# Using Large Language Models to extract Solide Oxide Fuel Cells materials.

This repository will be used to archive my scientific initiation project.

Student: André de Araújo Caetano
Advisor: Dr. Amauri Jardim de Paula

# Main Objective

Use open LLMs to "read" sentences and abstracts of articles about Solide Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) and extract they materials (cathode, eletrolyte, anode...). Futhermore, analyse the potentials and limits of LLMs, change parameters and prompts to increse the precision of the models.
