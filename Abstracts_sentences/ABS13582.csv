1,13582,The application of the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique to the preparation of high quality electrolyte films for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) was investigated.,Characterization of LSGM films obtained by electrophoretic deposition (EPD),10.1016/j.ssi.2006.03.022
2,13582,"Films of La(0.83)Sr(0.17)Ga(0.83)Mg(0.17)O(2.83) (LSGM) were deposited on Pt and La(0.8)Sr(0.2)MnO(3) (LSM) substrates from suspensions in acetone/ethanol (3:1 by volume) mixture solvent and sintered at 1300 degrees C. Pt supported LSGM films, 10-20 mu m thick, exhibited good adhesion to the Pt substrate, well-distributed microporosity and some surface roughness.",Characterization of LSGM films obtained by electrophoretic deposition (EPD),10.1016/j.ssi.2006.03.022
3,13582,"LSM supported films exhibited cracking after sintering at 1300 degrees C for 3 h. Up to 900 degrees C the bulk conductivity of the Pt supported LSGM film showed the same behaviour of LSGM pellet (E(a) = 0.93 eV and 0.99 eV, respectively).",Characterization of LSGM films obtained by electrophoretic deposition (EPD),10.1016/j.ssi.2006.03.022
4,13582,The LSGM film exhibited lower bulk electrical conductivity than the latter (4.1 X 10(-3) and 4.4 X 10(-2),Characterization of LSGM films obtained by electrophoretic deposition (EPD),10.1016/j.ssi.2006.03.022

6,13582,This difference should be ascribed to the slight Ga depletion in the LSGM film.,Characterization of LSGM films obtained by electrophoretic deposition (EPD),10.1016/j.ssi.2006.03.022
