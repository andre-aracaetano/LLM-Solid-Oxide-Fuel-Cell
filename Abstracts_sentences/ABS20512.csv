2,20512,"The Nd1.8Ce0.2Cu1 - xNixO4 + delta solid solutions are tetragonal structures in one single phase across the composition range, but it is convenient to divide the range into tetragonal Nd2CuO4 - cuprate for compositions corresponding to x <= 0.5 and while for x > 0.5, the same phase is described as tetragonal Nd2NiO4 - nickelate compositions.","Effect of Ni doping on structural, electrical and electrochemical properties of Nd1.8Ce0.2Cu1-xNixO4+δ mixed ionic-electronic conductor",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.02.010
3,20512,"In this Nd-Ce-Cu-Ni-O system, the maximum d.c. conductivity sigma = 0.619 S cm(-1), at a selected temperature of 700 degrees C, was obtained at a composition corresponding to x = 0.5, represented by the chemical formula Nd1.8Ce0.2Cu1 - xNixO4 + delta.","Effect of Ni doping on structural, electrical and electrochemical properties of Nd1.8Ce0.2Cu1-xNixO4+δ mixed ionic-electronic conductor",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.02.010
4,20512,"At this composition, the lowest value of activation energy (E-a = 0.11 eV) was measured over a temperature range of 500 to 700 degrees C. Symmetric cells in the configuration given by- electrode/electrolyte/electrode-, with Nd1.8Ce0.2Cu1 - xNixO4 + delta (for x = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) as the electrodes were fabricated by spin coating.","Effect of Ni doping on structural, electrical and electrochemical properties of Nd1.8Ce0.2Cu1-xNixO4+δ mixed ionic-electronic conductor",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.02.010
