1,4884,"The (La, Sr) (Cr, Mn)03 System was investigated in an effort to develop an interconnect and cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells.","INVESTIGATION OF STRONTIUM-DOPED LA(CR, MN)O3 FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS",10.1007/BF01119747
2,4884,"Sintering studies were done in air at temperatures below 1500-degrees-C. Significant improvements in densification were observed with substitution of 50 mol % Mn for chromium and a density of 95% theoretical was achieved with the substitution of 70 mol % Mn for chromium in the La(Cr, Mn)O3 system.","INVESTIGATION OF STRONTIUM-DOPED LA(CR, MN)O3 FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS",10.1007/BF01119747

4,4884,measurements were made as a function of temperature and oxygen activity.,"INVESTIGATION OF STRONTIUM-DOPED LA(CR, MN)O3 FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS",10.1007/BF01119747
5,4884,"At 1000-degrees-C and 1 atm oxygen, the electrical conductivity ranged from 2.2-20 S cm-1 for LaCr0.8Mn0.4O3 and La0.9Sr0.1Cr0.2Mn0.8O3, respectively.","INVESTIGATION OF STRONTIUM-DOPED LA(CR, MN)O3 FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS",10.1007/BF01119747
6,4884,All of the compositions showed similar dependence of electrical conductivity on the oxygen activity.,"INVESTIGATION OF STRONTIUM-DOPED LA(CR, MN)O3 FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS",10.1007/BF01119747
7,4884,"Dependence was small at high oxygen activities; as the oxygen activity decreased, a break in electrical conductivity at 10(-12) atm and 1000-degrees-C was observed, and then the electrical conductivity decreased as P(O2)1/4.","INVESTIGATION OF STRONTIUM-DOPED LA(CR, MN)O3 FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS",10.1007/BF01119747
8,4884,Sintering and electrical conductivity studies indicate that La0.9Sr0.1Cr0.3Mn0.7O3 appears to be a candidate for solid oxide fuel cell applications.,"INVESTIGATION OF STRONTIUM-DOPED LA(CR, MN)O3 FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS",10.1007/BF01119747
