1,14242,Perovskite oxide SrFe0.9Mo0.1O3-delta (SFM) was evaluated as the electrode for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells (S-SOFCs) with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) and La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolytes.,A redox-reversible perovskite electrode for CeO2- and LaGaO3-based symmetric solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.338
2,14242,"Under reducing conditions at 800 degrees C, the SFM was reduced to be a multi-phase composite consisting of the single pemvskite phase, Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) layered perovskite phase, and Fe-0 phase.",A redox-reversible perovskite electrode for CeO2- and LaGaO3-based symmetric solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.338
3,14242,"After reoxidation at 800 degrees C in air, this multi-phase system was again transformed into the parent perovskite phase again, indicating good redox reversibility of the SFM.",A redox-reversible perovskite electrode for CeO2- and LaGaO3-based symmetric solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.338
4,14242,"At 700 degrees C, polarisation resistances of the SFM used as the cathodes on the LSGM and SDC electrolytes were 0.28 and 0.14 Omega cm(2), respectively, in air.",A redox-reversible perovskite electrode for CeO2- and LaGaO3-based symmetric solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.338
5,14242,"Using H-2 as a fuel, the LSGM and SDC supported S-SOFCs with the SFM symmetric electrodes showed the peak power outputs of 253 and 269 mW cm(-2), respectively, at 700 degrees C. Finally, the good long-term stability and redox-cycling stability of the S-SOFCs further demonstrate the potential of the SFM as the symmetric electrode.",A redox-reversible perovskite electrode for CeO2- and LaGaO3-based symmetric solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.338
