1,12312,The properties of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode functional layers prepared by impregnation of ceria and catalytic metals into porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been examined for operation at 973 K.,An examination of SOFC anode functional layers based on ceria in YSZ,10.1149/1.2736647
2,12312,"By varying the thickness of the functional layer, the conductivity of the ceria-YSZ composite was determined to be only 0.015-0.02 S/cm.",An examination of SOFC anode functional layers based on ceria in YSZ,10.1149/1.2736647
3,12312,The initial performance of anodes made with ceria loadings of 40 or 60 wt % were similar but the anodes with lower loadings lost conductivity above 1073 K due to sintering of the ceria.,An examination of SOFC anode functional layers based on ceria in YSZ,10.1149/1.2736647
4,12312,The addition of dopant levels of catalytic metals was found to be critical.,An examination of SOFC anode functional layers based on ceria in YSZ,10.1149/1.2736647
