1,10104,Diffusion behavior of Ni during high temperature co-sintering was quantitatively investigated for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that had BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) proton-conducting electrolyte and NiO-BZCYYb anode.,Effect of Ni diffusion into BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte during high temperature co-sintering in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.081
2,10104,"Although diffused Ni in such SOFCs effectively acts as a sintering aid to densify the BZCYYb electrolyte layer, it often negatively affects the electrolyte conductivity.",Effect of Ni diffusion into BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte during high temperature co-sintering in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.081
3,10104,"In the present study, field emission electron probe microanalysis (with wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) clearly revealed that Ni diffused into the BZCYYb electrolyte layer, and that the amount of diffused Ni increased with increasing co-sintering temperature.",Effect of Ni diffusion into BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte during high temperature co-sintering in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.081
4,10104,"In particular, relatively high Ni concentration within the electrolyte layer was observed near the electrolyte/anode interface, e.g., approximately 1.5 and 2.8 wt% at co-sintering temperature of 1300 and 1400 degrees C, respectively.",Effect of Ni diffusion into BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte during high temperature co-sintering in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.081
5,10104,"Electrochemical measurements showed that, compared with the lower co-sintering temperatures (1300-1350 degrees C), the highest co-sintering temperature (1400 degrees C) led to the highest ohmic resistance because of lower electrolyte conductivity.",Effect of Ni diffusion into BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte during high temperature co-sintering in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.081
6,10104,"These results suggest that high co-sintering temperature causes excessive Ni diffusion into the BZCYYb electrolyte layer, thus degrading the intrinsic electrolyte conductivity and consequently degrading the SOFC performance.",Effect of Ni diffusion into BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte during high temperature co-sintering in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.081
