1,14020,"A novel method of ceramic-to-metal joining, referred to as reactive air brazing, was investigated as a potential method of sealing planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Novel metal-ceramic joining for planar SOFCs,10.1149/1.1896530
2,14020,"In the present study, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and Fecralloy were selected as subject materials to simulate the cell-to-frame seal in planar SOFC.",Novel metal-ceramic joining for planar SOFCs,10.1149/1.1896530
3,14020,"YSZ plates were joined with Fecralloy foils, using a range of CuO-Ag and CuO-Ag-TiO2 braze compositions.",Novel metal-ceramic joining for planar SOFCs,10.1149/1.1896530
4,14020,"Metallographic analysis revealed that a majority of the CuO in the braze preferentially migrates to the braze/Fecralloy interface, indicating a stronger affinity and interaction between the CuO and the alumina scale that had formed on the Fecralloy than with the YSZ substrate.",Novel metal-ceramic joining for planar SOFCs,10.1149/1.1896530
5,14020,"The addition of TiO2 to the braze had no significant effect on the microstructure or mechanical properties of the YSZ/Fecralloy joints, unlike what had been observed previously in YSZ/YSZ joining.",Novel metal-ceramic joining for planar SOFCs,10.1149/1.1896530
6,14020,"Four-point bend tests indicated that joint strength improves with increasing CuO content up to 8 mol % CuO, the maximum concentration of copper oxide tested, likely due to the concomitant improvement in braze wettability.",Novel metal-ceramic joining for planar SOFCs,10.1149/1.1896530
7,14020,"A maximum bend strength of 101 MPa was achieved using the 8 mol % CuO braze composition, demonstrating the feasibility of this joining technique for sealing planar SOFCs.",Novel metal-ceramic joining for planar SOFCs,10.1149/1.1896530
