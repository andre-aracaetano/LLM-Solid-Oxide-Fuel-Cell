1,13519,Ni-free redox reversible perovskite oxide La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.1Ti0.1O3-delta (LSFCT) has been synthesized and in-situ reduced to a functional anode R-LSFCT for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFC).,A High Performance Ni-Free Redox Reversible Ceramic Anode R-La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.1Ti0.1O3-δ for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271607jes
2,13519,"Power generating properties of the cells in various fuels, and the stability of the cell in H-2 are investigated by using scandia-stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte and Pr0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-delta cathode.",A High Performance Ni-Free Redox Reversible Ceramic Anode R-La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.1Ti0.1O3-δ for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271607jes
3,13519,It is found that reasonably high power densities are achieved on the cells with various fuels.,A High Performance Ni-Free Redox Reversible Ceramic Anode R-La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.1Ti0.1O3-δ for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271607jes
4,13519,"The maximum power density (MPD) of the cell with wet H-2 as fuel is achieved for values of 690, 531 and 368 mW cm(-2) at 800, 750 and 700 degrees C, respectively, and the MPDs of the cells in H-2 containing 54 ppm H2S and wet syngas (H-2 + 50% CO) fuels are achieved 618 and 512 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, respectively.",A High Performance Ni-Free Redox Reversible Ceramic Anode R-La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.1Ti0.1O3-δ for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271607jes
5,13519,"Moreover, the cell in wet H-2 demonstrates a quite stable output at 800 degrees C under 0.7 V for 100 h without any decrease.",A High Performance Ni-Free Redox Reversible Ceramic Anode R-La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.1Ti0.1O3-δ for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271607jes
6,13519,"This work also shows that doping Ti stabilizes the perovskite structure of LSFCT in 5% H-2-Ar and suppresses the segregation of Sr at surface of LSFCT/R-LSFCT, which may account for the improved cell performance and stability comparing with the undoped R-La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-delta anode.",A High Performance Ni-Free Redox Reversible Ceramic Anode R-La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.1Ti0.1O3-δ for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271607jes
