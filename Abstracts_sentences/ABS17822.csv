3,17822,The electrochemical results show that Pd doping decreases the polarization resistance and promotes the catalytic activity of LSCF cathodes.,Pd-doped La0.6Sr0.4CoO2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite oxides as cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.01.044
4,17822,"This promotion becomes greater with the increase of Pd doping content, which is also reflected by electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) measurement results because the oxygen surface exchange coefficient of LSCFPd is improved by Pd doping.",Pd-doped La0.6Sr0.4CoO2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite oxides as cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.01.044
5,17822,"According to the in-situ high temperature XRD and TG-DSC results, perovskite LSCFPd materials are stable at temperature below 700 degrees C, and some Pd species are segregated during heating process.",Pd-doped La0.6Sr0.4CoO2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite oxides as cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.01.044
