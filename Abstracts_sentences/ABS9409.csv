2,9409,"In this work, Ni-doped perovskites, (Pr0.5Ba0.5)(1-x/2)Mn1-x/2Nix/2O3-delta with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 (S-PBMNx), were prepared to design exsolution systems as solid oxide fuel cell anodes and for catalysis applications.",Exsolution of Ni Nanoparticles from A-Site-Deficient Layered Double Perovskites for Dry Reforming of Methane and as an Anode Material for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acsami.1c08158
3,9409,"X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses demonstrated that correlating A-site deficiency with Ni content can effectively induce exsolution of all Ni under H-2 atmosphere at T similar to 875 degrees C, yielding the reduced (exsolved) R-PBMNx materials.",Exsolution of Ni Nanoparticles from A-Site-Deficient Layered Double Perovskites for Dry Reforming of Methane and as an Anode Material for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acsami.1c08158
4,9409,"On heating the exsolution systems in air, metal incorporation in the oxide lattice did not occur; instead, the Ni nanoparticles oxidized to NiO on the layered perovskite surface.",Exsolution of Ni Nanoparticles from A-Site-Deficient Layered Double Perovskites for Dry Reforming of Methane and as an Anode Material for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acsami.1c08158
5,9409,The lowest area-specific resistance (ASR) under wet 5% H-2/N-2 in symmetrical cells was observed for R-PBMN0.2 anode (ASR similar to 0.64 Omega cm(2) at 850 degrees C) due to the highest Ni particle density in the R-PBMNx series.,Exsolution of Ni Nanoparticles from A-Site-Deficient Layered Double Perovskites for Dry Reforming of Methane and as an Anode Material for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acsami.1c08158
6,9409,"The best performance for dry reforming of methane (DRM) was also obtained for R-PBMN0.2, with CH4 and CO2 conversion rates at 11 and 32%, respectively, and the highest production of H-2 (37%).",Exsolution of Ni Nanoparticles from A-Site-Deficient Layered Double Perovskites for Dry Reforming of Methane and as an Anode Material for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acsami.1c08158
7,9409,The DRM activity of R-PBMN0.2 starts at 800 degrees C and is sustained for up to at least 5 h operation with little carbon deposition (0.017 g.gcat(-1).h(-1)).,Exsolution of Ni Nanoparticles from A-Site-Deficient Layered Double Perovskites for Dry Reforming of Methane and as an Anode Material for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acsami.1c08158
8,9409,These results clearly demonstrate that varying Ni-doping in layered double perovskite oxides is an effective strategy to manipulate the electrochemical performance and catalytic activity for energy conversion purposes.,Exsolution of Ni Nanoparticles from A-Site-Deficient Layered Double Perovskites for Dry Reforming of Methane and as an Anode Material for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acsami.1c08158
