1,5846,"In this research, the performance of a tubular fuel cell based on a nickel oxide-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) anode support containing 90 wt% NiO approximate to 82 vol.% of Ni (Ni82) is compared with a cell containing the conventional Ni-YSZ support with 50 vol.% Ni.",Tailoring the solid oxide fuel cell anode support composition and microstructure for low-temperature applications,10.1002/fuce.202200069
2,5846,A Ni-YSZ buffer layer with a tailored microstructure was added to the Ni82 support layer to provide intermediate porosity and to reduce the thermal expansion mismatch with the anode functional layer.,Tailoring the solid oxide fuel cell anode support composition and microstructure for low-temperature applications,10.1002/fuce.202200069
3,5846,Both cells were tested using infiltrated Nd2NiO4+delta cathodes.,Tailoring the solid oxide fuel cell anode support composition and microstructure for low-temperature applications,10.1002/fuce.202200069
4,5846,"High peak power densities of 790 and 478 mW/cm(2) were achieved at 600 and 550 degrees C, respectively, for the Ni82 cell which was 25% and 87% higher than the performances for the conventional cell at respective temperatures.",Tailoring the solid oxide fuel cell anode support composition and microstructure for low-temperature applications,10.1002/fuce.202200069
5,5846,"In addition, no degradation was found during four redox cycles at 550 degrees C, making this support an attractive candidate for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell applications.",Tailoring the solid oxide fuel cell anode support composition and microstructure for low-temperature applications,10.1002/fuce.202200069
