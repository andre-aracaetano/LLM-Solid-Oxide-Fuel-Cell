1,20111,Perovskite ceramics with non-stoichiometric compositions given by (La0.85Sr0.15)(0.98)MnO3-delta ((LS)(0.98)M-85) and (La0.80Sr0.20)(0.98)MnO3-delta (LS)(0.98)M-80) were obtained by pressureless sintering (1500 degrees C for 2 h) from powders synthesized by a polymerizable-complexation route and then calcined (500 degrees C for 1 h).,Processing and electrical conductivity of non-stoichiometric lanthanum strontium manganite perovskites prepared from powders synthesized by a polymerizable-complexation route,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.175
2,20111,"It was found that the two sintered ceramics contain trigonal (i.e., R (3) over barc)",Processing and electrical conductivity of non-stoichiometric lanthanum strontium manganite perovskites prepared from powders synthesized by a polymerizable-complexation route,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.175
3,20111,"Sr-doped lanthanum manganite as majority phase, and also hexagonal (i.e., P6(3)/m) La(OH)(3) in trace amounts in the case of (LS)(0.98)M-85 and in abundant amounts in the case of (LS)(0.98)M-80.",Processing and electrical conductivity of non-stoichiometric lanthanum strontium manganite perovskites prepared from powders synthesized by a polymerizable-complexation route,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.175
4,20111,"The (LS)(0.98)M-85 ceramic is stable and therefore usable, whereas on the contrary the (LS)(0.98) M-80 ceramic eventually swelled and turned into a powder due to the abundant La(OH) 3 that uptakes water from the atmosphere.",Processing and electrical conductivity of non-stoichiometric lanthanum strontium manganite perovskites prepared from powders synthesized by a polymerizable-complexation route,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.175
5,20111,"Finally, it was found that the (LS)(0.98)M-85 ceramic has appropriate electrical properties for use as cathode in solid oxide fuel cells, with a total conductivity of similar to 145 S/cm at 1000 degrees C and an activation energy of 0.067(2) eV.",Processing and electrical conductivity of non-stoichiometric lanthanum strontium manganite perovskites prepared from powders synthesized by a polymerizable-complexation route,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.175
