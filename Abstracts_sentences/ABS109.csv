1,109,"A novel semiconductor-ionic La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-Sm/Ca co-doped CeO2 (SCDC) nanocomposite has been developed as a membrane, which is sandwiched between two layers of Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05Li-oxide (NCAL) to construct semiconductor-ion membrane fuel cell (SIMFC).",Semiconductor-ionic Membrane of LaSrCoFe-oxide-doped Ceria Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.07.128
2,109,"Such a device presented an open circuit voltage (OCV) above 1.0 V and maximum power density of 814 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C, which is much higher than 0.84 V and 300 mW cm(-2) for the fuel cell using the SCDC membrane.",Semiconductor-ionic Membrane of LaSrCoFe-oxide-doped Ceria Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.07.128
3,109,"Moreover, the SIMFC has a relatively promising long-term stability, the voltage can maintain at 0.966 V for 60 hours without degradation during the fuel cells operation and the open-circuit voltage (OCV) can return to 1.06 V after long-term fuel cell operation.",Semiconductor-ionic Membrane of LaSrCoFe-oxide-doped Ceria Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.07.128
4,109,The introduction of LSCF electronic conductor into the membrane did not cause any short circuit but brought significant enhancement of fuel cell performances.,Semiconductor-ionic Membrane of LaSrCoFe-oxide-doped Ceria Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.07.128
5,109,The Schottky junction is proposed to prevent the internal electrons passing thus avoiding the device short circuiting problem.,Semiconductor-ionic Membrane of LaSrCoFe-oxide-doped Ceria Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.07.128
