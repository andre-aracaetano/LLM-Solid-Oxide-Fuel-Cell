3,20368,The failures of the ceramic components may lead to significant degradation or eventual failure of a stack.,Modelling of local mechanical failures in solid oxide cell stacks,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116901
4,20368,"To predict mechanical failures in a stack, a full stack model is needed, together with a local assessment of stresses at the vicinity of failing regions, e.g. the contact points between the cells and interconnects.",Modelling of local mechanical failures in solid oxide cell stacks,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116901
5,20368,A conventional three-dimensional model requires a very fine discretization of the mesh to capture stress intensities.,Modelling of local mechanical failures in solid oxide cell stacks,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116901
6,20368,"Computational resources needed for such a model are therefore immense, and it is highly unlikely to compute at stack scale, as well describe the evolution over time.",Modelling of local mechanical failures in solid oxide cell stacks,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116901

8,20368,"Thus, the fracturing within a local failing point is examined by using a localization approach, where stresses in the stack model are linked to the local stresses and the energy release rate at the crack tip of the relevant interface.",Modelling of local mechanical failures in solid oxide cell stacks,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116901
9,20368,"This is done in a general manner, such that the local stresses and the energy release rate can be evaluated at every point in the stack at every instant of time without loss of computational efficiency.",Modelling of local mechanical failures in solid oxide cell stacks,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116901
