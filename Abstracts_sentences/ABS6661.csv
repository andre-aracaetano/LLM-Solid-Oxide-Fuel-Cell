1,6661,This study is an attempt to improve LaMnO3 high temperature air cathodes by using an electrode structure which resembles that of porous electrodes of liquid electrolyte fuel cells.,LAMNO3 AIR CATHODES CONTAINING ZRO2 ELECTROLYTE FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90161-H
2,6661,Y2O3-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was loaded with LaMnO3 and molded into porous electrodes which had YSZ-LAMnO3 interfaces inside the electrodes.,LAMNO3 AIR CATHODES CONTAINING ZRO2 ELECTROLYTE FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90161-H
3,6661,"A strong relation was seen between the conductivity of YSZ added and polarization losses, suggesting that the internal LaMnO3-YSZ contacts are active for O2 reduction.",LAMNO3 AIR CATHODES CONTAINING ZRO2 ELECTROLYTE FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90161-H
4,6661,The addition of YSZ prevents the formation of highly resistive La2Zr2O7 which has otherwise been formed at the electrode-electrolyte interface.,LAMNO3 AIR CATHODES CONTAINING ZRO2 ELECTROLYTE FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90161-H
5,6661,This effect also helps to enhance the electrodes.,LAMNO3 AIR CATHODES CONTAINING ZRO2 ELECTROLYTE FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90161-H
