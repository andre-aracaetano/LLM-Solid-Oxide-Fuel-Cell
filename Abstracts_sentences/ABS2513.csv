3,2513,The results indicated that the incorporation of Mg ions in La0.3Sr0.7Mn0.8MnO3-delta can improve its ability to adsorb NO and the cathode activity.,Mg-doped La0.3Sr0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O3-δ cathode as a catalyst for NOx decomposition via H-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.079
4,2513,"At 800 degrees C, when using the NO as oxidant, single cell with La0.3Sr0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O3-delta cathode was able to obtain peak power density of 48 mW cm(-2) and achieve the conversion of NO to N-2 more than 48%.",Mg-doped La0.3Sr0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O3-δ cathode as a catalyst for NOx decomposition via H-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.079
5,2513,These findings suggested that power generation coupling deNO via H-SOFC is possible and La0.3Sr0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O3-delta was a promising cathode for this application.,Mg-doped La0.3Sr0.7Mn0.8Mg0.2O3-δ cathode as a catalyst for NOx decomposition via H-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.079
