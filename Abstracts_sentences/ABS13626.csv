3,13626,"All the YCIxBCZ samples investigated show an excellent tolerance to CO2 at 800 degrees C. Additionally, the YCI0.2BCZ phase are stable after 72 h exposure to air at 600, 700, and 800 degrees C, sepa-rately, while YCIxBCZ (x = 0, 0.1 and 0.3) show instability at 700 degrees C in air.","Basic properties of low thermal expansion coefficient (Y0.5Ca0.5)1-xInxBaCo3ZnO7+?
