1,12732,The surface regeneration or de-sulfurization process of a sulfur-poisoned (i.e. sulfur-covered) nickel surface by O-2 and H2O has been studied using first-principles calculations with proper thermodynamic corrections.,Surface regeneration of sulfur-poisoned Ni surfaces under SOFC operation conditions predicted by first-principles-based thermodynamic calculations,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.025
2,12732,"While O-2 is more effective than H2O in removing the sulfur atoms adsorbed on nickel surface, it readily reacts with the regenerated Ni surface, leading to over-oxidization of Ni.",Surface regeneration of sulfur-poisoned Ni surfaces under SOFC operation conditions predicted by first-principles-based thermodynamic calculations,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.025

5,12732,"Accordingly, the effects of the partial pressures of O-2 [p(O2),] and H2O [p(H2O)] as well as the ratio of P-O2/p(H2O) on the regeneration of a sulfur-covered Ni surface without over-oxidization at different temperatures are systematically examined to identify the best conditions for regeneration of Ni-based SOFC anodes under practical conditions.",Surface regeneration of sulfur-poisoned Ni surfaces under SOFC operation conditions predicted by first-principles-based thermodynamic calculations,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.025
