2,18468,A thermodynamic analysis of isooctane as feed hydrocarbon for autothermal reforming and dry autothermal reforming processes for feed OCIR (oxygen to carbon in isooctane ratio) from 0.5 to 0.7 at 1 bar pressure under analogous thermoneutral operating conditions was done using Gibbs free energy minimization algorithm in HSC Chemistry.,An alternative process for gasoline fuel processors,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.055
3,18468,"The trends in thermoneutral points (TNP), important product gas compositions at TNPs and fuel processor energy requirements were compared and analyzed.",An alternative process for gasoline fuel processors,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.055
4,18468,"Dry autothermal reforming was identified as a less energy consuming alternative to autothermal reforming as the syngas can be produced with lower energy requirements at thermoneutral temperatures, making it a promising candidate for use in gasoline fuel processors to power the solid oxide fuel cells.",An alternative process for gasoline fuel processors,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.055
