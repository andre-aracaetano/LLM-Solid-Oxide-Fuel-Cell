1,16907,"Tracer diffusion of O-18 in dense, polycrystalline La1-xSrxCoO3 for x = 0.1 has been measured in the temperature range 400 to 600 degrees C and at 500 degrees C for x = 0.2 at an oxygen partial pressure of 1 x 10(5) Pa.",Oxygen tracer diffusion in La1-xSrxCoO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00402-X
2,16907,Depth profiles were obtained by secondary ion mass spectrometry.,Oxygen tracer diffusion in La1-xSrxCoO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00402-X
3,16907,The diffusion coefficient for La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 is given by D=(17-247) exp[(-232+/-8 kJ/mole)/RT] cm(2)/s.,Oxygen tracer diffusion in La1-xSrxCoO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00402-X
4,16907,This value is several orders of magnitude lower than D extrapolated from the results for x = 0.2 measured in the 700-900 degrees C temperature range.,Oxygen tracer diffusion in La1-xSrxCoO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00402-X
5,16907,One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the two measurements reflect different diffusion paths.,Oxygen tracer diffusion in La1-xSrxCoO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00402-X
6,16907,"As expected, La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 exhibits a higher diffusivity at 500 degrees C than does La0.9Sr0.1CoO3.",Oxygen tracer diffusion in La1-xSrxCoO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00402-X
