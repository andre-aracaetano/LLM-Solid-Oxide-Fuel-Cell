1,18602,CeO2 nanocubes with (100) surface orientation are successfully synthesized and found to facilitate the sinterability of CeO2 material.,Improving the sinterability of CeO2 by using plane-selective nanocubes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2019.06.024
2,18602,The CeO2 nanocubes show a much-improved sinterability relative to CeO2 nanoparticles prepared by the conventional citric-nitrate method.,Improving the sinterability of CeO2 by using plane-selective nanocubes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2019.06.024
3,18602,The nanocubes can be successfully sintered at a relatively low temperature of 1200 degrees C without using any sintering aids.,Improving the sinterability of CeO2 by using plane-selective nanocubes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2019.06.024
4,18602,"In contrast, a pellet using conventional CeO2 nano powder obtained from the conventional citric-nitrate method can be densified only after sintering at 1400 degrees C, which is 200 degrees C higher than that for the CeO2 nanocube sintering, although the starting particle size of both CeO2 samples is similar.",Improving the sinterability of CeO2 by using plane-selective nanocubes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2019.06.024
5,18602,"Density functional theory indicates that the surface energy of the (100) plane is significantly higher than that of the (111) plane, which is the more typical surface presentation of conventional CeO2 particles.",Improving the sinterability of CeO2 by using plane-selective nanocubes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2019.06.024
6,18602,"This high surface energy allows fast growth of the CeO2 nanocubes during sintering, contributing to their improved sinterability.",Improving the sinterability of CeO2 by using plane-selective nanocubes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2019.06.024
