4,5973,The reduction of the particle size by prolonged milling and the higher reactivity of the activated precursors cause a reduction of the maximum shrinkage rate temperature of 500 degrees C with respect to the solid state reacted precursors.,Mechanosynthesis of perovskite LaGaO3 and its effect on the sintering of ceramics,10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.03.005
5,5973,"Despite these facts, it is found that the ceramics sintered from classically obtained precursors have similar densities at the optimum conditions as the ones obtained by mechanosynthesis, but with lower purity.",Mechanosynthesis of perovskite LaGaO3 and its effect on the sintering of ceramics,10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.03.005
6,5973,"Mechanical activation is shown as a good alternative to synthesize LaGaO3 based ceramics with Sr and Mg doping, which are candidates for electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), but care with the sintering strategies must be taken into account to assure a high density of the ceramics.",Mechanosynthesis of perovskite LaGaO3 and its effect on the sintering of ceramics,10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.03.005
