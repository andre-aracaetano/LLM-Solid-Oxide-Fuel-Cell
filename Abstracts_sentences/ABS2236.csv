1,2236,A gas-tight yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte film was fabricated on porous NiO-YSZ anode substrates by a binder-assisted slurry casting technique.,Performance Evaluation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Thin Film Electrolyte Fabricated by Binder-Assisted Slurry Casting,10.1002/fuce.201100022
2,2236,The scanning electron microscope (SEM) results showed that the YSZ film was relatively dense with a thickness of 10 mu m. La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM)-YSZ was applied to cathode using a screen-print technique and the single fuel cells were tested in a temperature range from 600 to 800 degrees C. An open circuit voltage (OCV) of over 1.0 V was observed.,Performance Evaluation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Thin Film Electrolyte Fabricated by Binder-Assisted Slurry Casting,10.1002/fuce.201100022
3,2236,"The maximum power densities at 600, 700, and 800 degrees C were 0.13, 0.44, and 1.1 W cm(-2), respectively.",Performance Evaluation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Thin Film Electrolyte Fabricated by Binder-Assisted Slurry Casting,10.1002/fuce.201100022
