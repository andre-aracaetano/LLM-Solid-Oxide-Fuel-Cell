3,7739,It is challenging to isolate the degradation behavior and predict maximum lifetime of the metal substrate when assembled as full cell since many parameters may affect cell performance and life expectancy.,Unravelling the oxidation behaviors of porous stainless steel 430L substrate for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.06.092
4,7739,We systematically investigated and reported the long-term oxidation behavior of porous stainless steel 430 L for up to 1500 h at 800 degrees C under dry and 3 vol% H2O humidified H2/Ar mixture (10 vol% H2) atmosphere to simulate its applications in MS-SOFC.,Unravelling the oxidation behaviors of porous stainless steel 430L substrate for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.06.092
5,7739,"Our results show that the surface oxide scale of the porous 430Lsubstrate in both atmospheres are dominated by Cr2O3 and small amounts of MnCr2O4 or FeCr2O4 spinel oxides depending on the gas conditions, where the oxidation process could be divided into three stages with distinct characteristics.",Unravelling the oxidation behaviors of porous stainless steel 430L substrate for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.06.092
6,7739,"Stepwise surface color change, morphology and thickness of the formed oxide scale, elemental migration and distribution along the bulk alloy/oxide scale interface, and oxidation kinetics as a function of exposure time are systematically and thoroughly studied at high resolution.",Unravelling the oxidation behaviors of porous stainless steel 430L substrate for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.06.092
