2,14691,Here we demonstrate that the cathode microstructure has a strong influence on the stability of GDC interlayer and cation diffusion behavior of LSCF/GDC/YSZ triplets.,Influence of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Microstructure on GDC Interlayer Stability and Cation Diffusion across the LSCF/GDC/YSZ Interfaces,10.1149/2.0021614jes
3,14691,LSCF was prepared into two distinct morphologies: porous layers by screen-printing and dense layers by pulsed laser deposition (PLD).,Influence of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Microstructure on GDC Interlayer Stability and Cation Diffusion across the LSCF/GDC/YSZ Interfaces,10.1149/2.0021614jes
4,14691,Dense GDC barriers by PLD were applied to both porous and dense LSCF cathodes.,Influence of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Microstructure on GDC Interlayer Stability and Cation Diffusion across the LSCF/GDC/YSZ Interfaces,10.1149/2.0021614jes
5,14691,Interdiffusion and microstructural evolution were investigated at temperatures of 800 degrees C to 1000 degrees C in air.,Influence of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Microstructure on GDC Interlayer Stability and Cation Diffusion across the LSCF/GDC/YSZ Interfaces,10.1149/2.0021614jes
6,14691,"At 800 degrees C, both cathodes showed no apparent formation of SrZrO3 at the GDC/YSZ interface.",Influence of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Microstructure on GDC Interlayer Stability and Cation Diffusion across the LSCF/GDC/YSZ Interfaces,10.1149/2.0021614jes
7,14691,"Instead, SrZrO3 formed at the LSCF/GDC interface, and was more evident for the porous LSCF annealed at 900 degrees C.",Influence of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Microstructure on GDC Interlayer Stability and Cation Diffusion across the LSCF/GDC/YSZ Interfaces,10.1149/2.0021614jes
8,14691,"At 1000 degrees C, severe cation interdiffusion at the LSCF/GDC interface became remarkable for the porous cathode, which exhibited rapid degradation of the GDC layer accompanied by the severe SrZrO3 formation; by contrast the dense cathode only showed localized SrZrO3 grains.",Influence of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Microstructure on GDC Interlayer Stability and Cation Diffusion across the LSCF/GDC/YSZ Interfaces,10.1149/2.0021614jes
9,14691,The superior barrier stability of GDC in a dense cathode can be related to the air-tight interface which would minimize microstructural degradation occurring near the oxygen/LSCF/GDC triple phase boundary.,Influence of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Microstructure on GDC Interlayer Stability and Cation Diffusion across the LSCF/GDC/YSZ Interfaces,10.1149/2.0021614jes
