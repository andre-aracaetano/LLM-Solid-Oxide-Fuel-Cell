1,13004,Ba(Ce0.8Y0.2)O3-delta anode-supported proton conductive solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFC) were fabricated and tested under different H-2 and O-2 partial pressures and temperatures.,"Fabrication, Performance, and Model for Proton Conductive Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1149/1.3596361
2,13004,An electrochemical model developed from Boltzmann statistics was derived to study the V(i) of the H-SOFC and proton conductive solid oxide electrolyzer (H-SOEC).,"Fabrication, Performance, and Model for Proton Conductive Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1149/1.3596361
3,13004,Our model has successfully fit the V(i) curves to our variety of H-2/O-2 partial pressure expermental data with only one adjustable parameter.,"Fabrication, Performance, and Model for Proton Conductive Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1149/1.3596361
4,13004,"By using the model, the parametric analyses suggest the major possible and easiest way to improve the already good performance of the H-SOFC is reducing its electrolyte thickness.","Fabrication, Performance, and Model for Proton Conductive Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1149/1.3596361
5,13004,"Other than that, the performance of H-SOFC is mostly restricted by the attempt current density c, which means the cathode of the H-SOFC limits the performance of the whole cell.","Fabrication, Performance, and Model for Proton Conductive Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1149/1.3596361
6,13004,The H-SOFC performance can be enhanced by carefully engineering its cathode to increase its triple phase boundaries or finding a cathode material that enables more O-2 molecules to be adsorbed and dissociate into available O atoms on the cathode surface.,"Fabrication, Performance, and Model for Proton Conductive Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1149/1.3596361
