2,5893,"The crystal structure of Sr0.9Tb0.1CoO3-delta was defined in the cubic Pm-3m space group (No. 221), and Sr0.8Tb0.2CoO3-delta and Sr0.7Tb0.3CoO3-delta had a tetragonal I4/mmm structure.",Terbium-Doped SrCoO3 as a New Cathode Material for IT-SOFC,10.1520/JTE20140536
3,5893,The electrical conductivity values were all higher than 407 S.cm(-1) for T >= 500 degrees C.,Terbium-Doped SrCoO3 as a New Cathode Material for IT-SOFC,10.1520/JTE20140536
4,5893,The area specific resistances (ASRs) and its activation energy (E-a) increased with increasing x.,Terbium-Doped SrCoO3 as a New Cathode Material for IT-SOFC,10.1520/JTE20140536
5,5893,The oxygen vacancies and the thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) decreased with increasing x. The TECs were influenced by the concentration of oxygen vacancies and the transition of the Co3+ ions from a low-spin to a high-spin state.,Terbium-Doped SrCoO3 as a New Cathode Material for IT-SOFC,10.1520/JTE20140536
