1,18337,"Cermets composed of submicron size alternating lamellae of CeO2, or 10% Gadolinia doped Ceria (GDC), and porous-metallic Cobalt have been prepared from eutectic oxide mixtures.",Textured cermets of CeO2 (or GDC) with Co for solid oxide fuel cells anodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.013
2,18337,A fine eutectic structure was obtained by fast directional solidification of the cobalt oxide ceria oxide eutectic composite using the Laser Floating Zone (LFZ) technique.,Textured cermets of CeO2 (or GDC) with Co for solid oxide fuel cells anodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.013
3,18337,"The resulting microstructure, with an interphase spacing down to 0.5 mu m, was obtained for solidification rates of 750 mm/h. Textured cermets were obtained by subsequent reduction under H-2 containing atmosphere of the eutectic oxide composite.",Textured cermets of CeO2 (or GDC) with Co for solid oxide fuel cells anodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.013
4,18337,The reduction kinetics was studied in the 550-750 degrees C temperature range and effective diffusion coefficients were obtained.,Textured cermets of CeO2 (or GDC) with Co for solid oxide fuel cells anodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.013
