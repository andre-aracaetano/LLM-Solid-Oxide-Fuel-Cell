1,12913,The effect of NiO-m-BCZY64 (BCZY64 1/4 BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95) as a composite anode with a single anode functional layer (AFL) and gradient AFL on the performance of a button cell was systematically evaluated.,Effect of nickel oxide - Modified BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95 as composite anode on the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.219
2,12913,The m-BCZY64 is referred to the pristine BCZY64 that was modified by a functionalized activated carbon derived from palm-oil empty fruit bunch (EFB).,Effect of nickel oxide - Modified BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95 as composite anode on the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.219
3,12913,The electrochemical performance of the cell was investigated by impedance spectroscopy in a controlled atmosphere.,Effect of nickel oxide - Modified BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95 as composite anode on the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.219
4,12913,The NiO-m-BCZY64 exhibited smaller grain size and homogenous elemental distribution compared to pristine NiO-BCZY64 as observed by SEM/EDX.,Effect of nickel oxide - Modified BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95 as composite anode on the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.219
5,12913,"At T 1/4 800 degrees C, a button cell consists of NiO:m-BCZY64 with gradient AFL showed the best performance with total resistance (R-T) of 21.12 Omega cm(2) compared to the cell with single AFL (R-T 1/4 86.04 Omega cm(2)) and pristine NiO-BCZY64 (R-T 1/4 145.64 Omega cm(2)).",Effect of nickel oxide - Modified BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95 as composite anode on the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.219
6,12913,The significant reduction of R-T indicates that the NiO:m-BCZY64 with gradient AFL showed high potential to be used as a composite anode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells.,Effect of nickel oxide - Modified BaCe0.54Zr0.36Y0.1O2.95 as composite anode on the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.219
