2,20416,"High concentrations of oxygen vacancies may be beneficial or detrimental according to the application, and hence there is interest in controlling the oxygen content of films without resorting to compositional changes.",Tailoring Nonstoichiometry and Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductivity in Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-δ/SrTiO3 Heterostructures,10.1021/acsami.9b08864
3,20416,"Here, we demonstrate that substantial changes in the nonstoichiometry of Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-delta/SrTiO3 (PCO), a model mixed ionic electronic conductor, can be achieved by fabricating multilayers with an inert material, SrTiO3(STO).",Tailoring Nonstoichiometry and Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductivity in Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-δ/SrTiO3 Heterostructures,10.1021/acsami.9b08864
4,20416,"We fabricated heterostructures using pulsed laser deposition, keeping the total thickness of PCO and STO constant while varying the number of layers and thickness of each individual layer, to probe the effects of the PCO/STO interfaces.",Tailoring Nonstoichiometry and Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductivity in Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-δ/SrTiO3 Heterostructures,10.1021/acsami.9b08864
5,20416,"Conductivity measurements as a function of oxygen partial pressure (PO2) and temperature showed a significant weakening of the PO2, dependence compared to bulk PCO, which scaled with the density of interfaces.",Tailoring Nonstoichiometry and Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductivity in Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-δ/SrTiO3 Heterostructures,10.1021/acsami.9b08864
6,20416,"We confirmed that this change was due to variations in nonstoichiometry, by optical transmission measurements, and show that the lower oxygen content is consistent with a decrease in the effective oxygen reduction enthalpy of PCO.",Tailoring Nonstoichiometry and Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductivity in Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-δ/SrTiO3 Heterostructures,10.1021/acsami.9b08864
7,20416,"These results exemplify the dramatic differences in properties between films and their bulk counterparts, achievable by interface engineering, and provide generalized insight into tailoring the properties of mixed ionic electronic conductors at the nanoscale.",Tailoring Nonstoichiometry and Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductivity in Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-δ/SrTiO3 Heterostructures,10.1021/acsami.9b08864
