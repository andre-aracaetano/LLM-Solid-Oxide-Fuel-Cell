5,16249,"Increasing NOx concentration, adding NO2, and increasing O-2 concentration can all increase the NO conversion; increasing NO conversion with increasing O-2 concentration is beneficial for DeNO(x) of lean-burn exhausts.","Effect of O2 Concentration and Voltage on Nitric Oxide Decomposition over (LaSr)MnO3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1149/2.044112jes
6,16249,"The amount of oxygen desorbed as the cathode gas (O-2, gas) is much larger than that utilized for power generation; this is an effect of desorption enhancement; this effect can be utilized for SOFC-DeNO(x) with least or no consumption of the anode fuel.","Effect of O2 Concentration and Voltage on Nitric Oxide Decomposition over (LaSr)MnO3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1149/2.044112jes
7,16249,"The O-2, gas formation rate increases with increasing voltage and is larger at 700 degrees C than at 750 degrees C. With increasing voltage, the NO conversion at 700 degrees C increases but those at 750 and 800 degrees C decrease.","Effect of O2 Concentration and Voltage on Nitric Oxide Decomposition over (LaSr)MnO3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1149/2.044112jes
