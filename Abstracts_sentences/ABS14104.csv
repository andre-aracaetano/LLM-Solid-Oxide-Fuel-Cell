2,14104,"However, little is known about the phase stability of cubic InSZ at temperatures that simulate the conditions in an operating SOFC or turbine.",Thermal stability and phase transformation in fully indium oxide (InO1.5) stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.matchar.2016.11.012
3,14104,"This article provides an investigation of the phase stability and phase transformations in cubic InSZ after heat treatments at 800,1000, and 1200 degrees C for periods up to 2000 h.",Thermal stability and phase transformation in fully indium oxide (InO1.5) stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.matchar.2016.11.012
4,14104,"The results revealed that cubic InSZ is not stable during annealing at 1000 and 1200 degrees C, owing to a fast destabilization of the initial cubic phase to tetragonal, and eventually to monoclinic (c -> t -> m).",Thermal stability and phase transformation in fully indium oxide (InO1.5) stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.matchar.2016.11.012
5,14104,The c -> t -> m transition in InSZ is intimately associated with the indium volatilization.,Thermal stability and phase transformation in fully indium oxide (InO1.5) stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.matchar.2016.11.012
6,14104,"On the other hand, cubic InSZ remained stable for 2000 hat 800 degrees C, although the partial formation of the tetragonal phase was observed along with a 0.25% contraction in the unit cell volume of the cubic phase, caused by short-range ordering.",Thermal stability and phase transformation in fully indium oxide (InO1.5) stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.matchar.2016.11.012
7,14104,These results demonstrate that technological applications of cubic InSZ are restricted to temperatures at which the volatilization of the InO1.5 stabilizer does not occur.,Thermal stability and phase transformation in fully indium oxide (InO1.5) stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.matchar.2016.11.012
