2,12075,It is therefore a promising electrolyte material for solid oxide fuel cells.,High Temperature Stability of BaZrO3: An Ab Initio Thermodynamic Study,10.1002/pssb.201700398
3,12075,The stability of BaZrO3 at high temperatures is generally explained by the low diffusivity of O vacancy.,High Temperature Stability of BaZrO3: An Ab Initio Thermodynamic Study,10.1002/pssb.201700398
4,12075,Present first principle density functional theory calculations show that the slow migration of the doubly charged O vacancy at high temperature cannot be solely caused by the ground-state migration energy but by the contribution of phonon excitations to the free migration energy.,High Temperature Stability of BaZrO3: An Ab Initio Thermodynamic Study,10.1002/pssb.201700398

6,12075,"At about 1000K, which is the operating temperature of fuel cells, the calculated O vacancy diffusivity is more than one order of magnitude lower than that determined using ground-state migration barrier.",High Temperature Stability of BaZrO3: An Ab Initio Thermodynamic Study,10.1002/pssb.201700398
7,12075,The calculated diffusivity data agree well with experimental results from literature.,High Temperature Stability of BaZrO3: An Ab Initio Thermodynamic Study,10.1002/pssb.201700398
8,12075,The present work reveals that the high-temperature stability of BaZrO3 is mainly due to the phonon contribution to the free migration energy of the O vacancy.,High Temperature Stability of BaZrO3: An Ab Initio Thermodynamic Study,10.1002/pssb.201700398
