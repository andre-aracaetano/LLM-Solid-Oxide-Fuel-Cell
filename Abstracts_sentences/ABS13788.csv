1,13788,"In response to the exigent topic of exploiting low cost high active electrode materials for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFC), a novel strategy using K2NiF4-type layered La0.5Sr1.5MnO4+delta (LSMO4) with interstitial oxygen transfer mode as ionically conductive phase for La1-xSrxMnO3-based cathodes is proposed.",Rational design of an in-situ co-assembly nanocomposite cathode La0.5Sr1.5MnO4+δ-La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ for lower-temperature proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228240
2,13788,"With the adoption of one-step in-situ co-assembly method, the 20-40 nm dual-phase equimolar nanocomposite LSMO4- La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-delta (LSMO4-LSM) is obtained at 1000 degrees C, corroborated by the XRD and TEM results.",Rational design of an in-situ co-assembly nanocomposite cathode La0.5Sr1.5MnO4+δ-La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ for lower-temperature proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228240
3,13788,"When assembled with the BZCY electrolyte, the LSMO4-LSM cathode possesses much lower area specific polarization resistances in symmetrical cells and better electrochemical performance in single cells than that of the LSM cathode.",Rational design of an in-situ co-assembly nanocomposite cathode La0.5Sr1.5MnO4+δ-La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ for lower-temperature proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228240
4,13788,"Correspondingly, the electrode process is changed with the introduction of LSMO4 and an excellent cell performance with the peak power density (PPD) of 936 mW cm(-2) and the interfacial polarization resistance (R-p) of 0.082 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C is attained, respectively.",Rational design of an in-situ co-assembly nanocomposite cathode La0.5Sr1.5MnO4+δ-La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ for lower-temperature proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228240
5,13788,"On the whole, the extremely tiny particles and competitive cell performance with LSMO4-LSM cathode could illustrate the superiority of the in-situ co-assembly technique combined with the novel strategy, providing new ideas or methods for designing high performance H-SOFC electrode materials.",Rational design of an in-situ co-assembly nanocomposite cathode La0.5Sr1.5MnO4+δ-La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-δ for lower-temperature proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228240
