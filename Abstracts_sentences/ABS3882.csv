1,3882,"It has been demonstrated that the samarium and neodymium codoped ceria (Ce0.8Sm0.1Nd0.1O2- abbreviated SNDC) shows high ionic conductivity at intermediate operating temperature (0.012S/cm at 500 degrees C. However, the poor mechanical properties limited its applications in solid fuel cells and oxygen sensors.",Synergetic enhancement of mechanical and electrical properties in Ce0.8Sm0.1Nd0.1O2-/La10Si6O27 composite electrolytes,10.1111/jace.15458
2,3882,"Present research reports an approach to improve the mechanical properties of SNDC by adding another kind of oxide solid electrolyte, the apatite-type lanthanum silicate (La10Si6O27 abbreviated LSO).",Synergetic enhancement of mechanical and electrical properties in Ce0.8Sm0.1Nd0.1O2-/La10Si6O27 composite electrolytes,10.1111/jace.15458
3,3882,"The SNDC/LSO composites were prepared by mixing the powders with different proportion, and sintered at 1600 degrees C. Their structure, morphology, mechanical, and electrical properties were characterized.",Synergetic enhancement of mechanical and electrical properties in Ce0.8Sm0.1Nd0.1O2-/La10Si6O27 composite electrolytes,10.1111/jace.15458
