5,5806,S1.950FM possesses the largest electrical conductivity and the lowest polarization resistance (R-p) among all the samples.,The characteristic of strontium-site deficient perovskites SrxFe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ (x=1.9-2.0) as intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.129
6,5806,"The maximum power densities of a single cell with the S1.950FM cathode reaches 1083 mW cm(-2), and the area specific resistance value is 0.17 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C. These results indicate that the A-site deficiency could promote the electrochemical performance of SFM materials as cathodes for IT-SOFCs.",The characteristic of strontium-site deficient perovskites SrxFe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ (x=1.9-2.0) as intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.129
