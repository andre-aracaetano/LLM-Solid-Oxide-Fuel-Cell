1,13427,Oxygen transport in most oxide ceramics incorporated in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) involves the movement of oxygen ion vacancies.,OXYGEN-TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE IN OXIDE CERAMICS,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01789-K
2,13427,It is the relative magnitude of oxygen ion vacancy and electronic charge carrier concentrations and mobilities which determines whether oxide materials can function as effective electrolyte or electrode components.,OXYGEN-TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE IN OXIDE CERAMICS,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01789-K
3,13427,Examination of relevant data suggests that zirconia- and ceria-based electrolytes are unlikely to be replaced in SOFC systems operating in the temperature range 450-950-degrees-C. Oxygen ion vacancies are also involved in the cathodic reduction of oxygen and influence the magnitude of the associated exchange current density which can be measured by isotopic oxygen exchange measurements.,OXYGEN-TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE IN OXIDE CERAMICS,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01789-K
4,13427,Oxygen vacancy concentrations are also implicated in thermal expansion coefficient values and chemical stability considerations.,OXYGEN-TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE IN OXIDE CERAMICS,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01789-K
5,13427,It follows that optimisation of the cathode composition requires many conflicting requirements to be satisfied.,OXYGEN-TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE IN OXIDE CERAMICS,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01789-K
6,13427,"However for operation at 800-degrees-C, electrolyte, electrode and bipolar plate materials are available to ensure power densities approaching 0.5 W cm-2.",OXYGEN-TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE IN OXIDE CERAMICS,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01789-K
7,13427,"In contrast, direct methanol SOFC systems operating at 500-degrees-C necessitate the development of alternative electrode materials.",OXYGEN-TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE IN OXIDE CERAMICS,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01789-K
8,13427,"The successful exploitation of our knowledge about oxygen ion vacancy transport in ceramic oxides has now stimulated research into the role of protons in oxide lattices, and it is postulated that protonic/hydroxyl ion transport could be important in the development of alternative anode components.",OXYGEN-TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE IN OXIDE CERAMICS,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01789-K
