1,7768,"An (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel layer effectively suppresses Cr outward diffusion, but the occurrence of spallation between coating and metal interfaces and the increasing oxidation rate over time significantly deteriorate cell performance.","Formation of sol-gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel and its electrical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.060
2,7768,"A transition metal cation, particularly Cu, is added into the (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 to improve the long-term stability of the interconnect materials for low-to-intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Formation of sol-gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel and its electrical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.060
3,7768,"In this work, fine-crystalline (Cu,Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel powders with an average crystallite size of 21 nm were successfully synthesized via the citric acid-nitrate method.","Formation of sol-gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel and its electrical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.060
4,7768,The potential for use as a coating material for low-to-intermediate-temperature SOFC interconnects was explored.,"Formation of sol-gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel and its electrical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.060
5,7768,"According to the TG curves, IR spectra, and XRD patterns, 800 degrees C is recommended as the minimum calcination temperature for (Cu,Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel materials.","Formation of sol-gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel and its electrical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.060
6,7768,"Compared with (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel materials, the addition of Cu does not induce significant changes in the crystal structure but markedly improves the electrical conductivity (116 Scrn(-1)) and the activation energy (0.394 eV) of the (Cu,Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel.","Formation of sol-gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel and its electrical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.060
7,7768,"Overall, the sol-gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel can be used as a coating material for low-to-intermediate-temperature SOFC interconnects and is superior to (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel because high electrical conductivity is preferred to minimize ohmic losses between the electrodes of adjacent cells.","Formation of sol-gel derived (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 spinel and its electrical properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.060
