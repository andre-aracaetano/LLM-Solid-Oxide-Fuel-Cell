1,15049,"SrMo0.9Co0.1O3.4 oxide has been prepared, characterized and tested as anode material in single solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC), yielding output powers close to 800 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C with pure H-2 as a fuel.",SrMo0.9Co0.1O3-δ: A potential anode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.031
2,15049,"This excellent performance is accounted for the results of an in-situ neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiment, at the working conditions of a SOFC, showing the presence of a sufficiently high oxygen deficiency, with large displacement factors for oxygen atoms that suggest a large lability and mobility, combined with a huge metal-like electronic conductivity, as high as 386 S cm(-1) at T = 50 degrees C. Besides, the oxidation of the perovskite gives rise to a new oxygen deficient scheelite-like phase with formula SrMo0.9Co0.1O4-delta with Mo(VI), which has been studied by NPD and thermal analysis as far as crystal structure and composition are concerned.",SrMo0.9Co0.1O3-δ: A potential anode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.031
3,15049,"An adequate thermal expansion coefficient for both (oxidized and reduced) phases, an excellent reversibility upon cycling in oxidizing reducing atmospheres and a good chemical compatibility with the electrolyte (La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta; LSGM) make this oxide a good candidate for anode in intermediate-temperature SOFC (IT-SOFCs).",SrMo0.9Co0.1O3-δ: A potential anode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.031
