1,12674,The nickel metal-supported cells fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying are post-heat treated in air at 960 degrees C for 2 h with different pressures.,Post-heat treatment pressure effect on performances of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.018
2,12674,"The current-voltage-power and AC impedance measurements show the prepared cell with an applied pressure of 450g cm(-2) in the post-heat treatment has a better electrochemical performance at test temperatures >= 650 degrees C. For test temperatures < 650 degrees C, the maximum power densities at 450g cm(-2) pressure are about the same as the maximum power densities at 1250 g cm(-2) pressure.",Post-heat treatment pressure effect on performances of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.018
3,12674,The SEM micrograph indicates that the cathode including the cathode interlayer and the cathode collector is the most porous region in the cell.,Post-heat treatment pressure effect on performances of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.018
4,12674,AC impedance results show this cathode is the most sensitive part to the applied pressure in the post-heat treatment and the cell with 450g cm(-2) pressure has the smallest low frequency intercept R-2 and the polarization resistance R-p at temperatures from 600 to 800 degrees C.,Post-heat treatment pressure effect on performances of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.018
5,12674,The performance durability test of the cell post-heat treated at 450 g cm(-2) pressure shows a degradation rate of 0.0087 mV h(-1) or 0.0026 mW h(-1) at 300 mA cm(-2) constant current density and 750 degrees C test temperature.,Post-heat treatment pressure effect on performances of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.018
