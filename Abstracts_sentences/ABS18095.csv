1,18095,Nanocrystalline scandia-doped zirconia (ScSZ) ceramics with a relative density of above 96% and an average grain size of similar to 80 nm were prepared via pressureless sintering at 900 degrees C for 4 h in air.,Low temperature processing of dense nanocrystalline scandia-doped zircoma (ScSZ) ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.09.005
2,18095,"The starting powder synthesized by co-precipitation combined with supercritical fluid drying route is highly homogeneous and weakly agglomerated with crystallite size about 3 nm and specific surface area of 378 m(2)/g, and can be uniaxially pressed into highly homogeneous compacts.",Low temperature processing of dense nanocrystalline scandia-doped zircoma (ScSZ) ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.09.005
3,18095,The excellent sinterability achieved in this work is mainly attributed to the small crystallite size with high surface area and the weak agglomeration.,Low temperature processing of dense nanocrystalline scandia-doped zircoma (ScSZ) ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.09.005
4,18095,"The very low sintering temperature achieved in the present work is of practical significance for suppressing the cubic phase to beta-phase transition to some degree, eliminating the discontinuity in electrical conductivity and facilitating co-firing the ZrO2-based electrolytes with other SOFCs (solid oxide fuel cells) components.",Low temperature processing of dense nanocrystalline scandia-doped zircoma (ScSZ) ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.09.005
