1,14889,"New perovskite solid solutions of (l-x)LaCrO3-xBiCrO(3) (0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.35) are synthesized by solid state reactions at 1200degreesC. The substitution of Bi2O3,for La2O3 is found to improve the density of the ceramics.",Ferroelectricity in La1-xBixCrO3 solid solutions,10.1080/00150190490455737
2,14889,"Ferroelectricity is discovered in Lal-x,Bi-x,CrO3 by hysteresis loops displayed at 77 K, with the remanent polarization increasing as Bi3+ content increases.",Ferroelectricity in La1-xBixCrO3 solid solutions,10.1080/00150190490455737
3,14889,Its origin is attributed to the structural distortion induced by the stereochemically active Bi3+ ion on the A-site.,Ferroelectricity in La1-xBixCrO3 solid solutions,10.1080/00150190490455737
