1,20162,Electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) is a widely adopted technique for determination of oxygen surface exchange coefficient (k(chem)) and chemical oxygen diffusivity (D-chem) of mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIECs).,Enhanced accuracy of electrochemical kinetic parameters determined by electrical conductivity relaxation,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115561
2,20162,"However, it has been argued that the fitting process of determining two kinetic parameters from a single conductivity relaxation curve inevitably leads to high error in the determined values.",Enhanced accuracy of electrochemical kinetic parameters determined by electrical conductivity relaxation,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115561
3,20162,"In this research, we demonstrate experiment-based analytical approaches to overcome the issue and obtain highly reliable kinetic parameters using ECR for the case of (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.95)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF), a representative MIEC.",Enhanced accuracy of electrochemical kinetic parameters determined by electrical conductivity relaxation,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115561
4,20162,"As a baseline, kinetic parameters of a standard LSCF bar sample with the thickness close to the critical thickness are obtained using a conventional ECR method along with error range and sensitivity analysis at oxygen partial pressures of 0.2-3.125 x 10(-3) atm.",Enhanced accuracy of electrochemical kinetic parameters determined by electrical conductivity relaxation,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115561
5,20162,"D-chem with improved accuracy is obtained by ECR under primarily bulk diffusion-controlled condition, which is achieved by either increasing the thickness or coating porous LSCF on the baseline sample.",Enhanced accuracy of electrochemical kinetic parameters determined by electrical conductivity relaxation,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115561
6,20162,"With the D-chem determined, the baseline data are further refined to obtain k(chem) as the sole fitting parameter and the error range is reduced more than 70% of the original value under all test conditions.",Enhanced accuracy of electrochemical kinetic parameters determined by electrical conductivity relaxation,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115561
7,20162,With the significantly improved accuracy and sensitivity of both k(chem),Enhanced accuracy of electrochemical kinetic parameters determined by electrical conductivity relaxation,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115561
8,20162,"and D-chem, this demonstrated method is proven to be a practical approach to advance the application of ECR.",Enhanced accuracy of electrochemical kinetic parameters determined by electrical conductivity relaxation,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115561
