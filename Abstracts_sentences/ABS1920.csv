1,1920,Internal reforming reaction at low temperature in micro tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and numerical simulation using FLUENT.,Investigation of Internal Reforming Reaction at Low Temperature Using Micro Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.5796/electrochemistry.80.566
2,1920,"A micro tubular cell was composed of NiO/(ZrO2)(0.9)(Y2O3)(0.1) anode-substrate, La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8 electrolyte, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2-Fe0.8O3 cathode.",Investigation of Internal Reforming Reaction at Low Temperature Using Micro Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.5796/electrochemistry.80.566
3,1920,It was suggested that cell performance became lower in supplied 50% reforming gas composition at 873 K because of variation of current density and hydrogen partial pressure distribution along the cell axis direction.,Investigation of Internal Reforming Reaction at Low Temperature Using Micro Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.5796/electrochemistry.80.566
4,1920,The reason was that steam reforming reaction rate was slow along the cell axis direction and shift reaction occurred mainly without CO electrochemical oxidation owing to heat radiation of the cell at lower temperature.,Investigation of Internal Reforming Reaction at Low Temperature Using Micro Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.5796/electrochemistry.80.566
