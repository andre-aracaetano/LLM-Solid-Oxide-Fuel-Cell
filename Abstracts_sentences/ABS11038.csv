2,11038,In this study AISI 441 ferritic stainless steel is coated by pack cementation method in a Co-base pack mixture.,Evaluation of electrical resistance activation energy for cobalt-coated interconnects,
3,11038,"The microstructure of the samples is then examined by SEM and EDS, and phases are identified by XRD.",Evaluation of electrical resistance activation energy for cobalt-coated interconnects,
4,11038,In order to evaluate the area specific resistance (ASR) isothermal oxidation is applied at 800 degrees C for 300 h. Also oxidation at different temperatures (500-1000 degrees C) is carried out to evaluate electrical resistance activation energy.,Evaluation of electrical resistance activation energy for cobalt-coated interconnects,
5,11038,Results show the formation of cobalt spinels during oxidation caused to the reduction of electrical resistance (ASR for coated substrates: 12.3 m Omega cm(2) and for uncoated substrates: 40.1 m Omega cm(2)).,Evaluation of electrical resistance activation energy for cobalt-coated interconnects,
6,11038,Also electrical resistance activation energy for coated samples is lower compared to uncoated ones.,Evaluation of electrical resistance activation energy for cobalt-coated interconnects,
