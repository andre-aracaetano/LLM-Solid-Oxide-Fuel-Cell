3,17229,Catalytic properties of LSCV for the methane steam reforming have been carried out at 800 degreesC. This oxide exhibits a low activity.,Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
4,17229,The most important fact is that no carbon deposit was detected.,Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
5,17229,We have investigated electrochemical behaviour of a LSCV-YSZ composite (YSZ: yttria stabilised zirconia) in H(2)-H(2)O and in CH(4)-H(2)O atmosphere by impedance spectroscopy.,Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
6,17229,"Impedance diagrams are composed of two contributions at high-frequency (HF, typically 100 Hz) and at medium-frequency (MF, typically 1 Hz).",Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
7,17229,"At 800 degreesC, the normalised value of the MF resistance is only three-times higher than that obtained with an optimised Ni-YSZ cermet.",Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
8,17229,"In fact, the large difference comes from the HF resistance which is lower for the Ni-YSZ cermet by a factor of 20.",Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
9,17229,This could be explained by the microstructure of the interface of the LSCV-YSZ composite layer and the electrolyte pellet which has to be improved.,Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
10,17229,"In CH(4)-H(2)O, an additional semicircle at low-frequency (noted as LF, typically 0.1 Hz) is observed.",Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
11,17229,This LF contribution might be associated with the catalytic rate of the steam reforming of methane reaction.,Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
12,17229,"Ruthenium, as a steam reforming catalyst, was added to the LSCV-YSZ electrode.",Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
13,17229,"At 800 degreesC, in pure methane mixed with 5% of steam, this anode material shows similar results to those observed in H(2)-H(2)O without ruthenium.",Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
14,17229,"Moreover, electrochemical behaviour was stable with time and no carbon deposit was detected after 100 h of operation.",Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
15,17229,These results demonstrated that the gradual methane reforming can be implemented.,Alternative anode material for gradual methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00390-8
