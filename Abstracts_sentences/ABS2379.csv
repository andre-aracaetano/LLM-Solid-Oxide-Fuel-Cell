1,2379,SUS430 (16% similar to 17% (mass fraction) Cr) can be used as interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that operate at lower temperatures ( < 800 degrees C).,Effects of La0.8Sr0.2Mn(Fe)O3-δ protective coatings on SOFC metallic interconnects,10.1016/S1002-0721(06)60117-8
2,2379,"However, oxidation of steel can occur readily at elevated temperatures leading to the formation of Cr2O3 and spinel (Fe3O4) and thus greatly degrades the performance of the fuel cell.",Effects of La0.8Sr0.2Mn(Fe)O3-δ protective coatings on SOFC metallic interconnects,10.1016/S1002-0721(06)60117-8
3,2379,"The aim of this work was to reduce oxide growth, in particular, the Cr2O3 phase, through the application of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM20) and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta (LSF20) coatings by atmospheric plasma spraying technology (APS).",Effects of La0.8Sr0.2Mn(Fe)O3-δ protective coatings on SOFC metallic interconnects,10.1016/S1002-0721(06)60117-8

7,2379,"After exposure in air at 800 degrees C for 1000 h, the interfacial resistance of LSF20-coated alloy is lowered by more than 23 times to that of LSM20-coated layer.",Effects of La0.8Sr0.2Mn(Fe)O3-δ protective coatings on SOFC metallic interconnects,10.1016/S1002-0721(06)60117-8
