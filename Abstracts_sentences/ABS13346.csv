1,13346,The aim of this work is the development of a structured catalyst for the dry reforming of biogas to be used as a pre-reformer in the indirect internal reforming configuration (IIR) of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Structured Catalyst for Indirect Internal Reforming (IIR) of Biogas in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.3390/catal13071129
2,13346,The structured catalyst is based on NiCrAl foams coated with ruthenium (nominal loading 3.0 wt%) supported on a CaZr0.85Sm0.15O3-& delta; (CZS) perovskite oxide.,Structured Catalyst for Indirect Internal Reforming (IIR) of Biogas in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.3390/catal13071129
3,13346,The powder is produced by solution combustion synthesis and deposited on metallic foams by the wash-coating method.,Structured Catalyst for Indirect Internal Reforming (IIR) of Biogas in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.3390/catal13071129
4,13346,"Catalytic tests for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction are carried out at 850 & DEG;C, 700 & DEG;C and 550 & DEG;C for an overall 50 h with CH4/CO2 = 1 and p = 1.3 bar at different gas hourly space velocities (GHSVs).",Structured Catalyst for Indirect Internal Reforming (IIR) of Biogas in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.3390/catal13071129
5,13346,The final goal is a proof-of-concept: a laboratory validation of an IIR-SOFC fed by biogas.,Structured Catalyst for Indirect Internal Reforming (IIR) of Biogas in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.3390/catal13071129
6,13346,The carbon amount on spent structured catalysts is evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis and microstructural/compositional investigation.,Structured Catalyst for Indirect Internal Reforming (IIR) of Biogas in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.3390/catal13071129
