1,15508,Recent development of dual-phase ceramic-carbonate composite electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has prompted a pressing question as to whether H+ can transfer in molten carbonates and play a role in the enhanced ionic conductivity and improved SOFC performance.,Energetics of proton transfer in alkali carbonates: a first principles calculation,10.1039/c5ra07975f
