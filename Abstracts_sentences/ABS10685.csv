1,10685,"The performance of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with the configuration, H-2, 3 wt % Pd-loaded FeO\25 mol % Y3+-doped BaCeO3 (BCY25)\Ba0.5Pr0.5CoO3, air, was studied between 350 and 600degreesC. The BCY25 electrolyte showed higher ion conductivities than 8 mol % yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) below 800degreesC and 20 mol % Sm3+-doped",A solid oxide fuel cell using Y-doped BaCeO3 with Pd-loaded FeO anode and Ba0.5Pr0.5CoO3 cathode at low temperatures,10.1149/1.1513983

3,10685,"The overpotentials of the Pd-loaded FeO anode and the Ba0.5Pr0.5CoO3 cathode at 600degreesC were 25 and 53 mV, respectively, at 200 mA cm(-2), which were less than one-fourth those of a Pt electrode.",A solid oxide fuel cell using Y-doped BaCeO3 with Pd-loaded FeO anode and Ba0.5Pr0.5CoO3 cathode at low temperatures,10.1149/1.1513983
4,10685,The resulting peak power density was higher than those obtained for two SOFCs using the YSZ and SDC electrolytes with a Ni-SDC anode and a Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 cathode below 600degreesC.
