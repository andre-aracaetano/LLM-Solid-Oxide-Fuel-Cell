3,12380,The power density of the anode-supported SOFC unit cell was measured by the potentiostatic method to investigate the effect of nickel nanoparticle infiltration.,Enhanced Low-Temperature Power Density of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell by Nickel Nanoparticle Infiltration Into Pre-Fired Ni/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode,10.1166/jnn.2014.10072
4,12380,The increase in the power density of the Ni/YSZ anode with nickel nanoparticle infiltration became gradually less significant as the SOFC operating temperature increased from 700 to 800 degrees C.,Enhanced Low-Temperature Power Density of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell by Nickel Nanoparticle Infiltration Into Pre-Fired Ni/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode,10.1166/jnn.2014.10072
5,12380,"The improved performance of the Ni/YSZ anode with nickel nanoparticle infiltration compared to that of an anode without nickel nanoparticles is tentatively attributed to two factors: The discretely distributed nanoparticles on the nanostructured electrodes exhibited significant catalytic effects on the electrochemical performance of the electrodes, in addition to substantially increasing the triple phase boundary lengths.",Enhanced Low-Temperature Power Density of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell by Nickel Nanoparticle Infiltration Into Pre-Fired Ni/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode,10.1166/jnn.2014.10072
