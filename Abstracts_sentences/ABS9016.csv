2,9016,PB0.92CoCu had the same phase structure as that of PBCoO but showed a slight lattice expansion.,Characterization of PrBa0.92CoCuO6-δ as a potential cathode material of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.076
3,9016,Results of iodometric titration and thermogravimetry (TG) measurements demonstrated that PB0.92CoCu had a higher concentration of oxygen vacancy than PBCoO did.,Characterization of PrBa0.92CoCuO6-δ as a potential cathode material of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.076
4,9016,"Electrical conductivities of PB0.92CoCu ranged from 255 S cm(-1) at 400 degrees C to 134 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C in air, meeting the requirement for the cathode of SOFCs.",Characterization of PrBa0.92CoCuO6-δ as a potential cathode material of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.076
5,9016,"Thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of PB0.92CoCu was about one quarter decreased compared with TEC of PBCoO. PB0.92CoCu showed improved electrochemical performance than PBCoO characterized by low area specific resistances (ASRs) ranging from 0.12 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C to 0.017 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C. High peak power densities, 1541 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, 1228 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and 930 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C were achieved in a single cell using the PB0.92CoCu cathode.",Characterization of PrBa0.92CoCuO6-δ as a potential cathode material of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.076
6,9016,This single cell also showed an operational stability using hydrogen fuel at 650 degrees C without any decay for 100 h. These results have demonstrated that PB0.92CoCu is a promising cathode material of IT-SOFCs.,Characterization of PrBa0.92CoCuO6-δ as a potential cathode material of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.076
