1,2696,A simple and effective technique to reduce the overall fuel cell polarization resistance was introduced on a conventionally sintered YSZ electrolyte by creating a hybrid microstructure using low-intensity CO2 laser scanning methods.,Effect of Laser-derived Surface Re-melting of YSZ Electrolyte on Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-019-00073-w
2,2696,"After laser modification of the YSZ electrolyte surface on the cathode side, the overall polarization resistance was reduced from 513 to 124 cm(2), and the maximum power density was increased by 28% from 1.86 to 2.38 mW/cm(2) at 450 degrees C.",Effect of Laser-derived Surface Re-melting of YSZ Electrolyte on Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-019-00073-w
3,2696,This improvement was due to the enhanced surface kinetics by higher grain boundary density on the YSZ surface from recrystallization after laser scanning.,Effect of Laser-derived Surface Re-melting of YSZ Electrolyte on Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-019-00073-w
