1,19952,"Carbon dioxide electrolysis was studied in Ni/YSZ electrode supported Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs) consisting of a Ni-YSZ Support, a Ni-YSZ electrode layer, a YSZ electrolyte, and a LSM-YSZ O-2 electrode (YSZ=Yttria Stabilized Zirconia).",Electrolysis of carbon dioxide in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.093
2,19952,The results of this study show that long term CO2 electrolysis is possible in SOECs with nickel electrodes.,Electrolysis of carbon dioxide in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.093
3,19952,The passivation rate of the SOEC was between 0.22 and 0.44 mVh(-1) when operated in mixtures of CO2/CO = 70/30 or CO2/CO=98/02 (industrial grade) at 850 degrees C and current densities between -0.25 and -0.50 A cm(-1).,Electrolysis of carbon dioxide in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.093
4,19952,The passivation rate was independent of the current density and irreversible when operated at conditions that would oxidise carbon.,Electrolysis of carbon dioxide in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.093
5,19952,This clearly shows that the passivation was not caused by coke formation.,Electrolysis of carbon dioxide in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.093
6,19952,"On the other hand, the passivation was partly reversible when introducing hydrogen.",Electrolysis of carbon dioxide in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.093
7,19952,"The passivation may be a consequence of impurities in the gas stream, most likely sulphur, adsorbing on some specific nickel sites in the cathode of the SOEC.",Electrolysis of carbon dioxide in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.093
8,19952,"Activation can be carried out by hydrogen reacting with adsorbed sulphur to form the volatile compound H2S. Because adsorption of sulphur is site specific, only a part of the nickel sites were passivated and long-time operation of CO2 electrolysis in these Ni/YSZ electrode supported Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells seems therefore feasible.",Electrolysis of carbon dioxide in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.093
