1,6076,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) structure is proposed in which a composite thin film cathode substrate supports a dense thin film electrolyte with a thickness of less than 1 mu m.,Processing of composite thin film solid oxide fuel cell structures,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00345.x
2,6076,The cathode substrate has a graded porosity achieved through the partial sintering of a spin-coated CeO2 colloidal suspension.,Processing of composite thin film solid oxide fuel cell structures,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00345.x
3,6076,The resulting surface has a pore size and surface roughness which allowed a fully dense ZrO2:16%Y (YSZ) electrolyte to be spin-coated directly from a polymeric precursor without capillary forces removing the precursor from the surface of the porous substrate.,Processing of composite thin film solid oxide fuel cell structures,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00345.x

5,6076,"The porous CeO2 interlayer should allow for decreased ohmic losses, as well as decreased reactions between the YSZ and the cathode substrate.",Processing of composite thin film solid oxide fuel cell structures,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00345.x
6,6076,"In addition, the nanocrystalline grain sizes should allow for increased catalytic activity on the cathode.",Processing of composite thin film solid oxide fuel cell structures,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00345.x
7,6076,"Calculated ohmic losses indicated the resistance of the CeO2 interlayer limited the power of the structure, which was minimized by impregnating the porous layer with a mixed-conducting perovskite.",Processing of composite thin film solid oxide fuel cell structures,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00345.x
8,6076,The final structure shows significantly reduced ohmic losses as calculated at 400 degrees C.,Processing of composite thin film solid oxide fuel cell structures,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00345.x
