6,15453,"The components, showing higher exergoeconomic factors such as SOFC stack, fuel blower, heat recovery water pump, and inverter, need reduction of investment cost, even if the associated efficiency would decreased because of this cost reduction.",Exergetic and exergoeconomic evaluation of a solid-oxide fuel-cell-based combined heat and power generation system,10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.066
7,15453,"For the components, exhibiting lower exergoeconomic factors such as integrated reformer, fuel/water pre-heater, and air pre-heater, the main focus, should be on efficiency improvements, even if higher investment expenditures would be associated with such improvements.",Exergetic and exergoeconomic evaluation of a solid-oxide fuel-cell-based combined heat and power generation system,10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.066
