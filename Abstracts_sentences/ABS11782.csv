1,11782,Initial oxidation behavior of ferritic stainless steel with a sputtered NiFe2 coating for solid oxide fuel cells interconnect application was investigated in air at 800 degrees C to understand the transformation process from the NiFe2 alloy coating to NiFe2O4 spinel layer.,Initial Oxidation Behavior of Ferritic Stainless Steel Interconnect with Sputtered NiFe2 Alloy Coating,10.1007/s11085-019-09954-6
2,11782,The results indicated that the NiFe2 coating was initially converted to a surface scale with a layered structure consisting of a top Fe2O3 layer followed by NiFe2O4 mid-layer and an NiO inner layer.,Initial Oxidation Behavior of Ferritic Stainless Steel Interconnect with Sputtered NiFe2 Alloy Coating,10.1007/s11085-019-09954-6
3,11782,Cr oxide started to form at scale/steel interface before the coating was completely oxidized.,Initial Oxidation Behavior of Ferritic Stainless Steel Interconnect with Sputtered NiFe2 Alloy Coating,10.1007/s11085-019-09954-6
