1,10925,Data-driven fault diagnosis is a promising approach for the early detection and isolation of malfunctions in power generation plants deploying solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Data-driven fault diagnosis in SOFC-based power plants under off-design operating conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.128
2,10925,"Despite the supervised classifier used in a data-driven system is trained by samples gathered under one specific design-point operating condition, during real operation the plant can move to a new, unexpected off-design operating condition, reducing the performance of the diagnosis system.",Data-driven fault diagnosis in SOFC-based power plants under off-design operating conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.128
3,10925,This Short Communication demonstrates that this reduction is heavily mitigated if the supervised classifier is adapted to the new condition through the domain adaptation statistical technique.,Data-driven fault diagnosis in SOFC-based power plants under off-design operating conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.128
4,10925,"The present study shows that a probability of correct classification between 85% and 94% can be achieved in off-design, when a probability of 95% is obtained at the design-point.",Data-driven fault diagnosis in SOFC-based power plants under off-design operating conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.128
