2,19810,"In this work, a new nickel-based composite anode current collector has been developed for anode-supported MT-SOFC, addressing reduced cost, manufacturability and current collection efficiencies.","High-efficiency, nickel-ceramic composite anode current collector for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.130
3,19810,"Triple-layer hollow fibers have been successfully fabricated via a phase inversion-assisted co-extrusion process, during which a thin nickel-based inner layer was uniformly coated throughout the interior anode surface for improved adhesion with superior process economy.","High-efficiency, nickel-ceramic composite anode current collector for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.130
4,19810,"10 wt.% CGO was added into the inner layer to prevent the excessive shrinkage of pure NiO, thus helping to achieve the co-sintering process.","High-efficiency, nickel-ceramic composite anode current collector for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.130
5,19810,The electrochemical performance tests illustrate that samples with the thinnest anodic current collector (15% of the anode thickness) displayed the highest power density (1.07 W cm(-2)).,"High-efficiency, nickel-ceramic composite anode current collector for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.130
6,19810,"The impedance analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that inserting the anodic current collector could dramatically reduce the percentage of contact loss down to 6 10 % of the total ohmic loss (compared to 70% as reported in literatures), which proves the high efficiencies of new current collector design.","High-efficiency, nickel-ceramic composite anode current collector for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.130
7,19810,"Moreover, the superior manufacturability and process economy suggest this composite current collector suitable for mass-scale production.","High-efficiency, nickel-ceramic composite anode current collector for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.130
