3,20909,A few researchers have reported that an ultra-fine pattern can be mechanically machined on ceramic materials with no brittle fracture with a depth of cut close to sub-micrometers (called ductile mode machining).,Ductile mode machining of the micro pattern made on YSZ using ultra-precision shaping with a diamond tool,10.3938/jkps.67.1961
4,20909,"In the present study, the conditions for ductile mode machining of YSZ were studied.",Ductile mode machining of the micro pattern made on YSZ using ultra-precision shaping with a diamond tool,10.3938/jkps.67.1961

6,20909,"At first, when YSZ was machined with a depth of cut of 1 mu m and 10 passes, the micro pattern was entirely fractured due to the brittleness of YSZ.",Ductile mode machining of the micro pattern made on YSZ using ultra-precision shaping with a diamond tool,10.3938/jkps.67.1961
7,20909,"Next, the micro pattern was machined with a depth of cut of 1 mu m and 1 pass to verify how multi-pass machining affected the brittle fracture.",Ductile mode machining of the micro pattern made on YSZ using ultra-precision shaping with a diamond tool,10.3938/jkps.67.1961
