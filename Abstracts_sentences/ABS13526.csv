1,13526,"The effects of the contents of iron and cobalt on the crystal structure, oxygen content, thermal expansion coefficient, and electrical-electrochemical properties of materials Eu2SrCoxFe2-xO7-delta (x = 0.50 and 1.00) are reported.",Superior Performance as Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells of the Ruddlesden-Popper n=2 Member Eu2SrCo0.50Fe1.50O7-δ with Low Cobalt Content,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03391
2,13526,"These oxides are well-ordered new members of the Ruddlesden-Popper series (Eu,Sr)(n+1)(Co,Fe)(n)O3n+1 system with n = 2 as determined by selected area electron diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies.",Superior Performance as Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells of the Ruddlesden-Popper n=2 Member Eu2SrCo0.50Fe1.50O7-δ with Low Cobalt Content,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03391
3,13526,"The two materials are semiconductors of p-type, with much higher total conductivity under working conditions for the low cobalt compound, Eu2SrCo0.50Fe1.50O7-delta.",Superior Performance as Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells of the Ruddlesden-Popper n=2 Member Eu2SrCo0.50Fe1.50O7-δ with Low Cobalt Content,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03391
4,13526,Composite cathodes prepared with this oxide present much lower area-specific resistance values (0.08 Omega.cm(2) at 973 K in air) than composites containing Eu2SrCo1.00Fe1.00O7-delta (1.15 Omega.cm(2)).,Superior Performance as Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells of the Ruddlesden-Popper n=2 Member Eu2SrCo0.50Fe1.50O7-δ with Low Cobalt Content,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03391
5,13526,This significant difference is related to the much higher total conductivity and a sufficiently high content of oxygen vacancies in the Fe-rich phase.,Superior Performance as Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells of the Ruddlesden-Popper n=2 Member Eu2SrCo0.50Fe1.50O7-δ with Low Cobalt Content,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03391
6,13526,"The excellent electrochemical performance of Eu2SrCo0.50Fe1.50O7-delta with low cobalt content, which shows one of the lowest area-specific resistance reported so far for a Ruddlesden-Popper oxide, makes it a good candidate for application as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures in real devices.",Superior Performance as Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells of the Ruddlesden-Popper n=2 Member Eu2SrCo0.50Fe1.50O7-δ with Low Cobalt Content,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03391
