1,13399,"An effect of strontium ion doping on the structural, thermal, morphological and electrical properties of a co-doped lanthanum manganite system, La1-xSrx Mn0.85Fe0.05Co0.05Ni0.05O3+delta (x = 0-0.4 mole) is investigated for the solid oxide fuel cell cathode application.","Effect of strontium ion doping on structural, thermal, morphological and electrical properties of a co-doped lanthanum manganite system",10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.10.095
2,13399,"The submicron and rhombohedral structured sample, synthesized by the Pechini method, exhibited a decrease in the unit cell volume with increasing x.","Effect of strontium ion doping on structural, thermal, morphological and electrical properties of a co-doped lanthanum manganite system",10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.10.095
3,13399,The thermogravimetry study portrayed nearly fivefold weight loss for a sample with x = 0.3 mole relative to the La0.75Sr0.25MnO3+delta and suggested an improvement in the concentration of the oxygen vacancy for ion migration due to the co-doping effect.,"Effect of strontium ion doping on structural, thermal, morphological and electrical properties of a co-doped lanthanum manganite system",10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.10.095
4,13399,"It also showed sufficiently high electrical conductivity (similar to 76 S cm(-1)) at 650 degrees C along with a low activation energy (similar to 0.15 eV), a comparable coefficient of thermal expansion (similar to 12.1 x 10(-6) degrees C-1) and a chemical compatibility with the solid electrolytes.","Effect of strontium ion doping on structural, thermal, morphological and electrical properties of a co-doped lanthanum manganite system",10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.10.095
