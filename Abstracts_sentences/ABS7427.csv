1,7427,The direct utilization of carbonaceous fuels is examined in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a molten Sb anode at 973 K.,A direct carbon fuel cell with a molten antimony anode,10.1039/c1ee01863a
2,7427,"It is demonstrated that the anode operates by oxidation of metallic Sb at the electrolyte interface, with the resulting Sb2O3 being reduced by the fuel in a separate step.",A direct carbon fuel cell with a molten antimony anode,10.1039/c1ee01863a
3,7427,"Although the Nernst Potential for the Sb-Sb2O3 mixture is only 0.75 V, the electrode resistance associated with molten Sb is very low, approximately 0.06 Omega cm(2), so that power densities greater than 350 mW cm(-2) were achieved with an electrolyte-supported cell made from Sc-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ).",A direct carbon fuel cell with a molten antimony anode,10.1039/c1ee01863a
4,7427,"Temperature programmed reaction measurements of Sb2O3 with sugar char, rice starch, carbon black, and graphite showed that the Sb2O3 is readily reduced by a range of carbonaceous solids at typical SOFC operating conditions.",A direct carbon fuel cell with a molten antimony anode,10.1039/c1ee01863a
5,7427,"Finally, stable operation with a power density of 300 mW cm(-2) at a potential of 0.5 V is demonstrated for operation on sugar char.",A direct carbon fuel cell with a molten antimony anode,10.1039/c1ee01863a
