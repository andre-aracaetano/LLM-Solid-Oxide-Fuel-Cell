10,20420,"While the microstructure of the joints is not significantly influenced by the base material, the strength of the BSCF/Crofer 22 H specimens is nearly four times lower than the strength of the specimens with the adapted thermal expansion coefficients (BSCF/AISI 314 and 3YSZ/Crofer 22 H).",Characterization of Reactive Air Brazed Ceramic/Metal Joints with Unadapted Thermal Expansion Behavior,10.1002/adem.201400311
11,20420,The reasons are residual stresses caused by the different thermal expansion coefficients.,Characterization of Reactive Air Brazed Ceramic/Metal Joints with Unadapted Thermal Expansion Behavior,10.1002/adem.201400311
