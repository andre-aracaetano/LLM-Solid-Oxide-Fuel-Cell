1,5296,Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode must be highly active and durable for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).,CO2-induced reconstruction for ORR-enhanced solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142216
2,5296,"Here, we demonstrate a CO2-induced reconstruction strategy to build an oxygen incorporative but robust BaCO3 shell for a self-assembled composite cathode from simple BaFeO3-delta perovskite (noted as re-BF), leading to the enhanced ORR activity, durability, and thermomechanical compatibility.",CO2-induced reconstruction for ORR-enhanced solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142216
3,5296,"The heterostructure beneath the BaCO3 shell consists of a BaFeO3 phase and a BaFe2O4 phase, of which BaFeO3 sustains the re-BF with good bulk oxygen transportation.",CO2-induced reconstruction for ORR-enhanced solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142216
4,5296,"The BaFe2O4 phase is stable with low thermal expansion coefficient, serving as a reinforced phase to re-BF for better chemical/morphological integrity.",CO2-induced reconstruction for ORR-enhanced solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142216
5,5296,"This new re-BF cathode shows good durability and a low area-specific resistance (ASR) of 0.013 omega cm2, about only one-third of pristine BaFeO3-delta (0.041 omega cm2) at 650 degrees C.",CO2-induced reconstruction for ORR-enhanced solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142216
6,5296,This method can also be extended to other perovskite materials to develop an active catalyst for SOFC cathode.,CO2-induced reconstruction for ORR-enhanced solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142216
