3,7496,"The use of this powder for cathode material led to an extremely fine microstructure, in which all the LSM and YSZ grains (approximately 100-200 nm) were highly dispersed and formed their own network structures.",Extremely fine structured cathode for solid oxide fuel cells using Sr-doped LaMnO3 and Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 nano-composite powder synthesized by spray pyrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.12.002
4,7496,"This microstructure was due to the two phase electrode structure control using the powder, namely, nano-order level in each particle and micro-order level between particles.",Extremely fine structured cathode for solid oxide fuel cells using Sr-doped LaMnO3 and Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 nano-composite powder synthesized by spray pyrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.12.002
5,7496,"An anode-supported SOFC with the LSM-YSZ cathode using humidified H-2 as fuel and ambient air as oxidant exhibited high power densities, such as 1.29 W cm(-2) under a voltage of 0.75 V and a maximum power density of 2.65 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Also, the SOFC could be stably operated for 250 h with no degradation, even at a high temperature of 800 degrees C.
