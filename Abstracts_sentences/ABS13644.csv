1,13644,"Solid oxide fuel cells were fabricated with a 5 mu m thick film of Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.95) electrolyte, supported on a NiO-YSZ cermet anode with a La(0.6)Sr(0.4)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3) cathode, for operation at temperatures below 700 degrees C.",Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells operated with methanol fuels,10.1016/S0009-2509(99)00569-2
2,13644,The performance for power generation was studied with externally reformed methanol fuel or with methanol/water vapour fed directly to the anode.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells operated with methanol fuels,10.1016/S0009-2509(99)00569-2
3,13644,The open-circuit voltages of 0.7-0.8 V were lower than the theoretical potential as a result of electronic permeation across the electrolyte film.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells operated with methanol fuels,10.1016/S0009-2509(99)00569-2
4,13644,"Maximum power outputs of 126, 65 and 32 mW/cm(2) were obtained at 650, 600 and 550 degrees C respectively, using the externally reformed fuel.",Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells operated with methanol fuels,10.1016/S0009-2509(99)00569-2
5,13644,"With direct methanol fuel the maximum power output was lower at each temperature by 16, 38 and 53%, respectively.",Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells operated with methanol fuels,10.1016/S0009-2509(99)00569-2
6,13644,The latter result at 550 degrees C was due to the poor internal reforming of methanol to hydrogen at the anode.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells operated with methanol fuels,10.1016/S0009-2509(99)00569-2
7,13644,The addition of Pd to the anode promoted the internal reforming at 550 degrees C: the maximum power output was similar to the previous result with externally reformed fuel and 45% lower with direct methanol fuel.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells operated with methanol fuels,10.1016/S0009-2509(99)00569-2
