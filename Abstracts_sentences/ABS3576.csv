1,3576,"A semi-empirical model is developed to quantitatively characterize electrode heterogeneities over the micro- and mesoscales, specifically between the relationship of the mean-squared normalized variance in the volume fraction, (theta Phi V/Phi V)2, and the mean particle size normalized linear dimension, L/(a) over barN. The model was developed analyzing data from five large-volume physical reconstructions collected using Xe-plasma focused ion beam with SEM (PFIB-SEM) - of several commercial cell electrodes and from unique sets of synthetic microstructures designed to have controlled distributions in particle size and local volume fractions.",Quantitative Analysis of Multi-Scale Heterogeneities in Complex Electrode Microstructures,10.1149/2.0102005JES
