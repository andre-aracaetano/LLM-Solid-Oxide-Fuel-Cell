1,15870,NiO-YSZ/YSZ/LSCF-YSZ tri-layer structure SOFC has been fabricated by tape casting and infiltration methods.,Performance and electrochemical analysis of solid oxide fuel cells based on LSCF-YSZ nano-electrode,10.1111/ijac.12748
2,15870,"Subsequently, polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectra measurement were carried out to evaluate cell performance at 850-700 degrees C with varied steam content in hydrogen supplied to the anode.",Performance and electrochemical analysis of solid oxide fuel cells based on LSCF-YSZ nano-electrode,10.1111/ijac.12748
3,15870,"At 800 degrees C, open circuit voltage for 4% steam-humidified hydrogen reached 1.069 V, along with a power density of 831 mW/cm(2) at 0.7 V. Furthermore, 500 hours of long-term durability test has been performed at 750 degrees C in hydrogen atmosphere, as a consequence that a voltage degradation rate of 1.7%/kh has been measured.",Performance and electrochemical analysis of solid oxide fuel cells based on LSCF-YSZ nano-electrode,10.1111/ijac.12748
