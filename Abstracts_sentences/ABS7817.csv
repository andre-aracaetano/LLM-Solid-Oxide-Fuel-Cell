4,7817,Thermogravimetric analyses on the reduction of the Ni1-xCoxO-YSZ powders show that there are two processes: the chemicalreaction-controlled process and the diffusion-controlled process.,Effects of Cobalt Addition on the Catalytic Activity of the Ni-YSZ Anode Functional Layer and the Electrochemical Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/am504148m
5,7817,"It is found that the reduction peak corresponding to the chemical-reaction-controlled process in the DTG curves moves toward lower temperatures with increasing Co content, suggesting that the catalytic activity of Ni1-xCox is enhanced by the doping of Co.",Effects of Cobalt Addition on the Catalytic Activity of the Ni-YSZ Anode Functional Layer and the Electrochemical Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/am504148m
6,7817,"It is observed that the SOFC shows the best performance at x = 0.03, and the corresponding maximum power densities are 445, 651, and 815 mW cm(-2) at 700, 750, and 800 degrees C, respectively.",Effects of Cobalt Addition on the Catalytic Activity of the Ni-YSZ Anode Functional Layer and the Electrochemical Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/am504148m
7,7817,The dependence of the SOFC performance on the Co content can be attributed to the competing results between the decreased three-phase-boundary length in the AFL and the enhanced catalytic activity of the Ni1-xCox phase with increasing Co content.,Effects of Cobalt Addition on the Catalytic Activity of the Ni-YSZ Anode Functional Layer and the Electrochemical Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/am504148m
