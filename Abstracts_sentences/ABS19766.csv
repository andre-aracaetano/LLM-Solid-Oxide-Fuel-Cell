1,19766,Proton conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) have a wide range of applications in solid oxide fuel cell due to its resistance to carbon deposition and good protonic conductivity.,Basic properties of proton conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ (BZCYYb) material,10.1002/apj.2322
2,19766,"In this work, several basic properties of BZCYYb perovskite were studied: Structural phase transitions have been investigated with combination of differential scanning calorimeter, dilatometry, and high-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD).",Basic properties of proton conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ (BZCYYb) material,10.1002/apj.2322
3,19766,"Water absorption ability of BZCYYb in the temperature range of 600 degrees C to 800 degrees C was measured by thermogravimetry (TG) in a certain concentration of water vapor; the results showed the best absorption ability of 4.2% weight gain at 600 degrees C, corresponding to a water adsorption of 0.63 mmol/m(2).",Basic properties of proton conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ (BZCYYb) material,10.1002/apj.2322
4,19766,Oxygen stoichiometry of BZCYYb from room temperature to 800 degrees C increased from 0.1296 to 0.386 in air.,Basic properties of proton conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ (BZCYYb) material,10.1002/apj.2322
5,19766,"Besides, we compared the conductivity in different atmospheres (dry and humid N-2-H-2 [5%] and dry and humid air), which showed the highest total conductivity in humid air and a lower conductivity activation energy in a reducing atmosphere.",Basic properties of proton conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ (BZCYYb) material,10.1002/apj.2322
6,19766,"Finally, CO2 poisoning process of BZCYYb was analyzed by XRD and TG.",Basic properties of proton conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ (BZCYYb) material,10.1002/apj.2322
7,19766,"Compared with the case of pure CO2, lower critical CO2 poisoning temperature and more BaCO3 were found in CO2-H2O, indicating the addition of water could promote the reaction.",Basic properties of proton conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ (BZCYYb) material,10.1002/apj.2322
