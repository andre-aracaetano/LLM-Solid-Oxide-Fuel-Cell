1,1165,Porous yttria-stabilized bismuth oxides (YSB) were investigated as the backbones for La0.85Sr0.15MnO3-delta (LSM) infiltrated cathodes in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,La0.85Sr0.15MnO3-δ Infiltrated Y0.5Bi1.5O3 Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3099321
2,1165,The cathodes were evaluated using anode-supported single cells with scandia-stabilized zirconia as the electrolytes.,La0.85Sr0.15MnO3-δ Infiltrated Y0.5Bi1.5O3 Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3099321
3,1165,"With humidified H-2 as the fuel, the cell showed peak power density of 0.33, 0.52, and 0.74 W cm(-2) at 650, 700, and 750 degrees C, respectively.",La0.85Sr0.15MnO3-δ Infiltrated Y0.5Bi1.5O3 Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3099321
4,1165,"At 650 degrees C, the cell polarization resistance was only 1.38 Omega cm(2), < 50% of the lowest value previously reported, indicating that YSB is a promising backbone for the LSM infiltrated cathode.",La0.85Sr0.15MnO3-δ Infiltrated Y0.5Bi1.5O3 Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3099321
