1,15656,"The effects of Ca on the properties of PrBa1-xCaxCo2O5+delta (x = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.5) as a cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells were studied.",Synergistic Effect of A-Site Cation Ordered-Disordered Perovskite as a Cathode Material for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0701707jes
2,15656,Higher Ca content in PrBa1-xCaxCo2O5+delta led to a gradual change in phase symmetry from A-site cation ordered double perovskite (x = 0.0) to mixed A-site cation ordered-disordered perovskite (x = 0.3) to A-site cation disordered simple perovskite (x = 0.5).,Synergistic Effect of A-Site Cation Ordered-Disordered Perovskite as a Cathode Material for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0701707jes
3,15656,It also led to a decreased oxygen content.,Synergistic Effect of A-Site Cation Ordered-Disordered Perovskite as a Cathode Material for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0701707jes
4,15656,"Comparing the electrochemical performance of the samples with x = 0.0 and x = 0.5, PrBa0.7Ca0.3Co2O5+delta exhibited the best catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and maximum power density.",Synergistic Effect of A-Site Cation Ordered-Disordered Perovskite as a Cathode Material for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0701707jes
5,15656,"This was ascribed to the synergistic effect of the A-site cation ordered-disordered structure, which combined the advantages of a fast oxygen diffusion rate and a relatively short oxygen diffusion distance from the oxygen reduction site to the cathode/electrolyte interface.",Synergistic Effect of A-Site Cation Ordered-Disordered Perovskite as a Cathode Material for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0701707jes
6,15656,"The maximum power density, which was as high as 2.16 W cm(-2), was achieved for the PrBa0.7Ca0.3Co2O5+delta-based single cell with a commercial anode-supported half cell at 800 degrees C. PrBa0.7Ca0.3Co2O5+delta was shown to be a potential cathode material for IT-SOFCs.",Synergistic Effect of A-Site Cation Ordered-Disordered Perovskite as a Cathode Material for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0701707jes
