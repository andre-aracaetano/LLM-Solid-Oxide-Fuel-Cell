3,3979,XRD and TEM results confirmed that the grain size of LSCF powders decreased with the grinding ball size decreased.,Effect of Morphology of La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode on the Electrochemical Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1002/jccs.201200164
4,3979,Conductivity of LSCF electrodes increased with increasing temperature that showed the characteristics of p-type conductor.,Effect of Morphology of La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode on the Electrochemical Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1002/jccs.201200164
5,3979,"At high temperature, there are more oxygen vacancies in smaller particle size LSCF, that will increase the energy gap of charge carrier transfer between the B-site cations and oxygen ions.",Effect of Morphology of La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode on the Electrochemical Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1002/jccs.201200164
6,3979,"AC impedance analysis revealed that smaller particle size LSCF had lower polarization resistance and the total polarization resistance was only 0.92 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C. However, sintering shrinkage of smaller particle size LSCF was too large that attributed the poor adhesion between cathode and electrolyte.",Effect of Morphology of La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode on the Electrochemical Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1002/jccs.201200164
7,3979,"At 800 degrees C, the power density based on large particle sized LSCF was 65 mW/cm(2), which was higher than that of the cell based on small particle sized LSCF.",Effect of Morphology of La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode on the Electrochemical Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1002/jccs.201200164
