1,20334,We present a Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+U) study of the adsorption and reduction reactions of oxygen on the pure and 25% Ca-doped LaMnO3 (LCM25) {100} and {110} surfaces.,Ab initio investigation of O2 adsorption on Ca-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8cp02137f
2,20334,The effect of oxygen vacancies on the adsorption characteristics and energetics has also been investigated.,Ab initio investigation of O2 adsorption on Ca-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8cp02137f
3,20334,"Our results show that the O-2 adsorption/reduction process occurs through the formation of superoxide and peroxide intermediates, with the Mn sites found to be generally more active than the La sites.",Ab initio investigation of O2 adsorption on Ca-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8cp02137f
4,20334,"The LCM25{110} surface is found to be more efficient for O-2 reduction than the LCM25{100} surface due to its stronger adsorption of O-2, with the superoxide and peroxide intermediates shown to be energetically more favorable at the Mn sites than at the Ca sites.",Ab initio investigation of O2 adsorption on Ca-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8cp02137f
5,20334,"Moreover, oxygen vacancy defect sites on both the {100} and {110} surfaces are shown to be more efficient for O-2 reduction, as reflected in the higher adsorption energies calculated on the defective surfaces compared to the perfect surfaces.",Ab initio investigation of O2 adsorption on Ca-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8cp02137f
6,20334,"We show from Lowdin population analysis that the O-2 adsorption on the pure and 25% Ca-doped LaMnO3 surfaces is characterized by charge transfer from the interacting surface species into the adsorbed oxygen (g) orbital, which results in weakening of the O-O bonds and its subsequent reduction.",Ab initio investigation of O2 adsorption on Ca-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8cp02137f
7,20334,The elongated O-O bonds were confirmed via vibrational frequency analysis.,Ab initio investigation of O2 adsorption on Ca-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8cp02137f
