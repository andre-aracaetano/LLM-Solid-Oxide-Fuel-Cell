1,16386,We have designed and synthesized by wet chemical techniques a family of excellent cathode materials to be used in intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) devices based on SrCoO3-delta oxide.,Performance of SrCo1-xIrxO3-δ (x=0.10 and 0.15) Perovskites as Potential Cathode Materials for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC),10.1021/acsaem.0c00848
2,16386,"We have replaced Co by 10 and 15% of Ir4+ in SrCo1-xIrxO3-delta (x = 0.10 and 0.15), eluding the unwanted hexagonal phase of SrCoO3-delta by the introduction of a highly charged ion at the Co position.",Performance of SrCo1-xIrxO3-δ (x=0.10 and 0.15) Perovskites as Potential Cathode Materials for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC),10.1021/acsaem.0c00848
3,16386,"In this way, the ionic and the electronic conductivity, together with the catalytic activity for O-2 reduction, was substantially improved.",Performance of SrCo1-xIrxO3-δ (x=0.10 and 0.15) Perovskites as Potential Cathode Materials for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC),10.1021/acsaem.0c00848
4,16386,"After identification from X-ray diffraction, an in situ neutron powder diffraction study enabled the structural characterization between 25 and 800 degrees C, unveiling a tetragonal to cubic phase transition around 380 degrees C. A significant quantity of oxygen vacancies at 800 degrees C was identified, also characterized by thermogravimetric analysis.",Performance of SrCo1-xIrxO3-δ (x=0.10 and 0.15) Perovskites as Potential Cathode Materials for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC),10.1021/acsaem.0c00848
5,16386,"The thermal expansion is virtually linear, without abrupt changes except a subtle change of slope at 380 degrees C concomitant with the tetragonal-to-cubic order-disorder transition.",Performance of SrCo1-xIrxO3-δ (x=0.10 and 0.15) Perovskites as Potential Cathode Materials for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC),10.1021/acsaem.0c00848
