4,20962,"Open circuit impedance measurements on as-prepared electrodes, i.e. before any polarization, and micropolarization measurements have shown that the L78SCF/CGO/YSZ electrode exhibits the lowest area specific polarization resistance R-F (R-F was approximately equal to 0.4 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C and P-O2 = 21 kPa) or, equivalently, the highest electrocatalytic activity according to the order: LSM/LSM-SZ/CGO/YSZ < L58SCF/CGO/YSZ <",Electrochemical characterization of perovskite-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10800-006-9215-y

6,20962,Current-overpotential data taken over an extended cathodic overpotential (ohmic-drop-free) range (0 to -500 mV) also indicated the aforementioned order of electrocatalytic activity.,Electrochemical characterization of perovskite-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10800-006-9215-y
7,20962,"The Nyquist plots corresponded to at least two overlapping arcs or, equivalently, to at least two rate limiting processes.",Electrochemical characterization of perovskite-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10800-006-9215-y
8,20962,"The relative contribution and degree of overlap of these arcs depended on electrode material, temperature and oxygen partial pressure, the low frequency arc being in general dominant at low temperatures and low oxygen partial pressures.",Electrochemical characterization of perovskite-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10800-006-9215-y
9,20962,Open circuit impedance experiments carried out at different oxygen partial pressures P-O2 (0.01-100 kPa) revealed an exponential increase of the open-circuit area specific polarization conductance R-F(-1) with increasing P-O2.,Electrochemical characterization of perovskite-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10800-006-9215-y
