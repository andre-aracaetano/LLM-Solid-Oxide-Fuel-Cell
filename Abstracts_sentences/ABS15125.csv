1,15125,"As an eco-friendly method of waste disposal, municipal solid waste (MSW)-to-multi-generation energy systems based on gasification reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, generates clean energy that can be used to power homes and businesses, reduces our reliance on fossil fuels, and helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","Environmental sustainability by an integrated system based on municipal solid waste fluidized bed gasification using energy, exergy, and environmental analyses",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.122171
2,15125,"In this study, a novel system is developed based on MSW gasification by combining a fluidized bed gasifier, a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and a heat recovery to produce heat and power.","Environmental sustainability by an integrated system based on municipal solid waste fluidized bed gasification using energy, exergy, and environmental analyses",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.122171
3,15125,"In-depth research is done on the power output, heating capacity, energy and exergy efficiencies, and emissions of this innovative combined heating and power system.","Environmental sustainability by an integrated system based on municipal solid waste fluidized bed gasification using energy, exergy, and environmental analyses",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.122171
4,15125,"Electrical and exergy efficiencies of the system are improved with the steam to MSW ratio from 40.6 % to 41.4 % and from 36.4 % to 37.0 %, respectively, and the emission is reduced.","Environmental sustainability by an integrated system based on municipal solid waste fluidized bed gasification using energy, exergy, and environmental analyses",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.122171
5,15125,Increasing utilization factor enhances electrical (from 37.2 % to 44.4 %) and exergy (from 33.4 % to 39.6 %) efficiencies and declines the emission (from 955.2 to 800.7 kg/MW.s).,"Environmental sustainability by an integrated system based on municipal solid waste fluidized bed gasification using energy, exergy, and environmental analyses",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.122171
6,15125,"Decreasing current density and increasing SOFC temperature boost the system performance from energy, exergy, and environmental viewpoints.","Environmental sustainability by an integrated system based on municipal solid waste fluidized bed gasification using energy, exergy, and environmental analyses",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.122171
7,15125,"The future of multi-generation energy systems based on MSW gasification looks bright, as they offer a sustainable way to manage waste while meeting the growing demand for clean energy.","Environmental sustainability by an integrated system based on municipal solid waste fluidized bed gasification using energy, exergy, and environmental analyses",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.122171
