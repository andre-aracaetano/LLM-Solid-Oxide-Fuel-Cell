1,5323,"Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF)/Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (GDC) dual-gradient cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were prepared via a spraying-sintering route, using corn starch as a pore-forming agent.",Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-based dual-gradient cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.034
2,5323,The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis results revealed that the BSCF and GDC showed good chemical compatibility even at 1200 degrees C.,Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-based dual-gradient cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.034
3,5323,"The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicated that a graded pore structure, in addition to a gradient composition, can be obtained by regulating the dosage of the pore-forming agent.",Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-based dual-gradient cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.034
4,5323,"Consequently, the dual-gradient cathode possessed a low polarization resistance of 0.25 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C, when the pore-forming agent contents were graded at 5 wt%, 10 wt%, and 15 wt% from the inner sub-layer to the outer sub-layer, respectively.",Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-based dual-gradient cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.034
5,5323,"This comparative study indicated that high levels of porosity are beneficial for oxygen transport; however, the variation in the porosity of the adjoining sub-layers should be tailored to guarantee the provision of continuous conductive paths for charge carriers.",Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-based dual-gradient cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.034
