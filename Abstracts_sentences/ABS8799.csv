1,8799,"A novel after-burner used for the heat-up and normal operating conditions of a metal-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system, is designed and experimentally studied in this paper.",The Characteristics of a Novel After-Burner Used for Metal-Supported Planar SOFC System,10.1115/1.4055773
2,8799,The burner construction and the calculation of maximum burner power are shown in detail.,The Characteristics of a Novel After-Burner Used for Metal-Supported Planar SOFC System,10.1115/1.4055773
3,8799,"Meanwhile, its static characteristics are researched through the influence of excess air ratio (ER), air velocity, inlet air temperature, and fuel utilization rate (U-f) and its transient characteristics are researched through the processes of burner start-up, burner operating state switch, and stack start-up.",The Characteristics of a Novel After-Burner Used for Metal-Supported Planar SOFC System,10.1115/1.4055773
4,8799,The results suggest that the best ER value gets larger with the increased burner power.,The Characteristics of a Novel After-Burner Used for Metal-Supported Planar SOFC System,10.1115/1.4055773
5,8799,The air velocity is better controlled within 3 m/s to prevent the influence of a lifted flame.,The Characteristics of a Novel After-Burner Used for Metal-Supported Planar SOFC System,10.1115/1.4055773
6,8799,"High inlet air temperature can extend the lean combustion range and reduces incomplete combustion products, but large ER mutations should still be avoided.",The Characteristics of a Novel After-Burner Used for Metal-Supported Planar SOFC System,10.1115/1.4055773
7,8799,"In the case of anode off-gas combusting with cathode off-gas, there are nearly zero emissions.",The Characteristics of a Novel After-Burner Used for Metal-Supported Planar SOFC System,10.1115/1.4055773
8,8799,"Meanwhile, the flue gas temperature decreases to about 760 degrees C because of enlarged heat loss, but it is minimally influenced by U-f. Under the static condition, the optimal point with both controlled temperature and lowest emissions can be obtained in a wide range, and the after-burner can well adapt to various operating states of the stack.",The Characteristics of a Novel After-Burner Used for Metal-Supported Planar SOFC System,10.1115/1.4055773
9,8799,"Under the transient condition, the after-burner has good response performance with much shorter time in burner start-up and burner operating state switch than conventional porous media ones.",The Characteristics of a Novel After-Burner Used for Metal-Supported Planar SOFC System,10.1115/1.4055773
