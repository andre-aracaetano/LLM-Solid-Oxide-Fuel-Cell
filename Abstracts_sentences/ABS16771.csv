1,16771,"Composites cathodes consisting of strontium doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) and yttria stabilized zirconia have been impregnated with the nitrates corresponding to the nominal compositions: La(0.75)Sr(0.25)Mn(1.05)O(3 +/-delta) (LSM25), Ce(0.8)Sm(0.2)O(2) (SDC) and a combination of both (dual).",Impregnation of LSM Based Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3583497
2,16771,The latter performed best with a polarization resistance (R(P)) of 0.39 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C and 0.039 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C compared to 2.17 and 0.19 Omega cm(2) respectively for electrodes without impregnation.,Impregnation of LSM Based Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3583497
3,16771,Furthermore the dual impregnation decreased the activation energy of R(P) to 1.19 eV compared to 1.35 eV for cells without impregnation.,Impregnation of LSM Based Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3583497
