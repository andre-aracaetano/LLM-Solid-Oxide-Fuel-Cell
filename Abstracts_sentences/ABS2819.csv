1,2819,"With the aim to enhance the coking tolerance of traditional Ni-YSZ anode for direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells, a new in-situ-grown Ni-Sr2WO5-delta cermet is proposed and evaluated as internal reforming catalyst.",A new in-situ-grown Ni-Sr2WO5-δ cermet to enhance coking tolerance of direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130301
2,2819,The new cermet of Sr2WO5-delta matrix with Ni nanoparticles is controllably obtained by in-situ reducing of double perovskite Sr2NiWO6 at 800 degrees C for 5 h. The single cell with the configuration of Ni-Sr2WO5-delta vertical bar Ni-YSZ vertical bar YSZ vertical bar LSM-YSZ exhibits a maximum power output of 270.0 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C in wet methane.,A new in-situ-grown Ni-Sr2WO5-δ cermet to enhance coking tolerance of direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130301
3,2819,"Just as promisingly, the single cell with Ni-Sr2WO5-delta works stably for 75 h at 700 degrees C, indicating the fact that the coking tolerance of Ni-YSZ anode can be promoted significantly.",A new in-situ-grown Ni-Sr2WO5-δ cermet to enhance coking tolerance of direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130301
4,2819,The results indicate that the new in-situ-grown Ni-Sr2WO5-delta cermet is a outstanding internal reforming catalyst for direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells.,A new in-situ-grown Ni-Sr2WO5-δ cermet to enhance coking tolerance of direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130301
