1,11118,A three-year solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) development program completed in 1992 has produced 10 cm2 cells with area-specific resistances in the range 0.25 to 0.40 OMEGA cm2 at 1000-degrees-C. Cathode and interconnect materials were produced in the program.,COMBINING SCIENCE AND PRACTICE IN THE DANISH DK-SOFC PROGRAM,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01828-6
