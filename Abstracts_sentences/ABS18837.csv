2,18837,The new approach makes it easy to obtain pure perovskite.,Synthesis of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ nano-powders by aqueous gel-casting for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/ijac.14497
3,18837,"The highly sintering active purity-phase of BZCY nano-powder (particle size of 50 & SIM;100 nm) was obtained by calcining at 1100 & DEG;C for 2 h. Nano-powders effectively reduce the sintering densification temperature and successfully prepare BZCY electrolyte with relative density > 96 % at 1450 & DEG;C, and promote grain growth with an average grain size of 2.36 & mu;m.",Synthesis of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ nano-powders by aqueous gel-casting for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/ijac.14497
