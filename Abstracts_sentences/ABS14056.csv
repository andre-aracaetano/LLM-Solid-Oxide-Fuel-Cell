1,14056,La0.8Sr0.2Mn1.1O3 (LSM1.1)-10 mol% Sc2O3-Stabilized ZrO2 co-doped with CeO2 (ScSZ) composite cathodes were investigated for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with thin 8 mol% Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) electrolyte.,Investigation of LSM1.1-ScSZ composite cathodes for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.07.013
2,14056,"X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated that the ScSZ electrolytes displayed good chemical compatibility with the nonstoichiometric LSM1.1 against co-firing at 1300 degrees C. Increasing the CeO2 content in the ScSZ electrolytes dramatically suppressed the electrode polarization resistance, which may be related to the improved surface oxygen exchange or the enlarged active area of cathode.",Investigation of LSM1.1-ScSZ composite cathodes for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.07.013
3,14056,"The 5Ce10ScZr was the best electrolyte for the composite cathodes, which caused a small ohmic resistance decrease and the reduced polarization resistance and brought about the highest cell performance.",Investigation of LSM1.1-ScSZ composite cathodes for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.07.013
4,14056,"The cell performances at lower temperatures seemed to rely on the electrode polarization resistance more seriously, than the ohmic resistance.",Investigation of LSM1.1-ScSZ composite cathodes for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.07.013
5,14056,"Compared with the cell impedance at higher temperatures, the higher the 5Ce10ScZr proportion in the composite cathodes, the smaller the increment of the charge transfer resistance at lower temperatures.",Investigation of LSM1.1-ScSZ composite cathodes for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.07.013
6,14056,"The anode-supported SOFC with the LSM1.1-5Ce10ScZr (60:40) composite cathode achieved the maximum power densities of 0.82 W/cm(2) at 650 degrees C and 2.24 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C, respectively.",Investigation of LSM1.1-ScSZ composite cathodes for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.07.013
