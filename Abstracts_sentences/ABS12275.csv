1,12275,"In this paper, we report the incorporation of borate, silicate and phosphate into La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3d (LSCF) and Sr0.9Y0.1CoO3d (SYC) cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
2,12275,"In the former, an increase in the electronic conductivity was observed, which can be correlated with electron doping due to the oxyanion doping favoring the introduction of oxide ion vacancies.",Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
3,12275,"The highest conductivity was observed for La0.6Sr0.4Co0.76Fe0.19B0.05O3d, 1190?S?cm1 at 700?degrees C, in comparison with 431?S?cm1 for undoped La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3d at the same temperature.",Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
4,12275,"For Sr0.9Y0.1CoO3d series the conductivity suffers a decrease on doping, attributed to any effect of electron doping being outweighed by the effect of partial disruption of the electronic conduction pathways by the oxyanion.",Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
5,12275,Composites of these cathode materials with 50% CGO10 were examined on dense CGO10 pellets and the area-specific resistances (ASR) in symmetrical cells were determined.,Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
6,12275,"The ASR values, at 800?degrees C, were 0.20, 0.08 and 0.11?O?cm2 for La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3d, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.76Fe0.19B0.05O3d and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.78Fe0.195Si0.025O3d, respectively.",Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
7,12275,"For the SYC materials, the oxyanion-doped compositions also showed an improvement in the ASR values with respect to the parent compounds, despite the lower electronic conductivity in these cases.",Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
8,12275,This observation may be due to an increase in ionic conductivity due to oxyanion incorporation leading to the formation of oxide ion vacancies.,Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
9,12275,"In addition, the stability of these systems towards CO2 was studied.",Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
10,12275,"For La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8(1x)Fe0.2(1x)MxO3d series, all compositions showed no evidence for reactivity with CO2 between RT and 1000?degrees C. On the other hand, for the Sr0.9Y0.1Co1xMxO3d series, some reactivity was observed, although the CO2 stability was shown to be improved on oxyanion doping.",Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
11,12275,"Thus, these results show that oxyanion doping can have a beneficial effect on the performance of perovskite cobaltite cathode materials.",Synthesis and Characterization of Oxyanion-Doped Cobalt Containing Perovskites,10.1002/fuce.201200081
