1,14023,Increasing global energy demands have been accelerating the research and development of reversible electrochemical systems that can realize an efficient use of the intermittent renewable energy resources.,Computational analysis on the electrode geometric parameters for the reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.04.174
2,14023,"This paper thus describes a numerical investigation of reversible solid oxide cells (RSOCs), for their high energy efficiency delivered from the high operating temperatures ranging from 600 to 1000 degrees C. Unlike the previous studies, a model-based strategy is applied for the simultaneous integration of different operating modes (namely, fuel cell and electrolysis cell modes) to enable more realistic predictions on the trade-off behavior of the effects of electrode design parameters on the cell performance.",Computational analysis on the electrode geometric parameters for the reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.04.174
3,14023,This approach was taken to investigate the effects of various geometric designs and operating parameters (electrode backing layer thickness; interconnector rib size; fuel gas composition) on the current-potential characteristic and the round-trip efficiency.,Computational analysis on the electrode geometric parameters for the reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.04.174
4,14023,"The cell performance was significantly affected by the rib size, particularly when the backing layer was thin, because of the uneven distribution of the reactant species.",Computational analysis on the electrode geometric parameters for the reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.04.174
5,14023,"Overall, this study provides insights into key geometric design parameters that dominate the performance of dual-mode RSOCs.",Computational analysis on the electrode geometric parameters for the reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.04.174
