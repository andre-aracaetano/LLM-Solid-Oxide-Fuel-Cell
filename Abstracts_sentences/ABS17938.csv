2,17938,It is based on high energy milling (mechanical alloying or MA) of CeO2 and Gd2O3 powders containing 10 mol% Gd2O3.,Synthesis of nanosized gadolinium doped ceria solid solution by high energy ball milling,10.1016/j.powtec.2011.08.001
3,17938,"The samples, obtained after different milling times of 10 to 60 h, were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET method of the specific surface area measurement, electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy.",Synthesis of nanosized gadolinium doped ceria solid solution by high energy ball milling,10.1016/j.powtec.2011.08.001
4,17938,The fluorite-structured Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 solid solution nanopowder with the surface area of 16.86 m(2)/g and particle sizes below 50 nm was obtained by milling the oxide mixture for 30 h. Increase in the milling time beyond 30 h led to the smaller crystallite sizes and more agglomeration.,Synthesis of nanosized gadolinium doped ceria solid solution by high energy ball milling,10.1016/j.powtec.2011.08.001
