1,7868,This work reports a durability study in galvanostatic mode at 700 degrees C for 900-960 h related to structural and microstructural evolution of LaPrNiO4+delta (LPNO) oxygen electrode.,"Durability of nanostructured LaPrNiO4+δ electrode for solid oxide cells: Electrochemical, microstructural, and structural investigation",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227724
2,7868,"The performances of the electrode, deposited by electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) and screen printing (SP), are not changed when operated under electrolysis current whereas a degradation is observed in fuel cell mode.","Durability of nanostructured LaPrNiO4+δ electrode for solid oxide cells: Electrochemical, microstructural, and structural investigation",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227724
3,7868,"Small quantities of secondary phases (La, Pr)(3)Ni2O7-delta in the fine ESD microstructure and Pr6O11 on both ESD and SP layers are detected in the pristine electrode by synchrotron mu-X-ray diffraction and fluorescence.","Durability of nanostructured LaPrNiO4+δ electrode for solid oxide cells: Electrochemical, microstructural, and structural investigation",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227724
4,7868,"The destabilization of LPNO electrode, which slightly.","Durability of nanostructured LaPrNiO4+δ electrode for solid oxide cells: Electrochemical, microstructural, and structural investigation",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227724
5,7868,"occurs in the ESD layer after thermal aging in air, is strongly accelerated under anodic and cathodic currents.","Durability of nanostructured LaPrNiO4+δ electrode for solid oxide cells: Electrochemical, microstructural, and structural investigation",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227724
6,7868,"Indeed, the formation of a new phase (La,Pr)(4)Ni3O10-delta on both ESD and SP layers occurs with the extension of (La,Pr)(3)Ni2O7-delta in the SP layer, and a significant increase in the amount Pr6O11 at high current density.","Durability of nanostructured LaPrNiO4+δ electrode for solid oxide cells: Electrochemical, microstructural, and structural investigation",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227724
7,7868,"Nevertheless, the electrode microstructure, determined by FIB-SEM tomography, remains stable under current whereas severe delamination is observed after aging in fuel cell mode.","Durability of nanostructured LaPrNiO4+δ electrode for solid oxide cells: Electrochemical, microstructural, and structural investigation",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227724
8,7868,"Based on these characterizations, the mechanisms of electrode aging have been discussed to explain the different behavior in fuel cell and electrolysis modes.","Durability of nanostructured LaPrNiO4+δ electrode for solid oxide cells: Electrochemical, microstructural, and structural investigation",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227724
