1,21027,"Fast oxygen transport materials are necessary for a range of technologies, including efficient and cost-effective solid oxide fuel cells, gas separation membranes, oxygen sensors, chemical looping devices, and memristors.",Strain effects on oxygen migration in perovskites,10.1039/c4cp05554c
2,21027,"Strain is often proposed as a method to enhance the performance of oxygen transport materials, but the magnitude of its effect and its underlying mechanisms are not well-understood, particularly in the widely-used perovskite-structured oxygen conductors.",Strain effects on oxygen migration in perovskites,10.1039/c4cp05554c
3,21027,"This work reports on an ab initio prediction of strain effects on migration energetics for nine perovskite systems of the form LaBO3, where B = [Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ga].",Strain effects on oxygen migration in perovskites,10.1039/c4cp05554c
4,21027,"Biaxial strain, as might be easily produced in epitaxial systems, is predicted to lead to approximately linear changes in migration energy.",Strain effects on oxygen migration in perovskites,10.1039/c4cp05554c
5,21027,"We find that tensile biaxial strain reduces the oxygen vacancy migration barrier across the systems studied by an average of 66 meV per percent strain for a single selected hop, with a low of 36 and a high of 89 meV decrease in migration barrier per percent strain across all systems.",Strain effects on oxygen migration in perovskites,10.1039/c4cp05554c
6,21027,The estimated range for the change in migration barrier within each system is +/- 25 meV per percent strain when considering all hops.,Strain effects on oxygen migration in perovskites,10.1039/c4cp05554c
7,21027,"These results suggest that strain can significantly impact transport in these materials, e. g., a 2% tensile strain can increase the diffusion coefficient by about three orders of magnitude at 300 K (one order of magnitude at 500 degrees C or 773 K) for one of the most strain-responsive materials calculated here (LaCrO3).",Strain effects on oxygen migration in perovskites,10.1039/c4cp05554c
8,21027,"We show that a simple elasticity model, which assumes only dilative or compressive strain in a cubic environment and a fixed migration volume, can qualitatively but not quantitatively model the strain dependence of the migration energy, suggesting that factors not captured by continuum elasticity play a significant role in the strain response.",Strain effects on oxygen migration in perovskites,10.1039/c4cp05554c
