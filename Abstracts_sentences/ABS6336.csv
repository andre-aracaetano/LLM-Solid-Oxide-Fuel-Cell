1,6336,Electrochemical performance of metal-supported plasma sprayed (PS) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was tested for three nominal electrolyte thicknesses and three electrolyte fabrication conditions to determine the effects of electrolyte thickness and microstructure on open circuit voltage (OCV) and series resistance (R(s)).,Electrochemical testing of suspension plasma sprayed solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.057
2,6336,"The measured OCV values were approximately 90% of the Nernst voltages, and electrolyte area specific resistances below 0.1 Omega cm(2) were obtained at 750 degrees C for electrolyte thicknesses below 20 mu m. Least-squares fitting was used to estimate the contributions to R(s) of the YSZ bulk material, its microstructure, and the contact resistance between the current collectors and the cells.",Electrochemical testing of suspension plasma sprayed solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.057
3,6336,"It was found that the 96% dense electrolyte layers produced from high plasma gas flow rate conditions had the lowest permeation rates, the highest OCV values, and the smallest electrolyte-related voltage losses.",Electrochemical testing of suspension plasma sprayed solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.057
4,6336,Optimal electrolyte thicknesses were determined for each electrolyte microstructure that would result in the lowest combination of OCV loss and voltage loss due to series resistance for operating voltages of 0.8 v and 0.7V.
