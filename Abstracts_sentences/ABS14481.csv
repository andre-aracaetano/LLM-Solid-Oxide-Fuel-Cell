2,14481,"By using the finite element method, this model enables the time-dependent and space-resolved simulation of the physicochemical processes in a porous cathode microstructure.",Time-Dependent 3D Impedance Model of Mixed-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.093308jes
3,14481,The developed model is used for a detailed analysis of the formation of a 'Gerischer-type' impedance.,Time-Dependent 3D Impedance Model of Mixed-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.093308jes
4,14481,"It is detected that the low-frequency part is dominated by the surface exchange reaction, whereas the typical 45 degrees ramp of the Gerischer impedance is related to the ionic diffusion in the bulk.",Time-Dependent 3D Impedance Model of Mixed-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.093308jes
5,14481,The capability of the time-dependent 3D impedance model is evaluated versus a well-established homogenized analytical model.,Time-Dependent 3D Impedance Model of Mixed-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.093308jes
6,14481,For homogeneous 3D microstructures both models calculate impedance curves which are in excellent agreement.,Time-Dependent 3D Impedance Model of Mixed-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.093308jes
7,14481,Further impedance simulations with microstructures containing features of high-performance SOFC cathodes clearly show that model separates and quantifies the contribution of the gas diffusion in a porous cathode layer.,Time-Dependent 3D Impedance Model of Mixed-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.093308jes
8,14481,"At an oxygen partial pressure of 0.21 atm the gas diffusion accounts for only 2% of the total polarization resistance, whereas a depletion of oxygen to 0.01 atm significantly increases this value to 38%.",Time-Dependent 3D Impedance Model of Mixed-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.093308jes
