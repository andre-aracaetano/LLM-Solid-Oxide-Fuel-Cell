1,8457,Raw and charred walnut shells were investigated as solid fuels in direct carbon solid fuel cells operating within the temperature range 600-850 degrees C. Char was prepared by means of thermal processing of pulverised shells in a quartz reactor within a temperature range of 400-850 degrees C. Elemental analysis identified high carbon and marginally low sulphur contents in char obtained from biomass-derived solid waste.,The usefulness of walnut shells as waste biomass fuels in direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.biombioe.2018.09.026
