1,13311,The performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with thin film electrolytes and electrodes was investigated at a lower operating temperature regime (T <= 600 degrees C).,Low Temperature Performance Improvement of SOFC with Thin Film Electrolyte and Electrodes Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition,10.1149/1.3243859
2,13311,"2 x 2 cm anode-supported unit cells with thin film components of a Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) composite anode interlayer, a thin (<= 1 mu m) YSZ electrolyte, and a lanthanum strontium cobalt oxide cathode were fabricated by using pulsed laser deposition, and the performance of the cells was characterized at the temperature range of 350 degrees C <= T <= 600 degrees C. Stable open-circuit voltage values above 1 V were successfully obtained with thin film electrolyte cells, which implied that the 1 mu m thick electrolyte was fairly dense and gastight.",Low Temperature Performance Improvement of SOFC with Thin Film Electrolyte and Electrodes Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition,10.1149/1.3243859
3,13311,"The thin film electrolyte cells exhibited a much more improved cell performance than a thick film (similar to 8 mu m) YSZ electrolyte cell at the low operating temperature regime (350-550 degrees C) and, in some cases, showed better power outputs than other thin film membrane micro-SOFCs.",Low Temperature Performance Improvement of SOFC with Thin Film Electrolyte and Electrodes Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition,10.1149/1.3243859
