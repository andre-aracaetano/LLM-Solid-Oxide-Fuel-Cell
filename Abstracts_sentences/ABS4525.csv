2,4525,"Of the many types of fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), employing either oxygen ions or protons as charge carriers, provide an efficient, environmentally benign, and fuel-flexible power generation system that can be adapted for small power units (including mobile applications) and for large scale power plants.([3,4])",Unprecedented room-temperature electrical power generation using nanoscale fluorite-structured oxide electrolytes,10.1002/adma.200700715
3,4525,"However, SOFCs require high temperatures (800-1000 degrees C), a condition that presents material degradation problems,([5,6]) as well as other technological complications and economic obstacles.([7])",Unprecedented room-temperature electrical power generation using nanoscale fluorite-structured oxide electrolytes,10.1002/adma.200700715
4,4525,"Numerous attempts have been made to find alternative systems that can be operated at lower temperatures.([8,9])",Unprecedented room-temperature electrical power generation using nanoscale fluorite-structured oxide electrolytes,10.1002/adma.200700715
5,4525,We report here unprecedented observations of power generation at temperatures as low as room temperature using dense bulk nanostructured yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and samaria-doped ceria (SDC) as electrolytes.,Unprecedented room-temperature electrical power generation using nanoscale fluorite-structured oxide electrolytes,10.1002/adma.200700715
6,4525,This behavior is observed only when the material is nanostructured (grain size similar to 15 nm).,Unprecedented room-temperature electrical power generation using nanoscale fluorite-structured oxide electrolytes,10.1002/adma.200700715
7,4525,"Open circuit electromotive force (emf) (up to 180 mV for YSZ and 400 mV for SDC) and closed circuit currents (similar to 6 nA for YSZ and 30 nA for SDC) were measured from water concentration cells, indicating proton conduction within the nanostructured oxides.",Unprecedented room-temperature electrical power generation using nanoscale fluorite-structured oxide electrolytes,10.1002/adma.200700715
8,4525,"These results show that with optimization, viable power generation using water concentration cells at room temperature is a possible goal.",Unprecedented room-temperature electrical power generation using nanoscale fluorite-structured oxide electrolytes,10.1002/adma.200700715
