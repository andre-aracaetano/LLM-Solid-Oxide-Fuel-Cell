4,14697,"Meanwhile, Mo6+ effectively suppresses the reduction of the Fe4+/Fe3+ electron pair in reducing atmosphere, which enhances the electrical conductivity.",High performance of Mo-doped La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ perovskites as anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.190
5,14697,"In 5% H-2-Ar, the conductivity of Modoped sample is increased from 0.75 to 2.8 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C, which is more in line with the requirement of the anode.",High performance of Mo-doped La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ perovskites as anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.190
6,14697,"LSFNM exhibits lower polarization resistance (R-p) than LSFN in wet H-2; for example, the R-p values of LSFN and LSFNM at 850 degrees C are 0.25 and 0.18 Omega.cm(2).",High performance of Mo-doped La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ perovskites as anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.190
7,14697,"The maximum power density (P-max) of the LSGM-supported single cell is increased from 740 to 975 mW cm(-2) in H-2 at 850 degrees C, and the cell exhibits reasonable stability at 700 degrees C for 100 h.",High performance of Mo-doped La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ perovskites as anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.190
