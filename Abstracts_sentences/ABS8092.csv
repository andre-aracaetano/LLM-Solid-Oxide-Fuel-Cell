3,8092,"These techniques allow for an understanding of how gas-phase composition and electrical conditions affect the fuel chemistry on the anode, specifically with regards to carbon formation.",Ni/YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes operating on humidified ethanol fuel feeds: An optical study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.048
4,8092,"Ethanol flows that are humidified to H2O:C2H5OH ratios of 1.58, 1.27, and 1.12 at 700, 750, and 800 degrees C, respectively, result in far less anode damage than dry ethanol.",Ni/YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes operating on humidified ethanol fuel feeds: An optical study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.048
5,8092,"However, subtle spatial variations in anode surface temperature indicate that damage occurs at temperatures below 800 degrees C. FTIR spectra of the fuel feed reaching the anode show that internal steam reforming occurs both in the gas phase and at the anode catalyst.",Ni/YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes operating on humidified ethanol fuel feeds: An optical study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.048
6,8092,"Thermal imaging and post-mortem analysis confirm that humidified ethanol flows at 800 degrees C form negligible amounts of carbon deposits in polarized cells, resulting in minimal anode deterioration.",Ni/YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes operating on humidified ethanol fuel feeds: An optical study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.048
7,8092,"These results serve as benchmark data for the further development of direct, internal reforming SOFC systems, especially in smaller, portable systems.",Ni/YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes operating on humidified ethanol fuel feeds: An optical study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.048
