3,14049,"The fabrication processing parameters including composition of precursor solution, PBC loading, and firing temperature have been investigated to optimize the cathode microstructure and further to minimize the cathode interfacial polarization resistance, leading to a cathode interfacial polarization resistance of only 0.082 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, much lower than those reported for pure PBC electrode (0.86 Omega cm(2)), PBC-SDC composite cathode (0.25 Omega cm(2)) or various other impregnated cobaltite cathodes such as Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (0.25 Omega cm(2)), La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (0.31 Omega cm(2)), and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (0.24 Omega cm(2)).",Electrochemical characteristics of nano-structured PrBaCo2O5+x cathodes fabricated with ion impregnation process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.11.069
