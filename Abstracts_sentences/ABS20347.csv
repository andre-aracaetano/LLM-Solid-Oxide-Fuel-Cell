1,20347,"The electrochemical behavior of Ni cermet electrode with CeO2 - x additive in contact with YSZ electrode was studied by means of impedance spectroscopy in H-2, H2O, CO2, CO, He, and Ar gas media of various composition within the temperature range of 700 to 950A degrees C. Near the equilibrium potential, the electrochemical impedance spectra of the studied electrodes indicate to three stages of electrode reaction.",Gas diffusion hindrances on Ni cermet anode in contact with Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 solid electrolyte,10.1134/S102319350904020X
2,20347,"The polarization conductivity of the low-frequency stage of electrode reaction (sigma(lf)) is characterized with the following regularities: (a) temperature dependence of sigma(lf) has a positive slope in Arrhenius coordinates; (b) sigma(lf) increases upon replacement of gas mixture with lower mutual diffusion coefficient by mixture with higher mutual diffusion coefficient, while polarization conductivity values of other stages remain practically invariable; (c) concentration relationships of 1/sigma(lf)recorded for constant activity of oxygen in the gas phase are linear in the 1/sigma(lf) vs. 1/P (CO) (2) (P (CO)) coordinates; (d) no low-frequency stage of the electrode reaction is observed upon electrochemical inflow (outflow) of the gas reagents (reaction products) to (from) the test electrodes (current passing through closely pressed specimens and central specimen impedance measurement); and (e) no change in the gas flow rate affects sigma(lf) value.",Gas diffusion hindrances on Ni cermet anode in contact with Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 solid electrolyte,10.1134/S102319350904020X
