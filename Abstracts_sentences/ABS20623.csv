1,20623,Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of stabilizing the cubic or tetragonal perovskite phases in the SrCoO3-delta system at room temperature by partially replacing Co atoms with small amounts of highly charged cations like Ti4+ in SrCo0.95Ti0.05O3-delta.,Reducing the Cobalt Content in SrCo0.95Ti0.05O3-δ-Based Perovskites to Produce Cleaner Cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1021/acsaem.2c03569
2,20623,This material gives extraordinary performances as a cathode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) at intermediate temperatures (800-850 degrees C).,Reducing the Cobalt Content in SrCo0.95Ti0.05O3-δ-Based Perovskites to Produce Cleaner Cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1021/acsaem.2c03569
3,20623,"In this work, we have tried to still improve this cathode in a cleaner and low-priced material by reducing its Co content, since Co is a high-cost and toxic element, additionally reducing its thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), to make it more mechanically compatible with the rest of the components of a SOFC.",Reducing the Cobalt Content in SrCo0.95Ti0.05O3-δ-Based Perovskites to Produce Cleaner Cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1021/acsaem.2c03569
