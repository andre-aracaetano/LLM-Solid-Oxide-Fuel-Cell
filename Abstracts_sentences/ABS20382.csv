4,20382,"Meanwhile, XPS analysis obviously demonstrates the co-existence of Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mo5+/Mo6+ couples, of which both proportions increase with the reduce oxygen partial pressure.",Characterization of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 symmetrical electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.179
5,20382,"Applying SFM-GDC symmetrical electrode, the 300 mu m-thick YSZ electrolyte-supported RSOCs with GDC buffer layers show acceptance electrochemical performance, and switch smoothly between power generation and electrolysis modes with no obvious degradation after 20 h short-term stability working under humidified (similar to 3%H2O) H-2 and 3%H2O-air atmospheres, respectively.",Characterization of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 symmetrical electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.179
6,20382,"Besides, the impedance spectrum were further studied using a relaxation time distribution function (DRT), and two polarization peaks (P1, P2) observed in the power generation mode shifted to the left at low frequency with the reduced temperature, while one more new polarization peak (P3) corresponds to the reaction gas diffusion owing to the low concentration steam (similar to 3% H2O) in electrolysis mode.",Characterization of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 symmetrical electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.179
