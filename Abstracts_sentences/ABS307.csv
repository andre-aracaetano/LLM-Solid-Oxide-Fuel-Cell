1,307,Highly crystalline and thermally stable gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) particles have been synthesized by hard template route for the first time.,Gadolinium doped Ceria nanocrystals synthesized from mesoporous silica,10.1007/s11051-007-9257-z
2,307,This oxide is being recognized as an intermediate temperature (500-700 degrees C) electrolyte material for applications in solid-oxide fuel cells.,Gadolinium doped Ceria nanocrystals synthesized from mesoporous silica,10.1007/s11051-007-9257-z
3,307,The GDC particles show high crystallinity and nanometric size (2.83 +/- 0.05 nm in diameter) and Raman analyses confirm the formation of the solid solution instead of a CeO2 and Gd2O3 mixture.,Gadolinium doped Ceria nanocrystals synthesized from mesoporous silica,10.1007/s11051-007-9257-z
4,307,EDX and EELS studies indicate a stoichiometry coherent with the Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 phase.,Gadolinium doped Ceria nanocrystals synthesized from mesoporous silica,10.1007/s11051-007-9257-z
5,307,The synthesized nanometric powder is expected to be used in solid oxide fuel cells as well as in the catalytic treatment of automobile exhaust fumes.,Gadolinium doped Ceria nanocrystals synthesized from mesoporous silica,10.1007/s11051-007-9257-z
