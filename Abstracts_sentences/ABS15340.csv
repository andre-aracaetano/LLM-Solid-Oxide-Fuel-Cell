1,15340,"A co-extrusion technique was employed to fabricate a novel dual layer NiO/NiO-YSZ hollow fiber (HF) precursor which was then co-sintered at 1,400 degrees C and reduced at 700 degrees C to form, respectively, a meshed porous inner Ni current collector and outer Ni-YSZ anode layers for SOFC applications.",NI/NI-YSZ Current Collector/Anode Dual Layer Hollow Fibers for Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000174
2,15340,"The inner thin and highly porous mesh-like pure Ni layer of approximately 50 mu m in thickness functions as a current collector in micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), aiming at highly efficient current collection with low fuel diffusion resistance, while the thicker outer Ni-YSZ layer of 260 mu m acts as an anode, providing also major mechanical strength to the dual-layer HF.",NI/NI-YSZ Current Collector/Anode Dual Layer Hollow Fibers for Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000174
3,15340,"Achieved morphology consisted of short finger-like voids originating from the inner lumen of the HF, and a sponge-like structure filling most of the Ni-YSZ anode layer, which is considered to be suitable macrostructure for anode SOFC system.",NI/NI-YSZ Current Collector/Anode Dual Layer Hollow Fibers for Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000174
4,15340,The electrical conductivity of the meshed porous inner Ni layer is measured to be 77.5 x 10(5) S m(-1).,NI/NI-YSZ Current Collector/Anode Dual Layer Hollow Fibers for Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000174
5,15340,"This result is significantly higher than previous reported results on single layer Ni-YSZ HFs, which performs not only as a catalyst for the oxidation reaction, but also as a current collector.",NI/NI-YSZ Current Collector/Anode Dual Layer Hollow Fibers for Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000174
6,15340,These results highlight the advantages of this novel dual-layer HF design as a new and highly efficient way of collecting current from the lumen of micro-tubular SOFC.,NI/NI-YSZ Current Collector/Anode Dual Layer Hollow Fibers for Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000174
