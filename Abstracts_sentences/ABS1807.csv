1,1807,"Porous yttriastabilized zirconia (YSZ), in a composite with NiO, is widely used as a cermet electrode in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs).",Manufacturing and Thermal Shock Characterization of Porous Yttria Stabilized Zirconia for Hydrogen Energy Systems,10.3390/ceramics5030036
2,1807,"Given cycles of high temperature in these energy devices, mechanical integrity of the porous YSZ is critical.",Manufacturing and Thermal Shock Characterization of Porous Yttria Stabilized Zirconia for Hydrogen Energy Systems,10.3390/ceramics5030036
3,1807,"Pore morphology, as well as properties of the ceramic, ultimately affect the mechanical properties of the cermet electrode.",Manufacturing and Thermal Shock Characterization of Porous Yttria Stabilized Zirconia for Hydrogen Energy Systems,10.3390/ceramics5030036
4,1807,"Here, we fabricated porous YSZ sheets via freezing of an aqueous slurry on a cold thermoelectric plate and quantified their flexural properties, both for as-fabricated samples and samples subjected to thermal shock at 200 degrees C to 500 degrees C. Results of this work have implications for the hydrogen economy and global decarbonization efforts, in particular for the manufacturing of SOFCs and SOECs.",Manufacturing and Thermal Shock Characterization of Porous Yttria Stabilized Zirconia for Hydrogen Energy Systems,10.3390/ceramics5030036
