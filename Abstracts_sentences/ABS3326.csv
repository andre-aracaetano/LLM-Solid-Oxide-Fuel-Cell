1,3326,Application of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 - delta (SSC) cathode in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has its advantage of reducing polarization loss at intermediate operating temperatures (600-800 degrees C).,"Fabrication of (Sm, Ce)O2-δ interlayer for yttria-stabilized zirconia-based intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.01.124
2,3326,"However, the SSC cathode cannot be applied directly on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte due to the thermal mismatch and chemical reaction.","Fabrication of (Sm, Ce)O2-δ interlayer for yttria-stabilized zirconia-based intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.01.124
