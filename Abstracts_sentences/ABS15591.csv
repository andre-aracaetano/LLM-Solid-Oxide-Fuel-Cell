1,15591,"A solid oxide fuel cell with Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte of 10 mu m in thickness and Ni-SDC anode of 15 mu m in thickness on a 0.8 mm thick Ni-YSZ cermet substrate was fabricated by tape casting, screen printing and co-firing.",Internal shorting and fuel loss of a low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with SDC electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.087
2,15591,"A composite cathode, 75 wt.% Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (SSCo) + 25 wt.% SDC, approximately 50 mu m in thickness, was printed on the co-fired half-cell, and sintered at 950 degrees C.",Internal shorting and fuel loss of a low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with SDC electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.087
3,15591,The cell showed a high electrochemical performance at temperatures ranging from 500 to 650 degrees C. Peak power density of 545 MW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C was obtained.,Internal shorting and fuel loss of a low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with SDC electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.087
4,15591,"However, the cell exhibited severe internal shorting due to the mixed conductivity of the SDC electrolyte.",Internal shorting and fuel loss of a low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with SDC electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.087
5,15591,"Both the amount of water collected from the anode outlet and the open circuit voltage (OCV) indicated that the internal shorting current could reach 0.85 A cm(-2) or more at 600 degrees C. Zr content inclusions were found at the surface and in the cross-section of the SDC electrolyte, which could be one of the reasons for reduced OCV and oxygen ionic conductivity.",Internal shorting and fuel loss of a low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with SDC electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.087
6,15591,Fuel loss due to internal shorting of the thin SDC electrolyte cell becomes a significant concern when it is used in applications requiring high fuel utilization and electrical efficiency.,Internal shorting and fuel loss of a low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with SDC electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.087
