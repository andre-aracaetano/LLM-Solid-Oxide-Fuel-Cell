1,4709,"For investigating the direct applicability of highly active cobalt containing cathodes on YSZ electrolytes at a lower processing and operating temperature range (T <= 650 degrees C), we fabricated a thin film lanthanum strontium cobalt oxide (LSC) cathode on an yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ)-based solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) via pulsed laser deposition (PLD).",Direct Applicability of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - δ Thin Film Cathode to Yttria Stabilised Zirconia Electrolytes at T ≤ 650 °C,10.1002/fuce.201000009
2,4709,"Its electrochemical performance (5.9 mW cm(-2) at 0.7 V, 650 degrees C) was significantly inferior to that (595 mW cm(-2) at 0.7 V, 650 degrees C) of an SOFC with a thin (t similar to 200 nm) gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) buffer layer in between the LSC thin film cathode and the YSZ electrolyte.",Direct Applicability of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - δ Thin Film Cathode to Yttria Stabilised Zirconia Electrolytes at T ≤ 650 °C,10.1002/fuce.201000009
3,4709,"It implies that even though the cathode processing and cell operating temperatures were strictly controlled not to exceed 650 degrees C, the direct application of LSC on YSZ should be avoided.",Direct Applicability of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - δ Thin Film Cathode to Yttria Stabilised Zirconia Electrolytes at T ≤ 650 °C,10.1002/fuce.201000009
4,4709,"The origin of the cell performance deterioration is thoroughly studied by glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the decomposition of the cathode and diffusion of La and Sr into YSZ were observed when LSC directly contacted YSZ.",Direct Applicability of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - δ Thin Film Cathode to Yttria Stabilised Zirconia Electrolytes at T ≤ 650 °C,10.1002/fuce.201000009
