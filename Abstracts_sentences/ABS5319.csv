1,5319,New materials based on WC-YSZ composites were investigated as potential anodes for direct methane-fueled solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,"Tungsten carbide-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Preparation, performance and challenges",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.102
2,5319,Two different carbide-based composites were developed in this study: a conventional WC-YSZ (50:50 vol.%) composite and an infiltrated WC-YSZ composite (20 vol.% WC infiltrated into a porous YSZ support).,"Tungsten carbide-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Preparation, performance and challenges",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.102
3,5319,It was shown that a conventional WC-YSZ composite cannot be used as an alternative anode because of catastrophic changes in anode microstructure due to the carbide phase decomposition.,"Tungsten carbide-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Preparation, performance and challenges",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.102
4,5319,"The infiltrated WC-YSZ, however, performed rather stably with no catastrophic degradation at 800-900 degrees C under mixed hydrogen methane and methane fuels.","Tungsten carbide-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Preparation, performance and challenges",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.102
5,5319,"Furthermore, while WC-based anodes were resistance to carbon formation under methane, the fuel was poorly activated and the performance was quite low.","Tungsten carbide-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Preparation, performance and challenges",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.102
6,5319,The carbide-based electrodes were then modified by incorporation of 5 wt% CeO2 and 1 wt% Ru.,"Tungsten carbide-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Preparation, performance and challenges",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.102
7,5319,"Not only did the addition of ceria-Ru electrocatalysts dramatically enhance the fuel cell performance, it also greatly improved the stability of the polarized cell.","Tungsten carbide-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Preparation, performance and challenges",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.102
8,5319,Both calculations and experiments showed that kinetic factors play the major role in stability of the carbide phase.,"Tungsten carbide-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Preparation, performance and challenges",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.102
9,5319,It is proposed here that the carbide-infiltrated YSZ support can reasonably be considered as a foundation for future studies to develop promising alternative anodes.,"Tungsten carbide-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Preparation, performance and challenges",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.102
