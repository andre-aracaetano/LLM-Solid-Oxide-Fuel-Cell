1,2555,A composite cathode composed of NdBa0.5Sr0.3CO2.3Fe0.5O5+delta (NBSCF) and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) has been investigated to evaluate its electrochemical properties for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) based on structural characteristics and oxygen redox stability.,Effects of composite cathode on electrochemical and redox properties for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.007
2,2555,The composite cathode has a lower polarization loss than a pure NBSCF cathode because the specific addition of GDC provides extended electrochemically active sites where the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurs.,Effects of composite cathode on electrochemical and redox properties for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.007
3,2555,"Accordingly, the optimized NBSCF-40GDC cathode material had the lowest ASR, 0.074 Omega cm(2) at 873 K, resulting in excellent cell performance of 1.83 W cm(-2) at 873 K.",Effects of composite cathode on electrochemical and redox properties for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.007
4,2555,"In particular, investigation into the oxygen redox stability reveals that the composite cathode has superior redox stability under the operating conditions than a bulk NBSCF cathode material, which affects the long-term stability of the cathode performance.",Effects of composite cathode on electrochemical and redox properties for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.007
