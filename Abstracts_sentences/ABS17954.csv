2,17954,A high electrical conductivity of such a cathode is the parameter determining the efficiency of the operation of a fuel element.,"Role of Excess Manganese in Formation of the Structure and Transport Properties of Manganite (Nd0.67Sr0.33)1-x Mn1+x O3 (x=0, 0.2) Sintered at 1273-1473 K",10.1134/S1063783418070211
3,17954,"In this report, the effect of influence of excess manganese on the structure and the conductivity of manganite ceramics with compositions (Nd0.67Sr0.33)(1-x) Mn1 + x O-3 +/- Delta (x = 0, 0.2) sintered at temperatures 1273-1673 K is presented for the first time.","Role of Excess Manganese in Formation of the Structure and Transport Properties of Manganite (Nd0.67Sr0.33)1-x Mn1+x O3 (x=0, 0.2) Sintered at 1273-1473 K",10.1134/S1063783418070211
4,17954,The existence of 20% excess manganese in the initial manganite powder after sintering is shown to lead to that the conductivity of the obtained ceramics in the temperature range 823-1073 K is several times higher than the conductivity of the ceramics without excess manganese.,"Role of Excess Manganese in Formation of the Structure and Transport Properties of Manganite (Nd0.67Sr0.33)1-x Mn1+x O3 (x=0, 0.2) Sintered at 1273-1473 K",10.1134/S1063783418070211
