1,15160,"Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells (CH4-SOFCs) have gained significant attention as methane, the primary component of natural gas (NG), is cheap and widely available and the natural gas infrastructures are relatively mature.",Synergistic Effects of In-Situ Exsolved Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalyst on High-Performance and Durable Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jacs.3c12121
2,15160,"However, at intermediate temperatures (e.g., 600-650 degrees C), current CH4-SOFCs suffer from low performance and poor durability under a low steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C ratio), which is ascribed to the Ni-based anode that is of low catalytic activity and prone to coking.",Synergistic Effects of In-Situ Exsolved Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalyst on High-Performance and Durable Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jacs.3c12121
3,15160,"Herein, with the guidance of density functional theory (DFT) studies, a highly active and coking tolerant steam methane reforming (SMR) catalyst, Sm-doped CeO2-supported Ni-Ru (SCNR), was developed.",Synergistic Effects of In-Situ Exsolved Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalyst on High-Performance and Durable Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jacs.3c12121
4,15160,The synergy between Ni and Ru lowers the activation energy of the first C-H bond activation and promotes CHx decomposition.,Synergistic Effects of In-Situ Exsolved Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalyst on High-Performance and Durable Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jacs.3c12121
5,15160,"Additionally, Sm doping increases the oxygen vacancy concentration in CeO2, facilitating H2O adsorption and dissociation.",Synergistic Effects of In-Situ Exsolved Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalyst on High-Performance and Durable Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jacs.3c12121
6,15160,The SCNR can therefore simultaneously activate both CH4 and H2O molecules while oxidizing the CH* and improving coking tolerance.,Synergistic Effects of In-Situ Exsolved Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalyst on High-Performance and Durable Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jacs.3c12121
7,15160,We then applied SCNR as the CH4-SOFC anode catalytic reforming layer.,Synergistic Effects of In-Situ Exsolved Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalyst on High-Performance and Durable Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jacs.3c12121
8,15160,"A peak power density of 733 mW cm(-2) was achieved at 650 degrees C, representing a 55% improvement compared to that of pristine CH4-SOFCs (473 mW cm(-2)).",Synergistic Effects of In-Situ Exsolved Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalyst on High-Performance and Durable Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jacs.3c12121
9,15160,"Moreover, long-term durability testing, with >2000 h continuous operation, was performed under almost dry methane (5% H2O).",Synergistic Effects of In-Situ Exsolved Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalyst on High-Performance and Durable Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jacs.3c12121
10,15160,These results highlight that CH4-SOFCs with a SCNR catalytic layer can convert NG to electricity with high efficiency and resilience.,Synergistic Effects of In-Situ Exsolved Ni-Ru Bimetallic Catalyst on High-Performance and Durable Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jacs.3c12121
