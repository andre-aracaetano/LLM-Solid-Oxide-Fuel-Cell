2,7089,The anode layer was fabricated on an electrolyte supported single cell using yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3.delta as the cathode.,NiMo-ceria-zirconia-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating on gasoline surrogate,10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.09.095
3,7089,Our results indicate that the single NiMo-ceria-zirconia layer possesses a dual-functionality: firstly to internally convert complex hydrocarbons into synthesis gas with a high resistance to coking and secondly to electrochemically oxidize the synthesis gas mixture for electric power generation.,NiMo-ceria-zirconia-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating on gasoline surrogate,10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.09.095
4,7089,"Compared with the conventional Ni-YSZ anode single cell, the application of the ceria-zirconia in the anode significantly suppresses carbon deposition and improves the performance stability of the single cell.",NiMo-ceria-zirconia-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating on gasoline surrogate,10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.09.095
5,7089,"Furthermore, the addition of Mo in the Ni-ceria-zirconia appears to facilitate a higher degree of sintering for the anode, which increases the electronic conductivity and maximum power density of the single cell.",NiMo-ceria-zirconia-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating on gasoline surrogate,10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.09.095
6,7089,"Consequently, at 800 degrees C the single cell with 5 wt.% Mo in the Ni-ceria-zirconia-based anode displayed a higher maximum power density of 212 mW cm(-2) at 0.48 V and significantly enhanced performance stability than the conventional Ni-YSZ anode single cell in the isooctane/air operating mode.",NiMo-ceria-zirconia-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating on gasoline surrogate,10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.09.095
