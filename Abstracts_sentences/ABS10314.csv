1,10314,The selective control of the voltage Polarity in a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) constituting the anode and cathode arranged at the same electrolyte surface of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) or samaria-doped ceria (SDC) and which call operate in a flowing mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is discussed oil the basis of the dissociation and adsorption reactions Clue to the catalytic materials and electrode configurations.,Selective control of voltage polarity in a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell using the same catalytic electrodes with different sizes,10.1002/tee.20314
2,10314,"The open circuit voltage (OCV) of SC-SOFC showed the highest value when the H-2 : O-2 ratio Was around 2: 1, which might be equal to the mol ratio of oxygen and hydrogen based oil the reaction of water formation by the electrochemical reaction in the cell.",Selective control of voltage polarity in a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell using the same catalytic electrodes with different sizes,10.1002/tee.20314
3,10314,The voltage polarity of the cell using the Pt and LSM (La(0.7)Sr(0.3)MnO3) catalysts was the same as in the conventional SOFC such that in the Pt catalysis the anode became negative whereas in the LSM catalysis the cathode was independent of the electrode configurations.,Selective control of voltage polarity in a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell using the same catalytic electrodes with different sizes,10.1002/tee.20314
