5,11651,The electrochemical properties of both the H-LaSrCoO4-delta-BZCY and the LaSrCoO4-delta-BZCY composite cathodes ware investigated through ac impedance spectroscopy and dc polarization measurements.,Hydride reduced LaSrCoO4-δ as new cathode material for Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3 based intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.121
6,11651,"At 750 degrees C, the H-LaSrCoO4-delta-BZCY cathode exhibits a polarization resistance of 0.229 Omega cm(2), which is about one third smaller than that of the LaSrCoO4-delta-BZCY cathode.",Hydride reduced LaSrCoO4-δ as new cathode material for Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3 based intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.121

9,11651,Subsequent study on the cathodic reaction process implies that the better electrochemical properties of the H-LaSrCoO4-delta-BZCY cathode can be attributed to the higher oxygen vacancy concentration in the H-LaSrCoO4-delta lattice that enhances some key steps of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).,Hydride reduced LaSrCoO4-δ as new cathode material for Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3 based intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.121
