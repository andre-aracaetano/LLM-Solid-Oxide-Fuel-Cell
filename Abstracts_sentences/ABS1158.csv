1,1158,A highly active and stable composite anode catalyst for a H2S-air fuel cell has been developed based on the requirements of three-phase boundary (TPB) theory.,High-activity Mo-Ni-S anode catalysts for H2S-air solid oxide fuel cells,
2,1158,"The anode material is based on a metal sulfide (Mo-Ni-S) catalyst, admixed with Ag as electronic conductor and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as ionic conductor A fuel cell using a 0.2 mm thick YSZ membrane produced a maximum power density 42 mW cm(-2) at 750degreesC and over 200 mW cm(-2) at 850degreesC Dilution of H2S with CO2, which often presents in the H2S feed from an amine regenerator reduces the open cell voltage, maximum current density and maximum power density.",High-activity Mo-Ni-S anode catalysts for H2S-air solid oxide fuel cells,
