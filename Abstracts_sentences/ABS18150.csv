1,18150,A conversion coating of iron and copper was investigated with the purpose of increasing the performance of Sanergy HT as a potential SOFC interconnect material.,Copper Iron Conversion Coating for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.139
2,18150,"Samples were exposed to a simulated cathode atmosphere (air, 3 % H2O) for durations of up to 1000 h at 850 degrees C. Their performance in terms of corrosion, chromium evaporation and electrical resistance (ASR) was monitored and compared to uncoated and cobalt-coated Sanergy HT samples.",Copper Iron Conversion Coating for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.139
3,18150,The copper iron coating had no negative effects on corrosion protection and decreased chromium evaporation by about 80%.,Copper Iron Conversion Coating for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.139
