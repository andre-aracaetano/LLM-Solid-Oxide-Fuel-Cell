1,10189,"Strontium segregation in a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) electrode reacts with Cr and S in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), which can cause cell performance deterioration.",Integrated Cr and S poisoning of a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ra09239h
2,10189,"Integrated Cr and S poisoning for LSCF cathodes of SOFC was studied at 800 degrees C of 200 mA cm(-2) (cathodic) for 20 h. After polarization in Cr and S at 800 degrees C for 20 h, polarization and ohmic resistances for LSCF were 2.4 omega cm(2) and 3.4 omega cm(2), which were larger than those for LSCF electrodes after Cr deposition only and S deposition only, respectively.",Integrated Cr and S poisoning of a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ra09239h
3,10189,"The results illustrated that Cr and S deposition occurred on the surface of LSCF, which could form SrCrO4 and SrSO4.",Integrated Cr and S poisoning of a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ra09239h
4,10189,"Compared to Cr deposition only and S deposition only, integrated Cr and S deposition was unsystematic, and the degradation phenomenon of Cr and S poisoning was more severe.",Integrated Cr and S poisoning of a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ra09239h
5,10189,"The integrated Cr and S deposition of the LSCF electrodes was induced via interactions among CrO, SO2 and segregated SrO from LSCF.",Integrated Cr and S poisoning of a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ra09239h
