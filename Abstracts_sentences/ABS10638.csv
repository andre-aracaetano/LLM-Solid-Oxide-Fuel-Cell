1,10638,La2NiO4+delta (LNO) impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathodes were prepared and the effects of the impregnation on the electrical conductivity and oxygen surface exchange property were studied to reveal the enhancement mechanism of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities.,High performance La2NiO4+δ impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2022.116065
2,10638,Results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with distribution of relaxation times (DRT) deconvoluting and electrical con-ductivity relaxation (ECR) indicate that LNO impregnation into LSCF cathodes enhances the oxygen diffusion process and oxygen surface exchange property.,High performance La2NiO4+δ impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2022.116065
3,10638,The optimal ORR catalytic activity is achieved after LNO impregnation for two times on the LSCF scaffold (LNO2-LSCF).,High performance La2NiO4+δ impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2022.116065
