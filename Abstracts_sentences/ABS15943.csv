2,15943,"Yittria-ceria double-doped bismuth oxide (Bi0.75Y0.25)(1.86)Ce0.14O3 +/-, (YCSB) which showed stable ionic conductivity across the temperature range of 650-500 degrees C was used as both the second electrolyte layer and as the oxygen ion conductor phase in the cathode.",Development of a new ceria/yttria-ceria double-doped bismuth oxide bilayer electrolyte low-temperature SOFC with higher stability,10.1007/s11581-019-02838-4
3,15943,"For a cell with a 20m 10% gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) layer and a 12-13m YCSB layer, open circuit voltage (OCV) and maximum power density (MPD) of the cell at 650 degrees C reached 0.833V and 760mW/cm(2), respectively.",Development of a new ceria/yttria-ceria double-doped bismuth oxide bilayer electrolyte low-temperature SOFC with higher stability,10.1007/s11581-019-02838-4
4,15943,"OCV stability of this bilayer was measured for 50h at 625 and 600 degrees C (100h in total), and exceptional stability of OCV with zero degradation was observed.",Development of a new ceria/yttria-ceria double-doped bismuth oxide bilayer electrolyte low-temperature SOFC with higher stability,10.1007/s11581-019-02838-4
5,15943,"In comparison, the cell with 10GDC/erbium-stabilized bismuth oxide (ESB) bilayer electrolyte showed a very rapid degradation of OCV at 600 degrees C (average hourly degradation rate of -0.55%/h).",Development of a new ceria/yttria-ceria double-doped bismuth oxide bilayer electrolyte low-temperature SOFC with higher stability,10.1007/s11581-019-02838-4
6,15943,"In addition to the exceptional OCV stability, this new bilayer electrolyte exhibited no ohmic area-specific resistance (ASR) degradation at 600 and 625 degrees C.",Development of a new ceria/yttria-ceria double-doped bismuth oxide bilayer electrolyte low-temperature SOFC with higher stability,10.1007/s11581-019-02838-4
