1,17312,We show that Sn/Ni alloy anode electrocatalysts (0.5-1 wt % nominal loading of Sn with respect to Ni) exhibit improved tolerance to carbon-induced deactivation in the internal utilization of hydrocarbon fuels on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) compared to conventional monometallic Ni electrocatalysts.,Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Hydrocarbon Fuels on SOFCs: Improved Carbon Tolerance of Ni Alloy Anodes,10.1149/1.3208060
2,17312,The Sn/Ni electrocatalysts were tested in the direct electrochemical oxidation of methane and isooctane.,Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Hydrocarbon Fuels on SOFCs: Improved Carbon Tolerance of Ni Alloy Anodes,10.1149/1.3208060
3,17312,It was observed that the electrochemical activity and electronic conductivity of Ni were not compromised significantly by introduction of Sn.,Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Hydrocarbon Fuels on SOFCs: Improved Carbon Tolerance of Ni Alloy Anodes,10.1149/1.3208060
4,17312,"We postulate that the improved carbon tolerance of Sn/Ni compared to monometallic Ni electrocatalysts is due to the formation of Sn/Ni surface alloys, which, unlike monometallic Ni, preferentially oxidize carbon atoms and fragments, removing these from the surface of the electrocatalyst rather than forming carbon-carbon bonds.",Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Hydrocarbon Fuels on SOFCs: Improved Carbon Tolerance of Ni Alloy Anodes,10.1149/1.3208060
