7,4098,"Most interestingly, LSV undergoes continuous activation during the course of operation, instead of being poisoned, when exposed to gases containing 50 ppm H2S. LSV-based reversible SOCs under alternating electrolyser and fuel cell operations have been demonstrated with negligible performance degradation over 500 h.",Robust solid oxide cells for alternate power generation and carbon conversion,10.1039/c1ra00355k
