1,4102,"Promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical for commercialization of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), where Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (SFM) is a promising cathode by working as a mixed ionic and electronic conductor.",In3+-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ cathode with improved performance for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s12274-023-6338-y
2,4102,"In this work, doping of In3+ greatly increases the oxygen vacancy concentration and the content of adsorbed oxygen species in Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5-xInxO6-delta (SFMInx), and thus effectively promotes the ORR performance.",In3+-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ cathode with improved performance for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s12274-023-6338-y
3,4102,"As a typical example, SFMIn0.1 reduces the polarization resistance (R-p) from 0.089 to 0.046 Qcm(2) at 800 degrees C, which is superior to those doped with other metal elements.",In3+-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ cathode with improved performance for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s12274-023-6338-y
4,4102,"In addition, SFMIn0.1 increases the peak power density from 0.92 to 1.47 Wcm(-2) at 800 degrees C with humidified H-2 as the fuel, indicating that In3+ doping at the Mo site can effectively improve the performance of SOFC cathode material.",In3+-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ cathode with improved performance for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s12274-023-6338-y
