5,1475,"It is found that among the studied parameters, the inner cell tube diameter has the strongest effect on fuel cell efficiency.",Dynamic modelling and sensitivity analysis of a tubular SOFC fuelled with NH3 as a possible replacement for H2,10.1016/j.cherd.2012.03.004
6,1475,"On the other hand, the influence of cathodic porosity on fuel cell performance and transient response is higher than that of the anodic porosity.",Dynamic modelling and sensitivity analysis of a tubular SOFC fuelled with NH3 as a possible replacement for H2,10.1016/j.cherd.2012.03.004
7,1475,The transient response with different sizes of micro and macro-structures is studied and it is observed that changing the fuel cell length has the most effect.,Dynamic modelling and sensitivity analysis of a tubular SOFC fuelled with NH3 as a possible replacement for H2,10.1016/j.cherd.2012.03.004
8,1475,Also NH3-SOFC is compared with H-2-SOFC and it is found that the performance of the former is close to that of the latter thus signifying that ammonia is a suitable fuel for substituting in place of hydrogen.,Dynamic modelling and sensitivity analysis of a tubular SOFC fuelled with NH3 as a possible replacement for H2,10.1016/j.cherd.2012.03.004
