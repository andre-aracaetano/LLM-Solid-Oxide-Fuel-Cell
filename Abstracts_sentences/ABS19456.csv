1,19456,The effects of replacing iron with cobalt and employing either Pechini or spray pyrolysis synthesis routes have been studied for the perovskite system SrFe0.9-xCoxSb0.1O3-delta (x = 0; 0.45; 0.9) to optimise sustainable air electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide cells.,"Optimisation of electrochemical performance of Sr(Fe,Sb)O3-δ air electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide cells through spray-pyrolysis processing",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234243
2,19456,"The electrochemical performance of Pechini-prepared compositions improves with increasing cobalt content, attributable to higher electronic conductivity and oxygen-vacancy concentration, and lower processing temperature from 1300 degrees C, for SrFe0.9Sb0.1O3-delta, to 1200 and 1100 degrees C, for SrFe0.45Co0.45Sb0.1O3-delta and SrCo0.9Sb0.1O3-delta, respectively, with SrCo0.9Sb0.1O3-delta exhibiting an area specific resistance (ASR) of 0.084 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C.","Optimisation of electrochemical performance of Sr(Fe,Sb)O3-δ air electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide cells through spray-pyrolysis processing",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234243
3,19456,"The electrochemical stability of Fe-containing Pechini-based compositions is impaired, most likely due to a higher processing temperature.","Optimisation of electrochemical performance of Sr(Fe,Sb)O3-δ air electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide cells through spray-pyrolysis processing",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234243
4,19456,"However, the very low processing temperature of 800 degrees C for spray-pyrolysed electrodes produces similar electrochemical performances for Co-containing and Co-free compositions (ASR approximate to 0.065 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C for SrFe0.9Sb0.1O3-delta) and high electrochemical stability with practically unaltered electrode polarisation resistance on thermal cycling.","Optimisation of electrochemical performance of Sr(Fe,Sb)O3-δ air electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide cells through spray-pyrolysis processing",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234243
