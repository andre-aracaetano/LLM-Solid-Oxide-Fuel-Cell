2,6975,"We have prepared three different stoichiometries, Sr1-xCexTiO3 +/-delta, Sr1-1.5xCexTiO3 +/-delta and Sr1-2xCexTiO3 +/-delta (0.05<",Structural properties of Ce-doped strontium titanate for fuel cell applications,10.1039/c0jm03680c
3,6975,x < 0.15) to examine structural properties when prepared in air.,Structural properties of Ce-doped strontium titanate for fuel cell applications,10.1039/c0jm03680c
4,6975,"We have found that no matter what the starting stoichiometry, Sr1-1.5xCexTiO3 +/-delta would always preferentially form.",Structural properties of Ce-doped strontium titanate for fuel cell applications,10.1039/c0jm03680c
5,6975,This agrees with the current defect model for donor-doped strontium titanate.,Structural properties of Ce-doped strontium titanate for fuel cell applications,10.1039/c0jm03680c
6,6975,"When examined using X-ray diffraction the samples appeared to be cubic, however, using neutron diffraction we found there was a slight distortion of the perovskite structure.",Structural properties of Ce-doped strontium titanate for fuel cell applications,10.1039/c0jm03680c
7,6975,From our results it would appear this distortion was tetragonal but the resolution of our data does not allow us to conclusively differentiate this from the closely related rhombohedral symmetry.,Structural properties of Ce-doped strontium titanate for fuel cell applications,10.1039/c0jm03680c
