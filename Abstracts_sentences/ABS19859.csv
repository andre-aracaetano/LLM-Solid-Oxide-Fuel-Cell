1,19859,Operation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with bio-syngas from the gasification of biomass is a promising approach to highly efficient and sustainable power generation.,Operation of SOFC Short-Stacks with Simulated Bio-Syngas: Influence of Model Tars Naphthalene and Phenol,10.1149/1945-7111/ababd6
2,19859,"At the same time, the coupling is challenging as several biogenic impurities in the bio-syngas have a negative effect on the SOFC.",Operation of SOFC Short-Stacks with Simulated Bio-Syngas: Influence of Model Tars Naphthalene and Phenol,10.1149/1945-7111/ababd6
3,19859,For this paper the impacts of the impurities naphthalene and phenol on SOFC short-stacks were investigated experimentally for the first time.,Operation of SOFC Short-Stacks with Simulated Bio-Syngas: Influence of Model Tars Naphthalene and Phenol,10.1149/1945-7111/ababd6
4,19859,The cell in the stacks were anode-supported SOFCs with Ni/YSZ anode.,Operation of SOFC Short-Stacks with Simulated Bio-Syngas: Influence of Model Tars Naphthalene and Phenol,10.1149/1945-7111/ababd6
5,19859,"The experiments were performed at 700 degrees C under load with simulated bio-syngas consisting of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor.",Operation of SOFC Short-Stacks with Simulated Bio-Syngas: Influence of Model Tars Naphthalene and Phenol,10.1149/1945-7111/ababd6
6,19859,2 g Nm(-3)of naphthalene (350 ppm) caused a pronounced voltage drop and an increase in cell temperature.,Operation of SOFC Short-Stacks with Simulated Bio-Syngas: Influence of Model Tars Naphthalene and Phenol,10.1149/1945-7111/ababd6
7,19859,"By analysing the anode off-gas and recording of I-V-curves, it could be shown that naphthalene blocked the electrochemical hydrogen oxidation as well as the reforming of methane and the shift reaction of carbon monoxide.",Operation of SOFC Short-Stacks with Simulated Bio-Syngas: Influence of Model Tars Naphthalene and Phenol,10.1149/1945-7111/ababd6
8,19859,"Up to 8 g Nm(-3)of phenol (1900 ppm), on the other hand, led to carbon deposition and irreversibly damaged the structure of the anode substrate by metal dusting.",Operation of SOFC Short-Stacks with Simulated Bio-Syngas: Influence of Model Tars Naphthalene and Phenol,10.1149/1945-7111/ababd6
9,19859,This form of degradation was not visible in the electrochemical data during operation.,Operation of SOFC Short-Stacks with Simulated Bio-Syngas: Influence of Model Tars Naphthalene and Phenol,10.1149/1945-7111/ababd6
