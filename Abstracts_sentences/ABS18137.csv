1,18137,"The Sr1 - x Na (x) SiO3 - x/2 samples (SNS, x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.45) were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at a lower sintering temperature of 850 A degrees C for a shorter holding time of 5 min.",Microstructure and electrical properties of Sr1-x Na x SiO3-x/2 ceramics prepared by SPS process,10.1007/s11581-016-1737-7
2,18137,"All SNS samples by SPS are composed of single monoclinic SrSiO3 phase, and the grain sizes are in the range of 1.9 +/- 0.5 mu m.",Microstructure and electrical properties of Sr1-x Na x SiO3-x/2 ceramics prepared by SPS process,10.1007/s11581-016-1737-7
3,18137,The measurement results of the electrical properties show that the conductivities of SPS samples are one order of magnitude higher than those of the samples by traditional sintering method.,Microstructure and electrical properties of Sr1-x Na x SiO3-x/2 ceramics prepared by SPS process,10.1007/s11581-016-1737-7
4,18137,"The ion transference numbers of SNS samples by SPS are all higher than 0.99 in the temperature range of 500 similar to 650 A degrees C, which demonstrates that the SNS has met the requirements as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes and the SPS process is a promising candidate for preparations of SNS electrolytes.",Microstructure and electrical properties of Sr1-x Na x SiO3-x/2 ceramics prepared by SPS process,10.1007/s11581-016-1737-7
