2,12582,The modeling results were consistent with experimental data in literature.,Electrochemical modeling of ammonia-fed solid oxide fuel cells based on proton conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.018
3,12582,"It is found that there is little difference in working voltage and power density between the NH3-fed and the H-2-fed SCFC-H with an electrolyte-support configuration due to an extremely high ohmic overpotential in the SOFC-H. With an anode-supported configuration, especially when a thin film electrolyte is used, the H-2-fed SCFC-H shows significantly higher voltage and power density than the NH3-fed SCFC-H due to the significant difference in concentration overpotentials.",Electrochemical modeling of ammonia-fed solid oxide fuel cells based on proton conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.018
4,12582,"The anode concentration overpotential of the NH3-fed SOFC-H is found much higher than the H-2-fed SCFC-H, as the presence of N-2 gas dilutes the H-2 concentration and slows down the transport of H-2.",Electrochemical modeling of ammonia-fed solid oxide fuel cells based on proton conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.018
5,12582,"More importantly, the cathode concentration overpotential is found very significant despite of the thin cathode used in the anode-supported configuration.",Electrochemical modeling of ammonia-fed solid oxide fuel cells based on proton conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.018
6,12582,"In the SOFC-H, H2O is produced in the cathode, which enables complete fuel utilization on one hand, but dilutes the concentration of O-2 and impedes the diffusion of O-2 to the reaction sites on the other hand.",Electrochemical modeling of ammonia-fed solid oxide fuel cells based on proton conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.018
7,12582,"Thus, the cathode concentration overpotential is the limiting factor for the H-2-fed SOFC-H and an important voltage loss in the NH3-fed SCFC-H. How to reduce the concentration overpotentials at both electrodes is identified crucial to develop high performance SCFC-H.
