1,11485,"Preparation of LaNi1-xFexO3, which is one of the candidate materials of solid oxide fuel cell cathode, current collecting layer and interconnect coating was examined with Pechini method and solid state reaction method.",Conductivity and sintering property of LaNi1-xFexO3 ceramics prepared by Pechini method,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.08.004
2,11485,"Single phase LaNi1-xFexO3 with large Ni content has successfully been prepared by low temperature sintering as 750 degrees C with Pechini method, whereas large amount of raw materials has remained with solid state reaction method by sintering at the same temperature.",Conductivity and sintering property of LaNi1-xFexO3 ceramics prepared by Pechini method,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.08.004
3,11485,It can be ascribed to more homogenous cation distribution in raw powder material prior to sintering with Pechini method.,Conductivity and sintering property of LaNi1-xFexO3 ceramics prepared by Pechini method,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.08.004
4,11485,"It has also been revealed that LaNi1-xFexO3 with x lower than 0.3 is thermodynamically unstable in air above 1000 degrees C. LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 showed superior property as cathode material with high electrical conductivity, thermodynamic stability and appropriate sintering property.",Conductivity and sintering property of LaNi1-xFexO3 ceramics prepared by Pechini method,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.08.004
