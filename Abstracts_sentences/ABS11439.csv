1,11439,"An electrolyte/anode hollow fibre (HF) for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), i.e. a cerium-gadolinium oxide (CGO)/Ni-CGO dual-layer HF, has been developed in this study via a novel single-step co-extrusion and co-sintering technique, and followed by a reduction process.",Single-step fabrication and characterisations of electrolyte/anode dual-layer hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2010.01.050
2,11439,"The microstructure of the developed dual-layer HFs, which are co-sintered at 1450-1550 degrees C, can be characterised by an electrolyte outer layer of approximately 80 mu m supported by an anode inner layer of around 220 mu m. Benefiting from the advantages of this fabrication technique, great adhesion between the anode layer and the electrolyte layer can be achieved without any crack formation during the co-sintering.",Single-step fabrication and characterisations of electrolyte/anode dual-layer hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2010.01.050
3,11439,"Moreover, no elemental inter-diffusion between layers, such as Ni, was observed even at 1550 degrees C. With the increasing co-sintering temperature, mechanical strength of the developed dual-layer HF, gas-tightness of the electrolyte layer and electrical conductivity of the anode layer are increased.",Single-step fabrication and characterisations of electrolyte/anode dual-layer hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2010.01.050
4,11439,"However, gas permeability through the anode layer decreases dramatically with the increasing temperature, which may greatly reduce the efficiency of the related micro-tubular SOFC.",Single-step fabrication and characterisations of electrolyte/anode dual-layer hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2010.01.050
5,11439,"According to the investigations on the effects of co-sintering temperature on the mechanical, structural and electrical conducting properties of the dual-layer HFs, a co-sintering temperature at 1500 degrees C is recommended for the construction of the electrolyte/anode half-cell for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Single-step fabrication and characterisations of electrolyte/anode dual-layer hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2010.01.050
