1,227,Uncovering microstructure evolution mechanisms that accompany the long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells is a fundamental challenge in designing a more durable energy system for the future.,Microstructure evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell anodes characterized by persistent homology,10.1016/j.egyai.2023.100256
2,227,"To date, the study of fuel cell stack degradation has focused mainly on electrochemical performance and, more rarely, on averaged microstructural parameters.",Microstructure evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell anodes characterized by persistent homology,10.1016/j.egyai.2023.100256
3,227,Here we show an alternative approach in which an evolution of three-dimensional microstructural features is studied using electron tomography coupled with topological data analysis.,Microstructure evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell anodes characterized by persistent homology,10.1016/j.egyai.2023.100256
4,227,The latter produces persistent diagrams of microstructure before and after long-term operation of electrodes.,Microstructure evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell anodes characterized by persistent homology,10.1016/j.egyai.2023.100256
5,227,"Those diagrams unveil a new insight into the degradation process of three involved phases: Nickel, pores, and yttrium-stabilized zirconium.",Microstructure evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell anodes characterized by persistent homology,10.1016/j.egyai.2023.100256
