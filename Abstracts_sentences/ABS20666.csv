2,20666,St is found that PrGaO3 doped with Sr (or Ca) for the Pr site and Mg for the Ga site exhibits the high oxide ion conduction which was slightly less than that measured for doubly doped La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O-3 (LSGM).,Oxide ion conductivity in doubly doped PrGaO3 perovskite-type oxide,10.1149/1.1391820
3,20666,Doping alkaline earth cations for the Pr site and Mg for the Ga site of the PrGaO3 increased its oxide ion conductivity.,Oxide ion conductivity in doubly doped PrGaO3 perovskite-type oxide,10.1149/1.1391820
4,20666,"For temperatures above 1073 K, the highest oxide ion conductivity was obtained for the composition of Pr0.93Sr0.07Ga0.85Mg0.15O3 (PSGM).",Oxide ion conductivity in doubly doped PrGaO3 perovskite-type oxide,10.1149/1.1391820
5,20666,"On the other hand, the apparent activation energy of Pr0.93C0.07Ga0.85Mg0.15O3 (PCGM) was as low as 0.65 eV.",Oxide ion conductivity in doubly doped PrGaO3 perovskite-type oxide,10.1149/1.1391820
6,20666,"Therefore, the electrical conductivity of PCGM was higher than that of LSGM at temperatures below 873 K.",Oxide ion conductivity in doubly doped PrGaO3 perovskite-type oxide,10.1149/1.1391820
7,20666,"Although hole conduction was observed, electron conductivity of the doubly doped PrGaO3 was almost independent of the oxygen partial pressure from p(O2) = 1 to 10(-21) atm.",Oxide ion conductivity in doubly doped PrGaO3 perovskite-type oxide,10.1149/1.1391820
8,20666,It is clear that doped PrGaO3 is a new fast oxide ion conductor over a wide range of oxygen partial pressures.,Oxide ion conductivity in doubly doped PrGaO3 perovskite-type oxide,10.1149/1.1391820
9,20666,"On the other hand, a nonlinearity was observed on the Arrhenius plot of electrical conductivity for Ca-doped PrGaO3 and the high temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement suggested that it was due to phase transition from orthorhombic to rhombohedral or tetragonal, which may decrease the mobility of oxide ions.",Oxide ion conductivity in doubly doped PrGaO3 perovskite-type oxide,10.1149/1.1391820
10,20666,Application of PSGM and PCGM for an electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cell was also investigated in order to cross-check the findings of the fast oxide ion conductivity.,Oxide ion conductivity in doubly doped PrGaO3 perovskite-type oxide,10.1149/1.1391820
11,20666,This study revealed that PSGM and PCGM were a new family of fast oxide ion conductors.,Oxide ion conductivity in doubly doped PrGaO3 perovskite-type oxide,10.1149/1.1391820
