2,4753,"Open circuit voltages (OCV) as a function of temperature for pure and W-doped samples are reported and these data suggest that La(2)Mo(0.6)W(1.4)O(9) performs best in the temperature range 550-650 degrees C. where the stability of the sample under operating conditions appears to be good and the OCV values close to 1 V. Electrochemical measurements for an electrolyte-based cell were taken over the temperature range 550-650 degrees C and found to be, as expected, strongly dependent on the electrolyte thickness.",Electrode stability and electrochemical performance of Lamox electrolytes under fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.08.002
3,4753,"These results support the claim that W-doped Lamox can be used as an electrolyte material at temperatures close to 650 degrees C; with a suitable choice of electrode materials and a change in the fuel cell geometry from electrolytesupported to electrode-supported so that the electrolyte thickness can be reduced considerably, Lamoxbased fuel cells are expected to produce useful power densities.",Electrode stability and electrochemical performance of Lamox electrolytes under fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.08.002
