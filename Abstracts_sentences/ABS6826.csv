1,6826,"In this study, a carbon-air battery based on a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is demonstrated to continuously generate electric power through a direct oxidation of the biomass wastes.",Continuous conversion of biomass wastes in a La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ based carbon-air battery,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.105
2,6826,"Due to inevitable poisoning gases such as H2S, SO2, CO2 in wastes, more stable La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) instead of Ni is used as the anode material for SOFC.",Continuous conversion of biomass wastes in a La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ based carbon-air battery,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.105
3,6826,"Nano - and/or micro particles of LSCM are prepared onto a 3D porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) scaffold via an infiltration process, in which YSZ backbone provides rich pathways for O2- which can remedy the major defect of the LSCM, negligible O2- conductivity, and thus expanding the triple-phase boundary (TPB) to the whole anode.",Continuous conversion of biomass wastes in a La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ based carbon-air battery,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.105
4,6826,"When falling leaves are tucked into the anode chamber, an attractive performance of 330 mW cm(-2) can be reached for the battery at 800 degrees C, which is among the best in the published open literature.",Continuous conversion of biomass wastes in a La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ based carbon-air battery,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.105
