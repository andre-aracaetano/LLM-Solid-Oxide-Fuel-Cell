1,21139,"In this work, to simultaneously meet the requirements of good electrochemical performance and redox stability, perovskite oxide Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.875Mo0.125O3-delta (PSFM) material has been developed as a novel redox-stable electrode for symmetrical cell application.",Preparation and characterization of a redox-stable Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.875Mo0.125O3-δ material as a novel symmetrical electrode for solid oxide cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.206
2,21139,"The experimental results obtained by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy show that metallic Fe nanoparticles will exsolve from the parent oxide PSFM through in-situ exsolution method when treating in 97% H-2-3% H2O atmosphere, and then completely re-incorporate into the parent oxide in air, demonstrating excellent redox stability for PSFM material.",Preparation and characterization of a redox-stable Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.875Mo0.125O3-δ material as a novel symmetrical electrode for solid oxide cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.206
3,21139,"In addition, the redox stability in electrochemical performance is also studied by recording the electrochemical impedance spectra and distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis.",Preparation and characterization of a redox-stable Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.875Mo0.125O3-δ material as a novel symmetrical electrode for solid oxide cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.206
4,21139,"It is demonstrated that a constant electrode polarization resistance (R-P) of similar to 0.60 Omega cm(2) is achieved for the symmetrical cell with PSFM electrode in air at 800 degrees C after activation, and R-P value is significantly increased to 1.59 Omega cm(2) when exposing the symmetrical cell to 97% H-2-3% H2O, which is possibly ascribed to the significantly decreased electrical conductivity form 71.0 Scm(-1) in air to 3.8 Scm(-1) in 97% H-2-3% H2O.",Preparation and characterization of a redox-stable Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.875Mo0.125O3-δ material as a novel symmetrical electrode for solid oxide cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.206
5,21139,"Moreover, it is shown that R-P value recorded in air is effectively decreased to similar to 0.33 Omega cm(2), and keeps constant during the following 200-h redox stability testing, while R-P value measured in 97% H-2-3%",Preparation and characterization of a redox-stable Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.875Mo0.125O3-δ material as a novel symmetrical electrode for solid oxide cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.206
6,21139,"H2O atmosphere is gradually decreased to 0.82 Omega cm(2), which can be explained by the enhanced electro-catalytic properties of PSFM electrode induced by the gradually exsolved Fe nanocatalysts from parent PSFM electrode.",Preparation and characterization of a redox-stable Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.875Mo0.125O3-δ material as a novel symmetrical electrode for solid oxide cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.206
7,21139,"At the same time, DRT analysis demonstrates that the sub-electrode process including oxygen/hydrogen adsorption, dissociation ionization and surface diffusion to triple phase boundaries occurred at the electrode/electrolyte interfacial is the predominant rate-limiting step, which can be effectively accelerated by surface modification and exsolved Fe nanoparticles.",Preparation and characterization of a redox-stable Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.875Mo0.125O3-δ material as a novel symmetrical electrode for solid oxide cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.206
8,21139,These results indicate that PSFM is a promising symmetrical electrode material for symmetrical cell application because of its good electrochemical performance and excellent long-term redox stability.,Preparation and characterization of a redox-stable Pr0.4Sr0.6Fe0.875Mo0.125O3-δ material as a novel symmetrical electrode for solid oxide cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.206
