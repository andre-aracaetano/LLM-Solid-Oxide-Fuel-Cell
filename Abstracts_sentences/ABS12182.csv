1,12182,The novelty in this article is to utilize the intercooling heat to augment the extra power output through ORC along with the reduction of work required by air compressor.,Thermodynamic assessment of a novel SOFC and intercooled GT integration with ORC: Energy and exergy analysis,10.1016/j.tsep.2022.101411
2,12182,"A parametric analysis has been performed on the integrated system having solid oxide fuel cell, gas turbine, and organic Rankine cycle to assess the implication of parameters such as fuel utilization factor, current density, turbine inlet temperature, and compression ratio on the integrated system through energy and exergy analysis.",Thermodynamic assessment of a novel SOFC and intercooled GT integration with ORC: Energy and exergy analysis,10.1016/j.tsep.2022.101411
3,12182,"The obtained results shows that the SOFC-GT-ORC system energetic and exergetic efficiency increases from 41.85 % to 47.34 % and 51.36 % to 56.85 %, respectively, at 6 compression ratio, 0.75 fuel utilization factors, and 0.4 A/cm2 current density as the intercooler is incorporated in the air compressor and heat utilized in the ORC.",Thermodynamic assessment of a novel SOFC and intercooled GT integration with ORC: Energy and exergy analysis,10.1016/j.tsep.2022.101411
4,12182,"Therefore, from this study authors have found that the adoption of the intercooler is advantageous to the combined system.",Thermodynamic assessment of a novel SOFC and intercooled GT integration with ORC: Energy and exergy analysis,10.1016/j.tsep.2022.101411
