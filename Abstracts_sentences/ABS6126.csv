1,6126,Three different test geometries were used to apply shear loading to fracture glass-to-metal joints typical of seals intended for use in planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs): asymmetric compression; symmetric compression; and four-point asymmetric bending.,Measurement of Mechanical Strength of Glass-to-Metal Joints,10.1002/fuce.201500028
2,6126,The measured apparent shear strengths were found to differ by an order of magnitude depending on the test configuration employed.,Measurement of Mechanical Strength of Glass-to-Metal Joints,10.1002/fuce.201500028
3,6126,"In particular, the apparent shear strength measured in the asymmetric compression test was very low.",Measurement of Mechanical Strength of Glass-to-Metal Joints,10.1002/fuce.201500028
4,6126,"Conversely, the highest apparent shear strengths were measured using the symmetric compression test and the four-point asymmetric bend test gave an intermediate result.",Measurement of Mechanical Strength of Glass-to-Metal Joints,10.1002/fuce.201500028
5,6126,"It is shown, by finite element modelling, that these differences are caused by differences in the normal stresses transverse to the joint.",Measurement of Mechanical Strength of Glass-to-Metal Joints,10.1002/fuce.201500028
6,6126,The locus of failure was always along the glass/metal interface in all test geometries.,Measurement of Mechanical Strength of Glass-to-Metal Joints,10.1002/fuce.201500028
7,6126,It is concluded that mechanical test procedures used to characterize glass-ceramic seals in SOFC stacks need to be selected and interpreted with great care.,Measurement of Mechanical Strength of Glass-to-Metal Joints,10.1002/fuce.201500028
