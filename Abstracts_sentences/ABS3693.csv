1,3693,A micro thin-film solid oxide fuel cell (TFSOFC) has been designed based on thin-film deposition and microlithographic processes.,Thin-film heterostructure solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.1697623
2,3693,The TFSOFC is composed of a thin-film electrolyte grown on a nickel foil substrate and a thin-film cathode deposited on the electrolyte.,Thin-film heterostructure solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.1697623
3,3693,The Ni foil substrate is then processed into a porous anode by photolithographic patterning and etching to develop pores for gas transport into the fuel cell.,Thin-film heterostructure solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.1697623
4,3693,"A La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (LSCO) thin-film cathode is then deposited on the electrolyte, and a porous NiO-YSZ cermet layer is added to the anode to improve the electrode performance.",Thin-film heterostructure solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.1697623
5,3693,"The TFSOFC has stably operated in a temperature ranges as low as 480-570 degreesC, significantly lower than bulk SOFC's, and has yielded a maximum output power density of similar to110 mW/cm(2) in that temperature range.",Thin-film heterostructure solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.1697623
