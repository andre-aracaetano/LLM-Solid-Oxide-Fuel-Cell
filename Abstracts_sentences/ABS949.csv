1,949,"This paper presents exergy analysis of a conceptualized combined cogeneration plant that employs pressurized oxygen blown coal gasifier and high-temperature, high-pressure solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) in the topping cycle and a bottoming steam cogeneration cycle.",Exergy analysis of a cogeneration plant using coal gasification and solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/er.1171
2,949,Useful heat is supplied by the pass-out steam from the steam turbine and also by the steam raised separately in an evaporator placed in the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).,Exergy analysis of a cogeneration plant using coal gasification and solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/er.1171
3,949,"Exergy analysis shows that major part of plant exergy destruction takes place in gasifier and SOFC while considerable losses are also attributed to gas cooler, combustion chamber and HRSG.",Exergy analysis of a cogeneration plant using coal gasification and solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/er.1171
4,949,Exergy losses are found to decrease with increasing pressure ratio across the gas turbine for all of these components except the gas cooler.,Exergy analysis of a cogeneration plant using coal gasification and solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/er.1171
