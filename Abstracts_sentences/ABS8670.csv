1,8670,"Materials displaying high oxide-ion conductivity have attracted considerable interest due to technological applications in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), oxygen sensors and separation membranes.","Developing apatites for solid oxide fuel cells: insight into structural, transport and doping properties",10.1039/b704426g
2,8670,"This has driven research into the identification of new classes of oxide-ion conductors, and in this review, work on the recently discovered apatite-type silicate/germanate oxide-ion conductors is presented.","Developing apatites for solid oxide fuel cells: insight into structural, transport and doping properties",10.1039/b704426g
3,8670,"In contrast to the traditional perovskite- and fluorite-based oxide-ion conductors, in which conduction proceeds via oxygen vacancies, the research on these apatite systems suggests that the conductivity involves interstitial oxide-ions.","Developing apatites for solid oxide fuel cells: insight into structural, transport and doping properties",10.1039/b704426g
4,8670,"In addition, the flexibility of the tetrahedral (Si/GeO4) framework also plays a crucial role in facilitating oxide-ion migration.","Developing apatites for solid oxide fuel cells: insight into structural, transport and doping properties",10.1039/b704426g
5,8670,"Detailed doping studies have shown that the apatite structure is able to accommodate a large range of dopants (in terms of both size and charge state), and the influence of these dopants on the conductivity is discussed.","Developing apatites for solid oxide fuel cells: insight into structural, transport and doping properties",10.1039/b704426g
