1,2984,A portable commercial solid-oxide fuel cell that consisted of 56 stacked cells and used an indirect internal reforming strategy with a rhodium catalyst on an yttria-stabilized zirconia structure for its reformer and a nickel anode on an yttria-stabilized zirconia structure electrolyte was tested with propane fuel intentionally blended with 0 to 15 ppmv H2S.,"Understanding hydrogen sulfide impact on a portable, commercial, propane-powered solid-oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118163
2,2984,The voltages of cell pairs and stack were recorded during 7-h poison and recovery tests.,"Understanding hydrogen sulfide impact on a portable, commercial, propane-powered solid-oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118163
3,2984,"Results indicated that with higher H2S concentrations, the rate of stack voltage decrease could vary from 181.4 mV/h at 3 ppmv to 432.0 mV/h at 15 ppmv.","Understanding hydrogen sulfide impact on a portable, commercial, propane-powered solid-oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118163
