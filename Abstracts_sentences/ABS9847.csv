1,9847,Electron microscopy characterization across the cathode-electrolyte interface of two different types of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC) is performed to understand the origin of the cell performance disparity.,Cathode-Electrolyte Interfaces with CGO Barrier Layers in SOFC,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03763.x
2,9847,"One IT-SOFC cell had a sprayed-cosintered Ce(0.90)Gd(0.01)O(1.95) (CGO10) barrier layer, the other had a barrier layer deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) CGO10.",Cathode-Electrolyte Interfaces with CGO Barrier Layers in SOFC,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03763.x
3,9847,"Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) investigations conclude that the major source of the cell performance difference is attributed to CGO-YSZ interdiffusion in the sprayed-cosintered barrier layer.",Cathode-Electrolyte Interfaces with CGO Barrier Layers in SOFC,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03763.x
4,9847,"From TEM and EBSD work, a dense CGO10 PLD layer is found to be deposited epitaxially on the 8YSZ electrolyte substrate-permitting a small amount of SrZrO(3) formation and minimizing CGO-YSZ interdiffusion.",Cathode-Electrolyte Interfaces with CGO Barrier Layers in SOFC,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03763.x
