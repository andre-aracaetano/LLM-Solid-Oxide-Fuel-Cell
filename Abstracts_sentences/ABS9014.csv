1,9014,"Cobalt-free perovskite oxides, BaFeO3-delta and BaM0.05Fe0.95O3-delta (M = Ti, Zr and Ce), were prepared as the cathode of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Structure and electrochemical properties of cobalt-free perovskite cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.05.086
2,9014,"High temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) results show that BaFeO3-delta and BaM0.05Fe0.95O3-delta (BTF) have a complex phase composition, and the phase composition changes with temperature.",Structure and electrochemical properties of cobalt-free perovskite cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.05.086
3,9014,"BaM0.05Fe0.95O3-delta (BZF) has a cubic perovskite structure above 400 degrees C, while BaM0.05Fe0.95O3-delta (BCF) has a cubic perovskite structure from room temperature (25 degrees C) to 1000 degrees C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O-2-TPD) analysis reveal that the phase transition affects the oxygen-release properties of these materials.",Structure and electrochemical properties of cobalt-free perovskite cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.05.086
