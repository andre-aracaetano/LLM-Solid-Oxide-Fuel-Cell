1,11608,A new family of perovskite-based materials La2Sr4Ti6-xScxO19-z has been investigated in the search of alternative anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Sc-substituted oxygen excess titanates as fuel electrodes for SOFCs,10.1149/1.1921747
2,11608,"Although these phases show a pseudocubic unit cell (a approximate to 3.91 angstrom) by X-ray diffraction, the structure is far more complex with extra oxygen beyond the ABO(3) perovskite stoichiometry accommodated in local defects randomly distributed within a perovskite framework.",Sc-substituted oxygen excess titanates as fuel electrodes for SOFCs,10.1149/1.1921747
3,11608,"The presence of Sc has a negative effect on the electronic conductivity, which gradually decreases with increasing x, although the oxidation and reduction kinetics is improved.",Sc-substituted oxygen excess titanates as fuel electrodes for SOFCs,10.1149/1.1921747
4,11608,"The fuel cell performance, however, is improved in comparison to reported results for the nonsubstituted phases at low levels of substitution.",Sc-substituted oxygen excess titanates as fuel electrodes for SOFCs,10.1149/1.1921747
5,11608,"Anodic polarization overpotentials of 0.25 and 0.30 V at 500 mA cm(-2) at 900 degrees C under wet H-2 and CH4, respectively, were obtained for the x=0.3 composition.",Sc-substituted oxygen excess titanates as fuel electrodes for SOFCs,10.1149/1.1921747
6,11608,"The relatively low overpotential, especially under methane, indicates this to be a promising approach toward anode development.",Sc-substituted oxygen excess titanates as fuel electrodes for SOFCs,10.1149/1.1921747
