1,9252,A liquid tin anode solid oxide fuel cell is constructed and investigated under different operating conditions.,"Performance evaluation of a liquid tin anode solid oxide fuel cell operating under hydrogen, argon and coal",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.138
2,9252,Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is used to reflect the effect of fuel feed as the EIS spectra changes significantly on switching the fuel from argon to hydrogen.,"Performance evaluation of a liquid tin anode solid oxide fuel cell operating under hydrogen, argon and coal",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.138
3,9252,"A cathode symmetric cell is used to separate the impedance from the two electrodes, and the results indicate that a major contribution to the charge-transfer and mass-transfer impedance arises from the anode.","Performance evaluation of a liquid tin anode solid oxide fuel cell operating under hydrogen, argon and coal",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.138
4,9252,The OCP of 0.841 V for the cell operating under argon as a metal-air battery indicates the formation of a SnO2 layer at the electrolyte/anode interface.,"Performance evaluation of a liquid tin anode solid oxide fuel cell operating under hydrogen, argon and coal",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.138
5,9252,The increase in the OCP to 1.1 V for the hydrogen fueled cell shows that H-2 reduces the SnO2 film effectively.,"Performance evaluation of a liquid tin anode solid oxide fuel cell operating under hydrogen, argon and coal",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.138
6,9252,"The effective diffusion coefficients are calculated using the Warburg element in the equivalent circuit model for the experimental EIS data, and the values of 1.9 10(-3) cm(2) s(-1) at 700 degrees C, 2.3 10(-3) cm(2) s(-1) at 800 degrees C and 3.5 10(-3) cm(2) s(-1) at 900 degrees C indicate the system was influenced by diffusion of hydrogen in the system.","Performance evaluation of a liquid tin anode solid oxide fuel cell operating under hydrogen, argon and coal",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.138
7,9252,"Further, the performance degradation over time is attributed to the irreversible conversion of Sn to SnO2 resulting from galvanic polarization.","Performance evaluation of a liquid tin anode solid oxide fuel cell operating under hydrogen, argon and coal",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.138
