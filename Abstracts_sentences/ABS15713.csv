1,15713,The study presents the results of structural and electrical conductivity investigations of a Cu1.3Mn1.7O4 spinel obtained using EDTA gel processes.,Structure and Electrical Properties of Mn-Cu-O Spinels,10.1007/s11665-017-2588-8
2,15713,"An amorphous gel was synthesized and calcinated for 5 h in air at temperatures of 673, 773, 873, and 973 K. When calcinating the gel at temperatures below 973 K, the obtained powders consisted of two phases-the regular Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 spinel and manganese(III) oxide.",Structure and Electrical Properties of Mn-Cu-O Spinels,10.1007/s11665-017-2588-8
3,15713,"At 973 K, Mn2O3 was no longer observed, but a new Mn3O4 phase appeared in addition to the Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 spinel.",Structure and Electrical Properties of Mn-Cu-O Spinels,10.1007/s11665-017-2588-8
4,15713,Green bodies prepared from these powders were sintered for 2 h in air at 1393 K.,Structure and Electrical Properties of Mn-Cu-O Spinels,10.1007/s11665-017-2588-8
5,15713,"The obtained sinters had a porosity of around 12% and were composed predominantly of the spinel phase, with minor amounts of Mn3O4 and, in the case of three of four sinters-CuO. Electrical conductivity measurements were taken over the temperature range of 300-1073 K. A change in the character of conductivity of the studied sinters was observed in the range of 400-430 K, and it was associated with an increase in activation energy from 0.20 to 0.56 eV.",Structure and Electrical Properties of Mn-Cu-O Spinels,10.1007/s11665-017-2588-8
6,15713,"The electrical conductivity of the studied sinters ranged from 74.8 to 88.4 S cm(-1), which makes the Cu1.3Mn1.7O4 material suitable for application as a protective-conducting coating in IT-SOFC ferritic stainless steel interconnects.",Structure and Electrical Properties of Mn-Cu-O Spinels,10.1007/s11665-017-2588-8
