1,12243,"Detailed chemical and surface structure analyses are presented for an 8 mol % yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) wafer, partially covered with a thin, porous (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 (LSM) film electrode, after being cathodically poisoned in the presence of a chromia source at 800degreesC. Under the conditions used, the newly deposited Cr-containing compounds were distributed not only in and around the electroactive LSM-YSZ-air triple-phase boundary (TPB) interface region, but also extending ca.","Chromium poisoning of LSM-YSZ SOFC cathodes - I.

3,12243,The distribution and structure of the Cr species on the YSZ surface was directly correlated with variations in the cathodic polarization of the half-cell for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,"Chromium poisoning of LSM-YSZ SOFC cathodes - I.

5,12243,Evidence presented here suggests that Cr2O3 plays an important role in extending the electroactive LSM-YSZ-air TPB out onto the YSZ surface by effectively creating a new Cr2O3-YSZ-air TPB region.,"Chromium poisoning of LSM-YSZ SOFC cathodes - I.
