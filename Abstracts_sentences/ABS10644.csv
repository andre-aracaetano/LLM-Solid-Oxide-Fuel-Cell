1,10644,"The high-conductivity Ce0.82La0.18O2-delta (LDC) was synthesized by solid state reaction added with 2.5 mol% V2O5 in raw materials, which exhibited a cubic fluorite structure.",Enhanced density and conductivity of Ce0.82La0.18O2-δ ceramics for solid oxide fuel cell interlayer using V2O5 as sintering additive,10.1016/j.matlet.2012.07.056
2,10644,The addition of V2O5 enhanced greatly the densification (97%) and conductivity (0.0965 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C) of the LDC ceramics.,Enhanced density and conductivity of Ce0.82La0.18O2-δ ceramics for solid oxide fuel cell interlayer using V2O5 as sintering additive,10.1016/j.matlet.2012.07.056
3,10644,"The results are ascribed to the improved sintering activity and density of ceramics due to the addition of V2O5 with the low melting point and high volatilization, which could be supported by the observation of LaVO4 on the surface rather than inside of the LDC samples.",Enhanced density and conductivity of Ce0.82La0.18O2-δ ceramics for solid oxide fuel cell interlayer using V2O5 as sintering additive,10.1016/j.matlet.2012.07.056
4,10644,The excellent performances imply that LDC ceramics might be applied to the interlayer for solid state oxide fuel cells to suppress the reaction between the electrode and electrolyte without the loss of conductivity.,Enhanced density and conductivity of Ce0.82La0.18O2-δ ceramics for solid oxide fuel cell interlayer using V2O5 as sintering additive,10.1016/j.matlet.2012.07.056
