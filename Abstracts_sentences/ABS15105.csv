2,15105,It was found that Ni-Fe alloy exhibits high activity against anodic reaction and suitable compatibility with LaGaO3 electrolyte.,Ni-Fe alloy-supported intermediate temperature SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte film for quick startup,10.1115/1.2930763
3,15105,The electrolyte film of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM) and SM0.2Ce0.8O2 (SDC) bilayer with 5 mu m thickness was successfully prepared on the dense NiO-Fe2O3 composite anode.,Ni-Fe alloy-supported intermediate temperature SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte film for quick startup,10.1115/1.2930763
4,15105,"After a in situ reduction, the dense plate of NiO-Fe2O3 was changed to the porous Ni-Fe alloy substrate; however the LSGM film can keep the dense state.",Ni-Fe alloy-supported intermediate temperature SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte film for quick startup,10.1115/1.2930763
5,15105,"The prepared Ni-Fe alloy that supported LSGM cell demonstrated the maximum power densities of 0.9 W/cm(2) and 0.4 W/cm(2) at 873 K and 573 K. After heating up to 873 K within 540 s, there is no crack formed on the film and almost the theoretical open circuit voltage was exhibited.",Ni-Fe alloy-supported intermediate temperature SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte film for quick startup,10.1115/1.2930763
6,15105,"In addition, the maximum power density of 400 mW/cm(2) was achieved at 773 K. After the thermal cycling, the decrease in the maximum power density was not large, and this suggests that the film is still gas tight and highly tolerant against the thermal cycle.",Ni-Fe alloy-supported intermediate temperature SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte film for quick startup,10.1115/1.2930763
7,15105,Quick start characteristics of the metal support SOFC could expand the SOFC application to the electric source of a mobile-field-like automobile.,Ni-Fe alloy-supported intermediate temperature SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte film for quick startup,10.1115/1.2930763
