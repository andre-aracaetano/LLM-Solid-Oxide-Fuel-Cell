1,1370,The dynamic behavior of a solid oxide fuel cell gas turbine hybrid system (SOFC/GT) from both open and closed loop transients in response to sudden changes in fuel composition was experimentally investigated.,Open Loop and Closed Loop Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Turbine Hybrid Systems During Fuel Composition Changes,10.1115/1.4035646
2,1370,"A pilot-scale (200-700 kW) hybrid facility available at the U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory was used to perform the experiments using a combination of numerical models and actual equipment.",Open Loop and Closed Loop Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Turbine Hybrid Systems During Fuel Composition Changes,10.1115/1.4035646
3,1370,"In the open loop configuration, the turbine speed was driven by the thermal effluent fed into the gas turbine system, where the thermal effluent was determined by the feedforward fuel cell control system.",Open Loop and Closed Loop Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Turbine Hybrid Systems During Fuel Composition Changes,10.1115/1.4035646
4,1370,"However, in the closed loop configuration, a load-based speed control system was used to maintain the turbine speed constant at 40,500 rpm by adjusting the load on the turbine, in addition to the implementation of the fuel cell system control.",Open Loop and Closed Loop Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Turbine Hybrid Systems During Fuel Composition Changes,10.1115/1.4035646
5,1370,"The open loop transient response showed that the impacts of fuel composition changes on key process variables, such as fuel cell thermal effluent, turbine speed, and cathode feed stream conditions, in the SOFC/GT systems were propagated over the course of the test, except for the cathode inlet temperature.",Open Loop and Closed Loop Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Turbine Hybrid Systems During Fuel Composition Changes,10.1115/1.4035646
6,1370,The trajectories of the aforementioned variables are discussed in this paper to better understand the resulting mitigation/propagation behaviors.,Open Loop and Closed Loop Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Turbine Hybrid Systems During Fuel Composition Changes,10.1115/1.4035646
7,1370,This will help lead to the development of novel control strategies to mitigate the negative impacts experienced during fuel composition transients of SOFC/GT systems.,Open Loop and Closed Loop Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Turbine Hybrid Systems During Fuel Composition Changes,10.1115/1.4035646
