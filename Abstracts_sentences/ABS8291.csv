1,8291,Cu is incorporated by vacuum-assisted electroless plating into porous Ni/Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (Ni/SDC) anodes as the active anodes for the oxidation reaction of hydrogen and methane of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,"Vacuum-assisted electroless copper plating on Ni/(Sm,Ce)O2 anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.131
2,8291,The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation indicates the formation of a uniformly distributed nano-structured Cu network within the porous Ni/SDC microstructure.,"Vacuum-assisted electroless copper plating on Ni/(Sm,Ce)O2 anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.131
3,8291,"The maximum power density of the cell with the Cu electroless-plated Ni/SDC anodes is 0.84 and 0.54 W cm(-2) in dry H-2 and dry CH4 at 600 degrees C, respectively, enhanced by similar to 30% as compared to the cell with conventional Ni/SDC anodes.","Vacuum-assisted electroless copper plating on Ni/(Sm,Ce)O2 anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.131
4,8291,The increase in the performance of the cell with the Cu electroless-plated Ni/SDC anodes is most likely attributed to the enlarged effective three-phase boundaries (TPBs) by interconnecting the isolated Ni and/or SDC particles with the electroless-plated Cu network and the formation of TPBs at the Cu/SDC interface due to the activation of SDC surface by the Cu deposition.,"Vacuum-assisted electroless copper plating on Ni/(Sm,Ce)O2 anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.131
5,8291,The stability test shows that cell degradation in dry methane due to carbon deposition is significantly reduced by the electroless copper plating.,"Vacuum-assisted electroless copper plating on Ni/(Sm,Ce)O2 anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.131
