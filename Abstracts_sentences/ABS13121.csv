1,13121,"Anode-supported electrolyte thin films for improving the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) performance at intermediate temperature (IT) have been manufactured by a wet-chemical process, and their microstructures, gas permeabilities, and electrical performances have been investigated.",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported electrolyte thin films for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.07.013
2,13121,"NiO-YSZ anode supports of a flat tube type were prepared by the extrusion method, and their surfaces were modified via slurry coating of fine NiO-YSZ particles for controlling the surface roughness and the pore size.",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported electrolyte thin films for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.07.013
3,13121,"An anode-supported yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte was fabricated by dip-coating YSZ slurry (viscosity 4.5 cP, solid contents 2.7 vol.%) onto the modified anode support, then it was coated with YSZ sol (viscosity 2.5 cP), and sintered at 1400degreesC. The cathode consisted of three consecutive layers of LSM-YSZ composite,",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported electrolyte thin films for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.07.013
4,13121,"strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM), and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF).",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported electrolyte thin films for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.07.013
5,13121,"After each successive slurry layer was applied it was co-fired at 1200degreesC. The thickness of YSZ electrolyte layers could be controlled below 15 mum, and the YSZ layers' acceptability as an electrolyte film for an SOFC was estimated from the result of the gas impermeability ranging below 2 bar.",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported electrolyte thin films for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.07.013
