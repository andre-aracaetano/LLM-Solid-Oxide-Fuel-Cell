1,6696,"In order to develop a simple and cost-effective route to fabricate protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells (PCMFCs), a stable proton-conducting La0.99Ca0.01NbO4 (LCN) thin electrolyte was fabricated on a porous NiO-La0.5Ce0.5O1.75 (NiO-LDC) anode by in situ screen printing.",Stable proton-conducting Ca-doped LaNbO4 thin electrolyte-based protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells by in situ screen printing,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.11.058
2,6696,"The key part of this process is to directly print well-mixed ink of La2O3, CaCO3 and Nb2O5 instead of pre-synthesized LCN ceramic powder on the anode substrate.",Stable proton-conducting Ca-doped LaNbO4 thin electrolyte-based protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells by in situ screen printing,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.11.058

4,6696,A single cell was assembled with (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.9)MnO3-delta-La0.5Ce0.5O1.75 (LSM-LDC) as cathode and tested with humidified hydrogen as fuel and static air as oxidant.,Stable proton-conducting Ca-doped LaNbO4 thin electrolyte-based protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells by in situ screen printing,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.11.058
5,6696,The open circuit voltage (OCV) and maximum power density respectively reached 0.98 V and 65 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Interface resistance of cell under open circuit condition was also investigated.,Stable proton-conducting Ca-doped LaNbO4 thin electrolyte-based protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells by in situ screen printing,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.11.058
