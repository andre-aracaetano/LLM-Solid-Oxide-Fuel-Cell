2,6228,"In this work, the medium-entropy SrV1/3Fe1/3Mo1/3O3 (SVFMO) with Fe, V and Mo co-existing in the B site of a perovskite structure was fabricated in reducing 5% H-2/Ar mixed gas: (1) SVFMO demonstrates more stable physicochemical properties when using SOFCs anodes in a reducing environment; (2) the co-existence of Fe, V and Mo in SVFMO forms more small-polaron couples, demonstrating greatly enhanced electronic conductivity.",Medium-Entropy SrV1/3Fe1/3Mo1/3O3 with High Conductivity and Strong Stability as SOFCs High-Performance Anode,10.3390/ma15062298
3,6228,"With SVFMO in a porous structure (simulating the porous anode layer), its electronic conductivity can also reach 70 S cm(-1) when testing at 800 degrees C in an H-2 atmosphere; (3) SVFMO with more oxygen vacancies achieves higher catalytic ability for fuel gas, as an SOFCs anode layer demonstrates 720 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C.",Medium-Entropy SrV1/3Fe1/3Mo1/3O3 with High Conductivity and Strong Stability as SOFCs High-Performance Anode,10.3390/ma15062298
