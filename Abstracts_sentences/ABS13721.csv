1,13721,"Influence of the air-gap, the distance from the tube-in-orifice spinneret to the upper surface of the external coagulant bath during the extrusion/phase-inversion process, on the microstructure of nickel - yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni YSZ) hollow fibers has been systematically studied.","Novel light-weight, high-performance anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells with an active anode functional layer",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.018
2,13721,"When the air-gap is 0 cm, the obtained Ni YSZ hollow fiber has a sandwich microstructure.","Novel light-weight, high-performance anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells with an active anode functional layer",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.018
3,13721,"However, when the air-gap is increased to 15 cm, a bi-layer Ni YSZ hollow fiber consisting of a thin layer with small pores and a thick support with highly porous fingerlike macrovoids has been achieved.","Novel light-weight, high-performance anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells with an active anode functional layer",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.018
4,13721,"The output power density of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFCs) with a cell configuration of Ni-YSZ/YSZ/YSZ-LSM increases from 594 mW cm(-2) for the cells with the Ni YSZ anode of sandwich microstructure to 832 mW cm(-2) for the cells with the Ni YSZ anode of bi-layer microstructure at 750 degrees C, implying that to achieve the same output power density, the weight of the cells with the bi-layer anode support can be reduced to 41.5% compared with that of the cells with the sandwich anode support.","Novel light-weight, high-performance anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells with an active anode functional layer",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.018
5,13721,"Thermal-cycling test shows no obvious degradation on the open-circuit-voltage (OCV), indicating that the MT-SOFCs have robust resistance to thermal cycling.","Novel light-weight, high-performance anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells with an active anode functional layer",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.018
