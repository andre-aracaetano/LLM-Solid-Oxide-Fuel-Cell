2,11099,"In our Vietnam-Japan joint project contributing to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), a shrimp farm in Ben Tre (Mekong Delta area) was selected as a demonstration site for an energy circulation system that includes a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).","Biogas Power Generation with SOFC to Demonstrate Energy Circulation Suitable for Mekong Delta, Vietnam",10.1002/fuce.201800184
3,11099,We found that sludge accumulated during intensive-shrimp culture can be used as a source of methanogenic bacteria to decompose lignocellulosic and starch-based biomass.,"Biogas Power Generation with SOFC to Demonstrate Energy Circulation Suitable for Mekong Delta, Vietnam",10.1002/fuce.201800184
4,11099,"Bagasse and coconut pomace are mixed with the shrimp pond water containing organic matter and minerals, then supplied to a digester with seed sludge (shrimp pond sludge) to produce biogas, which converted to electricity using the SOFC system.","Biogas Power Generation with SOFC to Demonstrate Energy Circulation Suitable for Mekong Delta, Vietnam",10.1002/fuce.201800184
