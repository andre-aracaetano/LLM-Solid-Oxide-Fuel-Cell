6,11414,"The maximum current density was 400 mA cm(2) (at an average cell voltage of 0.75 V) and the maximum power was 90 W, at the stack operating temperature of 750 degrees",Impact of Changing Mode on the Execution of 100 W Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs),10.14447/jnmes.v22i4.a02
7,11414,"C. The result of the 6 cell stack was influenced by a reiteration test, where the cuurent was 20 A toward the start of the test and diminished to 15A at 750 degrees C. It might be because of the debasement in a few cells' execution, which is because of expanding the area specific resistance (ASR) which was in the scope of 0.50 - 0.80 Omega cm(2).",Impact of Changing Mode on the Execution of 100 W Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs),10.14447/jnmes.v22i4.a02
