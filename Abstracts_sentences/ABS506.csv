1,506,"The microstructure of solid-oxide fuel cell anodes, consisting of nickel particles embedded in either doped zirconia or ceria, was characterized in three different stages: (i) as sintered, (ii) after reduction, and (iii) after fuel cell operation for 500 h in an atmosphere of moist hydrogen.",Formation of nickel nanoparticles in nickel-ceramic anodes during operation of solid-oxide fuel cells,10.3139/146.101663
2,506,"After 500 h of operation, we found that both types of anodes, those based on zirconia and those based on ceria, contained nanoparticles of elemental nickel.",Formation of nickel nanoparticles in nickel-ceramic anodes during operation of solid-oxide fuel cells,10.3139/146.101663
3,506,"We propose that these nanoparticles form from nickel hydroxide, synthesized during fuel cell operation and precipitating elemental nickel where the partial pressure of water is low at the periphery of triple-phase boundaries or on cooling down from the operating temperature to room temperature.",Formation of nickel nanoparticles in nickel-ceramic anodes during operation of solid-oxide fuel cells,10.3139/146.101663
