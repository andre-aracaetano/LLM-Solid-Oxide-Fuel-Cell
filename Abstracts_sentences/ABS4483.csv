1,4483,Design of an appropriate sealant is crucial for reliable sealing and stable long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells.,The effect of CaO/MgO content on properties of barium aluminosilicate sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122842
2,4483,"We have investigated sealants based on barium aluminosilicate glass-ceramic modified with CaO and MgO. Focus of the research was on the 0.33BaO-0.20XO-0.33SiO2-0.05Al2O3-0.09B2O3 system, where XO is CaO, MgO, or a mixture of the two.",The effect of CaO/MgO content on properties of barium aluminosilicate sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122842
3,4483,"Key properties of the system were studied, and its applicability of different compositions to sealing of high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells was investigated.",The effect of CaO/MgO content on properties of barium aluminosilicate sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122842
4,4483,"Thermal properties, such as softening point and a half-ball point of the glass, coefficients of thermal expansion and adhesion to Crofer 22APU steel were of primary concern.",The effect of CaO/MgO content on properties of barium aluminosilicate sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122842
5,4483,CaO-containing sealants of this system showed much lower softening point compared to that of MgO-containing sealants.,The effect of CaO/MgO content on properties of barium aluminosilicate sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122842
6,4483,The substitution of CaO with MgO had no detectable effect on the coefficients of thermal expansion of the sealants.,The effect of CaO/MgO content on properties of barium aluminosilicate sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122842
7,4483,The coefficients of all the studied compositions were in 11.2-11.6 center dot 10-6 1/K range.,The effect of CaO/MgO content on properties of barium aluminosilicate sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122842
8,4483,All the compositions have good adhesion to both Crofer 22 APU steel and ZrO2-based electrolyte.,The effect of CaO/MgO content on properties of barium aluminosilicate sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122842
9,4483,CaO-containing sealant was tested under operation conditions of a fuel cell stack for ten days; the seal remained hermetic for that period with no visible signs of degradation or oncoming failure of the seal.,The effect of CaO/MgO content on properties of barium aluminosilicate sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122842
