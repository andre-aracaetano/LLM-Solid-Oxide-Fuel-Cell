2,9277,"In this study, an efficient and durable cathode material for IT-SOFCs is designed based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations by co-doping with Nb and Ta the B-site of the SrFeO3_d perovskite oxide.",A defective iron-based perovskite cathode for high-performance IT-SOFCs: Tailoring the oxygen vacancies using Nb/Ta co-doping,10.1016/j.jechem.2023.09.015
3,9277,The DFT calculations suggest that Nb/Ta co-doping can regulate the energy band of the parent SrFeO3_d and help electron transfer.,A defective iron-based perovskite cathode for high-performance IT-SOFCs: Tailoring the oxygen vacancies using Nb/Ta co-doping,10.1016/j.jechem.2023.09.015
4,9277,"In symmetrical cells, such cathode with a SrFe0.8Nb0.1Ta0.1O3_d(SFNT) detailed formula achieves a low cathode polarization resistance of 0.147 X cm2 at 650 degrees C. Electron spin resonance (ESR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirm that the co-doping of Nb/Ta in SrFeO3_d B-site increases the balanced concentration of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the electrochemical performance when compared to 20 mol% Nb single-doped perovskite oxide.",A defective iron-based perovskite cathode for high-performance IT-SOFCs: Tailoring the oxygen vacancies using Nb/Ta co-doping,10.1016/j.jechem.2023.09.015
5,9277,"The cathode button cell with Ni-SDC|SDC|SFNT configuration achieves an outstanding peak power density of 1.3 W cm_2 at 650 degrees C. Moreover, the button cell shows durability for 110 h under 0.65 Vat 600 degrees C using wet H2 as fuel.",A defective iron-based perovskite cathode for high-performance IT-SOFCs: Tailoring the oxygen vacancies using Nb/Ta co-doping,10.1016/j.jechem.2023.09.015
