1,12552,"The performance of solid oxide fuel cells is affected by various polarization losses, usually grouped in Ohmic, activation, and concentration polarizations.",Performances and Degradation Phenomena of Solid Oxide Anode Supported Cells With LSM and LSCF Cathodes: An Experimental Assessment,10.1115/1.2971128
2,12552,"Under typical operating conditions, these polarization losses are largely dependent on cell materials, electrode microstructures, and cell geometry: as an example, the performance of a tubular cell is strongly limited by the Ohmic polarization due to the long current path of electrons, while in a planar cell each of these losses has a comparable effect.",Performances and Degradation Phenomena of Solid Oxide Anode Supported Cells With LSM and LSCF Cathodes: An Experimental Assessment,10.1115/1.2971128
