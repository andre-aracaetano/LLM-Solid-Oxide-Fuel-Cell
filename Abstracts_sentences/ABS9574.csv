4,9574,"Specifically, the cell equipped with LSCF@GDC cathode demonstrates 40-fold promoted performance under low oxygen partial pressures (po(2) = 0.03atm) e.g. 0.415 W/cm(2) for LSCF@GDC versus 0.0107 W/cm(2) for bare LSCF at 750 degrees C.",Strongly coupled oxygen reservoir enabled highly efficient solid oxide fuel cell cathode operation under harsh conditions,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230933
5,9574,"The systematic characterizations verify that the strong coupling effect between GDC and LSCF, i.e., the GDC serves as the oxygen reservoir to not only alter the crystal structure of LSCF with enhanced oxygen content, but also guarantee sufficient oxygen species for LSCF under oxygen-starving atmosphere.",Strongly coupled oxygen reservoir enabled highly efficient solid oxide fuel cell cathode operation under harsh conditions,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230933
