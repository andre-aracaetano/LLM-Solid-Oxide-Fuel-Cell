2,14924,"Here, we prepare the anode-supported SOFC with a multifunction layer (MFL) cathode-infiltrated filmy La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d (LSC), which provides a peak power density as high as 1.1 W cm-2 at 750 degrees C, and outstanding durability with slight voltage loss under 0.5 A cm-2 and 750 degrees C for over 1000 h. According to collected data from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at different operating times, the distribution of relaxation time (DRT) and equivalent circuit model (ECM) methods are applied to quantify the contribution of different electrode processes to the whole voltage degradation during the cell operation.",Stability evaluation and quantitative analysis of filmy cathode in solid oxide fuel cells under operating conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.273
3,14924,"The result shows that oxygen ionic transport and charge transfer at the MFL/electrolyte interface dominate almost all voltage degradation (95.31%), while the ox-ygen surface exchange and oxygen ionic bulk diffusion in the cathode just contributes 1.82%.",Stability evaluation and quantitative analysis of filmy cathode in solid oxide fuel cells under operating conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.273
