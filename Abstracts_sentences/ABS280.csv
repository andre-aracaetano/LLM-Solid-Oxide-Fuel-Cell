1,280,"The main objective of this paper is to model and analyze the thermodynamic performance of a hybrid system consisting of steam turbine (ST), gas turbine (GT) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).","Thermodynamic analysis of the performance of a hybrid system consisting of steam turbine, gas turbine and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC-GT-ST)",10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112816
2,280,What separates this hybrid system from the other existing cycles is the simultaneous use of three modern technologies in a single power generation cycle.,"Thermodynamic analysis of the performance of a hybrid system consisting of steam turbine, gas turbine and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC-GT-ST)",10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112816
3,280,"In this work, first, 9 different steam cycle configurations have been examined and the best cycle in terms of thermodynamic performance has been selected.","Thermodynamic analysis of the performance of a hybrid system consisting of steam turbine, gas turbine and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC-GT-ST)",10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112816
4,280,"The fuel cell used in the hybrid cycle has been analyzed from thermodynamic, thermal and electrochemical standpoints; and, contrary to most previous research works, the operating temperatures of the fuel cell under different working conditions have been determined.","Thermodynamic analysis of the performance of a hybrid system consisting of steam turbine, gas turbine and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC-GT-ST)",10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112816
5,280,"The obtained results for the triple hybrid cycle indicate that by adding the steam cycle to the double cycle of gas turbine-fuel cell, the net power generated by the triple system goes up 200% relative to the simple gas turbine cycle and 15% relative to the hybrid cycle of gas turbine-fuel cell.","Thermodynamic analysis of the performance of a hybrid system consisting of steam turbine, gas turbine and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC-GT-ST)",10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112816
6,280,Results also show that the triple hybrid system (with an efficiency of 52%) has a better performance than the hybrid system of gas turbine-fuel cell (with an efficiency of 45.21%) and the simple gas turbine cycle (with an efficiency of 25%).,"Thermodynamic analysis of the performance of a hybrid system consisting of steam turbine, gas turbine and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC-GT-ST)",10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112816
