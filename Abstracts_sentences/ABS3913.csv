1,3913,La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM)-coated Ba05Sr05Co08Fe0.2O3 (BSCF) composite powder (LSM-BSCF) was synthesized by a novel solid-solution method and investigated electrochemically as a cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,High performance La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-coated Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 cathode prepared by a novel solid-solution method for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1872-2067(12)60704-9
2,3913,"The cathode combined the merits of LSM and BSCF cathodes through an extended triple phase boundary and stabilized microstructure and demonstrated a polarization resistance between 0.61 and 0.09 Omega cm(2) at 600 to 750 degrees C. Compared with high performance cathodes prepared by solution impregnation, this LSM-BSCF cathode greatly improved performance stability.",High performance La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-coated Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 cathode prepared by a novel solid-solution method for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1872-2067(12)60704-9
