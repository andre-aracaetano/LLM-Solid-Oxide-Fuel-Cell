1,5049,"For planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) designs, ceramic as well as metallic materials are being considered as construction materials for the interconnectors.",Metallic interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cells - a review,10.1179/mht.2003.015
2,5049,"Compared to the ceramics, mostly compounds on the basis of La-chromite, metallic materials have the advantage of easier fabricability, lower costs as well as higher heat and electrical conductivity.",Metallic interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cells - a review,10.1179/mht.2003.015
3,5049,"Based on the requirements in respect to oxidation resistance, low thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity of surface oxide scales, Cr-based alloys and high-Cr ferritic steels seem to be the most promising metallic interconnector materials.",Metallic interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cells - a review,10.1179/mht.2003.015
4,5049,"Whereas Cr-based alloys have recently especially been developed for SOFC application, a large number of ferritic steels are commercially available in a wide range of compositions.",Metallic interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cells - a review,10.1179/mht.2003.015
5,5049,"However, it seems that the specific combination of properties required for a SOFC interconnector will necessitate the development of a new, specifically designed steel or the modification of an existing commercial steel composition.",Metallic interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cells - a review,10.1179/mht.2003.015
