1,5660,"The synthesis of strontium-doped lanthanum chromite, La1-xSrxCrO3 (x=0.1 and 0.3), used as an interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), was investigated using two unconventional synthesis methods: (1) organic precursors' method based on the thermal conversion of complex combination resulted in the oxidation reaction of 1,2-ethanediol by La3+, Sr2+ and Cr3+ nitrates; (2) combustion synthesis based on the exothermic redox reaction of La3+, Sr2+ and Cr3+ nitrates with urea and glycine as fuels.",COMPARATIVE STUDY REGARDING THE FORMATION OF La1-xSrxCrO3 PEROVSKITE USING UNCONVENTIONAL SYNTHESIS METHODS,10.1007/s10973-008-9104-1
2,5660,We also used a mixture of urea and glycine as fuel.,COMPARATIVE STUDY REGARDING THE FORMATION OF La1-xSrxCrO3 PEROVSKITE USING UNCONVENTIONAL SYNTHESIS METHODS,10.1007/s10973-008-9104-1
3,5660,The samples were characterized by means of thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction.,COMPARATIVE STUDY REGARDING THE FORMATION OF La1-xSrxCrO3 PEROVSKITE USING UNCONVENTIONAL SYNTHESIS METHODS,10.1007/s10973-008-9104-1
