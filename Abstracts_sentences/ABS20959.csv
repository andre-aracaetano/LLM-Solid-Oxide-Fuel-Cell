1,20959,"The development of Ruddlesden-Popper oxides as oxygen exchange and transport materials for applications such as solid oxide fuel cells, oxygen separation membranes, and chemical looping will benefit from a detailed mechanistic understanding of how oxygen is transported through these materials.",Factors Controlling Oxygen Interstitial Diffusion in the Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+δ,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03146
2,20959,"Using density functional theory, we found that there are two distinct oxygen interstitial diffusion mechanisms involving two different oxygen interstitial species that can be active in La2-xSrxNiO4+delta and, we believe, in hyperstoichiometric Ruddlesden-Popper oxides in general.",Factors Controlling Oxygen Interstitial Diffusion in the Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+δ,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03146
3,20959,"The first mechanism is the previously proposed interstitialcy-mediated mechanism, which consists of diffusing oxide interstitials.",Factors Controlling Oxygen Interstitial Diffusion in the Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+δ,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03146
4,20959,The second mechanism is newly discovered in this work and consists of both oxide and peroxide interstitial diffusing species.,Factors Controlling Oxygen Interstitial Diffusion in the Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+δ,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03146
5,20959,This mechanism exhibits a similar or possibly lower migration barrier than the interstitialcy mechanism for high oxidation states.,Factors Controlling Oxygen Interstitial Diffusion in the Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+δ,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03146
6,20959,"Which mechanism contributes to the oxygen interstitial diffusion is the result of the change in relative stability between the oxide interstitial (2(-) charge) and peroxide interstitial (1(-) charge), which directly affects the migration barriers for these two different mechanisms.",Factors Controlling Oxygen Interstitial Diffusion in the Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+δ,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03146
7,20959,The stability of the oxide and peroxide and therefore the competition between the two oxygen diffusion mechanisms is highly sensitive to the overall oxidation state of the system.,Factors Controlling Oxygen Interstitial Diffusion in the Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+δ,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03146
8,20959,"Therefore, the oxygen diffusion mechanism is a function of the material composition, oxygen off-stoichiometry, operating temperature, and oxygen partial pressure.",Factors Controlling Oxygen Interstitial Diffusion in the Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+δ,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03146
9,20959,"We also examined the effect of epitaxial strain on both oxygen diffusion mechanisms and found that tensile and compressive epitaxial strain of up to 2% had less than 100 meV/(% strain) effects on oxygen interstitial formation, migration, and activation energies and that total achievable activation energy reductions are likely less than 100 meV for up to +/- 2% epitaxial strain.",Factors Controlling Oxygen Interstitial Diffusion in the Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+δ,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03146
10,20959,The presented understanding of factors governing interstitial oxygen diffusion potentially has significant implications for the engineering of Ruddlesden-Popper oxides in numerous alternative energy technologies.,Factors Controlling Oxygen Interstitial Diffusion in the Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide La2-xSrxNiO4+δ,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03146
