1,12147,"Following growing interest in the use of ammonia as a fuel in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), we have investigated the possible reaction between the apatite silicate/germanate electrolytes, La8+xSr2-x(Si/Ge)(6)O26+x/2, and NH3 gas.","Formation of apatite oxynitrides by the reaction between apatite-type oxide ion conductors, La8+xSr2-x(Si/Ge)6O26+x/2, and ammonia",10.1016/j.jssc.2009.09.029
2,12147,We examine how the composition of the apatite phase affects the reaction with ammonia.,"Formation of apatite oxynitrides by the reaction between apatite-type oxide ion conductors, La8+xSr2-x(Si/Ge)6O26+x/2, and ammonia",10.1016/j.jssc.2009.09.029
3,12147,"For the silicate series, the results showed a small degree of N incorporation at 600 degrees C, while at higher temperatures (800 degrees C), substantial N incorporation was observed.","Formation of apatite oxynitrides by the reaction between apatite-type oxide ion conductors, La8+xSr2-x(Si/Ge)6O26+x/2, and ammonia",10.1016/j.jssc.2009.09.029
4,12147,"For the germanate series, partial decomposition was observed after heating in ammonia at 800 degrees C, while at the lower temperature (600 degrees C), significant N incorporation was observed.","Formation of apatite oxynitrides by the reaction between apatite-type oxide ion conductors, La8+xSr2-x(Si/Ge)6O26+x/2, and ammonia",10.1016/j.jssc.2009.09.029
5,12147,"For both series, the N content in the resulting apatite oxynitride was shown to increase with increasing interstitial oxide ion content (x/2) in the starting oxide.","Formation of apatite oxynitrides by the reaction between apatite-type oxide ion conductors, La8+xSr2-x(Si/Ge)6O26+x/2, and ammonia",10.1016/j.jssc.2009.09.029
6,12147,"The results suggest that the driving force for the nitridation process is to remove the interstitial anion content, such that for the silicates the total anion (O+N) content in the oxynitrides approximates to 26.0, the value for an anion stoichiometric apatite.","Formation of apatite oxynitrides by the reaction between apatite-type oxide ion conductors, La8+xSr2-x(Si/Ge)6O26+x/2, and ammonia",10.1016/j.jssc.2009.09.029
7,12147,"For the germanates, lower total anion contents are observed in some cases, consistent with the ability of the germanates to accommodate anion vacancies.","Formation of apatite oxynitrides by the reaction between apatite-type oxide ion conductors, La8+xSr2-x(Si/Ge)6O26+x/2, and ammonia",10.1016/j.jssc.2009.09.029
8,12147,The removal of the mobile interstitial oxide ions on nitridation suggests problems with the use of apatite-type electrolytes in SCFCs utilising NH3 at elevated temperatures.,"Formation of apatite oxynitrides by the reaction between apatite-type oxide ion conductors, La8+xSr2-x(Si/Ge)6O26+x/2, and ammonia",10.1016/j.jssc.2009.09.029
