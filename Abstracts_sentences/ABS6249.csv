1,6249,We evaluated the electrochemical performances of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (LNFO) and LaNi0.6Co0.4O3 (LNCO) perovskites as cathodes in La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.(815) (LSGM) electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cell.,"Evaluation of LaNi0.6M0.4O3 (M = Fe, Co) cathodes in LSGM-electrolyte-supported solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.031
2,6249,"Both samples show excellent chemical compatibility with the LSGM electrolyte up to 900 degrees C, and exhibit small-polaron type electrical conduction with a high conductivity sigma approximate to 510 (430) S.cm(-1) at 800 degrees C and a small activation energy E-e(a) = 54.9 (44.4) meV for LNFO (LNCO).","Evaluation of LaNi0.6M0.4O3 (M = Fe, Co) cathodes in LSGM-electrolyte-supported solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.031
3,6249,The oxygen-reduction reaction evaluated in a symmetric LNFO(LNCO)|LSGM|LNFO(LNCO) cell gives a polarization resistance R-p approximate to 0.51 (0.34) Omega.cm(2) at 800 degrees C in air and an activation energy E-a(O) =,"Evaluation of LaNi0.6M0.4O3 (M = Fe, Co) cathodes in LSGM-electrolyte-supported solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.031
