1,15444,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) needs to be heated to an appropriate temperature (around 600 degrees C) before it is switched to start-up mode.,Simulation-based multiobjective management of transient heating process of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/fuce.202200113
2,15444,"A fast heat-up process, which is naturally of interest, can cause high temperature gradients inside the SOFC and the subsequent problems of cracking and delamination.",Simulation-based multiobjective management of transient heating process of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/fuce.202200113
3,15444,"Therefore, in order for the heat-up process to be efficiently managed, the opposing objectives (heat-up duration and temperature gradient) have to be considered simultaneously.",Simulation-based multiobjective management of transient heating process of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/fuce.202200113
4,15444,The present study investigates the influences of the type of temperature rise function and the average rate of temperature rise (ARTR) on each objective (heat-up duration and temperature gradient).,Simulation-based multiobjective management of transient heating process of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/fuce.202200113
5,15444,"Beside the simple linear temperature rise function of heating fluid considered in previous studies, some innovative nonlinear functions are also introduced and examined in the present study.",Simulation-based multiobjective management of transient heating process of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/fuce.202200113
6,15444,"The results indicate that the rotated-exponential temperature function with an ARTR of 5 K s(-1) and the linear temperature function with an ARTR of 0.1 K s(-1) are the best choices in terms of heat-up duration and temperature gradient, respectively.",Simulation-based multiobjective management of transient heating process of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/fuce.202200113
7,15444,This study also attempts to make a compromise between the two objectives and introduces the rotated-quadratic temperature function with an ARTR of 0.4 K s(-1) as a representative trade-off solution.,Simulation-based multiobjective management of transient heating process of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/fuce.202200113
