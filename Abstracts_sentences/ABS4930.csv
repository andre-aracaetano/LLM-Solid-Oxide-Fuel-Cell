2,4930,"In this study, the two-di-mensional ZnAl-mixed metal oxides (ZnAl-MMO) nanocomposite was derived from ZnAl-layered double hydroxide.",The interfacial ionic transport of two-dimensional ZnAl-mixed metal oxides nanocomposite,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166118
3,4930,"The obtained ZnAl-MMO nanocomposite is provided with high concentration of oxygen va-cancies at the surface, which achieved a high ionic conductivity of 0.26 S cm-1 and the maximum power density of 860 mW cm-2 at 550 & DEG;C. Significant improvement of open circuit voltage to 1.16 V is testified that the in-situ grown Zn6Al2O9 can effectively inhibit electron long-range transmission among ZnO. In addition, the unique proton transport at the interface of ZnAl-MMO heterostructure was proposed.",The interfacial ionic transport of two-dimensional ZnAl-mixed metal oxides nanocomposite,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166118
