1,7307,"With the development of offshore wind power (OWP)-based hydrogen production technology, hydrogen fuel cells play a critical role in buffering the mismatch between energy supply and demand in OWP systems.",Active Disturbance Rejection Optimization Control for SOFCs in Offshore Wind Power,10.3390/app13053364
2,7307,"Benefitting from high efficiency, cleanliness, and nontoxicity, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been extensively investigated.",Active Disturbance Rejection Optimization Control for SOFCs in Offshore Wind Power,10.3390/app13053364
3,7307,"However, OWP-based SOFC systems are characterized by strong nonlinearity and uncertainty and are vulnerable to disturbance, which leads to appreciable fluctuations and even instability to the system output voltage.",Active Disturbance Rejection Optimization Control for SOFCs in Offshore Wind Power,10.3390/app13053364
4,7307,"Since conventional PID control schemes cannot achieve favorable performance, a more advanced control method is imperative.",Active Disturbance Rejection Optimization Control for SOFCs in Offshore Wind Power,10.3390/app13053364
5,7307,"In response, this paper proposes a linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) method to reduce the influence of disturbance and ensure the stability of SOFC systems.",Active Disturbance Rejection Optimization Control for SOFCs in Offshore Wind Power,10.3390/app13053364
6,7307,"In addition, an improved firefly algorithm (IFA) was adopted to optimize LADRC parameters.",Active Disturbance Rejection Optimization Control for SOFCs in Offshore Wind Power,10.3390/app13053364
7,7307,"A step inertia weight was introduced, and a random generation mechanism was adopted to replace 30% of individuals with low luminous degrees.",Active Disturbance Rejection Optimization Control for SOFCs in Offshore Wind Power,10.3390/app13053364
8,7307,"Using optimized LADRC parameters, a series of Monte Carlo experiments were carried out to verify the system's robustness.",Active Disturbance Rejection Optimization Control for SOFCs in Offshore Wind Power,10.3390/app13053364
9,7307,"The experimental results show that the overshoot of the LADRC method optimized by the IFA can be reduced by 5.7% compared with the traditional PID controller, i.e., the influence of the voltage disturbance can be well suppressed.",Active Disturbance Rejection Optimization Control for SOFCs in Offshore Wind Power,10.3390/app13053364
