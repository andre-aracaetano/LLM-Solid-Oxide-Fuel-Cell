1,2279,The effect of strontium content on microstructure in (LaxSr1-x)FeO3 (LSFO) ceramics was investigated.,Effect of strontium content on microstructure in (LaxSr1-x)FeO3 ceramics,10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.07.013
2,2279,It was observed that grain size increased as strontium content increased: mean grain sizes of 2.4 mum for 60% strontium content and 6.1 mum for 80% strontium content were observed in LSFO ceramics after 1250degreesC/4 h sintering.,Effect of strontium content on microstructure in (LaxSr1-x)FeO3 ceramics,10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.07.013
