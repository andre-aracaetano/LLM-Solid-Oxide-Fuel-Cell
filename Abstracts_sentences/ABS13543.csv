1,13543,This study was aimed at developing integrated fabrication process for solid oxide cells (SOFC) with radio-frequency plasma spraying (RFPS) and/or hybrid plasma spraying (HYPS).,AN INTEGRATED FABRICATION PROCESS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS USING HYBRID PLASMA SPRAYING,10.2320/jinstmet1952.55.11_1240
2,13543,"Fundamental studies concerning particle velocity and deformation of ZrO2-12 wt%Y2O3 (YSZ) showed that even the lower particle velocities in RFPS (20 m/s) and HYPS (40-70 m/s) compared with the case in direct current plasma spraying (approximately 200 m/s), were found to be sufficient for the deformation of impinging molten YSZ particles on the substrate.",AN INTEGRATED FABRICATION PROCESS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS USING HYBRID PLASMA SPRAYING,10.2320/jinstmet1952.55.11_1240
3,13543,"RFPS, however, imposed a severe limitation on the substrate position because it led to short flying distance of molten particles.",AN INTEGRATED FABRICATION PROCESS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS USING HYBRID PLASMA SPRAYING,10.2320/jinstmet1952.55.11_1240
