1,17148,Substituted ceria is a material which has attracted great interest in solid oxide fuel cell technology [45].,"Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
2,17148,"Due to its chemical stability, it may also be a promising candidate as a mixed conductive membrane for oxygen separation with flue gas contact.","Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
3,17148,"As part of this paper, dilatometry measurements and X-ray powder diffraction experiments were carried out on ceramic materials in air and in argon with two separate series involving the substitution of ceria; cerium was substituted with different amounts of Gd and Pr.","Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
4,17148,The first substitution of Gd caused an increase of the unit cell with a small rise in linear thermal expansion in relation to pure ceria. CeO2 (-) (delta) Band Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 - delta showed no chemical expansion in both atmospheres.,"Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
5,17148,The second substitution of Gd with Pr decreased the unit cell in relation to pure ceria.,"Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
6,17148,It is therefore understandable that Pr is preferentially introduced and shown in this work as Pr4+ in ceria.,"Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
7,17148,These samples showed a remarkable chemical expansion in air and in argon.,"Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
8,17148,The chemical expansion displayed a clear positive correlation with increasing Pr content.,"Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
9,17148,The thermal expansion coefficients are comparable to the first substitution without any trend in relation to the amount of Pr.,"Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
10,17148,"The dilatometry behaviour above 400 degrees C can be explained due to the release of oxygen and simultaneous reduction of Pr4+, forming Pr3+ and oxygen vacancies.","Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
11,17148,The results are in accordance with the two competing processes of forming vacancies (lattice contraction) and ionic radius change (lattice expansion),"Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001

13,17148,"After cooling in air, the samples showed no residual expansion.","Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
14,17148,"In contrast, these samples displayed a remarkable residual expansion in argon of about 0.87% of the total relative expansion of 1.85% for Ce0.8Pr0.2O2 - delta.","Expansion behaviour of (Gd, Pr)-substituted CeO2 in dependence on temperature and oxygen partial pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.001
