1,18818,Considerable attention has been directed to understanding the influence of heterointerfaces between Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases and ABO(3) perovskites on the kinetics of oxygen electrocatalysis at elevated temperatures.,Influence of Heterointerfaces on the Kinetics of Oxygen Surface Exchange on Epitaxial La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 Thin Films,10.3390/app11093778
2,18818,"Here, we report the effect of heterointerfaces on the oxygen surface exchange kinetics by employing heteroepitaxial oxide thin films formed by decorating LaNiO3 (LNO) on La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) thin films.",Influence of Heterointerfaces on the Kinetics of Oxygen Surface Exchange on Epitaxial La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 Thin Films,10.3390/app11093778

4,18818,"The oxygen surface exchange coefficients (k(chem)) of LSCO films extracted from electrical conductivity relaxation curves significantly increase with partial decorations of LNO, whereas full LNO coverage leads to the reduction in the k(chem) of LSCO films.",Influence of Heterointerfaces on the Kinetics of Oxygen Surface Exchange on Epitaxial La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 Thin Films,10.3390/app11093778
5,18818,The activation energy for oxygen exchange in LSCO films significantly decreases with partial LNO decorations in contrast with the full coverage of LNO.,Influence of Heterointerfaces on the Kinetics of Oxygen Surface Exchange on Epitaxial La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 Thin Films,10.3390/app11093778

7,18818,We attribute the enhanced oxygen surface exchange kinetics of LSCO to the increased oxygen vacancies by creating the heterointerface between LSCO and LNO.,Influence of Heterointerfaces on the Kinetics of Oxygen Surface Exchange on Epitaxial La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 Thin Films,10.3390/app11093778
