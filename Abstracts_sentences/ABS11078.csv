1,11078,"Results are presented on a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode material designed for use with C-containing fuels: a composite of an electronically conducting ceramic, La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.8Mn0.2O3-delta, an ionically conducting ceramic, Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.9)5 (GDC), and a small fraction Ni.",A fuel-flexible ceramic-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1473258
2,11078,These ceramic-based anodes were tested in SOFCs with GDC bulk electrolytes.,A fuel-flexible ceramic-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1473258
3,11078,The anode performance was comparable to that for Ni-GDC anodes with hydrogen and methane fuels.,A fuel-flexible ceramic-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1473258
4,11078,"The anodes also provided good performance with propane and butane and, unlike Ni-GDC, there was little or no coking.",A fuel-flexible ceramic-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1473258
5,11078,"The 4 wt % Ni content in the anode was necessary to obtain good performance, indicating that a small amount of Ni provides a substantial electrocatalytic effect while not causing coking.",A fuel-flexible ceramic-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1473258
6,11078,Initial cell test results showed good cell stability and indicated that the anodes were not affected by cyclic oxidation and reduction.,A fuel-flexible ceramic-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1473258
