1,8702,"In this article, a dynamic, lumped model of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is described, as a step towards developing control relevant models for a SOFC combined with a gas turbine (GT) in an autonomous power system.",Modeling and control of a SOFC-GT-based autonomous power system,10.1016/j.energy.2006.07.034
2,8702,The model is evaluated against a distributed dynamic tubular SOFC model.,Modeling and control of a SOFC-GT-based autonomous power system,10.1016/j.energy.2006.07.034
3,8702,The simulation results confirm that the simple model is able to capture the important dynamics of the SOFC and hence it is concluded that the simple model can be used for control and operability studies of the hybrid system.,Modeling and control of a SOFC-GT-based autonomous power system,10.1016/j.energy.2006.07.034
4,8702,Several such lumped models can be aggregated to approximate the distributed nature of important variables of the SOFC.,Modeling and control of a SOFC-GT-based autonomous power system,10.1016/j.energy.2006.07.034
5,8702,"Further, models of all other components of a SOFC-GT-based autonomous power system are developed and a control structure for the total system is developed.",Modeling and control of a SOFC-GT-based autonomous power system,10.1016/j.energy.2006.07.034
