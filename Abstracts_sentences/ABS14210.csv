1,14210,"In this study, the balance of plant (BOP) of an ethanol-fueled SOFC is analyzed using the GCTool software package developed by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL).",Efficiency analyses of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.03.044
2,14210,The effects of the excess air ratio and fuel utilization on the electric and heat efficiencies of the SOFC are systematically examined for two reforming methods (steam reforming and auto-thermal reforming) and two flow sheets (BOP A and BOP B).,Efficiency analyses of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.03.044
3,14210,"In BOP A, the cathode off-gas is passed directly to the afterburner together with the unreacted fuel, and the hot flue gas exiting the burner is then used to provide the thermal energy required for the ethanol reforming process.",Efficiency analyses of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.03.044
4,14210,"In BOP B, the cathode off-gas is passed through a heat exchanger in order to heat the ethanol fuel prior to the reforming process, and is then flowed into the burner with the unreacted fuel.",Efficiency analyses of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.03.044
5,14210,"The results show that given an SOFC inlet temperature of 650 degrees C, a fuel utilization of 70.2% and excess air ratios of 4, 6 and 7, respectively, the overall system efficiency is equal to 74.9%, 72.3% and 71.0%.",Efficiency analyses of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.03.044
6,14210,"In general, the results presented in this study provide a useful starting point for the design and development of practical ethanol-fueled SOFC test systems.",Efficiency analyses of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.03.044
