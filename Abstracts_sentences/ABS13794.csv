1,13794,"A series of silver (Ag)-modified barium cobalt ferrous niobate (Ba1-xCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta, BCFN) materials were fabricated using a solid-state method by doping silver cations into the A-site of this perovskite matrix (Ag-BCFN).",Silver-Modified Ba1-xCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite Performing as a Cathodic Catalyst of Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b19634
2,13794,The electrochemical analyses indicated that the Ag-BCFN cathodic catalysts performed superior to the nonmodified catalysts when applied in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Silver-Modified Ba1-xCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite Performing as a Cathodic Catalyst of Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b19634
3,13794,"These Ag-BCFN_cathodic catalysts displayed a cubic perovskite structure (PDF 75-0227, Pm (3) over barm, alpha = 90 degrees) with a high degree of crystallinity, as demonstrated by X-ray powder diffraction analyses.",Silver-Modified Ba1-xCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite Performing as a Cathodic Catalyst of Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b19634
4,13794,"It was also found that the in situ exsolution of the silver ion (Ag+) occurred, where 57.9% of doped Ag+ was reduced into metallic Ag particles with size ranging from 5 to 10 nm, as shown by electron microscopic analyses.",Silver-Modified Ba1-xCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite Performing as a Cathodic Catalyst of Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b19634
5,13794,The cerium gadolinium oxide (Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta) electrolyte-supported symmetrical half cell using different Ag-BCFN formulations of Ba1-xAgxCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta as electrodes showed a polarization resistance as low as 0.233 Omega.cm(2) and an exchange current density of 85.336 mA.cm(-2) at 650 degrees C under ambient pressure.,Silver-Modified Ba1-xCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite Performing as a Cathodic Catalyst of Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b19634
6,13794,The improved electrochemical kinetics is anticipated to be attributed to two reasons: doping of ions (Ag+) in the A-site of perovskite and in situ exsolved silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) along the edge and on the surface of BCFNs improving the mobile charge and electrical properties of the material.,Silver-Modified Ba1-xCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite Performing as a Cathodic Catalyst of Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b19634
7,13794,"The remaining Ag+ in the A-site induced the electron redistribution, whereas the Ag NPs were found to increase the electrochemically active sites and enable the formation of a triple-phase boundary.",Silver-Modified Ba1-xCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite Performing as a Cathodic Catalyst of Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b19634
8,13794,"These explanations were confirmed by the density functional theory study, indicating that Ag-doping processes lead to a decrease in the formation energy of oxygen vacancies from 1.72 to 1.42 eV upon the partial substitution of Ba2+ by Ag+ cations.",Silver-Modified Ba1-xCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite Performing as a Cathodic Catalyst of Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b19634
