1,4793,Catalytically active cathode materials are highly desirable for the development of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).,Infiltrated Sr0.9Y0.1CoO2.5+δ nanoparticles as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells operated at 450-650 °C,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.206
2,4793,"In the present study, we report the performance of a high-loading Sr0.9Y0.1CoO2.5+delta (SYC10) nanoparticles (NPs) as a catalytic cathode infiltrated in Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (GDC) backbones for LT-SOFCs and the use of a low-loading SYC10 NPs as a catalyst for promoting the performance of a commercial cathode.",Infiltrated Sr0.9Y0.1CoO2.5+δ nanoparticles as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells operated at 450-650 °C,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.206
3,4793,The loading and calcination temperature of SYC10 NPs were systematically optimized to achieve the lowest area-specific polarization resistance at <= 650 degrees C. A significant reduction in polarization resistance of commercial LSCF cathode by SYC NPs has also been demonstrated at 650 degrees C.
