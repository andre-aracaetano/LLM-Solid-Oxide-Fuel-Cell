5,13976,"Morphology and the sigma(E) of this Ag/SSZ cermet cathode were unchanged at 773 K in air by application of cathodic DC bias of 0.5 V These results suggest that this Ag-SSZ cermet cathode has enough electrode reactivity and durability for a 773-K operating SOFCs for 700 h. This high-electrode reactivity can be originated from an increase of reaction site and a small activation energy, E-a. These results suggested that an Ag-SSZ might be a suitable cathode material for SOFCs operated at 773 K.",Ag-Zr(SC)O2 cermet cathode for reduced temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.026
