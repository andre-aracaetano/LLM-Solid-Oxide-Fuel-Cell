1,17261,Samaria-doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with Cu-SDC and Cu-CeO2-SDC anode composites were fabricated.,SOFCs for direct oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels with samaria-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1149/1.1553765
2,17261,Current-voltage and impedance-spectroscopy measurements were used to characterize their performance at temperatures between 600 and 700degreesC. The cells demonstrated the ability to directly utilize not only hydrogen (H-2) but also dry butane (C4H10) fuel.,SOFCs for direct oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels with samaria-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1149/1.1553765
3,17261,"At 700degreesC, the maximum power density of a cell with a Cu-CeO2-SDC anode composite was 246 and 170 mW/cm(2) for H-2 and C4H10 fuels, respectively.",SOFCs for direct oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels with samaria-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1149/1.1553765
4,17261,"Impedance spectra suggested that for butane fuel, the anode resistance significantly limits the overall cell performance.",SOFCs for direct oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels with samaria-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1149/1.1553765
5,17261,It was shown that the addition of pure ceria to the anode significantly increased the catalytic activity for oxidation reactions and decreased the anode resistances.,SOFCs for direct oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels with samaria-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1149/1.1553765
