1,11002,"The charge transportation in the solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte, Sm0.2Ce0.8O2- (SDC); has been elucidated by using DC and AC measurements as a function of grain size at temperature 500 degrees C. Initially, chemically homogeneous pellets of SDC were prepared using its powder synthesized by oxalate co-precipitation method and then mean crystallite-size of the SDC samples was varied by adjusting the sintering temperature.",Synthesis and Performance Tuning of Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ Electrolyte for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Application,10.1007/s11664-019-07184-9
