1,13933,"A mono-block-layer build solid oxide fuel cell model (MOLB type SOFC) is established, which takes into account the contact resistance at the electrode/interconnector interface due to the produce of the oxide scale.",The analysis of structure parameters of MOLB type solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.251
2,13933,"The influence of structure parameter on the MOLB type SOFC performance is investigated, which includes that the anode thickness, cathode thickness, the anode/interconnector interface width, the cathode/interconnector interface width, the channel height, anode porosity and cathode porosity.",The analysis of structure parameters of MOLB type solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.251
3,13933,"Although most re- searchers reported that the performance of MOLB type SOFC was superior to that of planar type SOFC, this work revealed that at the condition of the lower cathode thickness (<100 mu m), the MOLB type SOFC performance was worse than that of the planar type SOFC.",The analysis of structure parameters of MOLB type solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.251
4,13933,"Moreover, for the MOLB type SOFC, the power density per unit area slightly rises with the increase of channel height, but the power density per unit volume sorely drops with the increase of channel height.",The analysis of structure parameters of MOLB type solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.251
5,13933,"Consequently, the structure parameters of the MOLB type SOFC affect the cell performance significantly.",The analysis of structure parameters of MOLB type solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.251
