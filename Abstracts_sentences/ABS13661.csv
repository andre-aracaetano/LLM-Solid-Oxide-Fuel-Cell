1,13661,The performance of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 (LSGM) as an optimized electrolyte of a solid oxide fuel cell was tested on single cells having a 500-mu m-thick electrolyte membrane.,"Superior perovskite oxide-ion conductor;: strontium- and magnesium-doped LaGaO3:: III, Performance tests of single ceramic fuel cells",
2,13661,The reactivity of NiO and LSGM suggested use of an interlayer to prevent formation of LaNiO3.,"Superior perovskite oxide-ion conductor;: strontium- and magnesium-doped LaGaO3:: III, Performance tests of single ceramic fuel cells",
3,13661,The interlayer Sm-CeO2 was selected and sandwiched between the electrolyte and anode.,"Superior perovskite oxide-ion conductor;: strontium- and magnesium-doped LaGaO3:: III, Performance tests of single ceramic fuel cells",
4,13661,Comparison of Sm-CeO2/Sm-CeO2 + Ni and Sm-CeO2 + Ni as anodes showed that Sm-CeO2/Sm-CeO2 + Ni gave an exchange current density 4 times higher than that of Sm-CeO2 + Ni.,"Superior perovskite oxide-ion conductor;: strontium- and magnesium-doped LaGaO3:: III, Performance tests of single ceramic fuel cells",
5,13661,The peak power density of the interlayered cell is 100 mW higher than that of the standard cell without the interlayer.,"Superior perovskite oxide-ion conductor;: strontium- and magnesium-doped LaGaO3:: III, Performance tests of single ceramic fuel cells",
6,13661,This improvement is due to a significant reduction of the anode overpotential; the overpotential of the cathode La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSCo) remained unchanged.,"Superior perovskite oxide-ion conductor;: strontium- and magnesium-doped LaGaO3:: III, Performance tests of single ceramic fuel cells",
7,13661,"Comparison of the peak power density in this study and with that of a previous study, also with a 500-mu m-thick electrolyte, indicates a factor of 2 improvement, i.e., from 270 mW/cm(2) to 550 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C.","Superior perovskite oxide-ion conductor;: strontium- and magnesium-doped LaGaO3:: III, Performance tests of single ceramic fuel cells",
8,13661,The excellent cell performance showed that an LSGM-based thick membrane SOFC operating at temperatures 600 degrees <,"Superior perovskite oxide-ion conductor;: strontium- and magnesium-doped LaGaO3:: III, Performance tests of single ceramic fuel cells",
9,13661,T-op < 800 degrees C is a realistic goal.,"Superior perovskite oxide-ion conductor;: strontium- and magnesium-doped LaGaO3:: III, Performance tests of single ceramic fuel cells",
