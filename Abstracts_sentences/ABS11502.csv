2,11502,"For low levels of dopant, a small enhancement in the conductivity was observed; e.g. 31.6, 34.4 and 35.9S cm(-1) for Ba0.33Sr0.67Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, Ba0.33Sr0.67Co0.76Fe0.19B0.05O3-delta and Ba0.33Sr0.67Co0.76Fe0.19P0.05O3-delta, respectively, at 700 degrees C. Most significantly, oxyanion doping was shown to improve the stability of the cubic form of BSCF at intermediate temperatures (especially for P-doping), helping to prevent the transition to a hexagonal cell, and maintaining its excellent electrical properties.",Synthesis of oxyanion-doped barium strontium cobalt ferrites: Stabilization of the cubic perovskite and enhancement in conductivity,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.02.105
