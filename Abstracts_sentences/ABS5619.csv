1,5619,Partial internal electronic short circuit continues to be a main problem for ceria-based oxide-ion conductors.,"Novel reduction-resistant Ba(Ce,Zr)1-xGdxO3-δ electron-blocking layer for Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ electrolyte in IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.131
2,5619,A novel composite anode composed of BaZr0.45Ce0.45Gd0.1O3-delta and nickel (Ni-BZCG) is proposed to avoid partial reduction from Ce4+ to Ce3+ in Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (GDC) electrolyte by forming a functional electron-blocking interlayer in situ at Ni-BZCG vertical bar GDC interface.,"Novel reduction-resistant Ba(Ce,Zr)1-xGdxO3-δ electron-blocking layer for Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ electrolyte in IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.131
3,5619,"Open circuit voltages (OCVs) above 1.0 V at 650 degrees C can be achieved for cells with Ba-containing anodes, which are much higher than the value obtained with Ni-GDC anode (lower than 0.8 V) under the same conditions.","Novel reduction-resistant Ba(Ce,Zr)1-xGdxO3-δ electron-blocking layer for Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ electrolyte in IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.131
4,5619,"The enhanced OCVs are attributed to the formation of a new electron-blocking layer with GDC@Ba(Ce,Zr)(1-x)GdxO3-delta core/shell structure.","Novel reduction-resistant Ba(Ce,Zr)1-xGdxO3-δ electron-blocking layer for Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ electrolyte in IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.131
5,5619,The interrelations between the structural interlayer and the OCVs for improved cells are also studied.,"Novel reduction-resistant Ba(Ce,Zr)1-xGdxO3-δ electron-blocking layer for Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ electrolyte in IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.131
6,5619,"Furthermore, based on the microstructure of the new structured interlayers in the fuel cells, the high polarization resistance can be mainly attributed to the insulative BaNiO3-delta phase reducing reaction zone at anode.","Novel reduction-resistant Ba(Ce,Zr)1-xGdxO3-δ electron-blocking layer for Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ electrolyte in IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.131
