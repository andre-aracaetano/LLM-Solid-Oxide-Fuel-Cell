1,9701,A right-angular configuration for the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) has been proposed and operated successfully in a methane-oxygen mixture (CH4:O-2 = 2:1) with a total flow rate of 300 mL min(-1).,A right-angular configuration for the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.095
2,9701,It was fabricated by attaching the Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode and the Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9-impregnated La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) cathode on two mutually perpendicular planes of a YSZ electrolyte substrate.,A right-angular configuration for the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.095
3,9701,Effect of the relative position of the electrodes on the ohmic resistance has been investigated.,A right-angular configuration for the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.095
4,9701,It is shown that the cell exhibits the smallest ohmic resistance when the two electrodes are symmetrically located on the two planes.,A right-angular configuration for the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.095
5,9701,"Compared with the conventional coplanar SC-SOFC, this configuration can make full use of the edge area of the electrolyte substrate and shorten the conductive channel of oxygen ion, leading to a remarkable reduction in ohmic resistance, an elevation of the open-circuit voltage, and, ultimately, an improved performance.",A right-angular configuration for the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.095
6,9701,"The simple stack, consisting of two right-angular cells connected in series on an electrolyte, generated an open-circuit voltage 1.4 V at 700 degrees C and a maximum power 14.9 mW at 800 degrees C.
