1,1854,Apatite-type silicates have been considered as promising electrolytes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC): however studies on the potential use of these materials in SOFC devices have received relatively little attention.,Evaluation of apatite silicates as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.068
2,1854,"The lanthanum silicate with composition La10Si5.5Al0.5O26.75 has been evaluated as electrolyte with the electrode materials commonly used in SOFC, i.e. manganite, ferrite and cobaltite as cathode materials and NiO-CGO composite, chromium-manganite and Sr2MgMoO6 as anode materials.",Evaluation of apatite silicates as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.068
3,1854,"Chemical compatibility, area-specific resistance and fuel cell studies have been performed.",Evaluation of apatite silicates as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.068
4,1854,X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis did not reveal any trace of reaction products between the apatite electrolyte and most of the aforementioned electrode materials.,Evaluation of apatite silicates as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.068
5,1854,"However, the area-specific polarisation resistance (ASR) of these electrodes in contact with apatite electrolyte increased significantly with the sintering temperature, indicating reactivity at the electrolyte/electrode interface.",Evaluation of apatite silicates as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.068
6,1854,"On the other hand, the ASR values are significantly improved using a ceria buffer layer between the electrolyte and electrode materials to prevent reactivity.",Evaluation of apatite silicates as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.068
7,1854,"Maximum power densities of 195 and 65 mWcm(-2) were obtained at 850 and 700 degrees C, respectively in H-2 fuel, using an 1 mm-thick electrolyte, a NiO-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite as anode and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta as cathode materials.",Evaluation of apatite silicates as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.068
8,1854,This fuel cell was tested for 100 h in 5%H-2-Ar atmosphere showing stable performance.,Evaluation of apatite silicates as solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.068
