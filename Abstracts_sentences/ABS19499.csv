2,19499,"In order to improve the resistance for high temperature oxidation, the effect of crystallographic orientation on the early stage oxidation was investigated.",Influence of grain orientation on the incipient oxidation behavior of Haynes 230 at 900 °C,10.1016/j.matchar.2015.06.029
3,19499,It was demonstrated that different oxide thicknesses are formed on grains having different orientations.,Influence of grain orientation on the incipient oxidation behavior of Haynes 230 at 900 °C,10.1016/j.matchar.2015.06.029
4,19499,"Comparison of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) orientation maps before and after oxidation at 900 degrees C indicates that grains near (111) orientation, especially with the deviation angle from < 111 > that is smaller than 20, are more oxidation resistant than grains of other orientations.",Influence of grain orientation on the incipient oxidation behavior of Haynes 230 at 900 °C,10.1016/j.matchar.2015.06.029
5,19499,Correlation between the results of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to compare the oxidation rate of grains having different crystallographic orientation.,Influence of grain orientation on the incipient oxidation behavior of Haynes 230 at 900 °C,10.1016/j.matchar.2015.06.029
6,19499,"The oxidation rate was found to change with the crystallographic orientation as follows (111) < (110) < (100), also it was demonstrated that the oxidation rate changes are a nearly linear function of the angle of deviation from < 111 > direction.",Influence of grain orientation on the incipient oxidation behavior of Haynes 230 at 900 °C,10.1016/j.matchar.2015.06.029
