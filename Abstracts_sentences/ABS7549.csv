1,7549,"In present work, we reported an novel oxide-salt Al2O3-NaAlO2 composite, which was prepared by mixing Al2O3 and Na2CO3 two phase materials in different weight ratio, and then sintering at 1100 degrees C. The X-ray diffraction pattern, scanning-electron microscope and impedance spectra are applied to characterize the crystal structure, morphology and electrical properties of the Al2O3-NaAlO2 composite.",Advance fuel cells using Al2O3-nNaAlO2 composite as ion-conducting membrane,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.149
