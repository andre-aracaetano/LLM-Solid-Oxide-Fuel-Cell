1,20108,New CO2-resistant dual-phase Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.925-SrCo0.4Fe0.55Zr0.05O3-delta (SDC-SCFZ) ceramics present a promising outlook for potential future applications in membrane reactors and solid oxide fuel cells.,"SDC-SCFZ dual-phase ceramics: Structure, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, and O2 permeability",10.1111/jace.17665
2,20108,Their high oxygen permeation flux and stability in CO2 sweep gas also allow their integration in oxyfuel combustion.,"SDC-SCFZ dual-phase ceramics: Structure, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, and O2 permeability",10.1111/jace.17665
3,20108,"Here the structural characteristics, electrical conductivities, thermal expansion behaviors, and oxygen permeabilities of four different SDC-SCFZ membranes with weight ratios of 10:90, 25:75, 50:50, and 75:25 (SDC:SCFZ) are systematically studied.","SDC-SCFZ dual-phase ceramics: Structure, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, and O2 permeability",10.1111/jace.17665
4,20108,"Among these four SDC-SCFZ compositions, 0.6 mm-thick 25 wt% SDC-75","SDC-SCFZ dual-phase ceramics: Structure, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, and O2 permeability",10.1111/jace.17665
5,20108,wt% SCFZ displayed the highest oxygen permeation fluxes that reach 1.26 mL min(-1) cm(-2) at 950 degrees C and retained its phase integrity under alternating He and CO2 sweep gas over 72 hours of operation.,"SDC-SCFZ dual-phase ceramics: Structure, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, and O2 permeability",10.1111/jace.17665
6,20108,This composite also showed a moderate thermal expansion coefficient of 1.90 x 10(-5) K-1 between 30 degrees C and 1000 degrees C and an electrical conductivity of at least 16 S cm(-1) at 550 degrees C and above.,"SDC-SCFZ dual-phase ceramics: Structure, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, and O2 permeability",10.1111/jace.17665
7,20108,Modeling studies revealed that the oxygen permeation fluxes through 25SDC-75SCFZ are limited by surface exchange reactions from 700 degrees C to 800 degrees C and mixed bulk diffusion and surface exchange reactions above 800 degrees C.,"SDC-SCFZ dual-phase ceramics: Structure, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, and O2 permeability",10.1111/jace.17665
