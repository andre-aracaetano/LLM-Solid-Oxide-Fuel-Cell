1,14110,A fine NiO powder and a Sm-doped ceria powder with a composition of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 were synthesized by heating the oxalate precursors at 300-1200 degreesC in air to produce a cermet (anode material) for solid oxide fuel cell.,Thermal stability of nanometer-sized NiO and Sm-doped ceria powders,10.1557/JMR.2002.0333
2,14110,"A 0.2 M Ni(NO3)(2) solution and a 0.2 M Ce(NO3)(3)-Sm(NO3)(3) solution were mixed with 0.4 M oxalate solution, respectively, to produce the oxalate precursors.",Thermal stability of nanometer-sized NiO and Sm-doped ceria powders,10.1557/JMR.2002.0333
3,14110,Only the cubic phase of Ce0.8SM0.2O1.9 was formed in the calcined powders from the Sm-doped cerium oxalate.,Thermal stability of nanometer-sized NiO and Sm-doped ceria powders,10.1557/JMR.2002.0333
4,14110,"However, the mixed phases of NiO and Ni were produced in the NiO precursor after the calcination at 300-600 degreesC. At higher temperatures, only NiO was detected.",Thermal stability of nanometer-sized NiO and Sm-doped ceria powders,10.1557/JMR.2002.0333
5,14110,"The primary particle sizes, which were determined from the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis surface areas, were 60 nm for NiO and 10 nm for Ru/Sm-doped ceria (SDC) after the heat treatment at 400 degreesC. The oxalate precursors of SDC and NiO provided 433 and 259 kJ/mol of the activation energy, respectively, for sintering/grain growth in the temperature range from 600 to 1200 degreesC. As-produced SDC precursor formed platelike secondary particles of 0.5-2-mum length by the heating at 800 degreesC. Heating of Ni oxalate at 800 degreesC produced isotropic fine NiO secondary particles of 0.5-2-mum sizes.",Thermal stability of nanometer-sized NiO and Sm-doped ceria powders,10.1557/JMR.2002.0333
