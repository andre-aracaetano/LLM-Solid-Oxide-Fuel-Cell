2,7364,Impedance spectroscopy is used to deconvolute impedance spectra of an in-operating SOFC and identify limiting overpotentials.,Limiting Factors for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Under Different Flow and Temperature Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200154
3,7364,Those measurements are made under a wide range of flow and temperature conditions.,Limiting Factors for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Under Different Flow and Temperature Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200154
4,7364,"In particular, oxidant flow rate is varied yielding fuel cell operation with 20, 40, 60, 80% oxidant utilization; fuel is instead changed in terms of flow and composition: fuel utilization factors in the range of 20-80% are investigated as well as the dilution with nitrogen.",Limiting Factors for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Under Different Flow and Temperature Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200154
5,7364,The operating temperature is varied in the range between 650 and 800 degrees C with steps of 50 degrees C. Results show that charge and mass transport can lead to a performance limitation according to the selected operating range for the investigated cell design.,Limiting Factors for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Under Different Flow and Temperature Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200154
6,7364,"For the investigated anode-supported design, a major improvement of performance could arise by reducing ohmic resistances (i.e. employing a thin electrolyte) and by an improvement of the anode geometry aiming at enhancing mass transport.",Limiting Factors for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Under Different Flow and Temperature Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200154
7,7364,"In particular, at low temperature and high fuel utilization, fuel oxidation seems to be a relevant performance limiting factor.",Limiting Factors for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Under Different Flow and Temperature Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200154
