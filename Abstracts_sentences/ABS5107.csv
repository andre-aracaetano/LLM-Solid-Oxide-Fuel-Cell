1,5107,Apatite silicates have recently been reported as promising electrolyte materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Synthesis and characterization of apatite-type La9.67Si6-xAlxO26.5-x/2 electrolyte materials and compatible cathode materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.07.014
2,5107,"In this work, a series of apatite-type compounds La9.67Si6-xAlxO26.5-x/2 (LSAO) with x=0-2 are synthesized by the sol-gel process at calcining temperature of 800-900 degrees C. Thermal expansion coefficient, relative density and electrical conductivity of these samples with different Al doped contents are investigated.",Synthesis and characterization of apatite-type La9.67Si6-xAlxO26.5-x/2 electrolyte materials and compatible cathode materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.07.014
