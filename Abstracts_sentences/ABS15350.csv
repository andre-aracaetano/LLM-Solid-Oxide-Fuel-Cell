1,15350,"(Sc2O3)0.1(CeO2)0.01(ZrO2)0.89 (SCSZ) ceramic electrolyte has superior ionic conductivity in the intermediate temperature range (700800?degrees C), but it does not exhibit good phase and chemical stability in comparison with 8?mol% Y2O3ZrO2 (YSZ).",Layered YSZ/SCSZ/YSZ Electrolytes for Intermediate Temperature SOFC Part I: Design and Manufacturing,10.1002/fuce.201200008
2,15350,"To maintain high ionic conductivity and improve the stability in the whole electrolyte, layered structures with YSZ outer layers and SCSZ inner layers were designed.",Layered YSZ/SCSZ/YSZ Electrolytes for Intermediate Temperature SOFC Part I: Design and Manufacturing,10.1002/fuce.201200008
3,15350,"Because of a mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion and Young's moduli of SCSZ and YSZ phases, upon cooling of the electrolytes after sintering, thermal residual stresses will arise, leading to a possible strengthening of the layered composite and, therefore, an increase in the reliability of the electrolyte.",Layered YSZ/SCSZ/YSZ Electrolytes for Intermediate Temperature SOFC Part I: Design and Manufacturing,10.1002/fuce.201200008
4,15350,"Laminated electrolytes with three, four, and six layers design were manufactured using tape-casting, lamination, and sintering techniques.",Layered YSZ/SCSZ/YSZ Electrolytes for Intermediate Temperature SOFC Part I: Design and Manufacturing,10.1002/fuce.201200008
5,15350,"After sintering, while the thickness of YSZ outer layers remained constant at similar to 30?mu m, the thickness of the SCSZ inner layer varied from similar to 30?mu m for a YSCY three-layered electrolyte, similar to 60?mu m for a Y2SCY four-layered electrolyte, and similar to 120?mu m for a Y4SCY six-layered electrolyte.",Layered YSZ/SCSZ/YSZ Electrolytes for Intermediate Temperature SOFC Part I: Design and Manufacturing,10.1002/fuce.201200008
6,15350,"The microstructure, crystal structure, impurities present, and the density of the sintered electrolytes were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray and neutron diffraction, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and water immersion techniques.",Layered YSZ/SCSZ/YSZ Electrolytes for Intermediate Temperature SOFC Part I: Design and Manufacturing,10.1002/fuce.201200008
