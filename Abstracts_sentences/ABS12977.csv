2,12977,"Herein, a new family of SrCo0.9-xNb0.1NixO3-delta (SCNN, 0.1 <= x <= 0.3) perovskites have been developed as a promising cathode for IT-SOFCs with improved cathode attributes with respect to their parent compound, SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3-delta (SCN).",A highly active and stable cathode for oxygen reduction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9se01096c
3,12977,Partial Ni substitution enhanced the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity for SrCo0.9-xNb0.1NixO3-delta.,A highly active and stable cathode for oxygen reduction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9se01096c
4,12977,"The SrCo0.7Nb0.1Ni0.2O3-delta (SCNN2) cathode exhibited a polarization resistance of 0.066 omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air, 44% lower than that of SCN.",A highly active and stable cathode for oxygen reduction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9se01096c
5,12977,The remarkable ORR catalytic activity for SrCo0.9-xNb0.1NixO3-delta could be ascribed to the improved oxygen bulk diffusion and surface exchange coefficient arising from the introduction of oxygen vacancies with Ni doping according to electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results.,A highly active and stable cathode for oxygen reduction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9se01096c
6,12977,"Furthermore, the SCNN2 cathode demonstrated excellent stability in air and high CO2 tolerance and recovery performance, demonstrating that the SCNN2 perovskite can be a very promising cathode for application in IT-SOFCs and other energy transformation systems.",A highly active and stable cathode for oxygen reduction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9se01096c
