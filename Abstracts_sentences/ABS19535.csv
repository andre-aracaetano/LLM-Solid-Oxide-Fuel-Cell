5,19535,"Compared with individually synthesized LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-8 (LNF), the co-synthesized LNF-LDC nanoparticles have a larger amount of oxygen vacancy and higher oxygen mobility due to a strong synergistic effect.",High-performance LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-8-La0.45Ce0.55O2-8 nanoparticles co-loaded oxygen electrode for solid oxide steam electrolysis,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.052
6,19535,"Secondly, the LNF-LDC nanoparticles co-loaded oxygen electrode exhibits a higher electrochemical performance than the single LNF loaded LSM-YSZ electrode.",High-performance LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-8-La0.45Ce0.55O2-8 nanoparticles co-loaded oxygen electrode for solid oxide steam electrolysis,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.052
7,19535,"Under 800 ? and 50% A.H., the cell with LSM-YSZ@LNF-LDC-4 mu L delivers -1.18 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V, which is 2.03 times higher than the cell with LSM-YSZ@LNF-4 mu L. Therefore, co-loading LNF-LDC is a promising method to develop a highly efficient oxygen electrode for solid oxide steam electrolysis.",High-performance LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-8-La0.45Ce0.55O2-8 nanoparticles co-loaded oxygen electrode for solid oxide steam electrolysis,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.052
