4,4986,Reactions between the component layers of the stack were examined in terms of elemental diffusion.,"Reactions of (La,Ca) CrO3 sealants in yttria-stabilized zirconia-(La,Ca) CrO3 planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks",10.1016/0254-0584(96)80084-8
5,4986,The YSZ film produced by the doctor blade technique yields about the same electrical conductivity as the YSZ pellet.,"Reactions of (La,Ca) CrO3 sealants in yttria-stabilized zirconia-(La,Ca) CrO3 planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks",10.1016/0254-0584(96)80084-8
6,4986,"During the joining, the Ca in the sealant diffused and dissolved into YSZ and La0.8Ca0.23CrO3, and the sealants reacted with YSZ to form CaZrO3 phase at the interface.","Reactions of (La,Ca) CrO3 sealants in yttria-stabilized zirconia-(La,Ca) CrO3 planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks",10.1016/0254-0584(96)80084-8
7,4986,The joining was accomplished by the formation of thick CaZrO3 layers at the interface.,"Reactions of (La,Ca) CrO3 sealants in yttria-stabilized zirconia-(La,Ca) CrO3 planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks",10.1016/0254-0584(96)80084-8
