1,10413,The present paper describes the fabrication of a bilayer structured solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Nickel-based anode with microstructured molybdenum dioxide internal reformer for liquid hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.05.048
2,10413,Its anode consists of molybdenum dioxide (MoO2)-based internal micro-reformer in the form of a porous thin film deposited over conventional Ni/YSZ cermet.,Nickel-based anode with microstructured molybdenum dioxide internal reformer for liquid hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.05.048
3,10413,Cell performance was measured by directly feeding a mixture of n-dodecane and air at different O-2/C ratios to the anode at 750 degrees C.,Nickel-based anode with microstructured molybdenum dioxide internal reformer for liquid hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.05.048
4,10413,Our findings show that the bilayer structured SOFC operating at an O-2/C ratio of 0.64 led to the highest initial cell performance with an initial maximum power density >4.0 W cm(-2).,Nickel-based anode with microstructured molybdenum dioxide internal reformer for liquid hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.05.048
5,10413,"At a constant voltage of 0.7V and O-2/C ratio of 0.64, the bilayer structured SOFC showed a gradual increase in power density output over the first 2 h, followed by a stable output of 3.6W cm(-2) for the next 10 h. The tested cell showed no indication of coking and phase transformation.",Nickel-based anode with microstructured molybdenum dioxide internal reformer for liquid hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.05.048
6,10413,"When a conventional Ni-based SOFC without the internal micro-reformer was operated under similar conditions, its initial performance and long-term stability were found to be significantly lower than that of bilayer structured SOFC due to Ni oxidation under high O-2/C ratio or coking under the low O-2/C ratio.",Nickel-based anode with microstructured molybdenum dioxide internal reformer for liquid hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.05.048
7,10413,These results open up new opportunities for efficiently generating electrical power from various types of high energy density liquid fuels using SOFCs with an integrated MoO2 micro- reformer.,Nickel-based anode with microstructured molybdenum dioxide internal reformer for liquid hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.05.048
