2,4027,Small-scale cells were fabricated by the extrusion of a microtubular (La(0.8)Sr(0.2))(0.97)MnO(3) support and subsequent surface coating with a Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.95)/Sc(2)O(3)-doped ZrO(2) bilayer electrolyte and NiO-Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.95) anode layers.,Effects of Anode Microstructure on the Performances of Cathode-Supported Micro-SOFCs,10.1149/1.3204647
