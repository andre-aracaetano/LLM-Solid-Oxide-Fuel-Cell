1,6955,"The Ni-Co and Ni-Co-Cu alloy coatings, as the interconnect for solid oxide fuel cells, were fabricated on the SUS430 substrate by electroplating to reduce the oxide growth kinetics and outward diffusion of Cr. Ni-Co and Ni-Co-Cu alloy coatings were oxidized at 800 degrees C for 1000 h. Our experimental results indicated that the Cu addition improved the electrical behavior of Ni-Co alloy coating.",Effect of Cu on the diffusion behavior and electrical properties of Ni-Co conversion coating for metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161358
