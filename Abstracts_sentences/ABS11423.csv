1,11423,A probabilistic-based component design methodology is developed for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack.,Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
2,11423,This method takes into account the randomness in SOFC material properties as well as the stresses arising from different manufacturing and operating conditions.,Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
3,11423,The purpose of this work is to provide the SOFC designers a design methodology so that the desired level of component reliability can be achieved with deterministic design functions using an equivalent safety factor to account for the uncertainties in material properties and structural stresses.,Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
4,11423,Multiphysics-based finite element analyses were used to predict the electrochemical and thermal mechanical responses of SOFC stacks with different geometric variations and under different operating conditions.,Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
5,11423,Failures in the anode and the seal were used as design examples.,Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
6,11423,"The predicted maximum principal stresses in the anode and the seal were compared with the experimentally determined strength characteristics for the anode and the seal, respectively.",Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
7,11423,Component failure probabilities for the current design were then calculated under different operating conditions.,Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
8,11423,It was found that anode failure probability is very low under all conditions examined.,Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
9,11423,"The seal failure probability is relatively high, particularly for high fuel utilization rate under low average cell temperature.",Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
10,11423,"Next, the procedures for calculating the equivalent safety factors for the anode and seal were demonstrated so that a uniform failure probability of the anode and seal can be achieved.",Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
11,11423,Analysis procedures were also included for non-normal distributed random variables so that more realistic distributions of strength and stress can be analyzed using the proposed design methodology.,Probabilistic-Based Design Methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1115/1.2971054
