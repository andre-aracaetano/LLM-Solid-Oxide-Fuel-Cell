1,12845,"Recently, a novel cathode material PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (PBSCF) has been proposed as a solution to overcome the drawbacks of a conventional cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",A collaborative study of sintering and composite effects for a PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ IT-SOFC cathode,10.1039/c3ra45296d
2,12845,Here we report systematic procedures to optimize the sintering temperature and the composite for PBSCF as an IT-SOFC cathode.,A collaborative study of sintering and composite effects for a PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ IT-SOFC cathode,10.1039/c3ra45296d
3,12845,"For optimization of the heat treatment conditions for a PBSCF composite cathode, the effects of sintering temperature on the microstructure and electrical transport properties of the material are examined.",A collaborative study of sintering and composite effects for a PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ IT-SOFC cathode,10.1039/c3ra45296d
4,12845,"We also suggest the optimization processes to effectively expand the electrochemical reaction zone based on a combination of a mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC) electrode and an ionically conducting phase (PBSCF-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) x, x = 0, 20, 40, 50, and 60 wt%).",A collaborative study of sintering and composite effects for a PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ IT-SOFC cathode,10.1039/c3ra45296d
5,12845,"The optimal intersection point between these two processing systems is revealed to be 50 wt% of GDC containing a composite cathode sintered at 950 degrees C for 4 h. The area specific resistance (ASR) of PBSCF-GDC50 sintered at 950 degrees C for 4 h reaches a minimum value of 0.052 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, which is consistent with the electrochemical performance results representing peak power density of similar to 2.0 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C.",A collaborative study of sintering and composite effects for a PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ IT-SOFC cathode,10.1039/c3ra45296d
