1,10108,"As part of an effort to develop robust metallic interconnects for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, a Ni-Mo-Cr alloy is designed, prepared, and investigated in terms of its microstructure, mechanical property, thermal expansion behavior, oxidation resistance, and electrical property.",Ni-Mo-Cr alloy for Interconnect Applications in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3010385
2,10108,"The developed Ni-Mo-Cr alloy possesses a good thermal expansion compatibility with cell components with a coefficient of thermal expansion smaller than 14x10(-6)/degrees C at temperature below 800 degrees C. Upon oxidation at 750 degrees C in air, the oxide scale consisted of two kinds of oxide with densely packed and Cr-free NiMn2O4 on top of continuous Cr2O3, and MoNi3 intermetallic compound layer is formed underneath the oxide scale.",Ni-Mo-Cr alloy for Interconnect Applications in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3010385
