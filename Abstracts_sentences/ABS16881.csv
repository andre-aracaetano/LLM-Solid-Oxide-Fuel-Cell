9,16881,"The cathode polarization resistance and overpotential at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) were 0.850 Omega cm(-2) and 110 mV in dry air, which decreased to 0.43 Omega cm(-2) and 52 mV, respectively, in wet air (similar to 3% H2O) at 650 degrees C. A decrease in impedance was also observed with polarization time; this was possibly caused by polarization-induced microstructure optimization.",Characterization and evaluation of BaCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ as a cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.010
