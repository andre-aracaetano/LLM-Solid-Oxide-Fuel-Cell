1,14000,"This article investigates a method in further improvement of a (La-0.8,Sr-0.2)MnO3 (LSM)-Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) dual composite cathode by adding material with high ionic conductivity such as gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC).",Synthesis of LSM-YSZ-GDC dual composite SOFC cathodes for high-performance power-generation systems,10.1007/s10800-012-0390-8
2,14000,"A nano-porous composite cathode containing LSM, YSZ, and GDC was prepared by a two-step polymerizable complex (PC) method which minimizes the formation of YSZ-GDC solid solution.",Synthesis of LSM-YSZ-GDC dual composite SOFC cathodes for high-performance power-generation systems,10.1007/s10800-012-0390-8
3,14000,"The structure of the resulting LSM/GDC-YSZ dual composite cathode was such that the LSM and GDC phases were present on the YSZ core particles without formation of the La2Zr2O7, SrZrO3, and GDC-YSZ solid solution.",Synthesis of LSM-YSZ-GDC dual composite SOFC cathodes for high-performance power-generation systems,10.1007/s10800-012-0390-8
