1,16230,LaNi(Fe)O-3 (LNF) is one of the promising cathode materials for intermediate- temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Application of LaNi(Fe)O3 as SOFC cathode,10.1149/1.1779628
2,16230,"However, LNF is more reactive with ZrO2-based electrolyte than conventional La(Sr)MnO3 in the sintering temperature region.",Application of LaNi(Fe)O3 as SOFC cathode,10.1149/1.1779628
3,16230,"In this paper, we examine the relationships among LNF sintering characteristics, reactivity, and cell performance to investigate the potential of LNF.",Application of LaNi(Fe)O3 as SOFC cathode,10.1149/1.1779628
4,16230,We show that the current-voltage characteristics of cells using LNF as the cathode are drastically improved by preliminary loading at a very high current density.,Application of LaNi(Fe)O3 as SOFC cathode,10.1149/1.1779628
5,16230,"The cathodic overvoltage became one order of magnitude smaller after the preliminary loading, and the cells generated the maximum power density of 1.56 W/cm(2) at 800 degreesC. (C) 2004 The Electrochemical Society.",Application of LaNi(Fe)O3 as SOFC cathode,10.1149/1.1779628
