2,11567,The effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure and electrical properties of the NLNC cathode material is investigated.,"Electrical behavior of the Ruddlesden-Popper phase, (Nd0.9La0.1)2 Ni0.75Cu0.25O4 (NLNC) and NLNC- x wt% Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) (x=10, 30 and 50), as intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.140
3,11567,"Likewise, composite cathode materials were also prepared by mixing the NLNC with 10, 30 and 50 wt% of Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) powders, and firing in the temperature range of 10001300 degrees C.","Electrical behavior of the Ruddlesden-Popper phase, (Nd0.9La0.1)2 Ni0.75Cu0.25O4 (NLNC) and NLNC- x wt% Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) (x=10, 30 and 50), as intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.140
4,11567,"The crystal structure and chemical compatibility of NLNC and SDC, and their microstructures were studied by XRD and SEM, respectively.","Electrical behavior of the Ruddlesden-Popper phase, (Nd0.9La0.1)2 Ni0.75Cu0.25O4 (NLNC) and NLNC- x wt% Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) (x=10, 30 and 50), as intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.140
5,11567,Electrical conductivity and performance of monolithic and composite electrodes as a function of the electrode composition is investigated experimentally through four probe method and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).,"Electrical behavior of the Ruddlesden-Popper phase, (Nd0.9La0.1)2 Ni0.75Cu0.25O4 (NLNC) and NLNC- x wt% Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) (x=10, 30 and 50), as intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.140
6,11567,The results proved that no reaction occur between NLNC and SDC compounds even at a temperature as high as 1300 degrees C. Maximum total electrical conductivity of 114.36 S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C is recorded for the pure NLNC material sintered at 1300 degrees C.,"Electrical behavior of the Ruddlesden-Popper phase, (Nd0.9La0.1)2 Ni0.75Cu0.25O4 (NLNC) and NLNC- x wt% Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) (x=10, 30 and 50), as intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.140
7,11567,"The polarization resistance of pure NLNC cathode was 0.43 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C; the NLNCSDC composite cathodes including 10, 30 and 50 wt% SDC displayed Rp value of 0.27 Omega cm(2), 0.11 Omega cm(2), and 0.19 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, respectively.","Electrical behavior of the Ruddlesden-Popper phase, (Nd0.9La0.1)2 Ni0.75Cu0.25O4 (NLNC) and NLNC- x wt% Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) (x=10, 30 and 50), as intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.140
