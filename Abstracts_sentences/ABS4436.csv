5,4436,"Furthermore, the result shows that about 47%similar to 54% of maximum 1st principal stress in SOFC is caused by the mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) among materials, while the other part of the maximum 1st principal stress is mainly caused by temperature gradient.",3D thermo-electro-chemo-mechanical coupled modeling of solid oxide fuel cell with double-sided cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.139
