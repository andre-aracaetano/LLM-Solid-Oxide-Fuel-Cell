1,10820,"A techno-economic assessment for biogas power generation projects with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in northern Japan has identified the required scale, required technological improvements and other key factors for making sufficient profit.",Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
2,10820,Dairy cattle manure was assumed as the organic waste for treatment in biogas plants.,Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
3,10820,"It was found that, for a 10,000-cattle scale project, if the only income is from the sale of electricity, the installation and maintenance cost of the biogas plant was the greatest contributor (33%), followed by the labor cost of the truck crew (20%) and the installation and maintenance cost of the SOFC (9.8%) on a present value basis calculated with a discount rate of 2% for a 20 year project period.",Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
4,10820,"Focused analyses on SOFC suggested that, under the current domestic situation (ca.",Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
5,10820,"FIT 4OJPY/kWh), further research and development to improve the durability of the system to at least ca.",Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
6,10820,"12,000 h is recommended.",Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
7,10820,It was also found that profitability is affected by the high treatment cost of liquid fertilizer when more is generated than can be sold.,Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
8,10820,R&D to reduce surplus liquid fertilizer by controlling the digestion process is thus important.,Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
9,10820,"Besides the above-mentioned technology improvements, to reach the break-even to make sufficient profit, it is also necessary to reduce the other dominant costs (biogas plant cost, waste collection cost) and increase the income (sale of by-products).",Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
10,10820,"For example, it is effective to shorten the waste collection distance by increasing the farm size, and to increase the income by selling the by-products.",Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
11,10820,"With the developed model, it is now possible to synthesize a profitable business plan for a biogas plant with SOFC, that takes these factors into account in advance, and to direct research efforts towards a wider possibility for use in this application.",Techno-Economic Assessment of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Based Biogas Power Plant Projects in Northern Japan,10.1252/jcej.20we224
