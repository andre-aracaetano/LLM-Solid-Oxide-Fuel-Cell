1,15557,A centrifugal casting technique was developed for depositing thin 8-mol%-yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte layers on porous NiO-YSZ anode substrates.,Thin yttrium-stabilized zirconia electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells by centrifugal casting,
2,15557,"After the bilayers were cosintered at 1400degreesC, dense pinhole-free YSZ coatings,with thicknesses of approximate to25 mum. were obtained, while the Ni-YSZ retained porosity.",Thin yttrium-stabilized zirconia electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells by centrifugal casting,
3,15557,"After La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF)-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) or La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM)-YSZ cathodes were deposited, single SOFCs produced near-theoretical open-circuit voltages and power densities of approximate to1 W/cm(2) at 800degreesC. Impedance spectra measured during cell tests showed that polarization resistances accounted for approximate to70%-80% of the total cell resistance.",Thin yttrium-stabilized zirconia electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells by centrifugal casting,
