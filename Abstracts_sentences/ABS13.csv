1,13,Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has experienced a growing interest in the last few decades because of generating energy more efficiently than the conventional combustion of fossil fuels.,Performance evaluation of La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ as both anode and cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.009
2,13,"By using the same material as anode and cathode of SOFC (symmetric fuel cell), the production of reliable and repeatable cells would be simpler.",Performance evaluation of La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ as both anode and cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.009
3,13,"In this work, La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-delta (LSCFN) perovskite has been prepared and evaluated as both cathode and anode material of symmetric fuel cell.",Performance evaluation of La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ as both anode and cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.009
4,13,The results of symmetric fuel cell show that a maximum peak power density of 500 mW cm(-2) has been achieved and the total electrode polarization resistances of the cell is only 0.22 Omega cm(2) at 850 degrees C which is much lower than that of typical symmetric fuel cell with La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta as electrode material.,Performance evaluation of La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ as both anode and cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.009
5,13,All of these results indicate that LSCFN can potentially be a promising candidate for the electrode material of symmetric fuel cell.,Performance evaluation of La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ as both anode and cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.009
