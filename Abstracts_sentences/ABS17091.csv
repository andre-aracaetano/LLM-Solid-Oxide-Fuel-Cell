1,17091,A-site deficient La(Sr)CrO3-delta thin film interconnectors were successfully fabricated on porous La(Sr)MnOx tubes using high deposition rate laser ablation.,PREPARATION OF LA(SR)CRO3-DELTA THIN-FILM INTERCONNECTOR BY HIGH DEPOSITION RATE LASER-ABLATION METHOD,10.1016/0167-2738(95)00200-P
2,17091,The La(Sr)CrO3-delta films obtained by this method are dense and void-free.,PREPARATION OF LA(SR)CRO3-DELTA THIN-FILM INTERCONNECTOR BY HIGH DEPOSITION RATE LASER-ABLATION METHOD,10.1016/0167-2738(95)00200-P
3,17091,The film deposition rate was about 10 mu m/min.,PREPARATION OF LA(SR)CRO3-DELTA THIN-FILM INTERCONNECTOR BY HIGH DEPOSITION RATE LASER-ABLATION METHOD,10.1016/0167-2738(95)00200-P
4,17091,The substrate could easily be masked in order to deposit the films in the desired shape.,PREPARATION OF LA(SR)CRO3-DELTA THIN-FILM INTERCONNECTOR BY HIGH DEPOSITION RATE LASER-ABLATION METHOD,10.1016/0167-2738(95)00200-P
5,17091,"The substrate tube was heated at 873-1073 K. As the substrate temperature was much lower than the sintering temperature of the substrate tube, the porous micro-structures of the substrate tube were maintained.",PREPARATION OF LA(SR)CRO3-DELTA THIN-FILM INTERCONNECTOR BY HIGH DEPOSITION RATE LASER-ABLATION METHOD,10.1016/0167-2738(95)00200-P
6,17091,The difference in chemical composition between the film and the target was negligible.,PREPARATION OF LA(SR)CRO3-DELTA THIN-FILM INTERCONNECTOR BY HIGH DEPOSITION RATE LASER-ABLATION METHOD,10.1016/0167-2738(95)00200-P
