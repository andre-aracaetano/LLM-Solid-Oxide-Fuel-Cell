1,5702,A simplified model is presented to analyse current-voltage characteristics of electrolyte supported solid oxide fuel cell stacks that run on reformed hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas.,"Automated, Model-Based Analysis of Uj-Data for Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Short-Stacks",10.1002/fuce.201000132
2,5702,"The model takes into account the fuel reforming process, fuel leakages and electrochemical conversions all in an idealised manner, i.e. it assumes thermodynamic equilibrium.","Automated, Model-Based Analysis of Uj-Data for Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Short-Stacks",10.1002/fuce.201000132
3,5702,"However, the model explicitly accounts for parameter variations that are often unavoidable under realistic testing conditions.","Automated, Model-Based Analysis of Uj-Data for Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Short-Stacks",10.1002/fuce.201000132
4,5702,"These variations include changes in the fuel composition, changes in the fuel mass fluxes and changes in the operation temperature.","Automated, Model-Based Analysis of Uj-Data for Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Short-Stacks",10.1002/fuce.201000132
5,5702,"In addition, internal repeat unit resistances as extracted from current-voltage data are compared with the ohmic and polarisation losses obtained from independent electrical impedance measurements data.","Automated, Model-Based Analysis of Uj-Data for Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Short-Stacks",10.1002/fuce.201000132
6,5702,"Since the data analysis is done in a highly automated fashion, large sets of current-voltage data can be compared and 'normal' data sets can be discriminated from 'abnormal' ones.","Automated, Model-Based Analysis of Uj-Data for Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Short-Stacks",10.1002/fuce.201000132
7,5702,The model has the potential to accelerate testing by eliminating variations that lead to corruption and unwanted scattering of current-voltage data.,"Automated, Model-Based Analysis of Uj-Data for Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Short-Stacks",10.1002/fuce.201000132
