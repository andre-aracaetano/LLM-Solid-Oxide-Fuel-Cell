3,8925,It is stated that the fuel utilization depends on H2O/CH4 mole ratio in the feeding fuel mixture and has a maximum at the ratio of about 2.6.,Thermodynamic analysis of a methane fed SOFC system based on a protonic conductor,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00363-6
4,8925,"It is stated that average EMF of the SOFC(H+) is higher than that of an SOFC based on oxygen ion conductor under the same conditions and, hence, the maximum efficiency of the SOFC(H-) system is about 15% higher than of the SOFC system based on oxygen ion conductor.",Thermodynamic analysis of a methane fed SOFC system based on a protonic conductor,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00363-6
