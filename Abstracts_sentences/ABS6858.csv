1,6858,"Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ, 8 mol% Y2O3) scaffolds, with surface areas up to 68 m(2)/g, were prepared by sintering hybrid inorganic-organic propylene oxide (PO) gels in an argon atmosphere between 1050 degrees C and 1350 degrees C. During sintering, a hard carbon template forms in situ that preserves the scaffold nanomorphology.",Preserving Nanomorphology in YSZ Scaffolds at High Temperatures via In Situ Carbon Templating of Hybrid Materials,10.1111/jace.14306
2,6858,"The carbon template is completely removed postsinter by heating in air to 700 degrees C. Surface areas of 24, 14, 3.2, and 2.4 m(2)/g were achieved for argon sintering temperatures of 1050 degrees C, 1150 degrees C, 1250 degrees C, and 1350 degrees C, respectively.",Preserving Nanomorphology in YSZ Scaffolds at High Temperatures via In Situ Carbon Templating of Hybrid Materials,10.1111/jace.14306
3,6858,"By adding glucose to the gel formulation, the amount of carbon template increases from 4 to 59 wt% and the surface area increases from 14 to 68 m(2)/g.",Preserving Nanomorphology in YSZ Scaffolds at High Temperatures via In Situ Carbon Templating of Hybrid Materials,10.1111/jace.14306
