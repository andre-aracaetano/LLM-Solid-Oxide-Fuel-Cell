1,4748,This simulation study is aimed to model a contemporary Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) CHP system having a 'heat and power' autonomy as well as a provision of demand-driven electrical supply to the grid.,Technoeconomic modelling and environmental assessment of a modern PEMFC CHP system: a case study of an eco-house at University of Nottingham,10.1007/s11356-019-06054-5
2,4748,A novel nanowire-electrode PEMFC stack is adopted within this PEMFC CHP system so to effectively replace the existing natural gas fuelled durable solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) CHP system installed at David Wilson Millennium Eco-house at University of Nottingham.,Technoeconomic modelling and environmental assessment of a modern PEMFC CHP system: a case study of an eco-house at University of Nottingham,10.1007/s11356-019-06054-5
3,4748,"The energy savings, environmental, and economic performances of the proposed PEMFC system are determined and compared to the base case (SOFC) which is operated continuously to maintain a 1.5 kWe.",Technoeconomic modelling and environmental assessment of a modern PEMFC CHP system: a case study of an eco-house at University of Nottingham,10.1007/s11356-019-06054-5
4,4748,"While to meetup the highly fluctuating and seasonal demands of heating and power like in the UK, a PEMFC is more productive and advantageous over a SOFC.",Technoeconomic modelling and environmental assessment of a modern PEMFC CHP system: a case study of an eco-house at University of Nottingham,10.1007/s11356-019-06054-5
5,4748,The proposed PEMFC unlike to the SOFC will be able to operate and adjust its output and turn down instantly as per changing conditions of ambient temperatures and loads in terms of electricity and heat.,Technoeconomic modelling and environmental assessment of a modern PEMFC CHP system: a case study of an eco-house at University of Nottingham,10.1007/s11356-019-06054-5
6,4748,"The results of the modelling predicted that as compared to the base case scenario, this PEMFC CHP system will efficiently reduce an annual CO2 emission by 65.99% and fiscal costs by 66.74% with a viable internal rate of return as 8.93% and benefit to cost ratio as 1.02.",Technoeconomic modelling and environmental assessment of a modern PEMFC CHP system: a case study of an eco-house at University of Nottingham,10.1007/s11356-019-06054-5
