1,6748,The performance of anode support of Ni-YSZ reduced from room temperature (T-R) to working temperature (T-w) and at Tw in anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell was investigated quantitatively in situ.,In suit Investigation of Anode Support on Cell Performance Reduced under Various Temperatures for Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400155
2,6748,A 2 mu m thick Pt voltage probe was embedded at the interface between the anode support and the function anode in the cell.,In suit Investigation of Anode Support on Cell Performance Reduced under Various Temperatures for Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400155
3,6748,"Results showed that the power densities of the stack that was reduced from T-R to T-w (stack 1) and stack reduced at T-w (stack 2) were 0.343 W cm(-2) and 0.583 W cm(-2) with the corresponding fuel utilization of 36.28% and 63.87%, respectively, under the operating voltage of 0.8 V.",In suit Investigation of Anode Support on Cell Performance Reduced under Various Temperatures for Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400155
4,6748,"The degradation rate of stack 1 was 7.76 times more than that of stack 2 when the stack was discharged under a constant current of 0.476 Acm(-2) for 100 h. Ni particles agglomerated in the anode support of the cell inside stack 1, whereas Ni particles in the anode support of the cell inside stack 2 were evenly distributed.",In suit Investigation of Anode Support on Cell Performance Reduced under Various Temperatures for Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400155
5,6748,The performance of stack 1 was poor mainly because of the increasing ohmic and polarization resistances caused by Ni agglomeration and decreasing porosity of the anode support.,In suit Investigation of Anode Support on Cell Performance Reduced under Various Temperatures for Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400155
