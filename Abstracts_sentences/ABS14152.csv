1,14152,"To investigate the application potential of Ce-0.85(SmxNd1-x)(0.15)O2-delta(SNDC) (x=0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) as electrolytes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC), single cells with identical electrode structures but using different electrolytes were fabricated.","Electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm, Nd co-doped Ce0.85(SMxNd1-x)0.15O2-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.076
2,14152,Their performance was investigated under identical conditions.,"Electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm, Nd co-doped Ce0.85(SMxNd1-x)0.15O2-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.076
3,14152,"It was found that the single cell with the SNDC (x=0.6) electrolyte had both the highest Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) and maximum power density (MPD) of 0.87 V and 715 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, respectively.","Electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm, Nd co-doped Ce0.85(SMxNd1-x)0.15O2-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.076
4,14152,This can be mainly attributed to the largest transference number of oxygen ions and the highest conductivity of the SNDC (x=0.6).,"Electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm, Nd co-doped Ce0.85(SMxNd1-x)0.15O2-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.076
5,14152,"An anode functional layer (AFL) was applied to another single cell, which used SNDC (x=0.6) as its electrolyte.","Electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm, Nd co-doped Ce0.85(SMxNd1-x)0.15O2-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.076
6,14152,"Subsequently, a significant improvement in the performance (the MPD at 600 degrees C was 980 mW cm(-2)) was achieved.","Electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm, Nd co-doped Ce0.85(SMxNd1-x)0.15O2-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.076
