1,16941,"The bulk structure, surface characteristics, catalytic properties, button cell performance, and stability of perovskite-type oxides with the formula Sr1-xCexCo0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (x = 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20) were investigated as potential anode electro-catalysts for solid oxide fuel cells.",Effect of Ce Doping on the Performance and Stability of Strontium Cobalt Ferrite Perovskites as SOFC Anode Catalysts,10.1007/s11244-015-0377-x
2,16941,In situ X-ray diffraction results indicated that the structural stability of the cerium-doped perovskites was enhanced with increasing cerium concentration.,Effect of Ce Doping on the Performance and Stability of Strontium Cobalt Ferrite Perovskites as SOFC Anode Catalysts,10.1007/s11244-015-0377-x
3,16941,The catalysts with lower cerium concentration transformed from the initial cubic structure to a lower symmetry structure at high temperatures in a reducing environment.,Effect of Ce Doping on the Performance and Stability of Strontium Cobalt Ferrite Perovskites as SOFC Anode Catalysts,10.1007/s11244-015-0377-x

7,16941,"The sulfur tolerance is significantly enhanced with the cerium-doped perovskites, showing no deactivation for up to 10 h of operation under 50 ppm H2S. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis on the poisoned samples suggests that the sulfur may exist on the surface primarily as strontium sulfate.",Effect of Ce Doping on the Performance and Stability of Strontium Cobalt Ferrite Perovskites as SOFC Anode Catalysts,10.1007/s11244-015-0377-x
8,16941,The sample with a cerium loading of 15 % (x = 0.15) showed a particularly high sulfur tolerance during chronoamperometry tests and its button cell performance matched well with that of Ni-YSZ anode.,Effect of Ce Doping on the Performance and Stability of Strontium Cobalt Ferrite Perovskites as SOFC Anode Catalysts,10.1007/s11244-015-0377-x
9,16941,"Sr1-xCexCo0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (x = 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20) samples may have potential for low or intermediate temperature SOFC operation in which sulfur-containing hydrocarbon fuels are used, although they would not be stable at higher temperatures.",Effect of Ce Doping on the Performance and Stability of Strontium Cobalt Ferrite Perovskites as SOFC Anode Catalysts,10.1007/s11244-015-0377-x
