1,677,"A binary gas permeation method is proposed to investigate gas transportation in the components of solid oxide fuel cells, in which the properties of porous media, such as pore diameter, porosity and the tortuosity factor, are obtained from the measured permeabilities of two different gases.",CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL COMPONENTS BY GAS-PERMEABILITY MEASUREMENT,10.1299/jsmeb1988.35.2_293
2,677,It is also confirmed experimentally that permeabilities can be predicted with high accuracy for other gases as well as for nonisobaric binary gas diffusion systems.,CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL COMPONENTS BY GAS-PERMEABILITY MEASUREMENT,10.1299/jsmeb1988.35.2_293
3,677,"Moreover, we consider the airtightness of plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia films and estimate the concentration polarization and distribution of total pressure in porous media at a high temperature.",CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL COMPONENTS BY GAS-PERMEABILITY MEASUREMENT,10.1299/jsmeb1988.35.2_293
