1,6350,"This paper presents a finite difference one-dimensional (1D) model of a single unit SOFC-SOEC stack, a novel technology based on the integration of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and solid oxide electrolyzer (SOEC), and a promising candidate for the high efficiency production of oxygen and/or hydrogen, especially for small scale applications.",A one dimensional solid oxide electrolyzer-fuel cell stack model and its application to the analysis of a high efficiency system for oxygen production,10.1016/j.ces.2012.06.032
2,6350,The model is applied to determine the performance of a SOFC-SOEC integrated system for oxygen production which has been previously analysed by means of a simplified zero-dimensional or lumped volume approach.,A one dimensional solid oxide electrolyzer-fuel cell stack model and its application to the analysis of a high efficiency system for oxygen production,10.1016/j.ces.2012.06.032
3,6350,The improved 1D model is used to explore the impact of different system configurations and operating conditions.,A one dimensional solid oxide electrolyzer-fuel cell stack model and its application to the analysis of a high efficiency system for oxygen production,10.1016/j.ces.2012.06.032
4,6350,It is shown that the simplified approach previously used overestimates the performance of the system by up to 60%.,A one dimensional solid oxide electrolyzer-fuel cell stack model and its application to the analysis of a high efficiency system for oxygen production,10.1016/j.ces.2012.06.032
5,6350,"Despite this, the results presented here show an electricity consumption in optimized conditions in the range of 0.35-0.5 kW h/kgO(2), still significantly lower than that of state of the art technology for small scale oxygen production systems.",A one dimensional solid oxide electrolyzer-fuel cell stack model and its application to the analysis of a high efficiency system for oxygen production,10.1016/j.ces.2012.06.032
