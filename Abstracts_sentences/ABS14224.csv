2,14224,The instances of insufficiency of potable water are predominant in coastal areas where power availability is also a challenge.,Parametric study of solid oxide fuel cell based novel power and desalination system,10.1080/15567036.2022.2066227
3,14224,"As an option, the desalination of seawater through the freezing and washing route can be integrated with power plants on seashores.",Parametric study of solid oxide fuel cell based novel power and desalination system,10.1080/15567036.2022.2066227
4,14224,This study aims to integrate a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-based direct energy conversion system with a gas turbine (GT) run on the Brayton cycle and Kalina cycle for power generation and utilization of the exhaust heat available from it to run a vapor absorption refrigeration system (VARS) to accomplish the freezing of seawater for its desalination.,Parametric study of solid oxide fuel cell based novel power and desalination system,10.1080/15567036.2022.2066227
5,14224,"Thus, the novel power and desalination system, namely, SOFC-GT-Kalina cycle-VARS combined system, is seen to offer the cumulative work output of 1594.34 kW at an efficiency of 60.73%, a cycle pressure ratio (CPR) of 12, and a turbine inlet temperature (TIT) of 1700 while desalinating water.",Parametric study of solid oxide fuel cell based novel power and desalination system,10.1080/15567036.2022.2066227
6,14224,"The maximum potable water is obtained at the rate of 10.38 m(3)/min, a CPR of 6, and a TIT of 1700 K with the power output of 1535.41 kW and efficiency of 58.46%.",Parametric study of solid oxide fuel cell based novel power and desalination system,10.1080/15567036.2022.2066227
7,14224,"In view of serious potable water crisis at seashores, the arrangement for power generation and desalination simultaneously is a quite attractive proposition.",Parametric study of solid oxide fuel cell based novel power and desalination system,10.1080/15567036.2022.2066227
