1,20032,Aerosol-assisted metallo-organic CVD (MOCVD) method (spray pyrolysis) has been employed to deposit thin films of solid electrolyte onto dense (NiO + YDC) substrates in our laboratory.,Aerosol-assisted MOCVD deposition of YDC thin films on (NiO plus YDC) substrates,10.1016/S0025-5408(00)00449-9
2,20032,"The beta -diketonate precursors Ce(tmhd)(4) and Y(tmhd)(3) were chosen as the source materials for deposition of yttria-doped ceria (YDC) thin films in the temperature range 500-700 degreesC. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation revealed the YDC films to have uniform and nanometric grains, with thickness ranging from 0.18 to 1.2 mum with different deposition times.",Aerosol-assisted MOCVD deposition of YDC thin films on (NiO plus YDC) substrates,10.1016/S0025-5408(00)00449-9
3,20032,X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses showed that the films possessed a single phase with a fluorite cubic structure.,Aerosol-assisted MOCVD deposition of YDC thin films on (NiO plus YDC) substrates,10.1016/S0025-5408(00)00449-9
4,20032,"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the elemental ratio Y/Ce of the film was close to that of the mixed solution precursor at a deposition temperature 600 degreesC. After being reduced in an H-2 atmosphere at 600 degreesC for 10 h, the (NiO + YDC) substrate was converted into Ni + YDC, The YDC thin film was found to be N-2 leak tight up to the pressure of 0.65 MPa.",Aerosol-assisted MOCVD deposition of YDC thin films on (NiO plus YDC) substrates,10.1016/S0025-5408(00)00449-9
5,20032,"AC impedance analyses showed that the ionic conductivity of YDC thin film on (Ni + YDC) substrate was slightly less than that of YDC prepared by sintering, but higher than that of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).",Aerosol-assisted MOCVD deposition of YDC thin films on (NiO plus YDC) substrates,10.1016/S0025-5408(00)00449-9
6,20032,"These results suggest that the YDC thin film obtained by aerosol-assisted MOCVD is a potential solid electrolyte alternative to YSZ, at intermediate operating temperatures, for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications.",Aerosol-assisted MOCVD deposition of YDC thin films on (NiO plus YDC) substrates,10.1016/S0025-5408(00)00449-9
