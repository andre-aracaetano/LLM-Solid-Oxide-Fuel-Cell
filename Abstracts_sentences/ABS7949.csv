3,7949,"Homogeneous coatings could be deposited over large areas within the coating zone, which is important for industrial applications.",Reactive magnetron sputtering of uniform yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings in an industrial setup,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.04.007
4,7949,The use of substrate bias during film growth was identified as a key parameter to promote less columnar coatings and made it possible to tailor the texture of films deposited on Si.,Reactive magnetron sputtering of uniform yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings in an industrial setup,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.04.007
5,7949,"Bias voltages <= - 40V resulted in highly < 200 > textured YSZ films, intermediate bias voltages of - 50 V to - 70 V in < 220 > textured films and high bias voltages (>= - 90 V) in a mixed orientation.",Reactive magnetron sputtering of uniform yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings in an industrial setup,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.04.007
6,7949,"In contrast, films grown on NiO-YSZ were seen to be randomly orientated when deposited at substrate bias voltages <= - 30 V. When bias was further increased the film took over the orientation of underlying substrate due to substrate template effects.",Reactive magnetron sputtering of uniform yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings in an industrial setup,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.04.007
