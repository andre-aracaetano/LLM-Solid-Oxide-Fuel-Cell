3,18181,"This methane fermentation provides H2S, which reduces the efficiency of SOFCs even at a level as low as a few parts per million.",Density functional theory analysis for H2S adsorption on pyridinic N- and oxidized N-doped graphenes,10.1039/d2ra00898j
4,18181,"It has been experimentally reported that a nitrogen (N)-doped graphene-based material known as pyridinic N removes H2S via an oxidation reaction compared with another graphene-based material known as oxidized N. To understand this experimental result, we investigated H2S adsorption on pyridinic N and oxidized N by a density functional theory analysis and further examined the activation barrier of dissociation reactions.",Density functional theory analysis for H2S adsorption on pyridinic N- and oxidized N-doped graphenes,10.1039/d2ra00898j
5,18181,We found that the adsorption of H2S on pyridinic N is more stable than that on oxidized N.,Density functional theory analysis for H2S adsorption on pyridinic N- and oxidized N-doped graphenes,10.1039/d2ra00898j
6,18181,"In addition, the H2S dissociation reaction occurs only on pyridinic N.",Density functional theory analysis for H2S adsorption on pyridinic N- and oxidized N-doped graphenes,10.1039/d2ra00898j
