1,11377,Chromium poisoning of the air electrode remains an obstacle to the long-term performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
2,11377,"In Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM) air electrodes, the poisoning process results in two types of deposits, chromium oxide (Cr2O3), and Mn, Cr spinel (MnCr2O4).",Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
3,11377,The former forms electrochemically and the latter forms via a chemical reaction.,Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
4,11377,"By applying a small anodic reverse bias, Cr2O3 deposits can be removed because their formation is electrochemical in nature.",Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
5,11377,"However, MnCr2O4 deposits remain because their formation is chemical, rather than electrochemical, in nature.",Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
6,11377,"In situ chemical decomposition of the Mn, Cr spinel was investigated as an alternate removal method as thermodynamics supports its decomposition into constituent oxides below similar to 540 degrees C in pure oxygen.",Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
7,11377,The spinel decomposition process was characterized using thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analyses.,Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
8,11377,The experimentally determined rate of spinel decomposition was undetectable (very slow) with isolated MnCr2O4 powders.,Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
9,11377,The addition of 10 mol% gadolinia doped ceria (GDC) and silver powders significantly increased the rate of decomposition.,Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
10,11377,"However, the rate is limited by the diffusion of oxygen through the decomposed oxide layer.",Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
11,11377,"Although one strategy may be the addition of GDC and silver to the LSM air electrode to enhance spinel decomposition, the more effective mitigation strategy would be to prevent the formation of MnCr2O4 spinel in the first place through the removal of the reactants: Cr2O3 via electrochemical cleaning and mobile Mn ions in the zirconia electrolyte by incorporating a diffusion barrier layer such as GDC between the air electrode and electrolyte.",Chromium Poisoning Mitigation Strategy in Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Manganite-Based Air Electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4062192
