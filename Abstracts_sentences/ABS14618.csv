2,14618,"Here, short-term experiments at various current densities and a durability test (1400 h) are performed to investigate the effects of HCl on the Ni-YSZ electrode of a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) operated in co-electrolysis mode.",Poisoning effects of chlorine on a solid oxide cell operated in co-electrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230247
3,14618,"Without current bias, exposure to 10 ppmv of HCl was tolerated whereas significant degradation was observed when the SOEC was exposed to 5 ppmv of HCl under polarization, mostly related to an increase of the resistance associated with the charge-transfer processes.",Poisoning effects of chlorine on a solid oxide cell operated in co-electrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230247
4,14618,"Prolonged exposure to HCl revealed an initial steady degradation before an increase by a factor of >10 caused by polarization resistance increases, thereby emphasizing the importance of prolonged poisoning tests.",Poisoning effects of chlorine on a solid oxide cell operated in co-electrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230247
5,14618,Stopping the HCl supply and operating the SOEC in an HCl-free atmosphere allowed for voltage stabilization but no performance recovery was observed.,Poisoning effects of chlorine on a solid oxide cell operated in co-electrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230247
6,14618,An increased serial resistance indicates that the desorption of Cl can also be detrimental.,Poisoning effects of chlorine on a solid oxide cell operated in co-electrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230247
