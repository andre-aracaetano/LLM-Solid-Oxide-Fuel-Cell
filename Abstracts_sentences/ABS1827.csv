1,1827,The electrochemical activities and chromium tolerances are studied on single phase La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (-) (delta) (LSCF) and Cd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (CDC) impregnated LSCF (GDC-LSCF) cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Enhanced chromium tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - δ electrode of solid oxide fuel cells by Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 impregnation,10.1016/j.elecom.2013.10.019
2,1827,GDC-LSCF electrode shows a significantly reduced electrode polarization resistance and more stable performance for the O-2 reduction reaction in the presence of chromia-forming metallic interconnect as compared to that on LSCF.,Enhanced chromium tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - δ electrode of solid oxide fuel cells by Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 impregnation,10.1016/j.elecom.2013.10.019
3,1827,The results indicate that the impregnated GDC nanoparticles serve as a barrier layer to enhance the resistance and tolerance of LSCF towards chromium deposition and poisoning.,Enhanced chromium tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - δ electrode of solid oxide fuel cells by Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 impregnation,10.1016/j.elecom.2013.10.019
