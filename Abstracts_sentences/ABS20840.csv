1,20840,"This study concerns numerical investigation of a solid oxide electrolysis stack, in which the cells are pressurized on only the fuel side (single-sided mode) or both fuel and air sides (double-sided mode).",Modeling of single- and double-sided high-pressure operation of solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.04.169
2,20840,"A 90-cell stack model is used to study the effects of the operating pressure on the polarization curves, area-specific-resistance (ASR), temperature, and pressure.",Modeling of single- and double-sided high-pressure operation of solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.04.169
3,20840,"The model predicts higher open-circuit voltage (OCV), lower ASR, and lower pressure drops over the flow fields at higher operating pressures.",Modeling of single- and double-sided high-pressure operation of solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.04.169
4,20840,The latter leads to flexibility in the flow field design.,Modeling of single- and double-sided high-pressure operation of solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.04.169
5,20840,The results show that the single-sided mode hinders the OCV increase and reduces the ASR.,Modeling of single- and double-sided high-pressure operation of solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.04.169
6,20840,"Nonetheless, the ASR reduction under the double-sided mode is more significant than the single-sided mode.",Modeling of single- and double-sided high-pressure operation of solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.04.169
7,20840,"Therefore, the double-sided mode performs better at high current densities since its higher ASR reduction provides a lower increase in the stack voltage (/input power).",Modeling of single- and double-sided high-pressure operation of solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.04.169
8,20840,"Moreover, the results indicate a nonlinear relationship between the temperature distribution and the operating pressure under the double-sided mode due to its counteracting effects on the ohmic heat sources and reaction heat sink.",Modeling of single- and double-sided high-pressure operation of solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.04.169
9,20840,It is illustrated that the temperature difference over the stack decreases under the double-sided mode at higher operating pressures and lower current densities.& COPY; 2023 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.,Modeling of single- and double-sided high-pressure operation of solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.04.169
