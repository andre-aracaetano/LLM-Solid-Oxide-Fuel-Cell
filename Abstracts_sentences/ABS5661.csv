1,5661,"One of the most promising technologies for future applications of solide oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is the so-called anode-supported configuration: a dense yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) ceramic electrolyte is deposited as a thin film over a porous Ni / YSZ cermet substrate anode, followed by a porous ceramic cathode such as La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSM).",Ceramic technologies for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.280-283.419
2,5661,"In this paper, a short review is made of the current technologies available to achieve this particular architecture, and to optimise the service behaviour.",Ceramic technologies for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.280-283.419
3,5661,"Then, alternative materials and fabrication technologies, as well as their possible impact on performance, are proposed and investigated.",Ceramic technologies for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.280-283.419
