2,19650,"In all compositions, a single perovskite phase was obtained after calcination at 750 degrees C for 10 h.",Structural and impedance analysis of copper doped LSM cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.01.002
3,19650,"The maximum electrical conductivity at elevated temperatures was obtained at a composition of x = 0.2 (190 S cm (1) at 750 degrees C), whereas the sample with x = 0.3 showed the minimum value (100 S cm (1) at 750 degrees C).",Structural and impedance analysis of copper doped LSM cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.01.002
4,19650,"The increase in electrical conductivity with increasing Cu contents was attributed to a charge compensating transition of the Mn3+-Mn4+ and the reason for the decreased value, at x = 0.3, is mainly due to the presence of a second phase.",Structural and impedance analysis of copper doped LSM cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.01.002
5,19650,"The cathode area specific resistance of the sample with x = 0.2 was 4.3 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C, which is lower than that of LSM (x = 0).",Structural and impedance analysis of copper doped LSM cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.01.002
6,19650,The enhanced performance with the addition of Cu can be explained by the additional Mn4+ promoting the formation of surface oxygen vacancies when Mn4+ is converted to Mn3+ at high temperatures.,Structural and impedance analysis of copper doped LSM cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.01.002
