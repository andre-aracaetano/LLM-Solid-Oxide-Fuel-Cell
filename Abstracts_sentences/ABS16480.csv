1,16480,"Effects of conductivity and adhesive properties of cathode current-collecting layer (CCCL) on cathode contact resistance and cell performance inside a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack during operation are investigated by adding Al2O3 to the CCCL of (La0.75Sr0.25)(0.95)MnO3+delta The conductivity of LSM-15 wt% Al2O3 composite CCCL decreases from 141.6 S cm(-1) to 23.7 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C, whereas its adhesion to SUS 430 interconnect and LSM-YSZ active cathode increases by 2.5 and 1.8 times, respectively.",Effect of conductivity and adhesive properties of cathode current-collecting layer on cell performance inside stack for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.117
2,16480,The area specific resistance (ASR) of SUS 430/CCCL/LSM-YSZ sandwich at 800 degrees C is tested.,Effect of conductivity and adhesive properties of cathode current-collecting layer on cell performance inside stack for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.117
3,16480,The result shows that ASR of SUS 430/ LSM-15 wt% Al2O3 /LSM-YSZ sandwich is approximately 2.5 times smaller than that of the SUS 430/LSM /LSM-YSZ sandwich.,Effect of conductivity and adhesive properties of cathode current-collecting layer on cell performance inside stack for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.117
4,16480,The maximum output power density (MOPD) of the unit cell with LSM-15 wt% Al2O3 CCCL is slightly higher than that of the cell with pure LSM CCCL at 800 degrees C.,Effect of conductivity and adhesive properties of cathode current-collecting layer on cell performance inside stack for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.117
5,16480,"The degradation rate of the unit cell with LSM-15 wt% Al2O3 CCCL is nearly 1/7 of the unit cell with pure LSM being discharged at a constant DC of 0.32 A cm(-2) for about 100 h. Consequently, the addition of adhesive to CCCL is much more conducive to improve the long-term stability of the stack operation.",Effect of conductivity and adhesive properties of cathode current-collecting layer on cell performance inside stack for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.117
