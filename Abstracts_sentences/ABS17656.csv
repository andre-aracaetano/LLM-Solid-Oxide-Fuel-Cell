1,17656,The effects of Fe doping on phase stability and electrical conductivity were investigated for the 25 mol% Sr and 20 mol% Mg-doped lanthanum gallates (LSGM-2520).,Fe doping effects on phase stability and conductivity of La0.75Sr0.25Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.025
2,17656,"While secondary phases, in addition to perovskite phase, were formed for an undoped LSGM-2520 in accordance with previous reports, a single phase perovskite phase was obtained by addition of a small amount (similar to 4 mol%) of Fe to LSGM-2520.",Fe doping effects on phase stability and conductivity of La0.75Sr0.25Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.025
