1,19084,"Perovskite-type barium-strontium-cobalt-ferrite (BSCF) is a potentially significant material in the development of electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysis cells, primarily because of its large oxygen vacancy concentration and mobility.",First principles calculations of oxygen vacancy formation in barium-strontium-cobalt-ferrite,10.1039/c3ra41585f
2,19084,"Using density functional theory (DFT) with the DFT + U approach, we perform first principles calculations of oxygen vacancy formation in bulk BSCF with the composition Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.75Fe0.25O3-delta, in which a range of oxygen deficiencies (0.125 <= delta <= 0.875) is investigated.",First principles calculations of oxygen vacancy formation in barium-strontium-cobalt-ferrite,10.1039/c3ra41585f
3,19084,"Contrary to previous DFT studies for delta = 0.125, DFT + U predicts that the non-stoichiometric structure is more stable than its stoichiometric counterpart with delta = 0, and that this originates from a significantly different atomic and electronic structure following the introduction of the Hubbard U term in the calculations.",First principles calculations of oxygen vacancy formation in barium-strontium-cobalt-ferrite,10.1039/c3ra41585f
4,19084,As more vacancies are created there is no tendency for ordering and the total vacancy formation energy becomes positive and increases as the oxygen deficiency increases.,First principles calculations of oxygen vacancy formation in barium-strontium-cobalt-ferrite,10.1039/c3ra41585f
5,19084,"Using ab initio thermodynamics, the heat of formation of BSCF as a function of oxygen partial pressure and temperature is determined and the results are in broad agreement with available stoichiometry measurements.",First principles calculations of oxygen vacancy formation in barium-strontium-cobalt-ferrite,10.1039/c3ra41585f
