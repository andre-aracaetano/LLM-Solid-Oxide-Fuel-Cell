1,12279,A novel cobalt-free Cu1.2Mn1.8O4 spinel coating is prepared and evaluated for the metal interconnect of solid oxide fuel cell.,Thermal Growth Cu1.2Mn1.8O4 Spinel Coatings on Metal Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.3390/met7120522
2,12279,"Mn-35Cu and Co-35Mn alloy coatings are deposited on 430 SS substrate and then in-situ oxidized in air at 750 degrees C for 100 h. XRD results confirm that Cu1.2Mn1.8O4 spinel with some Mn2O3 is formed, and the average thickness of the coating is 70-80 mu m according to cross section image.",Thermal Growth Cu1.2Mn1.8O4 Spinel Coatings on Metal Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.3390/met7120522
3,12279,"Spinel oxide coating is compact and has good adherence to the substrate, and very low Cr and Fe contents are detected in the coating.",Thermal Growth Cu1.2Mn1.8O4 Spinel Coatings on Metal Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.3390/met7120522
4,12279,"A small area specific resistance of 8.7 Omega m cm(2) is achieved at 800 degrees C for the composited Cu1.2Mn1.8O4 spinel coating, which is much less than that of the composited (Co,Mn)(3)O-4 spinel coating.",Thermal Growth Cu1.2Mn1.8O4 Spinel Coatings on Metal Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.3390/met7120522
5,12279,The research indicates that the Cu1.2Mn1.8O4 coating evolved by the high-energy micro-arc alloying process is a promising coating material for the metallic interconnects.,Thermal Growth Cu1.2Mn1.8O4 Spinel Coatings on Metal Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.3390/met7120522
