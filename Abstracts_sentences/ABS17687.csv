1,17687,The interfacial resistance of Ni-Y2O2-stabilized ZrO2 (Ni-YSZ) anodes on YSZ electrolytes has been reduced by inserting thin interfacial layers of TiO2-doped YSZ (YZT) or Y2O3-doped CeO2 (YDC).,Effect of mixed-conducting interfacial layers on solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1149/1.1838542
2,17687,Impedance spectroscopy measurements at temperatures ranging from 600 to 750 degrees C typically showed a high frequency are (HFA) and a low frequency are (LFA).,Effect of mixed-conducting interfacial layers on solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1149/1.1838542
3,17687,"The HFA was reduced by the addition of either interlayer, with a larger reduction for YDC.",Effect of mixed-conducting interfacial layers on solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1149/1.1838542
4,17687,This presumably resulted from enhanced charge transfer due to the mixed conductivity and/or enhanced redox reaction rate of the interfacial layer.,Effect of mixed-conducting interfacial layers on solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1149/1.1838542
5,17687,"The LFA, which was apparently related to mass-transport processes, grew with decreasing YSZ surface roughness and increasing interlayer thickness.",Effect of mixed-conducting interfacial layers on solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1149/1.1838542
6,17687,The overall interfacial resistance was minimized for layer thicknesses of -0.5 mu m.,Effect of mixed-conducting interfacial layers on solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1149/1.1838542
7,17687,"The lowest interfacial resistances in 97% H-2 + H2O, 0.13 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C, and 0.29 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, were obtained with 0.5 mu m thick YDC interfacial layers.",Effect of mixed-conducting interfacial layers on solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1149/1.1838542
