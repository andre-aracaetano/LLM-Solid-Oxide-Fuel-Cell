2,19591,"Dense polycrystalline ceramics of this material used in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells as solid electrolytes, however, suffer from uniquely high resistance across grain boundaries in the materials.",Direct evidence of potential barriers at grain boundaries in Y-doped BaZrO3 from dc-bias dependence measurements,10.1039/c1jm12685g
3,19591,It has long been speculated that such high resistance at the grain boundaries is originated from potential barriers which may be formed at the grain boundaries.,Direct evidence of potential barriers at grain boundaries in Y-doped BaZrO3 from dc-bias dependence measurements,10.1039/c1jm12685g

5,19591,"The results of our study on dc-bias dependence of grain-boundary impedance in 5, 3 and 2 mol% Y-doped BaZrO3 (BZY5, BZY3, and BZY2, respectively) clearly show that the relation between the current across a grain boundary and the applied dc-bias is ohmic where the dc-bias is lower than the thermal voltage, while that becomes superohmic at sufficiently high biases.",Direct evidence of potential barriers at grain boundaries in Y-doped BaZrO3 from dc-bias dependence measurements,10.1039/c1jm12685g
6,19591,"In addition, it is found that the capacitance of the grain boundary decreases with the bias.",Direct evidence of potential barriers at grain boundaries in Y-doped BaZrO3 from dc-bias dependence measurements,10.1039/c1jm12685g
