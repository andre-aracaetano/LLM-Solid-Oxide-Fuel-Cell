3,399,"In response, this study pioneers the use of stainless steel 316 (Ss316) as a replacement for the commonly used nickel foam (NF) supporter in SIFC construction.",Demonstration of high-performance and stable metal-supporting semiconductor-ionic fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233325
4,399,"The results demonstrate that Ss316 exhibits superior thermal and redox stability compared to NF supporters without compromising fuel cell performance, achieving a maximum power density of nearly 500 mW cm-2 at 550 degrees C. Furthermore, Ss316-supported SIFCs demonstrate a stable performance over 100 h of testing, whereas NFsupported counterparts fail within 20 h. A series of characterization results following the encouraging performance proves that Li2CO3 appears in the electrolyte layer after the fuel cell operation, which contributes to superionic conductivity, and is critical in preventing short-circuiting issues caused by the Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-(La, Sr) (Co, Fe)O3 semiconductor based electrolyte layer.",Demonstration of high-performance and stable metal-supporting semiconductor-ionic fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233325
