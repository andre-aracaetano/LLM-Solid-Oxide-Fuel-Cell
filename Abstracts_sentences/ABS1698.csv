1,1698,Functional all-oxide thin film micro-solid oxide fuel cells (mu SOFCs) that are free of platinum (Pt) are discussed in this report The mu SOFCs with widths of 160 mu m consist of thin film La06Sr04Co08Fe02O3 (LSCF) as both the anode and cathode and Y008Zr092O196 (YSZ) as the electrolyte Open circuit voltage and peak power density at 545 C are 0 18V and 210 mu W cm(-2) respectively The LSCF anodes show good lattice and microstructure stability and do not form reaction products with YSZ The all-oxide mu SOFCs endure long-term stability testing at 500 C for over 100 h as manifested by stable membrane morphology and crack-free microstructure Published by Elsevier B V,Nanostructured La0 6Sr0 4Co0 8Fe0 2O3/Y0 08Zr0 92O1 96/La0 6Sr0 4Co0 8Fe0 2O3 (LSCF/YSZ/LSCF) symmetric thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.066
