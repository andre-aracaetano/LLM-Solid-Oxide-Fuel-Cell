6,10003,"Isothermal sintering was carried out between 1100 and 1300 degrees C. Apparent density as high as 98% D-th was attained by firing isostatically pressed pellets at 1150 degrees C 4 h. Uniaxially pressed pellets attained the same apparent density at 1275 degrees C 2 h, being in both cases very low the densification temperatures.","Synthesis, sintering and electrical properties of yttria-calcia-doped ceria",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2009.02.014
