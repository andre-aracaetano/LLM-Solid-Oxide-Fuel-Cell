2,19896,hydrogen electrode-supported planar solid oxide electrolyzer (SOE) stack modules were manufactured and tested at 800 C in steam electrolysis mode for hydrogen production.,Investigation of 30-cell solid oxide electrolyzer stack modules for hydrogen production,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.020
3,19896,"The electrolysis efficiency of the stack modules was higher than 100% at a total steam and hydrogen flow of 2.1 sccm cm(-2), a H2O/H-2 ratio of 80/20, and a current density of <0.2 A cm(-2).",Investigation of 30-cell solid oxide electrolyzer stack modules for hydrogen production,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.020
4,19896,"The electrolysis efficiency, current efficiency, and actual hydrogen production rate of the stack modules increased with increasing H2O/H-2 ratio at a constant current density.",Investigation of 30-cell solid oxide electrolyzer stack modules for hydrogen production,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.020
5,19896,"However, the electrolysis and current efficiencies decreased steadily at high current densities.",Investigation of 30-cell solid oxide electrolyzer stack modules for hydrogen production,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.020
6,19896,"During hydrogen production, the stack modules were operated at 800 degrees C and a constant current density of 0.15 A cm(-2) for up to 1100 h. A steam conversion rate of 62% and current efficiency of 87.4% were obtained; the actual hydrogen production rate reached as high as 103.6 N L h(-1) Post-mortem analysis showed that delamination of the LSM-YSZ oxygen electrode mainly occurred in the steam and air inlet area of the 10 x 10 cm(2) cells.",Investigation of 30-cell solid oxide electrolyzer stack modules for hydrogen production,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.11.020
