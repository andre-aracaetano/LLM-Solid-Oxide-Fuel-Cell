1,20974,"Electrolysis of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, through which the greenhouse gas could be effectively utilized, using solid oxide electrolysis cells is now attracting much interest.",Mixed-Conductor Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as Robust Fuel Electrode for Pure CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02511
2,20974,"Here, we show for the first time that the redox-stable Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (SFM) ceramic electronic-ionic conductor can be used as the electrocatalyst to electrolyze and convert 100% CO2 to CO without using any safe gases like H-2 and CO. SFM maintained its cubic structure and had an electrical conductivity of 21.39 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C in 1:1 CO-CO2 atmosphere.",Mixed-Conductor Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as Robust Fuel Electrode for Pure CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02511

5,20974,"Compared with those reported for the typical oxide ceramic electrodes, high electrochemical performance has been demonstrated for single phase SFM cathode using 100% CO2 as the feeding gas.",Mixed-Conductor Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as Robust Fuel Electrode for Pure CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02511
6,20974,"For example, a current density of 0.71 A.cm(-2) was obtained using a fuel cell supported on LSGM (La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta) electrolyte operated at 800 degrees C and an applied voltage of 1.5 V.",Mixed-Conductor Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as Robust Fuel Electrode for Pure CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02511
7,20974,"The electrolysis performance was further improved by using SFM-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta composite cathode, and the current density increased to 1.09 A.cm(-2) under the same operation conditions.",Mixed-Conductor Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as Robust Fuel Electrode for Pure CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02511
8,20974,"Durability test at 800 degrees C for 100 h demonstrated a relatively stable performance for CO2 electrolysis under harsh conditions of 100% CO2 without safe gas and above 1 A.cm(-2) current density, which is seldom achieved in the literature but highly desirable for the commercial application, indicating that SFM is a highly promising ceramic fuel electrode for CO2 electrolysis.",Mixed-Conductor Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as Robust Fuel Electrode for Pure CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02511
