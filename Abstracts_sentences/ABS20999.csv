2,20999,"The results show that without continuous purging of the air in the air electrode (Cell-1), the degradation rate was 8.37%/kh in the 1070 h electrolysis process, while with 5 L/min air supplied to the air electrode (Cell-2), the degradation rate was 24.41%/kh.",Effect of air addition to the air electrode on the stability and efficiency of carbon dioxide electrolysis by solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.207
3,20999,"Impedance analysis indicates that the degradation of Cell-1 was mainly because of the increase in O2- exchange polarization impedance, while the degradation of Cell-2 was caused mainly by the variation of ohmic impedance.",Effect of air addition to the air electrode on the stability and efficiency of carbon dioxide electrolysis by solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.207
4,20999,"The microstructural characterization indicated a decrease in active Ni in the fuel electrode in both Cell-1 and Cell-2, but the degree of nickel loss depended on the test time.",Effect of air addition to the air electrode on the stability and efficiency of carbon dioxide electrolysis by solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.207
5,20999,"At the outlet of the Cell-2, the appearance of carbon further explains the faster degradation rate, although the carbon deposition was not directly caused by the introduction of air into the air electrode.",Effect of air addition to the air electrode on the stability and efficiency of carbon dioxide electrolysis by solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.207
6,20999,"Energy spectral analysis shows that the air electrode in Cell-1 generated Sr rich phases, which indicates that the absence of air in the air electrode in the electrolysis process indeed causes more serious microstructure damage.",Effect of air addition to the air electrode on the stability and efficiency of carbon dioxide electrolysis by solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.207
