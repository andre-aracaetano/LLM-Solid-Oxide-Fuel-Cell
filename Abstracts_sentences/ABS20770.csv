1,20770,Silver-copper oxide brazes are commonly used to bond zirconia to stainless steel (SS) for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and other high temperature joining applications.,Dual Atmosphere Isothermal Aging and Rapid Thermal Cycling of Ag-Ni and Ag-CuO Stainless Steel to Zirconia Braze Joints,10.1149/2.0911910jes
2,20770,"In fact, conventional Ag-CuO compositions (where Cu segregates to the surface, oxidizes, and reduces the silver wetting angle on zirconia from similar to 85 to similar to 40 degrees) allow brazing to be performed in air.",Dual Atmosphere Isothermal Aging and Rapid Thermal Cycling of Ag-Ni and Ag-CuO Stainless Steel to Zirconia Braze Joints,10.1149/2.0911910jes
3,20770,"Unfortunately, the relatively high similar to 40 degrees wetting angles of these reactive air brazes, and the ability of SOFC anode gases to reduce the CuO in them, produce pores during SOFC manufacturing and operation that reduce joint strength, impermeability, and longevity.",Dual Atmosphere Isothermal Aging and Rapid Thermal Cycling of Ag-Ni and Ag-CuO Stainless Steel to Zirconia Braze Joints,10.1149/2.0911910jes
4,20770,"Recently, Ag brazes utilizing transient porous nickel layers, instead of CuO additions, have been shown to produce high quality braze joints between SS and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ).",Dual Atmosphere Isothermal Aging and Rapid Thermal Cycling of Ag-Ni and Ag-CuO Stainless Steel to Zirconia Braze Joints,10.1149/2.0911910jes
5,20770,"Here, the microstructural and compositional evolution of SS vertical bar Ag-3CuO vertical bar YSZ and SS vertical bar Ag-Ni vertical bar YSZ braze joints exposed to air on one side and humidified 4% H-2-96% N-2 on the other side for either similar to 300 hours of similar to 750 degrees C aging or similar to 300 25 degrees C/min 35-830 degrees C rapid thermal cycles are compared.",Dual Atmosphere Isothermal Aging and Rapid Thermal Cycling of Ag-Ni and Ag-CuO Stainless Steel to Zirconia Braze Joints,10.1149/2.0911910jes
6,20770,"While both brazes display considerable microstructural and compositional evolution, only the Ag-Ni brazes remain pore free and well bonded, indicating that Ag-Ni brazes may be more suitable for long term SOFC operation.",Dual Atmosphere Isothermal Aging and Rapid Thermal Cycling of Ag-Ni and Ag-CuO Stainless Steel to Zirconia Braze Joints,10.1149/2.0911910jes
