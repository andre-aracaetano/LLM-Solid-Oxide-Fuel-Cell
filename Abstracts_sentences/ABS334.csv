1,334,The principal materials used in the construction of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are discussed.,Oxide-ion conductors for fuel cells,
2,334,"Some of the problems encountered with high temperature fuel cells (HT-SOFCs) might be overcome by lowering the operating temperature to 500-700 degrees C, through the development of suitable materials for intermediate temperature fuel cells IT-SOFCs.",Oxide-ion conductors for fuel cells,
3,334,"Candidate electrolyte materials are discussed, including cerium gallium oxide, lanthanum strontium gallium magnesium oxide, and electrolytes based on doped bismuth oxide.",Oxide-ion conductors for fuel cells,
4,334,"While high ionic conductivities can readily be achieved in these materials at intermediate temperatures, stability in reducing atmosphere is still a problem.",Oxide-ion conductors for fuel cells,
5,334,This might be overcome by careful chemical design of electrolytes containing stabilising dopants.,Oxide-ion conductors for fuel cells,
6,334,Two zirconia-doped bismuthate systems are discussed in this respect.,Oxide-ion conductors for fuel cells,
7,334,"In both cases, the obtained materials exhibit different structures-one is Bi3Nb1-xZrxO7-x/2 of the delta-Bi2O3 type, and the other, Bi4V2-2xZrxO11-x, has a layered structure of the Aurivillius type.",Oxide-ion conductors for fuel cells,
