2,19862,"Three types of anodes were applied; Ni-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC), Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ), and Ni-scandia-stabilized zirconia (Ni-ScSZ).",Comparative Study on Performance Stability of Ni-Oxide Cermet Anodes under Humidified Atmospheres in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.053208jes
3,19862,"Abrupt deterioration in performance was confirmed during constant current operation for the cells with Ni-YSZ and Ni-ScSZ anodes, accompanied with a drastic increase in ohmic resistance between the anode and reference electrode.",Comparative Study on Performance Stability of Ni-Oxide Cermet Anodes under Humidified Atmospheres in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.053208jes
4,19862,"In contrast, the performance of cell with Ni-SDC anode was pretty stable for 48 h. These differences in performance stability were significantly related to the local partial pressure of steam in the vicinity of the electrochemically active sites because the surface oxidation of nickel particles resulted in the deterioration.",Comparative Study on Performance Stability of Ni-Oxide Cermet Anodes under Humidified Atmospheres in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.053208jes
