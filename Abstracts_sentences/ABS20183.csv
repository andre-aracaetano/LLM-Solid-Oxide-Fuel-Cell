1,20183,"Bismuth-deficient sodium bismuth titanate (nominal Na0.5Bi0.49TiO2.985,NB0.49T) presents high oxide ion conductivity, which makes it a potential electrolyte material for intermediatetemperature solid oxide fuel cells.",Electrical and Dielectric Properties of Ca-Doped Bi-Deficient Sodium Bismuth Titanate Na0.5Bi0.49-xCaxTiO3-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08),10.3390/cryst12121800
2,20183,"Acceptor doping has been proven an effective approach to enhance the bulk conductivity (sigma(b)) of NB0.49T. Here, divalent Ca2+ ions were selected to partially replace Bi3+ on the A-site of NB0.49T, and the temperature and composition dependences of sigma(b) and permittivity were investigated.",Electrical and Dielectric Properties of Ca-Doped Bi-Deficient Sodium Bismuth Titanate Na0.5Bi0.49-xCaxTiO3-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08),10.3390/cryst12121800
3,20183,Results showed that Ca2+ doping was effective for enhancing sigma(b) of NB0.49T by creating oxygen vacancies.,Electrical and Dielectric Properties of Ca-Doped Bi-Deficient Sodium Bismuth Titanate Na0.5Bi0.49-xCaxTiO3-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08),10.3390/cryst12121800
4,20183,The highest sigma(b) (0.006 S.cm(-1) at 500 degrees C) was achieved by 2% Ca2+ doping.,Electrical and Dielectric Properties of Ca-Doped Bi-Deficient Sodium Bismuth Titanate Na0.5Bi0.49-xCaxTiO3-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08),10.3390/cryst12121800
5,20183,"Further increase in the doping level decreased sigma(b), which was more pronounced at temperatures below similar to 350 degrees C. Most importantly, Ca doping increased the temperature at which the activation energy for bulk conduction changed from similar to 0.80 eV (at low temperatures) to similar to 0.40 eV (at high temperatures), and reduced the temperature dependence of permittivity of NB0.49T. Results from the average structural parameters and the local defect associates are discussed.",Electrical and Dielectric Properties of Ca-Doped Bi-Deficient Sodium Bismuth Titanate Na0.5Bi0.49-xCaxTiO3-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08),10.3390/cryst12121800
6,20183,"The findings of this work are helpful for understanding the defect and conduction mechanisms for acceptor-doped NB0.49T, and are also useful for developing NBT-based dielectrics with temperature independent permittivity.",Electrical and Dielectric Properties of Ca-Doped Bi-Deficient Sodium Bismuth Titanate Na0.5Bi0.49-xCaxTiO3-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08),10.3390/cryst12121800
