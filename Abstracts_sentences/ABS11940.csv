1,11940,"Ceria-based electrolytes have been widely researched in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), which might be operated at 500 similar to 600 degrees C. Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95(GDC10) powders were prepared by a modified chemical co-precipitation process with Gd(NO3)3 and Ce(NO3)3 as precursors, and ammonia and hydrogen peroxide as precipitants.","Fabrication, sintering and electrical properties of cobalt oxide doped Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 - δ",10.1016/j.ssi.2010.06.019
2,11940,"The precursors of GDC10 were fired at 350 degrees C for 2 h, then the fluorite structure cerias were identified by X-ray diffraction.","Fabrication, sintering and electrical properties of cobalt oxide doped Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 - δ",10.1016/j.ssi.2010.06.019
3,11940,"The powders are well crystallized, with the size about 5 nm and surface area of 148.3 m2/g. Loading lmol% cobalt oxide as additive, the GDC10 were succeeded to densify at 950 degrees C by liquid phase sintering mechanism.","Fabrication, sintering and electrical properties of cobalt oxide doped Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 - δ",10.1016/j.ssi.2010.06.019
