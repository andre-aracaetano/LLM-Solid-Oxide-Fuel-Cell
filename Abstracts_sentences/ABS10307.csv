2,10307,"This study proposes two methods, an oxygen sensor method and an electrochemical impedance method, for the in-situ measurement of the effective binary diffusivity of an H-2 - H2O system in the anode of an anode-supported SOFC, which is composed of a YSZ (Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2) electrolyte and an Ni-YSZ anode.",Determination of effective binary diffusivity in anode of solid oxide fuel cell based on Fick's law,10.1299/mej.20-00239
3,10307,"By these methods, the effective binary diffusivity is determined based on Fick's law by using hydrogen gas concentrations at two positions, the inside and surface of the anode.",Determination of effective binary diffusivity in anode of solid oxide fuel cell based on Fick's law,10.1299/mej.20-00239

5,10307,"On the other hand, when the electrochemical impedance method is used, a mean hydrogen gas concentration in the anode adjoining the electrolyte is determined by analyzing the measured electrochemical impedance spectra.",Determination of effective binary diffusivity in anode of solid oxide fuel cell based on Fick's law,10.1299/mej.20-00239
6,10307,The effective binary diffusivities determined by these methods are almost the same under the same conditions.,Determination of effective binary diffusivity in anode of solid oxide fuel cell based on Fick's law,10.1299/mej.20-00239
7,10307,And also they are in agreement with effective binary diffusivities calculated using the porosity and volume-averaged pore diameter obtained by analyzing the anode cross-section in an SEM image.,Determination of effective binary diffusivity in anode of solid oxide fuel cell based on Fick's law,10.1299/mej.20-00239
