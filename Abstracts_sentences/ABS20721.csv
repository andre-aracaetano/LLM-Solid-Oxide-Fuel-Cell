1,20721,The oxidation behavior and electrical property of a Ni-Mo-Cr alloy at 750 degrees C in a simulated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode environment (humidified and diluted H-2) have been Studied.,Oxidation Behavior and Electrical Property of a Ni-Based Alloy in SOFC Anode Environment,10.1149/1.3194788
2,20721,"The thermally grown oxide scale presents a multilayered structure, which is similar to that formed in air, with densely grown Cr2O3 in between an underneath layer of the intermetallic compound MoNi3 and a less compact top layer consisting of MnCr2O4 with Cr2O3 flakes embedded.",Oxidation Behavior and Electrical Property of a Ni-Based Alloy in SOFC Anode Environment,10.1149/1.3194788
3,20721,The oxidation kinetics obey a two-stage parabolic law with an initially fast oxidation (0-170 h at a rate of 4.94 x 10(-14) g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)) followed by a slower steady oxidation (170-1000 h at a rate of 2.84 x 10(-14) g(2) cm(-4) s(-1)).,Oxidation Behavior and Electrical Property of a Ni-Based Alloy in SOFC Anode Environment,10.1149/1.3194788
4,20721,"The H-2/H2O reducing atmosphere, even with a significantly lower oxygen partial pressure, has a negative effect on the high temperature oxidation resistance: however, it enhances the adherence of the scale to the substrate.",Oxidation Behavior and Electrical Property of a Ni-Based Alloy in SOFC Anode Environment,10.1149/1.3194788
5,20721,"The Outward diffusion of Ti ions changes the composition, lattice parameters, and diffraction peak positions of the formed oxides, leading to Ti-doped Cr2O3 and the MnCr2O4 spinel.",Oxidation Behavior and Electrical Property of a Ni-Based Alloy in SOFC Anode Environment,10.1149/1.3194788
6,20721,"The area specific resistance of the oxide scale preformed at 750 degrees C for 1000 h is 8.34 m Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C, which is higher than that formed in air and lower than that of other studied Ni-based alloys.",Oxidation Behavior and Electrical Property of a Ni-Based Alloy in SOFC Anode Environment,10.1149/1.3194788
