1,5200,The effects of methane concentration and current load cycle on the performance and durability of integrated planar solid oxide fuel cell (IP-SOFC) obtained from Rolls Royce Fuel Cell Systems Ltd (RRFCS) has been investigated.,Direct Operation of IP-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Hydrogen and Methane Fuel Mixtures under Current Load Cycle Operating Condition,10.1002/fuce.201300096
2,5200,The IP-SOFC was operated with hydrogen-methane fuel mixture with up to 20% methane concentration at 900 degrees C for short term operation of the cells with high methane concentration increased the voltage of the IP-SOFC due to increase in Gibbs free energy.,Direct Operation of IP-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Hydrogen and Methane Fuel Mixtures under Current Load Cycle Operating Condition,10.1002/fuce.201300096
3,5200,"However, it degraded the performance of the IP-SOFC in long term operation due to carbon deposition on the anode surface.",Direct Operation of IP-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Hydrogen and Methane Fuel Mixtures under Current Load Cycle Operating Condition,10.1002/fuce.201300096
4,5200,"The current load cycle tests were carried out with 95% H-2-5% CH4 and 80% H-2-20% CH4 fuel mixtures at 900 degrees C with a constant current of 1A. At low methane concentration, the decrease in the IP-SOFC voltage was observed after operating nine current load cycles (384h).",Direct Operation of IP-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Hydrogen and Methane Fuel Mixtures under Current Load Cycle Operating Condition,10.1002/fuce.201300096
5,5200,"At higher methane concentration, the voltage of IP-SOFC decreased by almost 30% just after one current load cycle (48h) due to faster carbon deposition.",Direct Operation of IP-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Hydrogen and Methane Fuel Mixtures under Current Load Cycle Operating Condition,10.1002/fuce.201300096
6,5200,So future work is therefore required to identify viable alternative materials and optimum operating conditions.,Direct Operation of IP-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Hydrogen and Methane Fuel Mixtures under Current Load Cycle Operating Condition,10.1002/fuce.201300096
