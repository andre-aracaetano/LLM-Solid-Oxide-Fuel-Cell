1,18445,A structured catalyst for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) was investigated as a biogas pre-reformer for indirect internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell (IIR-SOFC).,Nickel-Based Structured Catalysts for Indirect Internal Reforming of Methane,10.3390/app10093083
2,18445,"For this purpose, a NiCrAl open-cell foam was chosen as support and Ni-based samarium doped ceria (Ni-SmDC) as catalyst.",Nickel-Based Structured Catalysts for Indirect Internal Reforming of Methane,10.3390/app10093083
3,18445,Ni-SmDC powder is a highly performing catalyst showing a remarkable carbon resistance due to the presence of oxygen vacancies that promote coke gasification by CO2 activation.,Nickel-Based Structured Catalysts for Indirect Internal Reforming of Methane,10.3390/app10093083
4,18445,Ni-SmDC powder was deposited on the metallic support by wash-coating method.,Nickel-Based Structured Catalysts for Indirect Internal Reforming of Methane,10.3390/app10093083
5,18445,"The metallic foam, the powder, and the structured catalyst were characterized by several techniques such as: N-2 adsorption-desorption technique, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), focused ion beam (FIB), temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), and Raman spectroscopy.",Nickel-Based Structured Catalysts for Indirect Internal Reforming of Methane,10.3390/app10093083
6,18445,"Catalytic tests were performed on structured catalysts to evaluate activity, selectivity, and stability at SOFC operating conditions.",Nickel-Based Structured Catalysts for Indirect Internal Reforming of Methane,10.3390/app10093083
