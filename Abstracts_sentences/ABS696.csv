1,696,Reversible high temperature solid oxide cells (rSOC) can be operated both in the fuel cell (SOFC) and the electrolysis mode (SOEC).,Transition Cycles during Operation of a Reversible Solid Oxide Electrolyzer/Fuel Cell (rSOC) System,10.1002/fuce.201800183
2,696,"This specificity is a promising way to either store intermittent renewable energy surpluses by producing H-2, or generate electricity from H-2 or any other fuel locally available (CH4, biogas) when demand overtakes the local production.",Transition Cycles during Operation of a Reversible Solid Oxide Electrolyzer/Fuel Cell (rSOC) System,10.1002/fuce.201800183
3,696,"Therefore, rSOC technology could reinforce autonomy and flexibility in buildings, eco-districts, up to industrial sites and local energy grids powered by intermittent renewable energies.",Transition Cycles during Operation of a Reversible Solid Oxide Electrolyzer/Fuel Cell (rSOC) System,10.1002/fuce.201800183
4,696,"Such a storage solution complements batteries, displays flexible energy storage durations, from a few hours up to seasonal cycles, and allows decorrelating power and storage capacity.",Transition Cycles during Operation of a Reversible Solid Oxide Electrolyzer/Fuel Cell (rSOC) System,10.1002/fuce.201800183
5,696,"Nonetheless, experiments are needed to assess whether rSOC systems can accommodate the surrounding environment and switch rapidly between various power levels and operating modes.",Transition Cycles during Operation of a Reversible Solid Oxide Electrolyzer/Fuel Cell (rSOC) System,10.1002/fuce.201800183
