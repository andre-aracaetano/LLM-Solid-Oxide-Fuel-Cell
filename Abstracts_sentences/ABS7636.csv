1,7636,"The perovskite type oxides, Ln(1-x)A(x)MO(3-delta) (Ln = lanthanides, A = Sr, Ca, M = Mn, Co), were studied as cathode materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) from a view point of compatibility with the solid electrolyte of yttria stabilized zirconia (8 mol% Y2O3 doped zirconia, 8YSZ).",Perovskite oxides for the cathode in solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.68.764
2,7636,"Generally, the pyrochlore, La2Zr2O7, can form at the boundary between the perovskite and 8YSZ.",Perovskite oxides for the cathode in solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.68.764
3,7636,"In the case of Ln(1-x)SrMnO(3-delta) (Ln = La, Fr, Nd, Sm, and Gd), the formation of the pyrochlore, Ln(2)Zr(2)O(7), was suppressed for the perovskites having smaller lanthanoids than La, especially for the Pr1-xSrxMnO3-delta and Nd1-xSrxMnO3-delta systems.",Perovskite oxides for the cathode in solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.68.764
4,7636,The Ln(1-x)A(x)CoO(3-delta) systems with samaller lanthanoid ions were also effective in suppressing the reaction with 8YSZ.,Perovskite oxides for the cathode in solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.68.764
5,7636,"However, the Ln(1-x)A(x)CoO(3-delta) systems, which are promising cathode materials for a low operating temperature SOFC, have larger thermal expansion rates than 8YSZ.",Perovskite oxides for the cathode in solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.68.764
6,7636,"The formation of a solid solution with Mn in the B-site of the perovskite such as Gd1-xArMn1-yCoyO3-delta (A = Sr and Ca) brought reasonable thermal expansion rates, compatible with 8YSZ and high oxygen reduction catalytic activity.",Perovskite oxides for the cathode in solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.68.764
