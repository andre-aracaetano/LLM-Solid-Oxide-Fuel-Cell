1,17323,"Perovskite-type proton-conducting materials, such as BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BCZYYb), are very attractive for the next generation equipment of electrochemical energy conversion and storage owing to their excellent conductivity in the intermediate-temperature range (300-750 degrees C), as well as good thermo-chemical stability, coking resistance, and sulfur tolerance.",Rapid Gas-Phase Synthesis of the Perovskite-Type BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Proton-Conducting Nanocrystalline Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c11492
2,17323,"However, the lack of a reliable and costeffective synthesis method for such multi-component co-doping oxides limits their large-scale application.",Rapid Gas-Phase Synthesis of the Perovskite-Type BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Proton-Conducting Nanocrystalline Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c11492
3,17323,"In this study, for the first time, we successfully synthesize BCZYYb electrolyte nanopowders by using a rapid, scalable flame-based gas-phase synthesis method with two different barium precursors Ba(NO3)2 and Ba(CH3COO)2, named as BCZYYb (N) and BCZYYb (CA).",Rapid Gas-Phase Synthesis of the Perovskite-Type BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Proton-Conducting Nanocrystalline Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c11492

5,17323,"BCZYYb (CA) shows more uniform doping with the element ratio of 1:0.74:0.12:0.08:0.1, which is very close to the theoretical value.",Rapid Gas-Phase Synthesis of the Perovskite-Type BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Proton-Conducting Nanocrystalline Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c11492
6,17323,"The shrinkage and surface SEM (scanning electron microscope) results indicate that the flame-made powders have superior sinterability compared to the sol-gel-made powders because of the smaller primary particle size (-,20 nm).",Rapid Gas-Phase Synthesis of the Perovskite-Type BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Proton-Conducting Nanocrystalline Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c11492
7,17323,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests show that BCZYYb (CA) sintered at 1450 degrees C has the highest protonic conductivity of 1.31 x 10-2 S cm-1 in wet H2 when operating at 600 degrees C and still maintains a high-level conductivity of 1.19 x 10-2 S cm-1 even when the sintering temperature is reduced to 1350 degrees C, which is mainly attributed to uniform doping and good sinterability.",Rapid Gas-Phase Synthesis of the Perovskite-Type BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Proton-Conducting Nanocrystalline Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c11492
8,17323,"The activation energy for the conductivity of BCZYYb (CA) is also significantly lower than that of conventional electrolytes, which suggests much better conductivity in the intermediate (-,600 degrees C) and even lower operating temperature.",Rapid Gas-Phase Synthesis of the Perovskite-Type BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Proton-Conducting Nanocrystalline Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c11492
9,17323,The excellent conductivity performance combined with the high-throughput production capability makes the swirling spray flame a promising synthesis method for promoting the BCZYYb electrolytes from lab to industrial-scale solid oxide fuel cells.,Rapid Gas-Phase Synthesis of the Perovskite-Type BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Proton-Conducting Nanocrystalline Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c11492
