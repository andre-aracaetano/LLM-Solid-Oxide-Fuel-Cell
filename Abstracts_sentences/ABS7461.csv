1,7461,"The potential solid oxide fuel cell anode material Sr2MgMoO6 adopts a root 2 x root 2 x 2 I (1) over bar superstructure of the simple perovskite cell, derived from an a(0)a(0)c(-) tilt system via distortion of the Mg- and Mo-centered octahedra.","Sr2MgMoO6-δ:: Structure, phase stability, and cation site order control of reduction",10.1021/cm0624116
2,7461,Reduction of Sr2MgMoO6 appears to be correlated with antisite disorder at either point or extended antiphase defects.,"Sr2MgMoO6-δ:: Structure, phase stability, and cation site order control of reduction",10.1021/cm0624116
3,7461,"The degree of reduction is small at temperatures below 900 degrees C. Upon further reduction above 900 degrees C, Sr2MgMoO6 begins to decompose into a reduced material modeled as an n = 2 Ruddlesden-Popper phase with a significantly higher Mo:Mg ratio, MgO, and Mo. Diffraction data are consistent with the reduced material being significantly intergrown with the perovskite matrix.","Sr2MgMoO6-δ:: Structure, phase stability, and cation site order control of reduction",10.1021/cm0624116
