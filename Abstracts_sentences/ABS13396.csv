4,13396,The decrease in roughness of the metal substrate used for deposition by spray-coating intermediary oxide layers had significant importance to the fabrication of functional layers as thin films.,Layered microstructures based on BaZr0.85Y0.15O3-δ by pulsed laser deposition for metal-supported proton ceramic electrolyser cells,10.1007/s10853-017-0884-1
5,13396,"Crystalline porous BZY15-NiO and dense BZY15 films were sequentially deposited at high substrate temperature on metal supports (MS) with or without an electron-conducting barrier oxide layer, e.g. MS/(BZY15-Ni)/(BZY15-NiO)/BZY15 and MS/CeO2/(BZY15-NiO)/BZY15.",Layered microstructures based on BaZr0.85Y0.15O3-δ by pulsed laser deposition for metal-supported proton ceramic electrolyser cells,10.1007/s10853-017-0884-1
6,13396,"The different microstructures for electrode and electrolyte were achieved with deposition steps at different substrate temperatures (800, 600 degrees C) and a gradual decrease in the pressure of O-2 in the deposition chamber.",Layered microstructures based on BaZr0.85Y0.15O3-δ by pulsed laser deposition for metal-supported proton ceramic electrolyser cells,10.1007/s10853-017-0884-1
