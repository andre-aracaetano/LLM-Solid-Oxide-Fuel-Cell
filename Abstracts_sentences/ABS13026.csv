2,13026,The Ni/GDC cermets with 18 and 44 wt.% Ni were prepared by a hydrothermal method.,Nickel/gadolinium-doped ceria anode for direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.05.088
3,13026,"Ethanol decomposition, steam reforming, and partial oxidation of ethanol were studied using a fixed-bed reactor at 1123 K. Carbon was formed only under dry ethanol for both catalysts.",Nickel/gadolinium-doped ceria anode for direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.05.088
4,13026,The addition of water or oxygen to the feed inhibited the formation of carbon.,Nickel/gadolinium-doped ceria anode for direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.05.088
5,13026,Ni/GDC was used as the anode current collector layer and as a catalytic layer in single cells tests.,Nickel/gadolinium-doped ceria anode for direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.05.088
6,13026,No deposits of carbon were detected in single cells with Ni/GDC catalytic layer after 50 h of continuous operation under direct (dry) ethanol.,Nickel/gadolinium-doped ceria anode for direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.05.088
7,13026,"This result was attributed to the catalytic properties of the Ni/GDC layer and the operation mechanism of gradual internal reforming, in which the oxidation of hydrogen provides the steam for ethanol reforming, thus avoiding carbon deposition.",Nickel/gadolinium-doped ceria anode for direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.05.088
