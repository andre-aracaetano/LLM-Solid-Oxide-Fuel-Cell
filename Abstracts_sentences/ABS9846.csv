1,9846,The impactors on cell degradation inside planar SOFC stacks were investigated using both coated and uncoated Fe16Cr alloys as the interconnects under stable operating conditions at 750?degrees C and thermal cycling conditions from 750 to 200?degrees C.,Investigation of Impactors on Cell Degradation Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200063
2,9846,It was found that cell degradation inside the stack is primarily dependent on the interfacial contact between the cathode current-collecting layer and the interconnect.,Investigation of Impactors on Cell Degradation Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200063
3,9846,"Additionally, cell degradation is found to be independent of the high-temperature oxidation and Cr vaporization of the interconnects during stack operation, as the stacks are well sealed.",Investigation of Impactors on Cell Degradation Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200063
4,9846,The coating on the interconnect can further improve the contact between the cell cathode and the interconnect when the latter is properly embedded into the current-collecting layer.,Investigation of Impactors on Cell Degradation Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200063
