2,4999,"Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) electrolyte, Ni-YSZ cermet anode and La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) cathode Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed tight integration between the cathode and electrolyte and good loading performance of LSM on the YSZ three-dimensional framework The thickness of the YSZ electrolyte film, the anode and the cathode was about 50, 600 and 100 mu m, respectively The effects of temperature (T), number of catalyst loading layers (n) and the volume ratio of CH4 and O-2 (R-mix =V(CH4)/V(O-2)) on the SC-SOFC performance was studied At T = 800 C. n=2 and R-mix=2, the single cell performed the best, the open voltage was 0 95 V, the maximum current density was 130 mA .",Preparation of Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cell by Co-Pressing and Direct Forming Process,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20100443
