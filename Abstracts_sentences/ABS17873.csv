2,17873,Understanding these features is crucial both to explain the oxide ion conduction process and to optimise it.,Pseudomorphic 2A → 2M → 2H phase transitions in lanthanum strontium germanate electrolyte apatites,10.1039/b907704a
3,17873,As the composition of putative P6(3)/m apatites with ideal formula [A(4)(I)][A(6)(II)][(BO4)(6)][X](2) is varied the [A(4)(I)(BO4)(6)] framework will flex to better accommodate the [A(6)(II)X(2)] tunnel component through adjustment of the A(I)O(6) metaprism twist angle (phi).,Pseudomorphic 2A → 2M → 2H phase transitions in lanthanum strontium germanate electrolyte apatites,10.1039/b907704a

7,17873,"Using a combination of diffraction and spectroscopic techniques it is shown that lanthanum strontium germanate oxide electrolytes crystallise as triclinic (A), monoclinic (M) and hexagonal (H) bi-layer pseudomorphs with the composition ranges: [La10-xSrx][(GeO4)(5+x/2)(GeO5)(1-x/2)][O-2] (0 <= x <= 1) apatite-2A",Pseudomorphic 2A → 2M → 2H phase transitions in lanthanum strontium germanate electrolyte apatites,10.1039/b907704a
