1,20396,The momentum towards reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by reduced use of conventional source in marine power networks as well as significant development of renewable energy resources (RRs) have been the motivating factors for inclusion RRs in hybrid maritime microgrid system (HM mu GS) and investigation of consequent frequent control mechanism.,Double stage controller optimization for load frequency stabilization in hybrid wind-ocean wave energy based maritime microgrid system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116171
2,20396,"This article presents an approach of load frequency control in an independent HM mu GS consisting of wind driven generation (WDG), Archimedes wave power generation (AWPG), marine biodiesel generator (MBG), solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) energy units, heat pump (HP) and freezer (FZR).",Double stage controller optimization for load frequency stabilization in hybrid wind-ocean wave energy based maritime microgrid system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116171
