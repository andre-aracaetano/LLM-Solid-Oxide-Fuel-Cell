1,14199,"A minor amount of CO2 in air usually causes a detrimental effect on oxygen activation over a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode because insulating surface carbonate is easily formed, which inhibits charge transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).",Turning Detrimental Effect into Benefits: Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Cobalt-Free Perovskites at Intermediate Temperature via CO2-Induced Surface Activation,10.1021/acsami.0c00975
2,14199,"In this study, we report that the detrimental effect due to the CO2 interaction with perovskite oxide can be turned into a beneficial effect for facilitating ORR through tailoring the material composition of the perovskite.",Turning Detrimental Effect into Benefits: Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Cobalt-Free Perovskites at Intermediate Temperature via CO2-Induced Surface Activation,10.1021/acsami.0c00975
3,14199,"More specifically, for cobalt-free SrSc0.025Nb0.075Fe0.9O3-delta (SSNF), the exposure to the CO2 atmosphere results in the formation of a minor amount of surface strontium carbonate mainly in the form of a nanofilm over the perovskite surface, which protects the electrode from further corrosion by CO2, thus achieving a relatively stable performance even under a 10% CO2-containing air atmosphere.",Turning Detrimental Effect into Benefits: Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Cobalt-Free Perovskites at Intermediate Temperature via CO2-Induced Surface Activation,10.1021/acsami.0c00975
4,14199,"When CO2-free air is restored, the SrCO3 is successfully decomposed at intermediate temperatures.",Turning Detrimental Effect into Benefits: Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Cobalt-Free Perovskites at Intermediate Temperature via CO2-Induced Surface Activation,10.1021/acsami.0c00975
5,14199,"As a result, the surface reaction kinetics is recovered to the initial degree while the charge transfer process is obviously improved.",Turning Detrimental Effect into Benefits: Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Cobalt-Free Perovskites at Intermediate Temperature via CO2-Induced Surface Activation,10.1021/acsami.0c00975
6,14199,"An area-specific resistance of only 0.07 Omega cm(2) is achieved at 650 degrees C after the CO2-induced surface activation, much smaller than the original value of 0.13 Omega cm(2).",Turning Detrimental Effect into Benefits: Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Cobalt-Free Perovskites at Intermediate Temperature via CO2-Induced Surface Activation,10.1021/acsami.0c00975
7,14199,"In addition, the CO2-treated electrode shows a fairly stable performance for ORR under a subsequent CO2-free air atmosphere.",Turning Detrimental Effect into Benefits: Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Cobalt-Free Perovskites at Intermediate Temperature via CO2-Induced Surface Activation,10.1021/acsami.0c00975
8,14199,"To create such a beneficial effect, it is critical to tailor the degree of interaction of the perovskite surface with CO2, while the benchmark Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d (BSCF) shows a too strong interaction with CO2 with the formation of bulk-phase-like carbonate, which failed to decomposed even when restored with a CO2-free atmosphere at intermediate temperatures, and as a result, worsened the ORR activity after the CO2 treatment.",Turning Detrimental Effect into Benefits: Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Cobalt-Free Perovskites at Intermediate Temperature via CO2-Induced Surface Activation,10.1021/acsami.0c00975
