1,17071,"The linear thermal expansion behavior of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (- delta) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (- delta), which have attracted much interest as cathode material for solid oxide fuel cell, was measured with dilatometer under various oxygen partial pressures, P(O-2).",Dependence of thermal expansion of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 - δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - δ on oxygen partial pressure,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.09.019
2,17071,Thermal expansion coefficient of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (- delta) is independent on P(O-2) and between 120 x 10(-5) K-1 and 135 x 10(-5) K-1 in the measurement conditions of this study.,Dependence of thermal expansion of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 - δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - δ on oxygen partial pressure,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.09.019
3,17071,Thermal expansion coefficient of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (- delta) is much larger than that of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (- delta) and increases with decreasing P(02).,Dependence of thermal expansion of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 - δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - δ on oxygen partial pressure,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.09.019
4,17071,The difference of P(O-2) dependence of thermal expansion behavior between LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (- delta) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (- delta) could be ascribed to the difference of the dependence of oxygen nonstoichiometry on temperature and P(O-2).,Dependence of thermal expansion of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 - δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - δ on oxygen partial pressure,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.09.019
5,17071,"Due to little variation of delta by temperature at constant P(O-2) in LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (- delta), chemical expansion due to generation of scarcely contributes to total expansion, while chemical expansion largely contributes to total expansion of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (- delta) especially under low P(O-2) owing to larger variation of S by temperature at constant P(02).",Dependence of thermal expansion of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 - δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - δ on oxygen partial pressure,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.09.019
6,17071,"By comparison with thermal expansion behavior of 8 mol% yttria stabilized ZrO2, 8YSZ, under various P(02), it was concluded that mechanical compatibility of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (- delta) against 8YSZ was better since La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (- delta) showed not only much larger thermal expansion coefficient than 8YSZ but also large P(O-2) dependence.",Dependence of thermal expansion of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 - δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - δ on oxygen partial pressure,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.09.019
