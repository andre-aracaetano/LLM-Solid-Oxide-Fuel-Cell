1,7269,Thermal management in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is a critical issue due to non-uniform electrochemical reactions and convective flows within the cells.,Temperature Gradient Analyses of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fueled by Methanol,10.1007/s12209-022-00331-0
2,7269,"Therefore, a 2D mathematical model is established herein to investigate the thermal responses of a tubular methanol-fueled SOFC.",Temperature Gradient Analyses of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fueled by Methanol,10.1007/s12209-022-00331-0
3,7269,"Results show that unlike the low-temperature condition of 873 K, where the peak temperature gradient occurs at the cell center, it appears near the fuel inlet at 1073 K because of the rapid temperature rise induced by the elevated current density.",Temperature Gradient Analyses of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fueled by Methanol,10.1007/s12209-022-00331-0
4,7269,"Despite the large heat convection capacity, excessive air could not effectively eliminate the harmful temperature gradient caused by the large current density.",Temperature Gradient Analyses of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fueled by Methanol,10.1007/s12209-022-00331-0
5,7269,"Thus, optimal control of the current density by properly selecting the operating potential could generate a local thermal neutral state.",Temperature Gradient Analyses of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fueled by Methanol,10.1007/s12209-022-00331-0
6,7269,"Interestingly, the maximum axial temperature gradient could be reduced by about 18% at 973 K and 20% at 1073 K when the air with a 5 K higher temperature is supplied.",Temperature Gradient Analyses of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fueled by Methanol,10.1007/s12209-022-00331-0
7,7269,"Additionally, despite the higher electrochemical performance observed, the cell with a counter-flow arrangement featured by a larger hot area and higher maximum temperature gradients is not preferable for a ceramic SOFC system considering thermal durability.",Temperature Gradient Analyses of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fueled by Methanol,10.1007/s12209-022-00331-0
8,7269,"Overall, this study could provide insightful thermal information for the operating condition selection, structure design, and stability assessment of realistic SOFCs combined with their internal reforming process.",Temperature Gradient Analyses of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fueled by Methanol,10.1007/s12209-022-00331-0
