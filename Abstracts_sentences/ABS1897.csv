1,1897,A dynamic model of a 100 MW solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid system has been developed and subjected to perturbations in diurnal ambient temperature and pressure as well as load sheds.,Diurnal Temperature and Pressure Effects on Axial Turbomachinery Stability in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine Hybrid Systems,10.1115/1.4003163
2,1897,"The dynamic system responses monitored were the fuel cell electrolyte temperature, gas turbine shaft speed, turbine inlet temperature, and compressor surge.",Diurnal Temperature and Pressure Effects on Axial Turbomachinery Stability in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine Hybrid Systems,10.1115/1.4003163
3,1897,"Using a control strategy that primarily focuses on holding fuel cell electrolyte temperature constant and secondarily on maintaining gas turbine shaft speed, safe operation was found to occur for expected ambient pressure variation ranges and for ambient temperature variations up to 28 K when tested nonsimultaneously.",Diurnal Temperature and Pressure Effects on Axial Turbomachinery Stability in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine Hybrid Systems,10.1115/1.4003163
4,1897,"When ambient temperature and pressure were varied simultaneously, stable operation was found to occur when the two are in phase but not when the two are out of phase.",Diurnal Temperature and Pressure Effects on Axial Turbomachinery Stability in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine Hybrid Systems,10.1115/1.4003163
5,1897,The latter case leads to shaft overspeed.,Diurnal Temperature and Pressure Effects on Axial Turbomachinery Stability in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine Hybrid Systems,10.1115/1.4003163
6,1897,Compressor surge was found to be more likely when the system is subjected to a load shed initiated at minimum ambient temperature rather than at maximum ambient temperature.,Diurnal Temperature and Pressure Effects on Axial Turbomachinery Stability in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine Hybrid Systems,10.1115/1.4003163
7,1897,Fuel cell electrolyte temperature was found to be well-controlled except in the case of shaft overspeeds.,Diurnal Temperature and Pressure Effects on Axial Turbomachinery Stability in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine Hybrid Systems,10.1115/1.4003163
8,1897,Turbine inlet temperature remained in safe bounds for all cases.,Diurnal Temperature and Pressure Effects on Axial Turbomachinery Stability in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine Hybrid Systems,10.1115/1.4003163
