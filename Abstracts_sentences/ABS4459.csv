1,4459,Hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that can operate in the intermediate temperature range of 500-700 degrees C represent an attractive SOFC device for combined heat and power applications in the industrial market.,A Direct n-Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1)0.9Ni0.05Ru0.05O3-δ Perovskite as the Reforming Layer,10.1021/acsami.1c02502
2,4459,One of the ways to realize such a device relies upon exploiting an in situ steam reforming process in the anode catalyzed by an anti-carbon coking catalyst.,A Direct n-Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1)0.9Ni0.05Ru0.05O3-δ Perovskite as the Reforming Layer,10.1021/acsami.1c02502
3,4459,"Here, we report a new Ni and Ru bimetal-doped perovskite catalyst, Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1)(0.9)Ni0.05Ru0.05O3-delta (BZCYYbNRu), with enhanced catalytic hydrogen production activity on n-butane (C4H10), which can resist carbon coking over extended operation durations.",A Direct n-Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1)0.9Ni0.05Ru0.05O3-δ Perovskite as the Reforming Layer,10.1021/acsami.1c02502
4,4459,"Ru in the perovskite lattice inhibits Ni precipitation from perovskite, and the high water adsorption capacity of proton conducting perovskite improves the coking resistance of BZCYYbNRu.",A Direct n-Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1)0.9Ni0.05Ru0.05O3-δ Perovskite as the Reforming Layer,10.1021/acsami.1c02502
5,4459,"When BZCYYbNRu is used as a steam reforming catalyst layer on a Ni-YSZ-supported anode, the single fuel cell not only achieves a higher power density of 1113 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C under a 10 mL min(-1) C4H10 continuous feed stream at a steam to carbon (H2O/C) ratio of 0.5 but also shows a much better operational stability for 100 h at 600 degrees C compared with those reported in the literature.",A Direct n-Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1)0.9Ni0.05Ru0.05O3-δ Perovskite as the Reforming Layer,10.1021/acsami.1c02502
