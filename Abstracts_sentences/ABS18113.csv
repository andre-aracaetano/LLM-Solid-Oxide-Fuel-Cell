2,18113,"Adsorption and surface diffusion of oxygen adsorbates on the pore walls, interfacial diffusion of adsorbates, and electrochemical reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface are considered, as well as the nonuniform current and potential distribution in the electrolyte.",Current distribution at porous electrode-solid oxide electrolyte interface,10.1149/1.1838775
3,18113,In particular; the effect of a nonuniform current distribution along the electrode/electrolyte interface is investigated.,Current distribution at porous electrode-solid oxide electrolyte interface,10.1149/1.1838775
