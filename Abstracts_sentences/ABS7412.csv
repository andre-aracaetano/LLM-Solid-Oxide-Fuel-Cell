2,7412,The core-shell nanocomposite particles are smaller than 100 nm with amorphous Na2CO3 shell of 46 nm in thickness.,Novel core-shell SDC/amorphous Na2CO3 nanocomposite electrolyte for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.08.023
3,7412,"The nanocomposite electrolyte shows superionic conductivity above 300 degrees C, where the conductivity reaches over 0.1 S cm(-1).",Novel core-shell SDC/amorphous Na2CO3 nanocomposite electrolyte for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.08.023
4,7412,Such high conductive nanocomposite has been applied in low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LTSOFCs) with an excellent performance of 0.8 W cm(-2) at 550 degrees C. A new potential approach of designing and developing superionic conductors for LTSOFCs was presented to develop interface as 'superionic highway' in two-phase materials based on coated SDC.,Novel core-shell SDC/amorphous Na2CO3 nanocomposite electrolyte for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.08.023
