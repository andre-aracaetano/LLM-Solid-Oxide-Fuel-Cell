1,17635,"Large fergusonite-type (ABO(4), A=Ce, B=Nb) oxide crystals, a prototype electrolyte composition for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), were prepared for the first time in a floating zone mirror furnace under air or argon atmospheres.","Fergusonite-type CeNbO4+δ: Single crystal growth, symmetry revision and conductivity",10.1016/j.jssc.2013.06.022
2,17635,"While CeNbO4 grown in air contained CeNbO4.08 as a minor impurity that compromised structural analysis, the argon atmosphere yielded a single phase crystal of monoclinic CeNbO4, as confirmed by selected area electron diffraction, powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction.","Fergusonite-type CeNbO4+δ: Single crystal growth, symmetry revision and conductivity",10.1016/j.jssc.2013.06.022
3,17635,"The structure was determined in the standard space group setting C12/c1 (No. 15), rather than the commonly adopted I12/a1.","Fergusonite-type CeNbO4+δ: Single crystal growth, symmetry revision and conductivity",10.1016/j.jssc.2013.06.022
4,17635,AC impedance spectroscopy conducted under argon found that stoichiometric CeNbO4 single crystals showed lower conductivity compared to CeNbO4+delta confirming interstitial oxygen can penetrate through fergusonite and is responsible for the higher conductivity associated with these oxides.,"Fergusonite-type CeNbO4+δ: Single crystal growth, symmetry revision and conductivity",10.1016/j.jssc.2013.06.022
