1,10490,Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell that is capable of directly using hydrocarbon without external reforming have been of great interest recently.,Characterization of a Cu-La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-CeO2/La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-YSZ/Ni-ScSZ Three-Layer Structure Anode in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Running on Methane Fuel,10.1002/fuce.201400108
2,10490,"In this paper, a three-layer structure anode running on methane is fabricated by tape casting and screen printing method.",Characterization of a Cu-La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-CeO2/La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-YSZ/Ni-ScSZ Three-Layer Structure Anode in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Running on Methane Fuel,10.1002/fuce.201400108
3,10490,"The slurry of catalyst layer Cu-LSCM-CeO2 (with weight ratios of 1.5: 7.0: 1.5, 2.0: 7.0: 1.0, 2.15: 7.0: 0.85 and 2.25: 7.0: 0.75, weight ratios of Cu/CeO2 is 1: 1, 2: 1, 2.5: 1 and 3: 1, respectively) is screen-printed on LSCM-YSZ support layer and Ni-ScSZ active layer.",Characterization of a Cu-La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-CeO2/La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-YSZ/Ni-ScSZ Three-Layer Structure Anode in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Running on Methane Fuel,10.1002/fuce.201400108
4,10490,"Thus, LSCM-YSZ/Ni-ScSZ anodes with Cu-LSCM-CeO2 catalyst layer (denoted as LSCM-YSZ1010, LSCM-YSZ2010, LSCM-YSZ2510 and LSCM-YSZ3010, respectively) are obtained.",Characterization of a Cu-La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-CeO2/La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-YSZ/Ni-ScSZ Three-Layer Structure Anode in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Running on Methane Fuel,10.1002/fuce.201400108
5,10490,"Single cells with three-layer structure anode are also fabricated and measured, of which the maximum power density reaches 491 and 670 mW cm(-2) for the cell with LSCM-YSZ2510 anode running on methane at 750 degrees C and 800 degrees C, respectively.",Characterization of a Cu-La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-CeO2/La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-YSZ/Ni-ScSZ Three-Layer Structure Anode in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Running on Methane Fuel,10.1002/fuce.201400108
6,10490,"No significant degradation in performance has been observed after 240h of cell testing when LSCM-YSZ2510 anode is exposed to methane at 750 degrees C. Very little carbon deposition is detected on the anode, suggesting that carbon deposition is limited during cell operation.",Characterization of a Cu-La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-CeO2/La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-YSZ/Ni-ScSZ Three-Layer Structure Anode in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Running on Methane Fuel,10.1002/fuce.201400108
7,10490,"Consequently, Cu-LSCM-CeO2 catalyst layer on the surface of LSCM-YSZ support layer makes it possible to have good stability for long-term operation in methane due to very little carbon deposition.",Characterization of a Cu-La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-CeO2/La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-YSZ/Ni-ScSZ Three-Layer Structure Anode in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Running on Methane Fuel,10.1002/fuce.201400108
