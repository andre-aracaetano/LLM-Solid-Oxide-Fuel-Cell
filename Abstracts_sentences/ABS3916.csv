1,3916,Rapid performance degradations of solid oxide fuel cells were observed when the chromium-forming metallic alloys were used as interconnects.,ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF LOW-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS UNDER CHROMIUM POISONING CONDITIONS,10.1080/15435070903364764
2,3916,The formation of strontium chromium oxide (SrCrO4) on the surface of Sr-doped perovskite cathode was believed to be one of the main causes for the cell degradation.,ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF LOW-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS UNDER CHROMIUM POISONING CONDITIONS,10.1080/15435070903364764
3,3916,This chromium-poisoning effect was not mitigated when the operating temperature was lowered to 600 degrees C.,ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF LOW-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS UNDER CHROMIUM POISONING CONDITIONS,10.1080/15435070903364764
4,3916,"The SrCrO4 that formed mainly on the cathode surface was found in both La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (SSCo) cathode, suggesting that all strontium-containing cathodes may develop low conductive chromite oxide compounds.",ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF LOW-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS UNDER CHROMIUM POISONING CONDITIONS,10.1080/15435070903364764
5,3916,"However, this chromium-poisoning effect can be effectively mitigated by coating a protective layer on the surface of the interconnect.",ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF LOW-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS UNDER CHROMIUM POISONING CONDITIONS,10.1080/15435070903364764
