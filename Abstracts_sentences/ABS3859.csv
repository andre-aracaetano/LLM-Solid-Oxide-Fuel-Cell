2,3859,Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data reveals that SFM crystallizes in the simple cubic perovskite structure with iron and molybdenum disordered on the B-site.,Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as a regenerative anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.085
3,3859,"No structure transition was observed by variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction measurements in the temperature range of 25-800 degrees C. XPS results show that the iron and molybdenum valences change with an increase in temperature, where the mixed oxidation states of both iron and molybdenum are believed to be responsible for the increase in the electrical conductivity with increasing temperature.",Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as a regenerative anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.085
4,3859,SFM exhibits excellent redox stability and has been used as both anode and cathode for solid oxide fuel cells.,Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as a regenerative anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.085
5,3859,"Presence of sulfur species in the fuel or direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuel can result in loss of activity, however, as shown in this paper, the anode performance can be regenerated from sulfur poisoning or coking by treating the anode in an oxidizing atmosphere.",Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as a regenerative anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.085
6,3859,"Thus, SFM can be used as a regenerating anode for direct oxidation of sulfur-containing hydrocarbon fuels.",Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ as a regenerative anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.085
