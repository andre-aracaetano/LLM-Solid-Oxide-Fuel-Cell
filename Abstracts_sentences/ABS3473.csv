3,3473,A novel composite sealing gasket is successfully developed to mimic the unique features of the elastomer-based compressive seal by controlling the composition and packing behavior of binary ceramic fillers.,Effect of Elastic Network of Ceramic Fillers on Thermal Cycle Stability of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1002/aenm.201100355
4,3473,"A single-cell SOFC stack undergoes more than 100 thermal cycles with little performance loss, during which the sealing integrity is lost/recovered repeatedly upon cooling and reheating, corresponding to unloading/loading of the elastomer-based compressive seal.",Effect of Elastic Network of Ceramic Fillers on Thermal Cycle Stability of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1002/aenm.201100355
5,3473,The thermal-cycle responses of the SOFC stack are explained in sequence by the concurrent events of elastic deformation/recovery of ceramic filler network and corresponding redistribution of sealing glass.,Effect of Elastic Network of Ceramic Fillers on Thermal Cycle Stability of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1002/aenm.201100355
