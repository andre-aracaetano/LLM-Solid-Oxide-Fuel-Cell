2,13858,Although it is known that LaGaO3 doped with Sr and Mg denoted as LSGM has reactivity with NiO in substrate and nickel diffusion into LSGM film was occurred during co-sintering.,Sr(La)TiO3 Anode Substrate for Low Ni Diffusion in Sr- and Mg-Doped LaGaO3 Film Prepared with Co-Sintering Method for Intermediate Temperature Tubular Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0821707jes
3,13858,Nickel diffusion can be decreased by using Ce0.6La0.4O2-TiO2 (Ti-LDC) and Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2 (CMF) buffer bilayer.,Sr(La)TiO3 Anode Substrate for Low Ni Diffusion in Sr- and Mg-Doped LaGaO3 Film Prepared with Co-Sintering Method for Intermediate Temperature Tubular Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0821707jes

5,13858,"Since nickel is reacted with Ti4+ in substrate, nickel diffusionwas significantly suppressed by using SLT for anode substrate and the cell using LSGM film with suppressed amount of Ni diffusion shows reasonable high open circuit potential and power density.",Sr(La)TiO3 Anode Substrate for Low Ni Diffusion in Sr- and Mg-Doped LaGaO3 Film Prepared with Co-Sintering Method for Intermediate Temperature Tubular Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0821707jes
6,13858,"The single SOFC using NiO-SLT substrate shows the maximum power density of 0.412, 0.165 and 0.065 W/cm2 at 973, 873, and 773 K, respectively.",Sr(La)TiO3 Anode Substrate for Low Ni Diffusion in Sr- and Mg-Doped LaGaO3 Film Prepared with Co-Sintering Method for Intermediate Temperature Tubular Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0821707jes
7,13858,"Although anodic overpotential is almost the same with that of the cell prepared on NiO-Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 (GDC) substrate, anodic IR loss became much smaller on NiO-GDC at low temperature and this may be assigned to the high conductivity of GDC at low temperature.",Sr(La)TiO3 Anode Substrate for Low Ni Diffusion in Sr- and Mg-Doped LaGaO3 Film Prepared with Co-Sintering Method for Intermediate Temperature Tubular Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0821707jes
8,13858,"However, at high temperature, because of small overpotential, the cell using LSGM film on NiO-SLT anode substrate shows higher power density than that of NiO-GDC cell.",Sr(La)TiO3 Anode Substrate for Low Ni Diffusion in Sr- and Mg-Doped LaGaO3 Film Prepared with Co-Sintering Method for Intermediate Temperature Tubular Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0821707jes
