2,21042,Previous studies showed that reversal (re-incorporation) of such dopant segregation layers can occur under both cathodic and anodic potential in Sr-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) as a model perovskite system.,Cation deficiency enables reversal of dopant segregation at perovskite oxide surfaces under anodic potential,10.1039/d2ta09118f
3,21042,Sr segregation under anodic and reversal of segregation under cathodic potential could be explained by a defect equilibrium reaction involving A-site cation vacancies and Mn oxidation state.,Cation deficiency enables reversal of dopant segregation at perovskite oxide surfaces under anodic potential,10.1039/d2ta09118f
