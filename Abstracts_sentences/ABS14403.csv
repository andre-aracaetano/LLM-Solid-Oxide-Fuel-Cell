4,14403,The results indicate that increasing the porosity in a homogeneous porous electrode does not always promote the cell's j-V performance.,Novel porous electrode designs for reversible solid oxide hydrogen planar cell through multi-physics modeling,10.1002/fuce.202200151

7,14403,"Furthermore, it is discovered that theoretically grading the porosity in the width direction (i.e., increasing porosity from the center of each gas channel to the center of each adjacent rib) brings an outsize benefit on the cell's performance, compared to the traditional way of improving the porosity along the cell thickness direction.",Novel porous electrode designs for reversible solid oxide hydrogen planar cell through multi-physics modeling,10.1002/fuce.202200151
