1,13108,Nanocrystalline fluorite type samarium doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte thin film for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) application were prepared on the dense and porous substrates at low temperatures of 573-1373 K using a novel citrate sol-gel route combined with a sol suspension spray coating technique.,Preparation of SDC electrolyte thin films on dense and porous substrates by modified sol-grel route,10.1016/j.mseb.2007.09.039
2,13108,Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the decomposition of the citrate gel film and the initial crystallization of the SDC occurred at a low temperature of about 590 K. XRD examination revealed that the annealing of the green film at temperatures of 573-1373 K provided cubic nanocrystalline SDC phase.,Preparation of SDC electrolyte thin films on dense and porous substrates by modified sol-grel route,10.1016/j.mseb.2007.09.039
