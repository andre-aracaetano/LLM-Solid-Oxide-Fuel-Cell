1,10952,"The present work proposes a novel approach for the removal of soot from a synthesis gas mixture for fuel cell applications, based on reactions between the particulate and syngas in a wall-flow filter, while respecting the constraints of an SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) and avoiding excesses of trap backpressure.",Experimental analysis of soot abatement in reducing syngas for high temperature fuel cell feeding,10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.112
2,10952,The experiments were performed on a test-rig with a TPOX (thermal partial oxidation) reformer and a wall-flow soot-trap.,Experimental analysis of soot abatement in reducing syngas for high temperature fuel cell feeding,10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.112
3,10952,The operating range varied from 3 to 8 kW of thermal load and from 0.40 to 0.50 of air-to-fuel ratio.,Experimental analysis of soot abatement in reducing syngas for high temperature fuel cell feeding,10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.112
4,10952,"The work shows that is possible to establish an equilibrium between the soot that enters the filter and the soot that is gasified, in order to avoid backpressures due to particle deposition in the channels, by running the reformer at specific air ratio conditions along the power load and without the addition of oxygen.",Experimental analysis of soot abatement in reducing syngas for high temperature fuel cell feeding,10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.112
5,10952,The capacity of the synthesis gas mixture to regenerate the trap has appeared to be directly related to the thermal load.,Experimental analysis of soot abatement in reducing syngas for high temperature fuel cell feeding,10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.112
6,10952,"The final part instead presents results concerning the effects of lambda and air pre-heating, analysed separately, in order to evaluate the effect of each one on the kinetics of the filter regeneration.",Experimental analysis of soot abatement in reducing syngas for high temperature fuel cell feeding,10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.112
7,10952,The tests showed how high lambda leads to a faster gasification rate of soot.,Experimental analysis of soot abatement in reducing syngas for high temperature fuel cell feeding,10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.112
8,10952,"A positive effect could also be achieved by increasing the air pre-heating temperature that enters the reactor, but this parameter does not appear to be as effective as the previous ones.",Experimental analysis of soot abatement in reducing syngas for high temperature fuel cell feeding,10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.112
