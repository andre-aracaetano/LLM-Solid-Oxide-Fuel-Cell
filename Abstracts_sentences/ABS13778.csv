1,13778,"We report the results of first-principles calculations (generalized gradient approximation-Perdew Wang 1991) on the electronic and vibrational properties of several nickel sulfides that are observed on Ni-based anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) upon exposure to H2S contaminated fuels: heazlewoodite Ni3S2, millerite NiS, polydymite Ni3S4, and pyrite NiS2.",Electronic and vibrational properties of nickel sulfides from first principles,10.1063/1.2801985
2,13778,The optimized lattice parameters of these sulfides are within 1% of the values determined from x-ray diffraction.,Electronic and vibrational properties of nickel sulfides from first principles,10.1063/1.2801985
3,13778,The electronic structure analysis indicates that all Ni-S bonds are strongly covalent.,Electronic and vibrational properties of nickel sulfides from first principles,10.1063/1.2801985
4,13778,"Furthermore, it is found that the nickel d orbitals shift downward in energy, whereas the sulfur p orbitals shift upward with increasing sulfur content; this is consistent with the decrease in conductivity and catalytic activity of sulfur-contaminated Ni-based electrodes (or degradation in SOFC performance).",Electronic and vibrational properties of nickel sulfides from first principles,10.1063/1.2801985
5,13778,"In addition, we systematically analyze the classifications of the vibrational modes at the Gamma point from the crystal symmetry and calculate the corresponding vibrational frequencies from the optimized lattice constants.",Electronic and vibrational properties of nickel sulfides from first principles,10.1063/1.2801985
6,13778,This information is vital to the identification with in situ vibrational spectroscopy of the nickel sulfides formed on Ni-based electrodes under the conditions for SOFC operation.,Electronic and vibrational properties of nickel sulfides from first principles,10.1063/1.2801985
7,13778,"Finally, the effect of thermal expansion on frequency calculations for the Ni3S2 system is also briefly examined.",Electronic and vibrational properties of nickel sulfides from first principles,10.1063/1.2801985
