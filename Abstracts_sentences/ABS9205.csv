2,9205,Dry reforming to convert CH4-CO2 into CO-H-2 syngas before entering Ni-based anode may potentially be an effective and economical method to address the coking problem.,Enhanced electrochemical performance and durability for direct CH4-CO2 solid oxide fuel cells with an on-cell reforming layer,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.107
3,9205,"Consequently, an on-cell reforming layer outside the Ni-based anode is expected to offer a unique solution for direct CH4-CO2 SOFCs without coking.",Enhanced electrochemical performance and durability for direct CH4-CO2 solid oxide fuel cells with an on-cell reforming layer,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.107
4,9205,"In this study, Ni-GDC anode-supported cells with and without a Sr2Co0.4Fe1.2Mo0.4O6-delta (SCFM) layer outside the anode support have been fabricated and evaluated using either H-2 or CH4-CO2 as fuel.",Enhanced electrochemical performance and durability for direct CH4-CO2 solid oxide fuel cells with an on-cell reforming layer,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.107
5,9205,"Both types of cells show excellent electrochemical performance when H-2 is used as fuel, and the SCFM layer has negligible impact on the cell performance.",Enhanced electrochemical performance and durability for direct CH4-CO2 solid oxide fuel cells with an on-cell reforming layer,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.107
6,9205,"When CH4-CO2 is used as fuel, however, the electrochemical performance and durability of the cells with the SCFM layer are much better than those without the SCFM layer outside the NiGDC anode, indicating that the SCFM layer can efficiently perform dry reforming.",Enhanced electrochemical performance and durability for direct CH4-CO2 solid oxide fuel cells with an on-cell reforming layer,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.107
