1,2292,"Thin ceramic bi-layered membrane comprising yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) is fabricated by the cost-effective slurry spin coating technique, and it is evaluated as an electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Slurry spin coating of thin film yttria stabilized zirconia/gadolinia doped ceria bi-layer electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.07.080
2,2292,It is demonstrated that the slurry spin coating method is capable of fabricating porous ceramic films by adjusting the content of ethyl-cellulose binders in the source slurry.,Slurry spin coating of thin film yttria stabilized zirconia/gadolinia doped ceria bi-layer electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.07.080
3,2292,The porous GDC layer deposited by spin coating under an optimal condition functions satisfactorily as a cathode-electrolyte interlayer in the test SOFC stack.,Slurry spin coating of thin film yttria stabilized zirconia/gadolinia doped ceria bi-layer electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.07.080
4,2292,"A 2-mu m-thick electrolyte membrane of the spin coated YSZ/GDC bi-layer is successfully deposited as a dense and stable film directly on a porous NiO-YSZ anode support without any interlayers, and the SOFC produces power output over 200 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, with an open circuit voltage close to 1 V. Electrochemical impedance spectra analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of the fuel cell components in relation with the microstructure of the spin-coated layers.",Slurry spin coating of thin film yttria stabilized zirconia/gadolinia doped ceria bi-layer electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.07.080
