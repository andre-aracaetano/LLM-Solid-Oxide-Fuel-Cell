1,4426,The performance of a 300 kW solid oxide fuel cell gas turbine (SOFC-GT) pilot power plant simulator is evaluated by applying a set of robust proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers that satisfy time delay and gain uncertainties of the SOFC-GT system.,Apply Robust Proportional Integral Derivative Controller to a Fuel Cell Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.4038635
2,4426,"The actuators are a fuel valve (FV) that models the fuel cell (FC) thermal exhaust, and a cold-air (CA) valve which bypasses airflow rate from the FC cathode.",Apply Robust Proportional Integral Derivative Controller to a Fuel Cell Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.4038635
3,4426,"The robust PID controller results for the upper and lower boundary of uncertain gains are presented first, followed by a design for the upper and lower boundary of uncertain time delays process for both, FV and CA bypass valves.",Apply Robust Proportional Integral Derivative Controller to a Fuel Cell Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.4038635
4,4426,The final design incorporates the combined uncertain gain and the time delay modeling for the upper and lower boundary of both actuators.,Apply Robust Proportional Integral Derivative Controller to a Fuel Cell Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.4038635
5,4426,This multiple-input multiple-output technique is beneficial to plants having a wide range of operation and a strong parameter interaction.,Apply Robust Proportional Integral Derivative Controller to a Fuel Cell Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.4038635
6,4426,The practical implementation of the PID controllers and the set point responses are presented through simulation in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.,Apply Robust Proportional Integral Derivative Controller to a Fuel Cell Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.4038635
