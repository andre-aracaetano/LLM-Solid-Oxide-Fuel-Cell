1,4490,"In this work, we investigate cobalt-free Ruddlesden Popper oxide with the nominal composition of PrSr3Fe3O10-delta(PSF) as potential cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells based on Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte.",PrSr3Fe3O10-δ as cobalt-free cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128489
2,4490,It is found that PSF is chemically compatible with the SDC for temperatures up to 1000 degrees C.,PrSr3Fe3O10-δ as cobalt-free cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128489
3,4490,"The average thermal expansion coefficient of PSF in air is 16.5 x 10(-6) K-1 in a temperature range of 30-1000 degrees C, and its electrical conductivity reaches the maximum value of 98 S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C.",PrSr3Fe3O10-δ as cobalt-free cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128489
4,4490,The area specific resistance of PSF is 0.075 52 cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Peak power density of 405 mW cm(-2) is achieved with PSF at 800 degrees C. (c) 2020,PrSr3Fe3O10-δ as cobalt-free cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128489
