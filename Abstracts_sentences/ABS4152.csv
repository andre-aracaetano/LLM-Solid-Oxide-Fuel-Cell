4,4152,General observations from structural analyses are that different preparation techniques resulted in two-phase composite particles in different particle sizes varying from micrometer level to nano-level accompanying also different homogeneity.,SDC-LiNa carbonate composite and nanocomposite electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.05.064
5,4152,"General observations from impedance analyses are that for the nanocomposites (particle size at nano-scale) more complex grain boundary interface effects are observed compared to that for samples with grains of the micrometer level, but nanocomposites showed enhanced conductivities at the low temperatures.",SDC-LiNa carbonate composite and nanocomposite electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.05.064
