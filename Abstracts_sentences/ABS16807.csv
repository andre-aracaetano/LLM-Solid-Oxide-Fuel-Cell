1,16807,"Identical strontium-doped LaMnO3 and yttria-doped zirconia (LSM-YSZ) composite electrodes were characterized in three separate cell configurations, in air at 973 K using impedance spectroscopy.",Effect of polarization on and implications for characterization of LSM-YSZ composite cathodes,10.1149/1.1667792
2,16807,"These configurations included a single-cell solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), a symmetric cell (cathode/YSZ/cathode), and a thick pellet half-cell.",Effect of polarization on and implications for characterization of LSM-YSZ composite cathodes,10.1149/1.1667792
3,16807,"Large discrepancies were observed in the measurements, with the electrode showing a current-independent area-specific resistance (ASR) of similar to0.2 Omega cm(2) as an SOFC cathode, while nearly identical electrodes in the other two configurations exhibited nonlinear behavior, with ASR as large as 12 Omega cm(2).",Effect of polarization on and implications for characterization of LSM-YSZ composite cathodes,10.1149/1.1667792
