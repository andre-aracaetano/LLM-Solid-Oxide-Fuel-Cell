1,4438,"In this study, three different nickel based meshes are investigated as an anode side current collector and flow-field for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to reduce the fabrication cost.",Effects of mesh and interconnector design on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.101
2,4438,The same meshes are also tested on the conventional interconnectors with machined gas channels for comparison.,Effects of mesh and interconnector design on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.101
3,4438,Eight different short stacks are installed for this purpose.,Effects of mesh and interconnector design on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.101
4,4438,The characterizations of the short stacks are achieved via performance tests together with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses.,Effects of mesh and interconnector design on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.101
5,4438,The experimental results reveal that the woven nickel mesh provides the required current collection and can act as an anode flow-field.,Effects of mesh and interconnector design on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.101
6,4438,It is also found that the spot welding of this mesh significantly improves the cell performance due to the enhanced contact between the mesh and the interconnector.,Effects of mesh and interconnector design on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.101
7,4438,"Therefore, the spot welded nickel mesh can be directly employed on the anode interconnector as an effective anode current collector and flow-field without machining gas channels to reduce the SOFC cell/stack fabrication cost.",Effects of mesh and interconnector design on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.101
