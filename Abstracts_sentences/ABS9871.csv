1,9871,The investigations of sequential cyclic reduction and oxidation (redox) of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode substrates presented here are aimed at monitoring and understanding changes in critical physical and mechanical properties as a function of degree of oxidation at 800 degrees C.,Changes in physical and mechanical properties of SOFCNi-YSZ composites caused by redox cycling,10.1149/1.2883731
2,9871,"The commonly observed expansion on oxidation, and its irreversibility on subsequent reduction, was confirmed but was found to be greatly dependent on oxidation conditions, giving strains in the range 0.55-0.8%.",Changes in physical and mechanical properties of SOFCNi-YSZ composites caused by redox cycling,10.1149/1.2883731
3,9871,"Nevertheless, redox cycling was accompanied by reversible changes in elastic modulus and no significant damage was detected in the YSZ network.",Changes in physical and mechanical properties of SOFCNi-YSZ composites caused by redox cycling,10.1149/1.2883731
