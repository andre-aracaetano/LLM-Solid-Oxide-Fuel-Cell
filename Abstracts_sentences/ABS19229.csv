1,19229,Rare-earth doped ceria materials are amongst the top choices for use in electrolytes and composite electrodes in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Effect of Reduced Atmosphere Sintering on Blocking Grain Boundaries in Rare-Earth Doped Ceria,10.3390/inorganics9080063
2,19229,"Trivalent acceptor dopants such as gadolinium, which mediate the ionic conductivity in ceria by creating oxygen vacancies, have a tendency to segregate at grain boundaries and triple points.",Effect of Reduced Atmosphere Sintering on Blocking Grain Boundaries in Rare-Earth Doped Ceria,10.3390/inorganics9080063
3,19229,This leads to formation of ionically resistive blocking grain boundaries and necessitates high operating temperatures to overcome this barrier.,Effect of Reduced Atmosphere Sintering on Blocking Grain Boundaries in Rare-Earth Doped Ceria,10.3390/inorganics9080063
4,19229,"In an effort to improve the grain boundary conductivity, we studied the effect of a modified sintering cycle, where 10 mol% gadolinia doped ceria was sintered under a reducing atmosphere and subsequently reoxidized.",Effect of Reduced Atmosphere Sintering on Blocking Grain Boundaries in Rare-Earth Doped Ceria,10.3390/inorganics9080063
5,19229,"A detailed analysis of the complex impedance, conductivity, and activation energy values was performed.",Effect of Reduced Atmosphere Sintering on Blocking Grain Boundaries in Rare-Earth Doped Ceria,10.3390/inorganics9080063
6,19229,"The analysis shows that for samples processed thus, the ionic conductivity improves when compared with conventionally processed samples sintered in air.",Effect of Reduced Atmosphere Sintering on Blocking Grain Boundaries in Rare-Earth Doped Ceria,10.3390/inorganics9080063
7,19229,Equivalent circuit fitting shows that this improvement in conductivity is mainly due to a drop in the grain boundary resistance.,Effect of Reduced Atmosphere Sintering on Blocking Grain Boundaries in Rare-Earth Doped Ceria,10.3390/inorganics9080063
8,19229,"Based on comparison of activation energy values for the conventionally processed vs. reduced-reoxidized samples, this drop can be attributed to a diminished blocking effect of defect-associates at the grain boundaries.",Effect of Reduced Atmosphere Sintering on Blocking Grain Boundaries in Rare-Earth Doped Ceria,10.3390/inorganics9080063
