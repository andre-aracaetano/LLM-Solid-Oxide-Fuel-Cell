4,8918,"Our results show that, for Scandia stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) co-dopedwith In3+, Yb3+, or Bi3+, the defect formation energy differences and binding energy differences of different sites are low, which indicates that for these co-doping cases the oxygen vacancies distribute more randomly, and are more beneficial for improving the oxygen vacancy diffusing efficiency.",Influence of codoping on the conductivity of Sc-doped zirconia by first-principles calculations and experiments,10.1016/j.matdes.2018.09.001
