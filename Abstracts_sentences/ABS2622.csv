1,2622,"The electrolytes materials Ce0.85Sm0.15O1.925 (SDC) and La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85(LSGM) were synthesized by means of glycine-nitrate process(GNP), respectively, then the composite electrolytes were prepared by mixing SDC and LSGM (the mass ratio of SDC powder to LSGM powder are 9: 1, 8: 2, 5: 5, respectively).",Preparation and performance of intermediate-temperature composite electrolytes of SDC-LSGM,
2,2622,Its electrical properties were investigated by impedance spectroscopy in air.,Preparation and performance of intermediate-temperature composite electrolytes of SDC-LSGM,
3,2622,"The results obtained shows that when the composition was 90% SDC and 10% (mass fraction) LSGM (SL91, the electrolyte has a higher electrical conductivity in comparison to SDC in the temperature range of 350-800 degrees C. Electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) was fabricated with NiO/SDC as the anode and Smo(0.5)Sr(0.5)CoO(3) as the cathode.",Preparation and performance of intermediate-temperature composite electrolytes of SDC-LSGM,
4,2622,The V-I characteristics of single fuel cell shows that the maximum output power density was 0.25 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C and the maximum current density was 1.06 A/cm(2) for the cell with SL91 as the electrolyte.,Preparation and performance of intermediate-temperature composite electrolytes of SDC-LSGM,
5,2622,"The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the single fuel cell using the composite as the electrolytes was higher than the cell using single SDC as the electrolyte in the working temperature range of 600-800 degrees C. It can be confirmed that to some extent, doping LSGM to SDC can block off the electronic current caused by the Ce4+/Ce3+ reduction process.",Preparation and performance of intermediate-temperature composite electrolytes of SDC-LSGM,
