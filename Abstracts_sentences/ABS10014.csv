1,10014,Composites prepared by infiltration of 50- wt% ceria into porous YSZ were investigated for use as H-2-H2O electrodes for solid oxide electrolyzers (SOE) or fuel cells (SOFC).,Enhanced reducibility of ceria-YSZ composites in solid oxide electrodes,10.1039/b718931a
2,10014,"Cells prepared from these composites showed excellent performance, with SOFC power densities as high as 1.1 W cm(-2) at 1073 K. Further investigations into the electrodes showed that they had significantly higher conductivities than would be expect for a material that was only 35 vol% ceria, as high as 0.25 S cm(-2) at 1073 in 3% H2O-97% H-2 mixtures.",Enhanced reducibility of ceria-YSZ composites in solid oxide electrodes,10.1039/b718931a
3,10014,"An investigation into the thermodynamic redox properties of the composite using coulometric titration at 973 K indicated that the ceria in the composite remained significantly reduced to higher P(O-2) compared to pure ceria, probably due to interactions at the ceria-YSZ interface.",Enhanced reducibility of ceria-YSZ composites in solid oxide electrodes,10.1039/b718931a
