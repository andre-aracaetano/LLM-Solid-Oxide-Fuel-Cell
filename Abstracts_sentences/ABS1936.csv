1,1936,"This study presents a new sustainable polygeneration system (power, heat, cool, and freshwater) based on a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system integrated with an absorption chiller and freshwater desalination system.",Waste to Energy and Polygeneration Systems Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4045564
2,1936,"The proposed system is based on the idea of gasifying the municipal waste, producing syngas serving as fuel for the polygeneration system.",Waste to Energy and Polygeneration Systems Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4045564
3,1936,"Such advanced waste to energy systems when improved is self-sustainable, less disposal to sanitary landfills, saving large municipal fields for other human activity and considerable less environmental impact.",Waste to Energy and Polygeneration Systems Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4045564
4,1936,"The study shows that for a plant with about 130 kW net power, the energy efficiency may be more than 92% including electricity, cooling, and freshwater production.",Waste to Energy and Polygeneration Systems Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4045564
5,1936,"If water desalination and absorption chiller are connected in parallel as a bottoming cycle for the fuel cell plant then cooling and freshwater productions will be about 129 kW and 174 l/h, respectively.",Waste to Energy and Polygeneration Systems Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4045564
