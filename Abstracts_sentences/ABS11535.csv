1,11535,"The effect on cell performance of adding dopant levels of precious metals (PM: Pt, Rh, or Pd) into solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes based on carbon, ceria, and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was examined.",Effect of precious-metal dopants on SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1149/1.1613231
2,11535,"The PM-doped anodes remained stable in dry CH4 and n-butane over a period of at least 24 h. While maximum power densities for H-2 and n-butane increased by almost a factor of two upon addition of PM, the maximum power density for CH4 increased by a factor of almost 10 over that measured on a Cu-ceria-YSZ anode, to 280 mW/cm(2) at 973 K.",Effect of precious-metal dopants on SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1149/1.1613231
3,11535,The open-circuit voltages (OCVs) were also measured for CH4 and n-butane as a function of H2O and CO2 concentrations.,Effect of precious-metal dopants on SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1149/1.1613231
4,11535,"The addition of PM dopants led to a significant increase in the OCV for CH4 and n-butane, although the OCV remained lower than the theoretical Nernst potentials.",Effect of precious-metal dopants on SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1149/1.1613231
5,11535,"The differences between the theoretical and measured OCV are attributed to barriers to surface reaction, which in turn can be decreased through improved catalytic properties.",Effect of precious-metal dopants on SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1149/1.1613231
