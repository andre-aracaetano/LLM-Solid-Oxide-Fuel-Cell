1,18461,"Dual-phasic composites consisted of continuous Bi2O3 matrix and 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia particulates were prepared by solid-state-sintering or liquid-phase-sintering, and investigated over the temperature range between 250-650 degrees C to reveal good electrical conductivity and matched thermal expansion to the components used for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).",Processing of high conductive Bi2O3/8YSZ composites as SOFC electrolyte,
2,18461,"Interface reactions occurred during sintering either at 750 degrees C or 900 degrees C could enhance the diffusion of Zr, Y and Bi ions, to form effective diffusion zone for stabilizing delta-Bi2O3 matrix.",Processing of high conductive Bi2O3/8YSZ composites as SOFC electrolyte,
3,18461,"The results showed a dual-structure of 66 mol% 8YSZ-34 m% Bi2O3 with up to 76% delta-phase content was stabilized by solid-state sintering, surpassing a bulk conductivity of 10(-2) Scm(-1)",Processing of high conductive Bi2O3/8YSZ composites as SOFC electrolyte,
