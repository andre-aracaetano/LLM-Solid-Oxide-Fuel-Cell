2,15268,"In the present work, we employed different strategies to lower the co-sintering temperature of cathode electrolyte bilayers for micro-tubular SOFCs by increasing the cathode sintering shrinkage and adding sintering aids to the electrolyte.",Lowering the co-sintering temperature of cathode-electrolyte bilayers for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.003
3,15268,"Strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were used as the cathode and electrolyte materials, respectively.",Lowering the co-sintering temperature of cathode-electrolyte bilayers for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.003
4,15268,"To facilitate densification of the electrolyte layer by controlling the shrinkage of the cathode support, the particle size of the LSM powder was reduced by high-energy ball milling and different amounts of micro-crystalline cellulose pore former were used.",Lowering the co-sintering temperature of cathode-electrolyte bilayers for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.003
5,15268,"Sintering aids, namely NiO and Fe2O3, were also added to the YSZ electrolyte to further improve its low-temperature sintering.",Lowering the co-sintering temperature of cathode-electrolyte bilayers for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.003
6,15268,"Our results indicate that with the improvement in the cathode support shrinkage and use of the small amounts of sintering aids, the cathode electrolyte co-sintering temperature can be reduced to 1250-1300 degrees C. It was also observed that the presence of the sintering aids helps to reduce the reactivity between the LSM cathode and YSZ electrolyte.",Lowering the co-sintering temperature of cathode-electrolyte bilayers for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.003
