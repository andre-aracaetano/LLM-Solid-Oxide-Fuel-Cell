2,1704,"Here, we present trichloro-acetic acid as an original infiltration agent for the facile nanoengineering of RSOFC electrodes.",Exceptionally stable nanostructured air electrodes for reversible solid oxide fuel cells via crystallization-assisted infiltration,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.11.041
3,1704,"The new process relies on the thermal decomposition of trichloroacetic acid in water at temperatures above 70 degrees C, which causes intense CO2 effervescence and crystallizes out the metal ions in the solution as slightly soluble carbonates.",Exceptionally stable nanostructured air electrodes for reversible solid oxide fuel cells via crystallization-assisted infiltration,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.11.041
4,1704,"Essentially, this allows for the subsequent infiltration step to be performed immediately after drying, as opposed to conventional infiltration, which requires high-temperature calcination after each infiltration step.",Exceptionally stable nanostructured air electrodes for reversible solid oxide fuel cells via crystallization-assisted infiltration,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.11.041
