1,3218,An A-site Ba cation-deficient layered-perovskite oxide PrBa0.92Co2O5+delta (PB0.92CO) was evaluated as a new cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Highly enhanced electrochemical performance of PrBa0.92Co2O5+δ cathode by introducing Ba cationic-deficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.095
2,3218,PB0.92CO is chemically stable with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) electrolyte at temperatures up to 1100 degrees C. PB0.92CO has conductivities of 580-195 S cm(-1) at temperatures of 200-800 degrees C in air.,Highly enhanced electrochemical performance of PrBa0.92Co2O5+δ cathode by introducing Ba cationic-deficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.095
3,3218,"Area specific resistances (ASR) of PB0.92CO cathode on the GDC electrolyte layer range from 0.093 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C to 0.0068 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C with an activation energy of 1.05 eV. These ASR values are much lower than the results of the parent PrBaCo2O5+delta (PBCO) cathode, cation-doped PBCO cathodes and the PBCO-based composite cathodes.",Highly enhanced electrochemical performance of PrBa0.92Co2O5+δ cathode by introducing Ba cationic-deficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.095
4,3218,The preliminary results have demonstrated that PB0.92CO has excellent electrochemical performances at temperatures of 600 degrees C-800 degrees C and is a very promising cathode material for IT-SOFCs.,Highly enhanced electrochemical performance of PrBa0.92Co2O5+δ cathode by introducing Ba cationic-deficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.095
