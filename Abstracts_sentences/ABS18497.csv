1,18497,A simple procedure for replicating organic-based structures in ceramics was used for the fabrication of a suitable packing material for biofiltration of toluene in air.,Fabrication of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia-Based Honeycomb Biofilters,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02645.x
2,18497,Yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were used due to the mechanical and chemical stability of this material and to its potentiality as inert substrate for the growing of biofilms.,Fabrication of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia-Based Honeycomb Biofilters,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02645.x
3,18497,Honeycomb arrangements were fabricated using NOMEX (TM) mesh as organic templates.,Fabrication of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia-Based Honeycomb Biofilters,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02645.x
4,18497,Biological studies have shown that this type of biofilters is able to remove up to 85% of volatile organic compounds for an inlet load up to 115 (gm(3).h)(-1).,Fabrication of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia-Based Honeycomb Biofilters,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02645.x
5,18497,A composting test adapted from standard UNE-EN ISO 846 was carried out to evaluate the possible degradation of the synthetic material.,Fabrication of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia-Based Honeycomb Biofilters,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02645.x
6,18497,"The results show that YSZ structures were stable, allowing the attachment of biofilms without any evidence of deterioration.",Fabrication of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia-Based Honeycomb Biofilters,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02645.x
7,18497,"The ceramic nature of the biofilter allows incineration and reutilization in case of removal efficiency decreases, therefore reducing the final annual cost of the packing material employed.",Fabrication of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia-Based Honeycomb Biofilters,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02645.x
8,18497,Also the approach opens up the possibility of recovering YSZ from solid oxide fuel cells that have reached the end of its lifetime allowing the fabrication of new biofilter supports from aged YSZ.,Fabrication of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia-Based Honeycomb Biofilters,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02645.x
