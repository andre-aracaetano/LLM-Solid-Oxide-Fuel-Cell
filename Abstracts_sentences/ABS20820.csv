3,20820,Below the dew point (65 degrees C at 0.25 bar) a two-phase region of the VLE exists where 48 %wt gas-phase ammonia could be produced (61 degrees C) compared to only 2 %wt within the stripping region adopted widely in the literature.,Transitioning through the vapour-liquid equilibrium for low energy thermal stripping of ammonia from wastewater: Enabling transformation of NH3 into a zero-carbon fuel,10.1016/j.watres.2023.120856
4,20820,"This was complemented by a 98 % reduction in thermal separation energy, since limited water vaporization can occur when the feed is maintained below the activation energy threshold for bulk evaporation.",Transitioning through the vapour-liquid equilibrium for low energy thermal stripping of ammonia from wastewater: Enabling transformation of NH3 into a zero-carbon fuel,10.1016/j.watres.2023.120856
