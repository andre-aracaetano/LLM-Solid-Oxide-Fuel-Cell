2,5001,"Effect of the ratio of organic precursors (acrylamide (AM) monomer and N, N'-Methylenebisacrylamide (MBAM) crosslinker) to metal nitrates (lanthanum nitrate, cobalt nitrate) and the ratio of AM to MBAM on the particle size are investigated in detail.",Synthesis of LaCoO3 nano-powders by aqueous gel-casting for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.080
3,5001,TEM results indicate that the particle size of LC nano-powders is in the range of 31-60 nm and decreases with increasing ratio of organic precursor to metal nitrates but is not affected by the ratio of AM to MBAM.,Synthesis of LaCoO3 nano-powders by aqueous gel-casting for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.080
4,5001,Preliminary results show that the nano-structured electrode approach based on wet impregnation is effective to combine the high electrocatalytic activity of LC nano-powders and the structural stability of La0.72Sr0.18MnO3-delta (LSM) electrodes for the development of IT-SOFC cathodes.,Synthesis of LaCoO3 nano-powders by aqueous gel-casting for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.080
