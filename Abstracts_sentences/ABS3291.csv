1,3291,We have developed a novel and highly effective electrode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with honeycomb structure for intermediate temperature operation.,Novel Electrode-Supported Honeycomb Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Design and Fabrication,10.1115/1.3206975
2,3291,"Honeycomb-supported SOFC is known as one of the most compact SOFCs due to the large electrode area per unit volume, which is attractive with regard to space saving and cost reduction.",Novel Electrode-Supported Honeycomb Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Design and Fabrication,10.1115/1.3206975
3,3291,"In this study, we summarized the design of the channel shape, size, and sequence using numerical simulation and technologies to realize the designed honeycomb SOFC fabrication.",Novel Electrode-Supported Honeycomb Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Design and Fabrication,10.1115/1.3206975
4,3291,"The calculation results showed that the wall thickness and the channel size of the honeycomb had to be less than 0.22 mm and more than 0.3 mm, respectively, for the sufficient net channel surface and the acceptable pressure drop.",Novel Electrode-Supported Honeycomb Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Design and Fabrication,10.1115/1.3206975
5,3291,"Also, a cathode-honeycomb-supported SOFC can be the more efficient form with lower current collection resistance, as compared with the anode-supported type.",Novel Electrode-Supported Honeycomb Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Design and Fabrication,10.1115/1.3206975
6,3291,The actual fabricated honeycomb SOFC exhibited a high volumetric power density above 1 W/cm(3) at 650 degrees C under wet H-2 fuel flow.,Novel Electrode-Supported Honeycomb Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Design and Fabrication,10.1115/1.3206975
