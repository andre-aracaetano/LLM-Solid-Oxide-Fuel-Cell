1,4309,"Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes were prepared by infiltration of 35 wt % La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSF) into porous scaffolds of three, zirconia-based electrolytes in order to determine the effect of the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte material on cathode impedances.",Effect of the Ionic Conductivity of the Electrolyte in Composite SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3581109
2,4309,"The electrolyte scaffolds were 10 mol % Sc2O3-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ), 8 mol % Y2O3-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), and 3 mol % Y2O3-20 mol % Al2O3-doped zirconia (YAZ), prepared by tape casting with graphite pore formers.",Effect of the Ionic Conductivity of the Electrolyte in Composite SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3581109
3,4309,"Each electrolyte scaffold was 65% porous, with identical pore structures as determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",Effect of the Ionic Conductivity of the Electrolyte in Composite SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3581109
4,4309,"Both symmetric cells and fuel cells were prepared and tested between 873 and 1073 K, using LSF composites that had been calcined to 1123 or 1373 K. Literature values for the electrolyte conductivities were confirmed using the ohmic losses from the impedance spectra.",Effect of the Ionic Conductivity of the Electrolyte in Composite SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3581109
5,4309,"The electrode impedances decreased with increasing electrolyte conductivity, with the dependence being between to the power of 0.5 and 1.0, depending on the operating temperature and LSF calcination temperature.",Effect of the Ionic Conductivity of the Electrolyte in Composite SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3581109
