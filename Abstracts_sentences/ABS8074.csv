2,8074,"Hereby, biogas is produced from a predefined group of substrates, namely, livestock effluents, energy crops, agricultural waste, and organic waste.",Small-Scale Biogas-SOFC Plant: Technical Analysis and Assessment of Different Fuel Reforming Options,10.1021/ef500212j
3,8074,"For the analysis, average methane (CH4) content is assumed to lie between 50 and 60 mol % as large seasonal and daily variations are observed which are independent of used matter.",Small-Scale Biogas-SOFC Plant: Technical Analysis and Assessment of Different Fuel Reforming Options,10.1021/ef500212j
4,8074,"The main biogas contaminants are sulfur compounds, mostly in the form of H2S. Sulfur leads to fast catalyst deactivation in the reformer and fuel cell, which is why an effective gas-cleaning system is established.",Small-Scale Biogas-SOFC Plant: Technical Analysis and Assessment of Different Fuel Reforming Options,10.1021/ef500212j
5,8074,"For this, ZnO and activated carbon are the most practical gas-cleaning solutions for small-scale plants.",Small-Scale Biogas-SOFC Plant: Technical Analysis and Assessment of Different Fuel Reforming Options,10.1021/ef500212j
