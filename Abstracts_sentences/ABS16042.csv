4,16042,The application of interlayer decreased the area specific resistance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-theta cathode.,"Electrochemical performance of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ-(Ce,Sm)O2-θ-CuO composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.materresbull.2012.01.005
5,16042,"The addition of CuO to La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta reduced the phase formation temperature of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta by 150 C and the addition of CuO to La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-theta cathode reduced the optimal calcination temperature of the cathode to 800 degrees C. The composite cathode with 2 mol% CuO calcined at 800 degrees C exhibited the lowest area specific resistance of 0.05 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air, which was reduced by 67% compared with that of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-theta cathode.","Electrochemical performance of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ-(Ce,Sm)O2-θ-CuO composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.materresbull.2012.01.005
6,16042,"The studies of the corresponding single cell performance, thermal expansion and thermal cycling behaviors further indicated that the composite cathode with 2 mol% CuO could be a promising cathode material.","Electrochemical performance of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ-(Ce,Sm)O2-θ-CuO composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.materresbull.2012.01.005
