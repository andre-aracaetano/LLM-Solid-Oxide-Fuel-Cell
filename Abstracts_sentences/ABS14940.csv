1,14940,"For use of metal supported solid oxide fuel cell (MS-SOFC) in mobile applications it is important to reduce the thermal mass to enable fast startup, increase stack power density in terms of weight and volume and reduce costs.",Towards High Power Density Metal Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Mobile Applications,10.1149/2.0741802jes
2,14940,"In the present study, we report on the effect of reducing the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) SoA MS-SOFCs support layer thickness from 313 mu m gradually to 108 mu m.",Towards High Power Density Metal Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Mobile Applications,10.1149/2.0741802jes
3,14940,The support layer thickness decrease in the DTU co-sintering MS-SOFC fabrication route results in an increased densification of the support layer and a slight decrease in performance.,Towards High Power Density Metal Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Mobile Applications,10.1149/2.0741802jes
4,14940,"To mitigate the performance loss, two different routes for increasing the porosity of the support layer and thus performance were explored.",Towards High Power Density Metal Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Mobile Applications,10.1149/2.0741802jes
5,14940,The first route is the introduction of gas channels by puncturing of the green tape casted support layer.,Towards High Power Density Metal Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Mobile Applications,10.1149/2.0741802jes
6,14940,The second route is modification of the co-sintering profile.,Towards High Power Density Metal Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Mobile Applications,10.1149/2.0741802jes
7,14940,"In summary, the cell thickness and thus weight and volume was reduced and the cell power density at 0.7 V at 700 degrees C was increased by 46% to 1.01 W cm(-2) at a fuel utilization of 48%.",Towards High Power Density Metal Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Mobile Applications,10.1149/2.0741802jes
8,14940,All modifications were performed on a stack technological relevant cell size of 12 cm x 12 cm.,Towards High Power Density Metal Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Mobile Applications,10.1149/2.0741802jes
