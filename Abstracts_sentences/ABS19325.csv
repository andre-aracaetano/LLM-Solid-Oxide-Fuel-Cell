3,19325,Present study shows that Sm0.2 -xBixCe0.8O1.9 is exceedingly stable as a cubic phase in all temperature range.,Processing and Characterization of Bi2O3 and Sm2O3 Codoped CeO2 Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04270.x
4,19325,"Starting from the Sm0.2 -xBixCe0.8O1.9 powder with specific surface area of 23.057 m(2)/g and using bismuth oxide as sintering aid, the sintering behavior investigation demonstrates that the Sm0.2 -xBixCe0.8O1.9 green compacts can be densified to nearly theoretical density at 1300 degrees C for 3 h. The very low sintering temperature prevents excessive grain growth during the heating, which is crucial for obtaining microcrystalline ceramics.",Processing and Characterization of Bi2O3 and Sm2O3 Codoped CeO2 Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04270.x
5,19325,"In the temperature range of 500 degrees-800 degrees C, AC impedance spectra indicate that the Sm0.2 -xBixCe0.8O1.9 has much higher ionic conductivity than SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9), and that the highest conductivity value is 3.982 S/m at 750 degrees",Processing and Characterization of Bi2O3 and Sm2O3 Codoped CeO2 Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04270.x
