1,5561,"In this paper, we present a simple solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) power system fed by methane gas.",Simulation of a solid oxide fuel cell power system fed by methane,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2004.04.001
2,5561,Comprehensive thermodynamic modelling was conducted on this simple SOFC power system supplement with some details of gas dynamics in the piping linking the system components.,Simulation of a solid oxide fuel cell power system fed by methane,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2004.04.001
3,5561,"The system consists of a fuel cell stack, two heat exchangers for preheating fuel and air streams, an afterburner to burn off the residual fuel, a vaporiser for vaporising water, a mixer for mixing fuel and steam, a reformer to produce hydrogen-rich reformate and a steam boiler serves to balance the heat of the power system.",Simulation of a solid oxide fuel cell power system fed by methane,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2004.04.001
4,5561,"Results showed that at 70% of fuel utilisation rate, 1 atm of fuel and air flow pressure, 1173 K of fuel inlet temperature and 973 K of air inlet temperature, the SOFC plant can achieve first and second law efficiency of 47.0% LHV, and 48.9%, respectively.",Simulation of a solid oxide fuel cell power system fed by methane,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2004.04.001
