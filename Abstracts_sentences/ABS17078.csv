1,17078,"This work presents the modeling and thermodynamic analysis of two novel small-scale polygeneration systems that are capable of simultaneously converting residual biomass to methanol (MeOH), electricity, heat and a CO2-rich stream for agricultural greenhouses.",Thermodynamic analysis of novel methanol polygeneration systems for greenhouses,10.1007/s13399-021-01678-5
2,17078,"The first system is based on a downdraft gasifier, while the second relies on a dual fluidized bed (DFB) gasifier.",Thermodynamic analysis of novel methanol polygeneration systems for greenhouses,10.1007/s13399-021-01678-5
3,17078,"Both configurations leverage the H-2, O-2, and electricity generation capabilities of reversible solid oxide cells (RSOCs).",Thermodynamic analysis of novel methanol polygeneration systems for greenhouses,10.1007/s13399-021-01678-5
4,17078,"The Aspen Plus process simulator is used to model the thermodynamic performance of the proposed polygeneration systems, which operate at total efficiencies ranging from 83.9 to 85.0%.",Thermodynamic analysis of novel methanol polygeneration systems for greenhouses,10.1007/s13399-021-01678-5
5,17078,"From a biofuel and electrical efficiency perspective, the system based on a DFB gasifier is superior, providing the added benefit of enabling carbon capture and storage, as a N-2-free stream with a molar purity exceeding 90% CO2 is generated, which could be readily liquefied or sequestered.",Thermodynamic analysis of novel methanol polygeneration systems for greenhouses,10.1007/s13399-021-01678-5
