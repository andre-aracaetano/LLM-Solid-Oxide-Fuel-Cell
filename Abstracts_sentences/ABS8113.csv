1,8113,"Recently, two new phenomena linking stress field and reduction rates in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been demonstrated, so-called accelerated creep during reduction and reduction rate enhancement and nucleation due to stress (Frandsen et al., 2014).",Effect of stress on NiO reduction in solid oxide fuel cells: a new application of energy-resolved neutron imaging,10.1107/S1600576715002794
2,8113,"These complex phenomena are difficult to study and it is demonstrated here that energy-resolved neutron imaging is a feasible technique for combined mechanics-chemical composition studies of SOFC components, including commercially produced ones.",Effect of stress on NiO reduction in solid oxide fuel cells: a new application of energy-resolved neutron imaging,10.1107/S1600576715002794
3,8113,"Cermet anode supports, which prior to the measurements were reduced under varying conditions such as different temperatures, various times and different values of applied stress, have been measured.",Effect of stress on NiO reduction in solid oxide fuel cells: a new application of energy-resolved neutron imaging,10.1107/S1600576715002794
