1,6810,Studied here are the effects of sintering temperature of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 (LSCF-CGO) cathodes on their microstructure and performance of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC).,Effect of sintering temperature on the performance of composite La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-018-0114-5
2,6810,"Phase composition, microstructure and electrochemical properties were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy and current-voltage characteristics measurement, respectively.",Effect of sintering temperature on the performance of composite La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-018-0114-5
3,6810,The electrochemical performances of Ni-YSZ anode-supported SOFC having YSZ electrolyte (4 mu m) with CGO interlayer (2 mu m) are studied with LSCF-CGO (50:50 wt%) cathodes in the temperature range 600-800 A degrees C using H-2 as fuel and air as oxidant.,Effect of sintering temperature on the performance of composite La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-018-0114-5
4,6810,The cathode microstructure was found to be less dense and to contain smaller grains as the sintering temperature was decreased in the range 1250-1150 A degrees C. Results reveal that sintering temperature and electrode morphology have strong influence on electrochemical performances of the IT-SOFC.,Effect of sintering temperature on the performance of composite La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-018-0114-5
5,6810,"Highest maximum power density of similar to 1.26 W/cm(2) is achieved during cell testing at 800 A degrees C with a cathode sintered at 1200 A degrees C. However, cells with in-situ sintered LSCF-CGO cathode showed highest power density at 600 A degrees C (0.48 W/cm(2)) because there is no particle coarsening at low sintering temperatures.",Effect of sintering temperature on the performance of composite La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-018-0114-5
