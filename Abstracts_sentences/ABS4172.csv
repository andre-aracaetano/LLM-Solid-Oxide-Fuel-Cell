1,4172,Porous composite cathodes were fabricated by impregnating(La0.74Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-delta (LBSM) electronic conducting structure with the ionic conducting Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (GDC) phase.,(La0.74 Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-δ-Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ cathodes fabricated by ion-impregnating method for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.027
2,4172,"The ion impregnation of the GDC phase significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of the LBSM electrodes for the O-2 reduction reactions, and the ion-impregnated LBSM-GDC composite cathodes showed excellent performance, At 700 C, the Value of the cathode polarization resistance (Rc) was only 0.097 Omega cm(2) for an ion-impregnated LBSM-GDC cathode, and the performance was gradually improved by increasing the loading of the impregnated GDC.",(La0.74 Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-δ-Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ cathodes fabricated by ion-impregnating method for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.027
