1,21148,We have developed and explored an external automatic tuning/matching (eATM) robot that can be attached to commercial and/or home-built magic angle spinning (MAS) or static nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probeheads.,Enhanced efficiency of solid-state NMR investigations of energy materials using an external automatic tuning/matching (eATM) robot,10.1016/j.jmr.2016.12.008
2,21148,Complete synchronization and automation with Bruker and Tecmag spectrometers is ensured via transistor-transistor-logic (TTL) signals.,Enhanced efficiency of solid-state NMR investigations of energy materials using an external automatic tuning/matching (eATM) robot,10.1016/j.jmr.2016.12.008
3,21148,"The eATM robot enables an automated on-the-fly re-calibration of the radio frequency (rf) carrier frequency, which is beneficial whenever tuning/matching of the resonance circuit is required, e.g. variable temperature (VT) NMR, spin-echo mapping (variable offset cumulative spectroscopy, VOCS) and/or in situ NMR experiments of batteries.",Enhanced efficiency of solid-state NMR investigations of energy materials using an external automatic tuning/matching (eATM) robot,10.1016/j.jmr.2016.12.008
4,21148,"This allows a significant increase in efficiency for NMR experiments outside regular working hours (e.g. overnight) and, furthermore, enables measurements of quadrupolar nuclei which would not be possible in reasonable timeframes due to excessively large spectral widths.",Enhanced efficiency of solid-state NMR investigations of energy materials using an external automatic tuning/matching (eATM) robot,10.1016/j.jmr.2016.12.008
5,21148,"Additionally, different tuning/matching capacitor (and/or coil) settings for desired frequencies (e.g. Li-7 and P-31 at 117 and 122 MHz, respectively, at 7.05 T) can be saved and made directly accessible before automatic tuning/matching, thus enabling automated measurements of multiple nuclei for one sample with no manual adjustment required by the user.",Enhanced efficiency of solid-state NMR investigations of energy materials using an external automatic tuning/matching (eATM) robot,10.1016/j.jmr.2016.12.008
6,21148,"We have applied this new eATM approach in static and MAS spin-echo mapping NMR experiments in different magnetic fields on four energy storage materials, namely: (1) paramagnetic Li-7 and 31P MAS NMR (without manual recalibration) of the Li-ion battery cathode material LiFePO4; (2) paramagnetic O-17 VT-NMR of the solid oxide fuel cell cathode material La2NiO4+delta; (3) broadband Nb-93 static NMR of the Li-ion battery material BNb2O5; and (4) broadband static 1271 NMR of a potential Li-air battery product LiIO3.",Enhanced efficiency of solid-state NMR investigations of energy materials using an external automatic tuning/matching (eATM) robot,10.1016/j.jmr.2016.12.008
7,21148,"In each case, insight into local atomic structure and dynamics arises primarily from the highly broadened (1-25 MHz) NMR lineshapes that the eATM robot is uniquely suited to collect.",Enhanced efficiency of solid-state NMR investigations of energy materials using an external automatic tuning/matching (eATM) robot,10.1016/j.jmr.2016.12.008
8,21148,These new developments in automation of NMR experiments are likely to advance the application of in and ex situ NMR investigations to an ever-increasing range of energy storage materials and systems.,Enhanced efficiency of solid-state NMR investigations of energy materials using an external automatic tuning/matching (eATM) robot,10.1016/j.jmr.2016.12.008
