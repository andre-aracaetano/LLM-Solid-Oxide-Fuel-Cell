1,9626,"The influence of H2S fuel impurity on power generation characteristics of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has been analyzed by measuring cell voltage at a constant current density, as a function of H2S concentration, operational temperature, and fuel gas composition.",H2S poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2336075
2,9626,"Reversible cell voltage change was observed around 1000 degrees C, while fatal irreversible degradation occurred at a lower operational temperature, at a higher H2S concentration, and at a lower fuel H-2/CO ratio.",H2S poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2336075
3,9626,Sulfur tolerance of SOFCs was improved by using Sc2O3-doped ZrO2 instead of Y2O3-doped ZrO2 as electrolyte and/or as electrolyte component in the anode cermets.,H2S poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2336075
4,9626,"It has been found that H2S poisoning consists of at least two stages, i.e., an initial cell voltage drop within a short time period to a metastable cell voltage, followed by a gradual larger cell voltage drop.",H2S poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2336075
5,9626,Possible H2S poisoning processes are discussed.,H2S poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2336075
