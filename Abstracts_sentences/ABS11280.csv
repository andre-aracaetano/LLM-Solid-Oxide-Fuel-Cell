1,11280,Atmospheric plasma spray (APS) was used to prepare the planar positive/electrolyte/negative (PEN) and mono-block layer built (MOLB) type PEN solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Fabrication of functionally graded SOFC by APS,10.1007/s11666-007-9132-6
2,11280,"On the basis of the spraying conditions optimized previously and the self-developed functionally graded powder feeder system, two types of PEN cells were fabricated.",Fabrication of functionally graded SOFC by APS,10.1007/s11666-007-9132-6
3,11280,Then the microstructure and material composition of the PEN cells were analyzed.,Fabrication of functionally graded SOFC by APS,10.1007/s11666-007-9132-6
4,11280,The results show that graded layers formed between the electrodes and electrolyte.,Fabrication of functionally graded SOFC by APS,10.1007/s11666-007-9132-6
5,11280,"Moreover, the material composition and the porosity of the graded layers vary gradually.",Fabrication of functionally graded SOFC by APS,10.1007/s11666-007-9132-6
6,11280,"In particular, the porosities of the resultant anode and cathode reach 32.74 and 32.24%, respectively.",Fabrication of functionally graded SOFC by APS,10.1007/s11666-007-9132-6
7,11280,"Using the AC complex impedance technique, the conductivity of the MOLB type composite electrode is tested.",Fabrication of functionally graded SOFC by APS,10.1007/s11666-007-9132-6
8,11280,The electrical conductivity of the MOLB type composite electrode with the graded layers is larger than that without the graded layers.,Fabrication of functionally graded SOFC by APS,10.1007/s11666-007-9132-6
