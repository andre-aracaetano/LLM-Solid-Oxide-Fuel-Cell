1,18990,A 1-dimensional model of a cathode has been developed in order to understand and predict the performance of cathodes prepared by infiltration of La0.6Sr4Co1.05O3-delta (LSC) into porous backbones of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO).,Model for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes prepared by infiltration,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.088
