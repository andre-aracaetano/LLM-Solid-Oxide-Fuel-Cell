1,1794,The application of conventional zirconia-based electrolytes is limited to relatively high temperatures (ie > 750 degrees C) due to their poor conductivities at low temperatures.,A high-performance solid oxide fuel cell with a layered electrolyte for reduced temperatures,10.1111/jace.17203
2,1794,"Doped ceria has much higher conductivities; however, when exposed to fuel, electronic current develops within the material, which impairs cell performance and efficiency.",A high-performance solid oxide fuel cell with a layered electrolyte for reduced temperatures,10.1111/jace.17203
3,1794,"Herein, we report a novel layered electrolyte structure consisting of a 10 mu m samaria-doped ceria primary layer and a 2 mu m scandia-ceria-stabilized zirconia protection layer on the fuel side.",A high-performance solid oxide fuel cell with a layered electrolyte for reduced temperatures,10.1111/jace.17203

5,1794,"By carefully selecting the raw materials, the bilyer electrolyte was sintered to full density at a low temperature of 1250 degrees C.",A high-performance solid oxide fuel cell with a layered electrolyte for reduced temperatures,10.1111/jace.17203
6,1794,The adverse interdiffusion and undesirable reactions between the two layers were largely avoided.,A high-performance solid oxide fuel cell with a layered electrolyte for reduced temperatures,10.1111/jace.17203
7,1794,"A fuel cell with the layered electrolyte structure, operated on hydrogen fuel, produced a high open circuit voltage 1.07 V and a power density of 321 mW/cm(2) at 0.8 V and 600 degrees C, 76% improvement compared to the fuel cell with a scandia-stabilized zirconia/samaria-doped ceria bilayer electrolyte reported in literature.",A high-performance solid oxide fuel cell with a layered electrolyte for reduced temperatures,10.1111/jace.17203
