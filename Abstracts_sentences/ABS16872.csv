3,16872,Long-term tests were subsequently conducted under 180 mAcm(-2) in wet CH4 for 236 h and dry CH4 for 526 h at 850 degrees C in order to assess the cell stability.,Performance of a Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Nickel-Ceria-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia as the Anode,10.3390/ma13030599
4,16872,Material analysis was carried out by SEM-EDS after operation was complete.,Performance of a Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Nickel-Ceria-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia as the Anode,10.3390/ma13030599
5,16872,"Similar cell performance was observed with wet (3% H2O) and dry CH4, and this indicates that the presence of water is not relevant under the applied load demand.",Performance of a Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Nickel-Ceria-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia as the Anode,10.3390/ma13030599
6,16872,"Impedance spectra of the cell showed that at least three processes govern the direct electrochemical oxidation of methane on the Ni-CYSZ anode and these are related to charge transfer at high frequency, the adsorption/desorption of charged species at medium frequency and the non-charge transfer processes at low frequency.",Performance of a Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Nickel-Ceria-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia as the Anode,10.3390/ma13030599
7,16872,"The cell was operated for more than 900 h in CH4 and 806 h under load demand, with a low degradation rate of similar to 0.2 mVh(-1) observed during this period.",Performance of a Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Nickel-Ceria-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia as the Anode,10.3390/ma13030599
8,16872,"The low degradation in performance was mainly caused by the increase in charge transfer resistance, which can be attributed to carbon deposition on the anode causing a reduction in the number of active centers.",Performance of a Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Nickel-Ceria-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia as the Anode,10.3390/ma13030599
9,16872,Carbon deposits were detected mostly on the surface of Ni particles but not near the anode/electrolyte interface or the cerium surface.,Performance of a Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Nickel-Ceria-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia as the Anode,10.3390/ma13030599
