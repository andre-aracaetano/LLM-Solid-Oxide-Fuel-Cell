1,3567,The poor activity of cathode materials for electrochemical reduction of oxygen in intermediate and low temperature regime ( <700 degrees C) is a key obstacle to reduced-temperature operation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Electrochemical characteristics of electrospun La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.158
2,3567,"In our previous work, the direct methane fuel cell exhibits approximately 1 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C in hydrogen atmosphere without any functional layers when the electrospun LSCF-GDC cathode was applied into the La2Sn2O7-Ni-GDC anode-supported cell, which is approximately two times higher performance than 0.45 W cm(-2) of the cell with the conventional LSCF-GDC cathode.",Electrochemical characteristics of electrospun La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.158
3,3567,"For detailed analysis of the fibrous cathode, the symmetrical cells with the electrospun and conventional LSCF-GDC cathode are fabricated, and then their electrochemical characteristics are measured by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).",Electrochemical characteristics of electrospun La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.158

5,3567,"Total polarization resistance of the electrospun LSCF-GDC cathode is approximately two times lower than that of the conventional LSCF-GDC cathode at 650 degrees C, which is attributed to fibrous microstructures and large amount of pores in 100-200 nm.",Electrochemical characteristics of electrospun La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.12.158
