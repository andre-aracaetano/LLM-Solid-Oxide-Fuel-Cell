2,2224,The activation energy for H spillover is calculated to be the same order of magnitude as experimental estimates at the reversible potential.,Hydrogen oxidation and proton transport at the Ni-zirconia interface in solid oxide fuel cell anodes: Quantum chemical predictions,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.05.032
3,2224,Proton transport on the oxide surface is shown to be activated by strongly held hydrogen-bonded water molecules: in the absence of H2O the activation energy is calculated to be 4.98 eV and the water molecule reduces the activation energy to 0.25 eV Substitutional Y3+ (for Zr4+) is shown to slow proton diffusion when present in the zirconia surface.,Hydrogen oxidation and proton transport at the Ni-zirconia interface in solid oxide fuel cell anodes: Quantum chemical predictions,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.05.032
