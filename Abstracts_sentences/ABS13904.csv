2,13904,"La2O3, Nd2O3, NiO and CoO were added to the SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-ZnO glass samples to enlarge their CTE and improve their adhesion on SUS430 stainless steel.","Effects of La2O3, Nd2O3, NiO and CoO additions on the characteristics of SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-ZnO glass seals for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.045
3,13904,It was found that YASZ-4 glass was the best candidate as a sealant among the glasses evaluated.,"Effects of La2O3, Nd2O3, NiO and CoO additions on the characteristics of SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-ZnO glass seals for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.045
4,13904,"The glass transition points, softening points and crystallization peak temperature of the YASZ-4 glass were determined to be 748 degrees C, 897 degrees C and 969 degrees C, respectively, while the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and electrical resistivity at 700 degrees C were reported to be 8.4 x 10(-6) K-1 and 4.43 x 10(8) Omega-cm, respectively.","Effects of La2O3, Nd2O3, NiO and CoO additions on the characteristics of SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-ZnO glass seals for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.045
5,13904,Partial substitution of Y2O3 with La2O3 and NiO in the SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-ZnO glass was observed to increase its CTE and to enhance its adhesion on SUS430.,"Effects of La2O3, Nd2O3, NiO and CoO additions on the characteristics of SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-ZnO glass seals for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.045
6,13904,"A strict and more sensitive test condition was employed in this study to evaluate the leak rate, which included a helium gas pressure of 1 psi across the glass seals and a small top-loading pressure of 1.0 psi applied on the glass.","Effects of La2O3, Nd2O3, NiO and CoO additions on the characteristics of SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-ZnO glass seals for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.045
7,13904,"The leak rate at 700 degrees C for the first three thermal cycles stabilized at 0.019 sccm/cm and then, slightly decreased to 0.012 sccm/cm after a subsequent 500 h soaking, indicating a trivial degradation of the sealing efficiency against long periods of operation.","Effects of La2O3, Nd2O3, NiO and CoO additions on the characteristics of SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-ZnO glass seals for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.045
8,13904,The XRD pattern of the YASZ-4 glass after a 500 h leakage test revealed that the fully amorphous nature was retained.,"Effects of La2O3, Nd2O3, NiO and CoO additions on the characteristics of SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-ZnO glass seals for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.045
9,13904,"The addition of 30 mol% LaCoO3 to YASZ-4 glass was further attempted to increase its CTE value; however, results did not show an improvement in terms of a low leak rate.","Effects of La2O3, Nd2O3, NiO and CoO additions on the characteristics of SiO2-Al2O3-Y2O3-ZnO glass seals for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.045
