1,8449,Tensile and creep properties of a newly developed ferritic stainless steel (Crofer 22 H) with additions of Nb and W for planar solid oxide fuel cell (pSOFC) interconnect are investigated at 25-800 degrees C. These properties are compared with those of another ferritic stainless steel (Crofer 22 APU) without Nb or W.
