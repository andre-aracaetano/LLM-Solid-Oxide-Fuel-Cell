1,13393,The electrochemical impedance response of an electrolyte supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) was studied for different compositions of feed in the anode compartment.,Steam effect on Gerischer impedance response of a Ni/GDC|YSZ|LSM fuel cell/anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227404
2,13393,"The cell was composed of Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ), as electrolyte, and commercial Nickel/Gadolinium doped Ceria (Ni/GDC) cermet and Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (LSM), as anode and cathode electrodes, respectively.",Steam effect on Gerischer impedance response of a Ni/GDC|YSZ|LSM fuel cell/anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227404
3,13393,The impedance responses of the anode and cathode were deconvoluted using the analysis method of differences in the impedance spectra (ADIS).,Steam effect on Gerischer impedance response of a Ni/GDC|YSZ|LSM fuel cell/anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227404
4,13393,"This allowed focusing on the electrochemical processes, which occur at the anode electrode and analyzing them adequately via equivalent electric circuit modelling.",Steam effect on Gerischer impedance response of a Ni/GDC|YSZ|LSM fuel cell/anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227404
5,13393,"The main finding is that the Ni/GDC anode electrode exhibits a Gerischer impedance response, characteristic of chemical and electrochemical competing processes, which was associated with the formation of OHad- on GDC oxygen vacancies as the prevailing intermediate species for the electro-oxidation of H-2 on Ni/GDC anode.",Steam effect on Gerischer impedance response of a Ni/GDC|YSZ|LSM fuel cell/anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227404
6,13393,"It is shown that H2O plays a dominant role for the formation of the OHad- species on the GDC surface through its reaction with O2-, thus contributing autocatalytically on the promotion of H-2 electro-oxidation on Ni/GDC anode.",Steam effect on Gerischer impedance response of a Ni/GDC|YSZ|LSM fuel cell/anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227404
