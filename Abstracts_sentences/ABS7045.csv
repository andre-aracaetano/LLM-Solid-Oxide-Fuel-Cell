2,7045,The astoundingly extended stability of NdBa1-xCaxCo2O5+delta (NBCaCO) under both air and CO2- containing atmosphere is reported along with excellent electro-chemical performance by only Ca doping into the A site of NdBaCo2O5+delta (NBCO).,Development of Double-Perovskite Compounds as Cathode Materials for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/anie.201407006
3,7045,"The enhanced stability can be ascribed to both the increased electron affinity of mobile oxygen species with Ca, determined through density functional theory calculations and the increased redox stability from the coulometric titration.",Development of Double-Perovskite Compounds as Cathode Materials for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/anie.201407006
