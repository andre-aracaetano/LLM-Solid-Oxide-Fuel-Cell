2,2359,The trade-off between desirable catalytic activity and long-term stability challenges the development and commercialization of electrode materials.,Enhanced Long-Term Cathode Stability by Tuning Interfacial Nanocomposite for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/admi.202102131
3,2359,"Here an oxygen cathode material, Ba0.5Sr0.5(Co0.7Fe0.3)(0.69-)xMgxW0.31O3-delta (BSCFW-xMg), that exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance through the addition of an optimized amount of Mg to the self-assembled nanocomposite Ba0.5Sr0.5(Co0.7Fe0.3)(0.69)W0.31O3-delta (BSCFW) by simple solid-state reaction is reported.",Enhanced Long-Term Cathode Stability by Tuning Interfacial Nanocomposite for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/admi.202102131
4,2359,"Distinct from the bulk and surface approaches to introduce vacancies and defects in materials design, here the Mg2+ ions concentrate at the single perovskite/double perovskite interface of BSCFW with dislocations and Mg2+-rich nanolayers, resulting in stressed and compositionally inhomogeneous interface regions.",Enhanced Long-Term Cathode Stability by Tuning Interfacial Nanocomposite for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/admi.202102131
5,2359,The interfacial chemistry within these nanocomposites provides an additional degree of freedom to enable performance optimization over single phase materials and promotes the durability of alkaline-earth based fuel cell materials.,Enhanced Long-Term Cathode Stability by Tuning Interfacial Nanocomposite for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/admi.202102131
