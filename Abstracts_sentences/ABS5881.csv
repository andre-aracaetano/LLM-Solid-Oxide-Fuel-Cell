1,5881,"This study conducts conventional and advanced exergy, exergo-economic, and exergo-environmental analyses and comparisons of two tri-generation systems driven by solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and gas turbines (GTs).",Conventional and advanced exergy-based analyses and comparisons of two novel tri-generation systems based on solid oxide fuel cells and gas turbines,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.144

3,5881,"The analysis results indicate that the biggest cost rates of exergy destruction and component in both systems appear in SOFCs being 4.4333 $/h and 4.2760 $/h, while the highest environmental impact rates combined with exergy destruction and component in systems 1 and 2 are found in afterburner and HRSG, which are 645.9569 mPts/h and 849.2659 mPts/h. Compared to the conventional analyses, the advanced analyses demonstrate that air compressors own the largest avoidable -endogenous parts of cost rates, while HRSG of system 1 and steam turbine (ST) of system 2 own the highest avoidable -endogenous parts of environmental impact rates being 165.8482 mPts/h and 115.2299 mPts/h.",Conventional and advanced exergy-based analyses and comparisons of two novel tri-generation systems based on solid oxide fuel cells and gas turbines,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.144
