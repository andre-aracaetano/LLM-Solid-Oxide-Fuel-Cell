2,4771,"Two different levels of detail for the definition of the basic cell elements are considered, the first with the assumption of isothermal behavior for a finite volume, defined by a portion of the cell PEN structure with pertinent air and fuel channels, and the second with a more refined element subdivision, capable of simulating temperature differences at a smaller scale.",Comparison of finite volume SOFC models for the simulation of a planar cell geometry,10.1002/fuce.200400057
3,4771,"The model applies a detailed electrochemical and thermal analysis to a planar SOFC of a defined geometry (with co-flow, counter-flow or cross-flow configuration), material properties and input flows.",Comparison of finite volume SOFC models for the simulation of a planar cell geometry,10.1002/fuce.200400057
