1,16585,"In order to improve the reliability of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in terms of tolerance to redox cycles, and to minimise fuel preprocessing for the direct use of readily available hydrocarbons in SOFCs, alternative ceramic-based anode substrate materials and functional anode materials were investigated, with the emphasis on perovskite oxides.",Ceramic-based Anode Materials for Improved Redox Cycling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800018
2,16585,"Compared to (Sr,La)TiO(3-delta) and Nb(2)TiO(7-delta), (Sr,Y)TiO(3-delta) ceramics (SYT, with a Y content of about 7 at.-%) reduced at high temperatures are promising redox-stable anode substrate materials due to their very small dimensional change upon redox cycling (0.14%).",Ceramic-based Anode Materials for Improved Redox Cycling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800018
3,16585,"Correspondingly, the composite ceramic SYT/YSZ impregnated with similar to 5 vol.-% Ni has a good chance of being applied as a redox-stable functional anode material due to its even smaller dimensional change upon redox cycling (<0.05%) and superior electrochemical performance for H(2) oxidation (polarisation resistance similar to 0.2 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C).",Ceramic-based Anode Materials for Improved Redox Cycling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800018
4,16585,"The small fraction of Ni homogeneously dispersed on the pore walls of the SYT/YSZ ceramic framework significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity, and should not have a detrimental effect on the redox stability of the electrode.",Ceramic-based Anode Materials for Improved Redox Cycling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800018
5,16585,"In addition, two mixed conductors with perovskite structure, (La(0.8)Sr(0.2))(0.94)Al(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3-delta) and La(0.4)Sr(0.6)Ti(0.4)Mn(0.6)O(3-delta), were also investigated.",Ceramic-based Anode Materials for Improved Redox Cycling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800018
6,16585,They show promising electrochemical performance for the oxidation of H(2).,Ceramic-based Anode Materials for Improved Redox Cycling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800018
7,16585,"However, the high-level Mn substitution which seems necessary to achieve a significant electrical conductivity and catalytic activity has a detrimental effect on the chemical stability of these two materials.",Ceramic-based Anode Materials for Improved Redox Cycling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800018
8,16585,"Consequently, they show relatively large and irreversible chemical expansion and are thus not considered to be qualified functional anode materials.",Ceramic-based Anode Materials for Improved Redox Cycling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800018
