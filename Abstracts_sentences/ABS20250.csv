2,20250,"In this study, the catalytic conversion of methane on a SFMO perovskite anode has been systematically investigated based on the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) method, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) measurement.","Mechanistic insight into catalytic conversion of methane on a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ perovskite anode: a combined EIS-DRT, DFT and TPSR investigation",10.1039/d3ta03391k
3,20250,"A LSGM electrolyte-supported cell with the SFMO anode demonstrates a maximum power density of 0.63 W cm(-2) in wet hydrogen fuel at 800 & DEG;C, but it plummets to only 0.01 W cm(-2) when switched to wet methane fuel.","Mechanistic insight into catalytic conversion of methane on a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ perovskite anode: a combined EIS-DRT, DFT and TPSR investigation",10.1039/d3ta03391k
