5,3582,"For fuel cells operating on biogas, stable operation under a polarization current for 130 h at 750 degrees C is achieved for a cell with an Al2O3-modified anode, while cells with unmodified or SnO2-modified Ni YSZ anodes show much poorer stability under the same conditions.",Aluminum oxide as a dual-functional modifier of Ni-based anodes of solid oxide fuel cells for operation on simulated biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.087
6,3582,The improved performance of the cell with the Al2O3-modified anode mainly results from the suppressed coking and sintering of the anode and from the formation of NiAl2O4 in the unreduced anode.,Aluminum oxide as a dual-functional modifier of Ni-based anodes of solid oxide fuel cells for operation on simulated biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.087
