2,7987,"The cathodes capable of sustaining these processes must themselves be stable in the high temperature environment of air with a significant water vapour content, and compatible chemically and mechanically with the contacting solid phase, normally an electrolyte.",Materials for high-temperature oxygen reduction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004861221167
3,7987,"As charge transfer materials obviously a high electronic conductivity is imperative, and some degree of ionic conductivity can serve to delocalise the oxidation process, thus reducing polarisation.",Materials for high-temperature oxygen reduction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004861221167
