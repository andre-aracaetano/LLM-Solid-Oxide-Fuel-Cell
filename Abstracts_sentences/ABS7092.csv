1,7092,Various compositions of mixture of silver (Ag) and nickel oxide (NiO) powders are studied for use as a cathode contact material in solid oxide fuel cell stacks.,Evaluation of Ag-NiO mixture as a cathode contact material for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.2109/jcersj2.16261
2,7092,The addition of NiO is intended to mitigate Ag evaporation and maintain low resistivity of the contact material during stack operation.,Evaluation of Ag-NiO mixture as a cathode contact material for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.2109/jcersj2.16261
3,7092,It is found that the mixture in the form of pellets consisting of 20 mol% Ag and 80 mol% NiO can yield acceptable area specific resistance (ASR) 2.24 m Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C with reduced weight loss.,Evaluation of Ag-NiO mixture as a cathode contact material for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.2109/jcersj2.16261
4,7092,"However, in the steel/Ag-NiO paste/steel assemblies prepared with 30-50 mol% Ag in mixed powders, each paste containing 64 wt% mixed powder, high ASR values of similar to 100-200 m Omega cm(2) after 1552 h thermal exposure at 800 degrees C are observed.",Evaluation of Ag-NiO mixture as a cathode contact material for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.2109/jcersj2.16261
5,7092,The low resistivity of the pellet with 20 mol% Ag is attributed to the formation of effective conducting pathways by complete sintering of the densely packed Ag particles through the pressing process in producing the pellets.,Evaluation of Ag-NiO mixture as a cathode contact material for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.2109/jcersj2.16261
6,7092,"For the steel/Ag-NiO paste/steel assemblies, Ag particles are scattered within the Ag-NiO layer and cannot readily get sintered.",Evaluation of Ag-NiO mixture as a cathode contact material for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.2109/jcersj2.16261
7,7092,It is found that the resistance of Ag-NiO mixture critically depends on the mass concentration of Ag powder.,Evaluation of Ag-NiO mixture as a cathode contact material for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.2109/jcersj2.16261
