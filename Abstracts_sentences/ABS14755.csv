6,14755,"Temperature dependencies of resonance frequencies and maxima of dielectric parameters in these relaxation peaks are used to estimate migration energies of O2- ion, E-M, and energies required for creation of a free oxygen vacancy assisting O2- migration, E-O. The sums of E-M and E-O in high- and low-frequency peaks are mostly in agreement with activation energies estimated from temperature dependencies of T/R-b and T/R-gb.
