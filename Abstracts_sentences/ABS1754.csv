1,1754,"The influence of the physical and chemical fuel properties on the performance of a direct carbon fuel cell, based on a SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) system, is tested at 850 degrees C. Using six different carbon samples, the experimental results show a clear dependence of both open circuit voltage (OCV) and maximum power density.",Influence of the Carbon/Anode Interaction on Direct Carbon Conversion in a SOFC,
2,1754,"This second parameter is dependent on the internal structure of the carbon material, such as particle size, specific surface area and degree of crystallinity.",Influence of the Carbon/Anode Interaction on Direct Carbon Conversion in a SOFC,
3,1754,"Moreover a variation of the force, pressing the carbon film against the anode layer, results in a reproducible variation of the OCV showing that the density of contact points with the active carbon atoms governs the electrochemical performance of a solid fuel / solid anode DCFC.",Influence of the Carbon/Anode Interaction on Direct Carbon Conversion in a SOFC,
