2,20585,"We report measurements of the oxygen diffusivity parallel and perpendicular to the [001] direction, from 450 to 900 degreesC, using the technique combining isotopic O-16/O-18 exchange and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) spectroscopy.",Anisotropic ionic transport properties in La2NiO4+δ single crystals,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.012
3,20585,"The diffusion is about one to two orders of magnitude higher in the (a,b) plane when compared to the perpendicular direction.",Anisotropic ionic transport properties in La2NiO4+δ single crystals,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.012
4,20585,"The activation energy of the diffusion measured in the (a,b) plane is close to the one (E-a similar to 0.9 eV) measured in the ceramics and in agreement, as expected, with a mechanism involving the interstitial oxygen O-i(2-) as major diffusing species.",Anisotropic ionic transport properties in La2NiO4+δ single crystals,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.012
5,20585,"This prevailing mechanism may explain, at least partly, the good efficiency of such materials when used as cathodes in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) devices.",Anisotropic ionic transport properties in La2NiO4+δ single crystals,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.012
6,20585,"Although the diffusivity parallel to the [001] axis is small, its activation energy is about four times weaker (E-a similar to 0.25 eV) than the one observed in the (a,b) plane.",Anisotropic ionic transport properties in La2NiO4+δ single crystals,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.012
7,20585,"This result is in agreement with a non-stoichiometry model involving anti-phase boundaries in such materials, which induce the stabilization of oxygen vacancies in the NiO2 layers.",Anisotropic ionic transport properties in La2NiO4+δ single crystals,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.012
8,20585,"The corresponding proposed mechanism involves the transfer of smaller O-i(-) species, with a low concentration but a high mobility.",Anisotropic ionic transport properties in La2NiO4+δ single crystals,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.012
9,20585,"Furthermore, electronic conduction seems to play a key role in this mechanism.",Anisotropic ionic transport properties in La2NiO4+δ single crystals,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.012
10,20585,"Finally, we measured a low anisotropy for the values of the surface exchange coefficients.",Anisotropic ionic transport properties in La2NiO4+δ single crystals,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.012
