1,13371,"La1-xSrxCr1-yFeyO3-delta (x= 0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2; y=0, 0.3, 0.5) perovskite-type oxide powders were synthesized by solution combustion synthesis and characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and H-2-temperature programmed reduction.",Direct methane oxidation on La1-xSrxCr1-y FeyO3-δ perovskite-type oxides as potential anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.06.012
2,13371,Selected compositions were studied by CH4-temperature programmed reduction in the absence and in the presence of H2S. Temperature programmed oxidation and structural characterizations were performed in order to discriminate the nature of residual deposits on the catalyst surface.,Direct methane oxidation on La1-xSrxCr1-y FeyO3-δ perovskite-type oxides as potential anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.06.012
3,13371,The study about reduction in different methane-based mixture revealed that total and partial methane oxidation occurred in the range similar to 450-1000 degrees C independently of methane concentration.,Direct methane oxidation on La1-xSrxCr1-y FeyO3-δ perovskite-type oxides as potential anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.06.012
4,13371,"The H2S influence on methane oxidation was evaluated and experiments in CH4/H2S gas mixture indicated that La0.9Sr0.1Cr0.7Fe0.3O3-delta oxidized CH4 to CO2 and CO, as well as H2S to SO2.",Direct methane oxidation on La1-xSrxCr1-y FeyO3-δ perovskite-type oxides as potential anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.06.012
5,13371,La0.9Sr0.1Cr0.7Fe0.3O3-delta was therefore identified a potential anode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells directly fed with CH4 in the presence of H2S.
