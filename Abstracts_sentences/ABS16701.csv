1,16701,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been commercialized due to their ability to provide a reliable energy supply at a high efficiency.,Fluoride- and hydroxide-containing CO2-selective membranes for improving H2 utilization of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118484
2,16701,"However, because of the incomplete oxidation on the anode side, there is still a considerable amount of unused fuel (e.g., H-2 and CO) present in the anode exhaust.",Fluoride- and hydroxide-containing CO2-selective membranes for improving H2 utilization of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118484
3,16701,A CO2-selective membrane was proposed to remove CO2 in the anode exhaust and recycle the retained H-2 and CO back to the SOFC.,Fluoride- and hydroxide-containing CO2-selective membranes for improving H2 utilization of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118484
4,16701,The challenge lies in maintaining a high CO2/H-2 selectivity (>100) and a good CO2 permeance (>100 GPU) at an operating temperature of 120 degrees C. Earlier studies have yielded facilitated transport membranes that employed tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) as the mobile carrier for CO2.,Fluoride- and hydroxide-containing CO2-selective membranes for improving H2 utilization of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118484
5,16701,"However, a better stability of the membrane at a higher temperature of 130 degrees C was desired.",Fluoride- and hydroxide-containing CO2-selective membranes for improving H2 utilization of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118484
6,16701,"In this study, fluoride- and hydroxide-containing species, including tetramethylammonium fluoride (TMAF), cesium fluoride (CsF), potassium fluoride (KF), and N,N-dimethylpiperidinium hydroxide (DMPOH), were examined for their potential of replacing TMAOH to facilitate CO2 transport.",Fluoride- and hydroxide-containing CO2-selective membranes for improving H2 utilization of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118484
7,16701,"The thermal stability of the quaternaryammonium-containing compounds was characterized by TGA and NMR, and the catalyzing activities of the fluoride-containing species were compared using NMR.",Fluoride- and hydroxide-containing CO2-selective membranes for improving H2 utilization of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118484
8,16701,"Based on the characterization results, TMAF was chosen as the substitute for TMAOH, and the membrane synthesized with the optimal composition was tested for transport performances at various temperatures.",Fluoride- and hydroxide-containing CO2-selective membranes for improving H2 utilization of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118484
9,16701,"In particular, a CO2 permeance of 108 GPU and a CO2/H-2 selectivity of 106 were obtained at 120 degrees C.",Fluoride- and hydroxide-containing CO2-selective membranes for improving H2 utilization of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118484
10,16701,The TMAF-containing membrane also demonstrated an improved stability than the TMAOH-containing membrane at 130 degrees C.,Fluoride- and hydroxide-containing CO2-selective membranes for improving H2 utilization of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118484
