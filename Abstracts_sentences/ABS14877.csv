1,14877,The effect of alloy heat treatment on the oxidation kinetics and oxide scale microstructure of Crofer 22 APU has been studied.,Effects of alloy heat treatment on oxidation kinetics and scale morphology for Crofer 22 APU,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.181
2,14877,"Parabolic oxidation rate constants were measured for the as-received alloy and after pre-oxidation heat treatment in argon at 1050 degrees C for 1 and 4 h. The oxide scale microstructure was investigated using scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam milling and transmission electron microscopy.",Effects of alloy heat treatment on oxidation kinetics and scale morphology for Crofer 22 APU,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.181
3,14877,It was found that the alloy forms a two-layer scale with a continuous chromia layer and a discontinuous MnCr2O4 overlayer.,Effects of alloy heat treatment on oxidation kinetics and scale morphology for Crofer 22 APU,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.181
4,14877,Two forms of internal oxides were also formed: subscale pockets of spinet and isolated TiOx precipitates in the underlying alloy.,Effects of alloy heat treatment on oxidation kinetics and scale morphology for Crofer 22 APU,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.181
