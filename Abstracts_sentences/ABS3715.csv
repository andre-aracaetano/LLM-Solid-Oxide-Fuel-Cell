1,3715,Interlayering 17.5 nm of Yttria-doped ceria (YDC) thin films between bulk yttria-stabilized-zirconia electrolyte and a porous Pt cathode enhanced the performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Enhancing Oxide Ion Incorporation Kinetics by Nanoscale Yttria-Doped Ceria interlayers,10.1021/nl104417n
2,3715,"The added YDC interlayer (14.11% doped Y(2)O(3)) was fabricated by atomic layer deposition and reduced the cathode/electrolyte interfacial resistances while increasing the exchange current density j(0) by a factor of 4 at operating temperatures between 300-500 degrees C. Tafel plots and the fitted impedance data suggest that the charge transfer coefficient a of interlayered SOFCs was 1.25 times higher, and the electrode/interfacial activation energy was reduced from 0.85 to 0.76 eV.",Enhancing Oxide Ion Incorporation Kinetics by Nanoscale Yttria-Doped Ceria interlayers,10.1021/nl104417n
