1,10942,A nano-structured La0.8Sr0.2Co0.5Fe0.5O3 + Y2O3 doped ZrO2 (LSCF + YSZ) composite cathode was prepared by impregnation of a I-SCIF-containing solution into porous YSZ structure presintered on the YSZ electrolyte.,"Nano-structured (La, Sr)(Co, Fe)O3+YSZ composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.082
2,10942,"The result shows that the LSCF phase was formed at 700 degrees C. forming a nano-structured, effective and functional LSCF + YSZ composite cathode that not only produces high triple phase boundaries for the O-2 reduction reaction, but also provides a Structurally stable interface between the LSCF and YSZ.","Nano-structured (La, Sr)(Co, Fe)O3+YSZ composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.082
3,10942,"The electrode polarization resistance for the O-2 reduction reaction is from 0.539 to 0.047 Omega cm(2) between 600 and 750 degrees C, indicating the promising potential the LSCF + YSZ as a high performance cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.","Nano-structured (La, Sr)(Co, Fe)O3+YSZ composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.082
