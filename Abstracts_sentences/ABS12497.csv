4,12497,"were deposited on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) supports and then infiltrated with catalytic amounts of a Ni nitrate solution, followed by electrochemical testing in a 3-electrode half-cell setup at 500-800 degrees C. Infiltration of 3 wt.% Ni into the porous GDC anode lowered the polarization resistance by up to 85%, affecting mainly the low frequency impedance arc.",Enhanced hydrogen oxidation activity and H2S tolerance of Ni-infiltrated ceria solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.150

In the presence of H2S, it is proposed that Ni, likely distributed as a nanophase, helps to maintain a clean GDC surface at the Ni/GDC interface at which the H-2 oxidation reaction takes place.",Enhanced hydrogen oxidation activity and H2S tolerance of Ni-infiltrated ceria solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.150
