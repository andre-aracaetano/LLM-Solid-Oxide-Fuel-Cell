1,15173,"Aiming at a tradeoff between the chemical stability of La2NiO4 + delta (LNO) and the high electrochemical performances of La2NiO4 + delta (PNO), La2 - xPrxNiO4 + delta mixed nickelates, further referred as LPNO, were studied as possible oxygen electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",La2-xPrxNiO4+δ as suitable cathodes for metal supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.05.005
2,15173,LPNO phases were synthesized using the modified citrate-nitrate route followed by a heat treatment at 1200 degrees C for 12 h under air.,La2-xPrxNiO4+δ as suitable cathodes for metal supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.05.005
3,15173,"Structural characterizations of those K2NiF4-type compounds show the existence of two solid solutions with orthorhombic structure, namely a La-rich one from x = 0 to 0.5 with Fmmm space group, and a Pr-rich one from x = 1.0 to 2.0 with Bmab space group.",La2-xPrxNiO4+δ as suitable cathodes for metal supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.05.005
4,15173,"The mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) properties of LPNO phases were investigated through the evolution of the oxygen over-stoichiometry, delta, measured as a function of temperature and pO(2), the electrical conductivity, the diffusion and surface exchange coefficients versus x, showing that all compositions exhibit suitable characteristics as cathode materials for SOFCs.",La2-xPrxNiO4+δ as suitable cathodes for metal supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.05.005
5,15173,"In particular, the electrochemical performances measured in symmetrical cells using LPNO materials sintered under low pO(2), as requested in metal supported cell, (MSC-conditions) confirmed a decrease in polarization resistance values, R-p, from 0.93 Omega cm(2) (LNO) down to 0.15 Omega cm(2) (PNO) at 600 degrees C with increasing x.
