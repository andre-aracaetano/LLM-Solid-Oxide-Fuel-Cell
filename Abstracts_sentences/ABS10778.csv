1,10778,"Conductive oxides are widely studied as cathode materials for electrochemical cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), because of their chemical stability and high electrical conductivity at high temperatures (800-950 degrees C).",DC 4-Point Measurement for Total Electrical Conductivity of SOFC Cathode Material,10.3390/app11114963
2,10778,"The cathode is a key component of SOFCs, accounting for the greatest resistance loss among the SOFC components.",DC 4-Point Measurement for Total Electrical Conductivity of SOFC Cathode Material,10.3390/app11114963
3,10778,"It is important to precisely determine the conductivity of the cathode material, but it is difficult to achieve consistency among measurements because of errors caused by differences in the measurement methods and conditions employed by various research teams.",DC 4-Point Measurement for Total Electrical Conductivity of SOFC Cathode Material,10.3390/app11114963
4,10778,"In this study, the total electrical conductivity of an SOFC cathode material was measured by the DC 4-point method by investigating the geometrical parameters of the sample and the measurement terminal and the measurement device using La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+d (LSM).",DC 4-Point Measurement for Total Electrical Conductivity of SOFC Cathode Material,10.3390/app11114963
5,10778,"The measurement variables included the spacing between the measurement terminals (1 and 2 cm), lead wire diameter (0.25 and 0.5 mm), specimen thickness (3, 4, and 5 mm), and the applied current (10, 50, and 100 mA).",DC 4-Point Measurement for Total Electrical Conductivity of SOFC Cathode Material,10.3390/app11114963
6,10778,"The larger the spacing between the measurement terminal and the thinner the specimen, the smaller the standard deviation.",DC 4-Point Measurement for Total Electrical Conductivity of SOFC Cathode Material,10.3390/app11114963
