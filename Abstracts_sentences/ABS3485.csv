2,3485,"In this work, the effect of electrolyte surface microstructure on the cathode performance was demonstrated by analyzing electrochemical impedance spectra of symmetric cells which consist of porous (La0.85Sr0.15)(0.9)MnO3-delta(LSM) and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta (LSCF) electrodes with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) electrolytes.",Effect of Electrolyte Surface Microstructure on Interfacial Polarization Resistances of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,
3,3485,"The SDC electrolytes exhibited different surface microstructures, i.e. different grain sizes and grain boundary densities as a result of various sintering conditions.",Effect of Electrolyte Surface Microstructure on Interfacial Polarization Resistances of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,
4,3485,SEM was used to investigate the SDC surface microstructure parameters and the relationships between these parameters and the polarization resistance ware discussed.,Effect of Electrolyte Surface Microstructure on Interfacial Polarization Resistances of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,
5,3485,"It is found that R-c is greatly affected by the SDC surface microstructures and decreases with the decrease of grain size, or the increase of grain-boundary density.",Effect of Electrolyte Surface Microstructure on Interfacial Polarization Resistances of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,
6,3485,"Moreover, it is demonstrated that the oxygen ion transfer is significantly increased by decreasing grain size for the oxygen reduction at the LSM cathode.",Effect of Electrolyte Surface Microstructure on Interfacial Polarization Resistances of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,
