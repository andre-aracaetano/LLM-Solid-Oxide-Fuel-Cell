1,16376,"In order to solve the Ni-coarsening problem during fabrication, Ni-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were fabricated using a two step process; co-sintering the cell at a high temperature in air and reducing it at a low temperature.",Enhanced power density of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a two-step firing process,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.023
2,16376,"NiO, NiO-YSZ, and YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) were tape casted and the laminated cell was co-fired at 1300 degrees C in air to form a three-layered half cell and then reduced at 800 degrees C in H(2) in order to convert the NiO to the Ni support.",Enhanced power density of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a two-step firing process,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.023
3,16376,Thin and strong Ni-supported SOFC was successfully fabricated by the two-step process without visible cracks.,Enhanced power density of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a two-step firing process,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.023
4,16376,The anodic microstructure was compared with that sintered at 1350 degrees C in H(2).,Enhanced power density of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a two-step firing process,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.023
5,16376,"The particle size of Ni in anode, reduced at 800 degrees C, was much smaller (< 1 mu m) and more uniform than that of Ni sintered at 1350 degrees C in H(2) (similar to 5 mu m).",Enhanced power density of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a two-step firing process,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.023
6,16376,The cell with the two-step fired anode showed a power density as high as similar to 0.93 W/cm(2) when it was measured at 800 degrees C using LSCF as cathodes.,Enhanced power density of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a two-step firing process,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.023
7,16376,This was about twice higher than that of the cell co-fired at 1350 degrees C in H(2) and thus the highest value among many metal-supported cells based on a YSZ electrolyte.,Enhanced power density of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a two-step firing process,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.023
8,16376,"Thus, the anode microstructure is critical in the performance of metal-supported SOFC.",Enhanced power density of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a two-step firing process,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.023
