1,3435,"This study demonstrated a silver (Ag) and samarium-doped ceria (SDC) mixed ceramic and metal composite (i.e., cermet) as a cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).",Silver and Samaria-Doped Ceria (Ag-SDC) Cermet Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/nano13050886
2,3435,"Introducing the Ag-SDC cermet cathode for LT-SOFCs revealed that the ratio between Ag and SDC, which is a crucial factor for catalytic reactions, can be tuned by the co-sputtering process, resulting in enhanced triple phase boundary (TPB) density in the nanostructure.",Silver and Samaria-Doped Ceria (Ag-SDC) Cermet Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/nano13050886
3,3435,Ag-SDC cermet not only successfully performed as a cathode to increase the performance of LT-SOFCs by decreasing polarization resistance but also exceeded the catalytic activity of platinum (Pt) due to the improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).,Silver and Samaria-Doped Ceria (Ag-SDC) Cermet Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/nano13050886
4,3435,"It was also found that less than half of Ag content was effective to increase TPB density, preventing oxidation of the Ag surface as well.",Silver and Samaria-Doped Ceria (Ag-SDC) Cermet Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/nano13050886
