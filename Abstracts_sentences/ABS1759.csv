2,1759,"Results from steady state and temperature programmed experiments over an alternative anode material, La0.8Ca0.2CrO3-x, indicate that both complete oxidation of methane and surface methane dissociation occur at temperatures above 500 degrees C. Negligible carbon deposition occurs during complete oxidation.",EVALUATION OF PEROVSKITE ANODES FOR THE COMPLETE OXIDATION OF DRY METHANE IN SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(94)90168-6
