1,4668,"We report a new sealant material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using glass-ceramic, A glass-ceramic based on the CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 system was selected as a sealant because it can be easily molded to give a gastight seal and remains in a solid-like state under typical fuel cell operating conditions.",A new sealant material for solid oxide fuel cells using glass-ceramic,10.2109/jcersj.109.1267_186
2,4668,Calcium alumina silicate glass powder is placed in the gas-sealing area before crystallization.,A new sealant material for solid oxide fuel cells using glass-ceramic,10.2109/jcersj.109.1267_186
3,4668,"During heating, the glass softens and bonds with the SOFC components.",A new sealant material for solid oxide fuel cells using glass-ceramic,10.2109/jcersj.109.1267_186
4,4668,"At higher temperatures, bulk crystallization occurs in the glass and the viscosity of the glass-ceramic sealant increases.",A new sealant material for solid oxide fuel cells using glass-ceramic,10.2109/jcersj.109.1267_186
5,4668,"We show that this sealing material which is able to seal at higher viscosities compared with the melt sealing method produces a good gas-tight seal and is chemically stable in contact with SOFC components, e.g., yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes and lanthanum chromite separators.",A new sealant material for solid oxide fuel cells using glass-ceramic,10.2109/jcersj.109.1267_186
