1,9537,"Various anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), based on 10 mol% Dy-doped La2Mo2O9 (LDM) electrolyte, are prepared analytically and operated under single chamber conditions to explore the connections between electrode and power performance.",Upgrading the performance of La2Mo2O9-based solid oxide fuel cell under single chamber conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.03.059
2,9537,"The cathode of tested SOFCs is compositionally graded with three composites of samarium strontium cobaltite and Gd-doped ceria (GDC) to relax the thermal stress, because of sizable thermal expansion differences above 400 C. We focus the research attention on varying the anode pore structure and composition to promote the power performance in methane/air mixture at 700 C. For the one-layer support of GDC+NiO+LDM anode, addition of 10 wt% graphite minimizes its mass transport resistance through creating 8-5 mu m long and similar to 1 gm wide slit-shaped pores.",Upgrading the performance of La2Mo2O9-based solid oxide fuel cell under single chamber conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.03.059
