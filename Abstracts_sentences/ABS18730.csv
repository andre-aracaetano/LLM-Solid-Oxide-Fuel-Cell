2,18730,"One of the key challenges to its industrialization is the lack of efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution at the anode, especially when the operating temperature is pushed to its lower limit.",Charge transfer dynamics in RuO2/perovskite nanohybrid for enhanced electrocatalysis in solid oxide electrolyzers,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.048
3,18730,"Here we present advances to tackle this challenge by taking the advantages of the charge transfer dynamics in the junction RuO2/perovskite, which enable the high SOEC performance at reduced temperatures.",Charge transfer dynamics in RuO2/perovskite nanohybrid for enhanced electrocatalysis in solid oxide electrolyzers,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.048
4,18730,"At 1.6 V and 600 degrees C, the modified SOEC delivers a current density of similar to 2.26 A cm(-2), and such high performance is maintained after 90 h. Most importantly, we substantially demonstrate the built-in charge transfer in the junction RuO2/perovskite and disclose the electron donation from the Co-O bonding orbitals to the RuO2 cluster.",Charge transfer dynamics in RuO2/perovskite nanohybrid for enhanced electrocatalysis in solid oxide electrolyzers,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.048
5,18730,"Overall, this work demonstrates a step change in the design of confined electrodes for reduced temperature SOEC, and it provides a general strategy for the functionalization of solid state material.",Charge transfer dynamics in RuO2/perovskite nanohybrid for enhanced electrocatalysis in solid oxide electrolyzers,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.048
