3,3870,"Although the Sc cation can be doped at the Ni site or the Fe site in LNF, which led to the formation of pure phase materials, first-principles calculations indicate that the formation of the LaNi0.4Sc0.1Fe0.5O3-delta (LNSF) material has more advantages than the formation of the LaNi0.5Fe0.4Sc0.1O3-delta (LNFS) material, even though the same Sc-doping level is employed.",Sc-doping strategy for LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3-δ cathode to boost the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.08.075
