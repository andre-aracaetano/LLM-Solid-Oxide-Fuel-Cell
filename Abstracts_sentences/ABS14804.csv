6,14804,All sintered pellets possessed high Vickers hardness (13-14.6 GPa) and fracture toughness (similar to 3 MPa m(1/2)).,Microwave sintering of ceria-doped scandia stabilized zirconia as electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.06.146
7,14804,Microstructural examination by using the scanning electron microscope showed that the grain size varied from 2.9 to 9.8 gm for the conventional sintered samples whereas the grain size of the microwave sintered ceramics was below 2 mu m. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy study recorded the maximum ionic conductivity of 0.280 S/cm at 800 degrees C for the conventional-sintered sample at 1550 degrees C whereas a high value of 0.314 S/cm was measured for the microwave-sintered sample at 1350 degrees C.
