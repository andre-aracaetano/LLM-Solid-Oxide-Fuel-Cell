1,11062,"As a promising electrolyte material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells operated at a temperature of <= 600 degrees C, a Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) film supported by a Ni-SDC cermet anode was prepared through electrophoretic deposition.",Microstructural Characteristics of SDC Electrolyte Film Supported by Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.1149/1.3129436
2,11062,Detailed microstructural features of the electrolyte film were studied.,Microstructural Characteristics of SDC Electrolyte Film Supported by Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.1149/1.3129436
3,11062,"In the region away from the interface, the microstructure of the SDC film is similar to that of the SDC bulk sample, containing nanosized domains embedded in a fluorite matrix.",Microstructural Characteristics of SDC Electrolyte Film Supported by Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.1149/1.3129436
4,11062,"However, in the region near the interface, the diffusion of Ni from the cermet anode to the electrolyte film was observed with a depth of about 1 mu m. Furthermore, the reduction in Ce and a high degree of oxygen vacancy ordering can be noticed in the interfacial region at the electrolyte side.",Microstructural Characteristics of SDC Electrolyte Film Supported by Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.1149/1.3129436
5,11062,It is suggested that these microstructural features could have negative impacts on the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte films.,Microstructural Characteristics of SDC Electrolyte Film Supported by Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.1149/1.3129436
