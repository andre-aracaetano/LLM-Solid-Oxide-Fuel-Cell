2,20752,The catalyst provides significantly higher reforming reactivity and excellent resistance toward carbon deposition compared to Ni/Al2O3 and conventional low surface area ceria (CeO2 (LSA)) under dry reforming conditions.,Catalytic dry reforming of methane over high surface area ceria,10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.03.001
3,20752,These enhancements are due to the high redox property of CeO2 (HSA).,Catalytic dry reforming of methane over high surface area ceria,10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.03.001
4,20752,"During the dry reforming process, the redox reactions between the gaseous components in the system and the lattice oxygen (O-x) take place on ceria surface.",Catalytic dry reforming of methane over high surface area ceria,10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.03.001
5,20752,"Among these reactions, the rapid redox reactions of carbon compounds such as CH4, and CO with lattice oxygen (CH4 + O-x -> CO + H-2 + Ox-1 and CO + O-x = CO2 + Ox-1) can prevent the formation of carbon species from the methane decomposition and Boudard reactions even at low inlet carbon dioxide concentration.",Catalytic dry reforming of methane over high surface area ceria,10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.03.001
6,20752,"In particular, the dry reforming rate over CeO2 (HSA) is proportional to the methane partial pressure and the operating temperature.",Catalytic dry reforming of methane over high surface area ceria,10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.03.001
7,20752,"Carbon dioxide presents weak positive impact on the methane conversion, whereas both carbon monoxide and hydrogen inhibit the reforming rate.",Catalytic dry reforming of methane over high surface area ceria,10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.03.001
8,20752,The activation energies and reforming rates under the same methane concentration for CeO2 toward the dry reforming are almost equal to the steam reforming as previously reported [1-4].,Catalytic dry reforming of methane over high surface area ceria,10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.03.001
9,20752,"This result suggests the similar reaction mechanisms for both the steam reforming and the dry reforming over CeO2; i.e., the dry reforming rate is governed by the slow reaction of adsorbed methane, or surface hydrocarbon species, with oxygen in CeO2, and a rapid gas-solid reaction between CO2 and CeO2 to replenish the oxygen.",Catalytic dry reforming of methane over high surface area ceria,10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.03.001
