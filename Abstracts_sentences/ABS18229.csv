2,18229,This is partly due to difficulties in separating anode and cathode impedance features and overpotentials of operating fuel cells.,Surface and Defect Chemistry of Porous La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ Electrodes on Polarized Three-Electrode Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac908b
3,18229,"For this, we present a novel three-electrode geometry to measure single-electrode impedance spectra and overpotentials in solid oxide cells.",Surface and Defect Chemistry of Porous La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ Electrodes on Polarized Three-Electrode Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac908b
4,18229,"With this new design, we characterise polarised porous La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta (LSF) electrodes by simultaneous impedance spectroscopy and ambient pressure XPS measurements.",Surface and Defect Chemistry of Porous La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ Electrodes on Polarized Three-Electrode Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac908b
5,18229,"With physically justified equivalent circuit models, we can show how the overpotential-dependent changes in the impedance and XPS spectra are related to oxygen vacancy and electronic point defect concentrations, which deterimine the electrochemical properties.",Surface and Defect Chemistry of Porous La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ Electrodes on Polarized Three-Electrode Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac908b
6,18229,The results are overall in very good agreement with the key findings of several previous studies on the bulk defect chemistry and surface chemistry of LSF.,Surface and Defect Chemistry of Porous La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ Electrodes on Polarized Three-Electrode Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac908b
7,18229,They show for example the exsolution of Fe-0 particles during cathodic polarisation in H-2 + H2O atmosphere that decrease the polarization resistance by roughly one order of magnitude.,Surface and Defect Chemistry of Porous La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ Electrodes on Polarized Three-Electrode Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac908b
