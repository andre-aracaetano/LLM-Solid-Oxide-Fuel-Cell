1,4589,Thin cathodes for micro-solid oxide fuel cells (micro-SOFCs) are fabricated by spin-coating a suspension of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3- (LSC) nanoparticulates obtained by salt-assisted spray pyrolysis.,Integration of Spin-Coated Nanoparticulate-Based La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes into Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes,10.1002/fuce.201300020
2,4589,The resulting 250nm thin LSC layers exhibit a three-dimensional porous microstructure with a grain size of around 45nm and can be integrated onto free-standing 3mol.% yttria-stabilized-zirconia (3YSZ) electrolyte membranes with high survival rates.,Integration of Spin-Coated Nanoparticulate-Based La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes into Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes,10.1002/fuce.201300020
3,4589,"Weakly buckled micro-SOFC membranes enable a homogeneous distribution of the LSC dispersion on the electrolyte, whereas the steep slopes of strongly buckled membranes do not allow for a perfect LSC coverage.",Integration of Spin-Coated Nanoparticulate-Based La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes into Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes,10.1002/fuce.201300020
4,4589,A micro-SOFC membrane consisting of an LSC cathode on a weakly buckled 3YSZ electrolyte and a sputtered Pt anode has an open-circuit voltage of 1.05V and delivers a maximum power density of 12mWcm-2 at 500 degrees C.,Integration of Spin-Coated Nanoparticulate-Based La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes into Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes,10.1002/fuce.201300020
