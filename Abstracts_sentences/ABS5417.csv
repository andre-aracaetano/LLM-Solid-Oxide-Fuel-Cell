1,5417,An experimental investigation is performed to establish the optimal operating conditions of a porous media after-burner integrated with a I kW solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system fed by a natural gas reformer.,Experimental investigation of 1 kW solid oxide fuel cell system with a natural gas reformer and an exhaust gas burner,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.021
2,5417,The compositions of the anode off-gas and cathode off-gas emitted by the SOFC when operating with fuel utilizations in the range 0-0.6 are predicted using commercial GCTool software.,Experimental investigation of 1 kW solid oxide fuel cell system with a natural gas reformer and an exhaust gas burner,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.021
3,5417,"The numerical results are then used to set the compositions of the anode off-gas and cathode off-gas in a series of experiments designed to clarify the effects of the fuel utilization, cathode off-gas temperature and excess air ratio on the temperature distribution within the after-burner.",Experimental investigation of 1 kW solid oxide fuel cell system with a natural gas reformer and an exhaust gas burner,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.021
4,5417,"The experimental results show that the optimal after-burner operation is obtained when using an anode off-gas temperature of 650 degrees C. a cathode off-gas temperature of 390 degrees C, a flame barrier temperature of 700 degrees C, an excess air ratio of 2 and a fuel utilization of U(f) = 0.6.",Experimental investigation of 1 kW solid oxide fuel cell system with a natural gas reformer and an exhaust gas burner,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.021
5,5417,"It is shown that under these conditions, the after-burner can operate in a long-term, continuous fashion without the need for either cooling air or any additional fuel other than that provided by the anode off-gas.",Experimental investigation of 1 kW solid oxide fuel cell system with a natural gas reformer and an exhaust gas burner,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.021
