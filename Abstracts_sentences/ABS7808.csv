2,7808,The solid-oxide electrolyte layer with Sr- and Mg-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM) prepared on a NiO-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode with an inserted Gd-doped ceria (GDC) buffering interlayer was not rigid.,Observation of Cation Diffusion and Phase Formation between Solid Oxide Layers of Lanthanum Gallate-Based Fuel Cells,10.2320/matertrans.M2017257
3,7808,"EPMA of the cross-section showed diffusion of La and Sr out of LSGM, and Ni, Y, and Zr out of NiO-YSZ.",Observation of Cation Diffusion and Phase Formation between Solid Oxide Layers of Lanthanum Gallate-Based Fuel Cells,10.2320/matertrans.M2017257
4,7808,"Using synchrotron radiation, X-ray absorption near-edge structures of the layer cross-sections were examined using an X-ray fluorescence yield method.",Observation of Cation Diffusion and Phase Formation between Solid Oxide Layers of Lanthanum Gallate-Based Fuel Cells,10.2320/matertrans.M2017257
