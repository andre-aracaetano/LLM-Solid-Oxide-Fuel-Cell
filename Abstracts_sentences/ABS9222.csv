2,9222,"These phases were found to adopt orthorhombic symmetry with a decrease in lattice parameters on increasing Pr content, consistent with the solid solution series end members.",LaxPr4-xNi3O10-δ: Mixed A-Site Cation Higher-Order Ruddlesden-Popper Phase Materials as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.3390/cryst10060428
3,9222,"From electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements of symmetrical cells, the electrodes were found to possess area specific resistances of 0.07 ohm cm(2)for the La(2)Pr(2)Ni(3)O(9.65)cathode and 0.10 ohm cm(2)for the La(3)PrNi(3)O(9.76)cathode at 750 degrees C, representing a significant improvement on previously reported compositions.",LaxPr4-xNi3O10-δ: Mixed A-Site Cation Higher-Order Ruddlesden-Popper Phase Materials as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.3390/cryst10060428
4,9222,"This significant improvement in performance is attributed to the optimisation of the electrode microstructure, introduction of an electrolyte interlayer and the resulting improved adhesion of the electrode layer.",LaxPr4-xNi3O10-δ: Mixed A-Site Cation Higher-Order Ruddlesden-Popper Phase Materials as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.3390/cryst10060428
5,9222,"Following this development, the new electrode materials were tested for their single-cell performance, with the maximum power densities obtained for La(2)Pr(2)Ni(3)O(9.65)and La(3)PrNi(3)O(9.76)being 390 mW cm(-2)and 400 mW cm(-2)at 800 degrees C, respectively.",LaxPr4-xNi3O10-δ: Mixed A-Site Cation Higher-Order Ruddlesden-Popper Phase Materials as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.3390/cryst10060428
6,9222,"As these single-cell measurements were based on thick electrolytes, there is considerable scope to enhance over cell performance in future developments.",LaxPr4-xNi3O10-δ: Mixed A-Site Cation Higher-Order Ruddlesden-Popper Phase Materials as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.3390/cryst10060428
