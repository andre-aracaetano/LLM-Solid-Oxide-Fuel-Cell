2,2170,"A power density of 0.39 W/cm(2) was obtained using a Sn-doped Ni/YSZ cell with methane fuel at 800 degrees C, which is equivalent to that obtained using a Ni/YSZ cell (0.40 W/cm(2)).",Improved solid oxide fuel cell anodes for the direct utilization of methane using Sn-doped Ni/YSZ catalysts,10.1016/j.catcom.2009.09.021
3,2170,Stability tests reveal that the stability of the Sn-doped Ni/YSZ cell is an order of magnitude higher than that of the Ni/YSZ cell.,Improved solid oxide fuel cell anodes for the direct utilization of methane using Sn-doped Ni/YSZ catalysts,10.1016/j.catcom.2009.09.021
4,2170,The Sn-doped Ni/YSZ cell operates for 49.0 h. whereas the Ni/YSZ cell stops after 2.3 h. The Ni/YSZ fuel cell is destroyed by cell expansion caused by the rapid accumulation of graphitic coke.,Improved solid oxide fuel cell anodes for the direct utilization of methane using Sn-doped Ni/YSZ catalysts,10.1016/j.catcom.2009.09.021
5,2170,"In contrast, much less graphitic carbon is deposited on Sn-doped Ni/YSZ, leading to improved stability.",Improved solid oxide fuel cell anodes for the direct utilization of methane using Sn-doped Ni/YSZ catalysts,10.1016/j.catcom.2009.09.021
