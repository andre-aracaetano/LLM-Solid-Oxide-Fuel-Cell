6,10840,"Results show that pressurization and increasing temperature enhance the ammonia-fed SOFC performance significantly having almost the same power densities as those of hydrogen/nitrogen-fed SOFC, as substantiated and explained by EIS data and an equivalence circuit model where the effects of p and T on ohmic, gas diffusion, and gas conversion impedances are shown.",A pressurized ammonia-fed planar anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell at 1-5 atm and 750-850 °C and its loaded short stability test,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.064
7,10840,"Moreover, the loaded short (10 h) stability tests at 700 degrees C and 0.8 V for 1 atm/3 atm cases reveal no/little power degradation, where the microstructures without any crack within the scale of SEM observation and nearly the same element atomic percentages of Ni-YSZ anode surfaces from EDX spectra are found.",A pressurized ammonia-fed planar anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell at 1-5 atm and 750-850 °C and its loaded short stability test,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.064
