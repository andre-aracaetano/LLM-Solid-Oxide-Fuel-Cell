1,12866,"In this work cation diffusion between a La2Mo2O9 (LM) ionic conductor and the conventional Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) cathode material La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-(delta) (LSM), was probed using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and diffusion coefficients of Sr, Mo and Mn cations within both materials evaluated.",Cationic Interdiffusion at the SOFC Electrolyte/Cathode Interface in La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ,10.1002/slct.201701180
2,12866,Diffusion coefficients extracted from samples with a Sr solution deposited on the LM pellets and from a Mo solution deposited on LSM pellets were found to be orders of magnitude higher than the cross-diffusion through the inter-face between two dense pellets in direct contact.,Cationic Interdiffusion at the SOFC Electrolyte/Cathode Interface in La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ,10.1002/slct.201701180
3,12866,"These differences may be due to uncertainty in determining the interface position, or to a real dependence on the source of the diffusing cation.",Cationic Interdiffusion at the SOFC Electrolyte/Cathode Interface in La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ,10.1002/slct.201701180
4,12866,"In the most favorable case, that of pellets in direct contact, extrapolation of diffusion coefficients down to a typical SOFC operating temperature, 800 degrees C, show that Mo diffusion in LSM (diffusion coefficient -10(-14) cm(2).s(-1)) is much higher than Sr or Mn diffusion in LM, and incompatible with use in a SOFC device, unless an efficient buffer layer is used.",Cationic Interdiffusion at the SOFC Electrolyte/Cathode Interface in La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ,10.1002/slct.201701180
