1,15166,Large scale integration of intermittent solar and wind power can result in an imbalance in generation and load creating a stressed grid with increased frequency excursions and large power ramps.,A dynamic solid oxide fuel cell empowered by the built-in iron-bed solid fuel,10.1039/c6ee02419j
2,15166,To mitigate these instabilities the use of energy storage devices such as batteries or other mechanical devices is under investigation.,A dynamic solid oxide fuel cell empowered by the built-in iron-bed solid fuel,10.1039/c6ee02419j
3,15166,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are a class of efficient and clean power generator that can provide a timely power injection into the grid.,A dynamic solid oxide fuel cell empowered by the built-in iron-bed solid fuel,10.1039/c6ee02419j
4,15166,"However, they have limited ramping capability and overload tolerance due to fuel delivery constraints that can cause fuel starvation, resulting in Ni-oxidation and irreversible degradation in performance.",A dynamic solid oxide fuel cell empowered by the built-in iron-bed solid fuel,10.1039/c6ee02419j
5,15166,"Herein, we demonstrate a new concept of SOFC that incorporates a regenerative Fe-bed inside the anode chamber as a means of boosting SOFC's dynamic response.",A dynamic solid oxide fuel cell empowered by the built-in iron-bed solid fuel,10.1039/c6ee02419j
6,15166,"The testing results show that such Fe-bed SOFC can operate at 195% overloaded power with a doubled power output over the baseload for at least 5 min, whereas the control Fe-bed free SOFC cannot operate even at 27% overload for 1 min. More interestingly, the Fe-SOFC can respond to load demand instantaneously, reaching a ramp rate of +/- 11 W cm(-2) min(-1).",A dynamic solid oxide fuel cell empowered by the built-in iron-bed solid fuel,10.1039/c6ee02419j
7,15166,The demonstrated new functionality is expected to empower SOFCs to play a transformational role in providing fast ramping power to the utility grid and overload-tolerant baseload power to the critical data centres.,A dynamic solid oxide fuel cell empowered by the built-in iron-bed solid fuel,10.1039/c6ee02419j
8,15166,The challenges of this new technology are also discussed.,A dynamic solid oxide fuel cell empowered by the built-in iron-bed solid fuel,10.1039/c6ee02419j
