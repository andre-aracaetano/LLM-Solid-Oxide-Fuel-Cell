1,14453,"Intermediate temperature (600-800 A degrees C) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology is often limited by inadequate gas transport in electrodes, and high ion transport resistance electrolytes.",Thin film YSZ coatings on functionally graded freeze cast NiO/YSZ SOFC anode supports,10.1007/s10800-008-9682-4
2,14453,"In this study, large area filtered arc deposition (LAFAD) and hybrid filtered arc-assisted e-beam physical vapor deposition (FA-EBPVD) technologies, in combination with freeze-tape-casting, were used to fabricate SOFC anode/electrolyte bi-layers with functionally graded porous anode microstructures and thin film electrolytes favorable for both gas transport and low resistance.",Thin film YSZ coatings on functionally graded freeze cast NiO/YSZ SOFC anode supports,10.1007/s10800-008-9682-4
3,14453,Traditionally-processed NiO/YSZ in addition to freeze-tape-cast NiO/YSZ anode substrates were fabricated and subsequently coated with thin film (< 1-20 mu m) YSZ via LAFAD and FA-EBPVD.,Thin film YSZ coatings on functionally graded freeze cast NiO/YSZ SOFC anode supports,10.1007/s10800-008-9682-4
4,14453,"LAFAD was found to be effective in applying thin (similar to 1 mu m) dense YSZ films on porous substrates at similar to 400 A degrees C. FA-EBPVD produced relatively thick (similar to 10-20 mu m) dense YSZ coatings on porous substrates, with columnar morphology and nano-metrical grain size.",Thin film YSZ coatings on functionally graded freeze cast NiO/YSZ SOFC anode supports,10.1007/s10800-008-9682-4
5,14453,"A similar to 10 mu m FA-EBPVD YSZ coating was observed to bridge NiO/YSZ surface pores of similar to 10 mu m, which typically requires pre-filling prior to conventional thin film coating processes.",Thin film YSZ coatings on functionally graded freeze cast NiO/YSZ SOFC anode supports,10.1007/s10800-008-9682-4
6,14453,"Coated substrates exhibited negligible curvature, yielding flat anode/electrode bi-layers up to 2.5 cm in diameter.",Thin film YSZ coatings on functionally graded freeze cast NiO/YSZ SOFC anode supports,10.1007/s10800-008-9682-4
7,14453,These results are presented with conderations for future SOFC development discussed.,Thin film YSZ coatings on functionally graded freeze cast NiO/YSZ SOFC anode supports,10.1007/s10800-008-9682-4
