2,8576,A previous study showed Pd/CeO2-Sm2O3 to be a good candidate.,Steam Reforming of Methanol with Sm2O3-CeO2-Supported Palladium Catalysts: Influence of the Thermal Treatments of Catalyst and Support,10.1021/ie900630z
3,8576,"Here, the influence of the calcination pretreatment of the Support and the reduction temperature of the catalyst on the steam reforming of methanol are investigated, as they can become key factors in the performance of the catalyst.",Steam Reforming of Methanol with Sm2O3-CeO2-Supported Palladium Catalysts: Influence of the Thermal Treatments of Catalyst and Support,10.1021/ie900630z
4,8576,"Conversion, H-2 yield, and TOF were considerably higher when the support was calcined at 800 degrees C (Pd/CS-800) instead of 1000 degrees C (Pd/CS-1000).",Steam Reforming of Methanol with Sm2O3-CeO2-Supported Palladium Catalysts: Influence of the Thermal Treatments of Catalyst and Support,10.1021/ie900630z
5,8576,"Characterization results suggest a stronger interaction of Pd particles with the support in Pd/CS-1000, which hinders its accessibility to the, as atmosphere, and a less homogeneous distribution of Pd particles.",Steam Reforming of Methanol with Sm2O3-CeO2-Supported Palladium Catalysts: Influence of the Thermal Treatments of Catalyst and Support,10.1021/ie900630z
6,8576,"In both cases, the activity increases oil increasing the reduction temperature from 400 to 500 degrees C.",Steam Reforming of Methanol with Sm2O3-CeO2-Supported Palladium Catalysts: Influence of the Thermal Treatments of Catalyst and Support,10.1021/ie900630z
