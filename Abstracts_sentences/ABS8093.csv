3,8093,It was found that the addition of CAES to an SOFC plant provided significant load-following capabilities with relatively small penalties to efficiencies (1.1%HHV) and levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) (0.08-0.3 cent kW(-1) h(-1)).,Systems for peaking power with 100% CO2 capture by integration of solid oxide fuel cells with compressed air energy storage,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.087
