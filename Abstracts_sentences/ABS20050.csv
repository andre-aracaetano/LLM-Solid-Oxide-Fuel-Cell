1,20050,Perovskite Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) is a promising mixed-conducting ceramic membrane material in addition to being a good electrode catalyst for solid oxide fuel cells.,From chelating precursor to perovskite oxides and hollow fiber membranes,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01372.x
2,20050,"In this study, BSCF powder was synthesized via a chelated water-soluble complex method at relatively low temperatures.",From chelating precursor to perovskite oxides and hollow fiber membranes,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01372.x
3,20050,"The combined ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and citric acid was used for the synthesis of a complex-based precursor, followed by thermal decomposition of the precursor at high temperatures.",From chelating precursor to perovskite oxides and hollow fiber membranes,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01372.x
4,20050,"Thermal behavior, crystal phases, and structures of the prepared powders were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry, XRD, and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) techniques, respectively.",From chelating precursor to perovskite oxides and hollow fiber membranes,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01372.x
5,20050,"Pure and single-phase perovskite could be obtained after sintering at a temperature higher than 800 degrees C for 5 h. The soft precursor powder synthesized at lower temperatures, i.e., 600 degrees C, is water insoluble and more appropriate for use as a membrane material to prepare gas-tight tubular or hollow fiber ceramic membranes.",From chelating precursor to perovskite oxides and hollow fiber membranes,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01372.x
6,20050,"By contrast, the hollow fibers prepared via the traditional techniques where the perovskite powder is used as the starting membrane materials display gas leakage.",From chelating precursor to perovskite oxides and hollow fiber membranes,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01372.x
7,20050,"The fibers were characterized by SEM, XRD, and tested for air separation at ambient pressure and temperatures between 700 degrees and 950 degrees C.",From chelating precursor to perovskite oxides and hollow fiber membranes,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01372.x
8,20050,The oxygen flux measured in this work reached 3.90 mL.(min.cm(2))(-1) and compares favorably with any experimental values reported in the open literature.,From chelating precursor to perovskite oxides and hollow fiber membranes,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01372.x
