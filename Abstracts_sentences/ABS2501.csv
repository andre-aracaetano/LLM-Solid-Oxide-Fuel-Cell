1,2501,The anodic performances of Ni-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (Ni-YSZ) modified by alkaline earth metal oxide BaO were investigated for solid oxide fuel cells operating in H2S-containing hydrogen fuels.,Sulfur tolerance improvement of Ni-YSZ anode by alkaline earth metal oxide BaO for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.027
2,2501,The XRF and EDS results indicated that the amount of BaO was about 5%.,Sulfur tolerance improvement of Ni-YSZ anode by alkaline earth metal oxide BaO for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.027
3,2501,The cell with BaO/Ni-YSZ anode exhibited almost constant peak power densities when the fuel was switched from wet hydrogen to 50 ppm H2S contaminated wet hydrogen and good stability in wet H2S-contained hydrogen fuels with H2S concentration gradually increased from 5 to 50 ppm.,Sulfur tolerance improvement of Ni-YSZ anode by alkaline earth metal oxide BaO for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.027
4,2501,The EDS and XPS results demonstrated that no element S was detectable after sulfur poisoning testing.,Sulfur tolerance improvement of Ni-YSZ anode by alkaline earth metal oxide BaO for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.027
5,2501,High water adsorption ability of BaO could be the primary reason for the high sulfur tolerance.,Sulfur tolerance improvement of Ni-YSZ anode by alkaline earth metal oxide BaO for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.027
6,2501,The obtained results confirmed the previous conclusion that BaO/Ni interfaces can resist not only deactivation by coking but also sulfur poisoning of a conventional Ni-YSZ anode.,Sulfur tolerance improvement of Ni-YSZ anode by alkaline earth metal oxide BaO for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.027
