1,5991,The existing Ni cermet anodes in single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (SC-SOFCs) usually perform poorly in hydrocarbon-air mixture owing to the reduction-oxidation cycles (redox) and latent reoxidation at operating temperatures.,Enhanced redox and reoxidation tolerances of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 electrolyte for Ni cermet anodes in single-chamber SOFCs,10.1007/s10008-022-05130-0
2,5991,"In this study, the redox and reoxidation tolerances of Ni cermet anode, composed of Ni metal and gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte, are investigated and evaluated in SC-SOFC conditions.",Enhanced redox and reoxidation tolerances of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 electrolyte for Ni cermet anodes in single-chamber SOFCs,10.1007/s10008-022-05130-0
3,5991,"The catalytic performances, resistance properties, and microstructure evolution of the Ni cermet are measured under different CH4-O-2 ratios (M) in the temperature range of 700-800 degrees C. Unlike the general perspective that the electrolyte materials are inactive for the catalytic reaction of fuel, GDC shows a superior catalytic activity for CH4 reforming, especially the complete oxidation.",Enhanced redox and reoxidation tolerances of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 electrolyte for Ni cermet anodes in single-chamber SOFCs,10.1007/s10008-022-05130-0
4,5991,"It significantly reduces the presence of O-2 on Ni metal, resulting in an improvement of redox and reoxidation tolerance.",Enhanced redox and reoxidation tolerances of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 electrolyte for Ni cermet anodes in single-chamber SOFCs,10.1007/s10008-022-05130-0
5,5991,The obtained results unveil a fascinating hidden side that the electrolyte materials of SC-SOFCs play an important role in the catalytic reaction of fuel and Ni-GDC is a promising anode for SC-SOFCs.,Enhanced redox and reoxidation tolerances of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 electrolyte for Ni cermet anodes in single-chamber SOFCs,10.1007/s10008-022-05130-0
