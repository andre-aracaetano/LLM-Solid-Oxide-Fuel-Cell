2,13856,"Herein, we explore a simple approach of low fuel partial pressure to investigate the relevant limiting factors for ethanol-fueled SOFCs, providing the evaluation of the electrochemical performance and the carbon tolerance.",Characterization and polarization DRT analysis of direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cells using low fuel partial pressures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.146
3,13856,"As the partial pressure of ethanol fuel increases from 30% to 60%, the best cell performance gradually increases from 710.2 mW cm(-2) to 856.8 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, which still lower than those of hydrogen-fueled SOFCs (1061.4 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C), and the corresponding improvement in concentration polarization can be clearly observed especially in high current discharge area.",Characterization and polarization DRT analysis of direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cells using low fuel partial pressures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.146
4,13856,"The corresponding impedance spectra and electrode polarization processes of ethanol-fueled SOFCs are further studied by the equivalent circuit fitting and the distribution function of relaxation time (DRT) analysis, finding that the key improvement of the speed control steps comes from the concentration polarization process with the increase of the fuel partial pressure.",Characterization and polarization DRT analysis of direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cells using low fuel partial pressures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.146
5,13856,"Small amount of carbon deposition is observed on the Ni-YSZ anode substrate by SEM-EDS images after short-term discharging testing, and the safety utilization boundaries of ethanol-fueled SOFCs with a certain steam concentration can be predicted by the thermodynamic equilibria calculation.",Characterization and polarization DRT analysis of direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cells using low fuel partial pressures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.146
