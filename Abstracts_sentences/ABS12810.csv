1,12810,"Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have the potential to increase electricity generation efficiency, but traditional SOFCs supported by nickel cermets suffer from reliability challenges due to weaker mechanical strength caused by cracking after redox cycling.",Flexural strength and flaw distributions of SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-delta ceramic-supports for SOFCs at operating conditions,10.1111/jace.16678
2,12810,"To solve this problem, a new ceramic anode material, SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-delta (SFCM) combined with Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 (GDC), was evaluated for conductivity and mechanical strength at SOFC operating conditions and after redox cycling.",Flexural strength and flaw distributions of SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-delta ceramic-supports for SOFCs at operating conditions,10.1111/jace.16678
3,12810,"Fracture toughness of SFCM was determined to be (0.124 +/- 0.023) MPa root m at room temperature in air, increasing to (0.286 +/- 0.038)",Flexural strength and flaw distributions of SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-delta ceramic-supports for SOFCs at operating conditions,10.1111/jace.16678
4,12810,"MPa root m at 600 degrees C. A mixture of SFCM:GDC showed fracture toughness between the two materials, following SFCM's trend with temperature.",Flexural strength and flaw distributions of SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-delta ceramic-supports for SOFCs at operating conditions,10.1111/jace.16678
5,12810,The SFCM-GDC anode supported half-cell strength increases by 31% from room temperature to 600 degrees C as intrinsic stresses remaining from sintering are relaxed and thermal expansion pushes existing cracks closed.,Flexural strength and flaw distributions of SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-delta ceramic-supports for SOFCs at operating conditions,10.1111/jace.16678
6,12810,"Exposure to reducing gasses decreases strength by 29% compared to ambient, due to oxygen vacancy formation and microstructural flaw changes.",Flexural strength and flaw distributions of SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-delta ceramic-supports for SOFCs at operating conditions,10.1111/jace.16678
7,12810,It is found that SFCM-GDC based cells tolerate cycling well because of phase stability but weaken from 34.3 to 22.4 MPa due to uniform growth of critical microstructural flaws.,Flexural strength and flaw distributions of SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-delta ceramic-supports for SOFCs at operating conditions,10.1111/jace.16678
