1,3026,"In this study, an anode-supported hollow-fiber solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) of diameter 1.7 mm has been successfully fabricated using the phase inversion and vacuum assisted coating techniques.",Fabrication and characterization of an anode-supported hollow fiber SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.069
2,3026,The cell has a special structure consisting of a 12-mu m-thick yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte film and a Ni-YSZ anode layer which has large finger-like pores on both sides of the hollow-fiber membrane.,Fabrication and characterization of an anode-supported hollow fiber SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.069
3,3026,"The hollow-fiber SOFC has an active electrode area of 0.63 cm(2) and generates maximum power densities of 124, 287 and 377 mW cm(-2) at 600, 700 and 800 degrees C, respectively, indicating that its use in applications requiring high power density is promising.",Fabrication and characterization of an anode-supported hollow fiber SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.069
