1,18470,NiO-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC)/SDC/La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta(LSCF) cells with either a single-layer or a double-layer cathode were fabricated and tested.,Enhancement of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance by La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Double-Layer Cathode,10.1149/1.2981039
2,18470,"The single-layer LSCF cathode was made by stencil printing, while the double-layer cathode was prepared by depositing a thin porous layer on the SDC electrolyte using electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) before stencil printing.",Enhancement of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance by La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Double-Layer Cathode,10.1149/1.2981039
3,18470,The cells were tested with moist hydrogen as fuel and air as oxidant.,Enhancement of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance by La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Double-Layer Cathode,10.1149/1.2981039
4,18470,The maximum power density increased from 0.81 to 0.91 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C and 1.04-1.18 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C when the ESD-LSCF layer was introduced.,Enhancement of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance by La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Double-Layer Cathode,10.1149/1.2981039
5,18470,The interfacial area specific resistances (ASRs) of electrodes for both cells were also measured under open-circuit condition.,Enhancement of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance by La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Double-Layer Cathode,10.1149/1.2981039
