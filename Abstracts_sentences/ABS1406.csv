1,1406,"Despite many efforts and improvements over the last few decades, two of the major challenges facing solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are slow heating rates to operating temperature (typically < 5 degrees C center dot min(-1)) and a limited ability to thermal cycle (<200 cycles).","Investigation of Rapid, Moderate Temperature Change Thermal Cycles of a Micro-Tubular Flame-Assisted Fuel Cell",10.1115/1.4049923
2,1406,"Recently, a novel hybrid setup that combines a fuel-rich combustion reformer with a SOFC was developed and utilized to investigate rapid heating, cooling, and thermal cycling of a micro-tubular SOFC.","Investigation of Rapid, Moderate Temperature Change Thermal Cycles of a Micro-Tubular Flame-Assisted Fuel Cell",10.1115/1.4049923
3,1406,"In this work, 3000 moderate thermal cycles are conducted at a heating rate exceeding 140 degrees C center dot min(-1) and a cooling rate that exceeded 100 degrees C center dot min(-1).","Investigation of Rapid, Moderate Temperature Change Thermal Cycles of a Micro-Tubular Flame-Assisted Fuel Cell",10.1115/1.4049923
4,1406,"The open-circuit voltage (OCV) was analyzed over the 150 h test, and a low degradation rate of similar to 0.0008 V per 100 cycles per fuel cell was observed in the absence of the current collector degradation.","Investigation of Rapid, Moderate Temperature Change Thermal Cycles of a Micro-Tubular Flame-Assisted Fuel Cell",10.1115/1.4049923
5,1406,"Unlike a previous test, which was conducted at lower temperatures, significant degradation of the current collector was observed during this test.","Investigation of Rapid, Moderate Temperature Change Thermal Cycles of a Micro-Tubular Flame-Assisted Fuel Cell",10.1115/1.4049923
6,1406,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that degradation in the SOFC was due to increases in ohmic losses, activation losses at the cathode, and increased concentration losses.","Investigation of Rapid, Moderate Temperature Change Thermal Cycles of a Micro-Tubular Flame-Assisted Fuel Cell",10.1115/1.4049923
