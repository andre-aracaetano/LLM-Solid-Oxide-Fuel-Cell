1,741,Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is performed to obtain less than 1 nm thick yttria-doped ceria (YDC) layers as cathode functional layers to increase the surface oxygen incorporation rate for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).,Yttria-Doped Ceria Surface Modification Layer via Atomic Layer Deposition for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/coatings13030491
2,741,Introducing a YDC surface modification layer (SML) has revealed that the optimized yttria concentration in YDC can catalyze surface oxygen exchange kinetics at the interface between the electrolyte and cathode.,Yttria-Doped Ceria Surface Modification Layer via Atomic Layer Deposition for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/coatings13030491
3,741,The YDC SML-containing fuel cell performs 1.5 times better than the pristine fuel cell; the result is an increased exchange current density at the modified surface.,Yttria-Doped Ceria Surface Modification Layer via Atomic Layer Deposition for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/coatings13030491
4,741,"Moreover, a heavily doped YDC SML degrades the performance of LT-SOFCs, owing to the weakened oxygen surface kinetics due to the increased migration energy of the oxygen ions.",Yttria-Doped Ceria Surface Modification Layer via Atomic Layer Deposition for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/coatings13030491
