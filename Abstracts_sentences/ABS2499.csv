3,2499,It was confirmed that the area specific resistance (0.75 Omega cm(2)) of the obtained SBSCO-fiber cathode was much lower than that (1.25 Omega cm(2)) of a powder-type SBSCO cathode at 550 degrees C.,Electrochemical properties of electrospinning-fabricated layered perovskite used in cathode materials for a low temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.tsf.2018.04.020

5,2499,A significantly lower activation energy (0.76 eV) was observed in fiber SBSCO cathode than in the nanostructured La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d ones which were used as control at 1.53 eV.,Electrochemical properties of electrospinning-fabricated layered perovskite used in cathode materials for a low temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.tsf.2018.04.020
