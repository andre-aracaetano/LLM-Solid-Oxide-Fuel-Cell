2,2951,The method constrained electrode-electrolyte interface geometry and thereby limited reaction area for charge transfer.,A new approach to characterize charge transfer reaction for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.01.083
3,2951,Reactive ion etch (RIE) and sputtering techniques were used and the well-defined geometry of interfaces was realized as patterned strips.,A new approach to characterize charge transfer reaction for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.01.083
4,2951,The number of strips of the pattern shape was fully consistent with the value of charge transfer impedance.,A new approach to characterize charge transfer reaction for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.01.083
5,2951,The confined interface structure also helped maintain open circuit voltage for 10 h. This new approach proposes an alternative to quantitatively analyze different electrode materials for SOFC operation while excluding consideration for structural variables.,A new approach to characterize charge transfer reaction for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.01.083
