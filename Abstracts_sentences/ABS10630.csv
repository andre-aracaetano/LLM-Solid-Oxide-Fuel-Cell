2,10630,wt% Ir was prepared and studied in the steam reforming of methane under water deficient conditions (H2O/CH4=0 1) in order to evaluate its potential use as anode material in solid oxide fuel cells directly fed with methane and integrating a gradual internal reforming (GIR) concept Catalytic activity of Ce-0 9Gd0 1O2-x (CGO) and Ir/Al2O3 (0 1 wt% Ir) was also measured Attention was paid to carbon deposition Catalysts were characterized by temperature programmed reaction experiments in dry methane (TPR-CH4) followed by mass spectrometry Adding Ir to CGO was shown to result in a catalyst much more active than CGO and Ir/Al2O3 being stable and extremely resistant to carbon deposition Different mechanisms and/or rate determining steps are proposed and discussed to explain the observed different catalytic behaviours depending on the catalyst (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved,Ir/Ce0 9Gd0 1O2-x as a new potential anode component in solid oxide fuel cells integrating the concept of gradual internal reforming of methane,10.1016/j.cattod.2010.03.066
