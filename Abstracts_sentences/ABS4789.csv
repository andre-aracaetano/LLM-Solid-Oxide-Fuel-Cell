2,4789,"The dynamics of SOFC output power are characterized by a fractional order model, which is more accurate than an integer order model to depict the dynamics; the fractional order dynamic model is taken as the controlled plant of the GPC system.",Generalized predictive control for fractional order dynamic model of solid oxide fuel cell output power,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.053
3,4789,The GPC algorithm adopts a linear approximation method that uses a linear predictive model to approximate locally and dynamically the nonlinear dynamics of SOFC output power at each sampling period.,Generalized predictive control for fractional order dynamic model of solid oxide fuel cell output power,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.053
4,4789,"Moreover, the parameters of the predictive model are identified online to overcome the time-varying dynamics of SOFC output power via introducing a forgetting factor recursive least squares (FFRLS) algorithm.",Generalized predictive control for fractional order dynamic model of solid oxide fuel cell output power,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.053
