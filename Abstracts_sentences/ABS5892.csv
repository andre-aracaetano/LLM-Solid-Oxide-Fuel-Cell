1,5892,"Anode-supported, micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells were prepared and operated, utilizing mixed-reactant (methane and air mixture) supply.","Mixed-reactant, micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells: An experimental study",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.032
2,5892,"The cells were composed of conventional materials, i.e. nickel, yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) as anode supported Material, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as electrolyte, and lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) as cathode material.","Mixed-reactant, micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells: An experimental study",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.032
3,5892,The cells were operated at various temperatures in between 550 and 800 degrees C with varying methane/air ratio (1:1-1:4.76).,"Mixed-reactant, micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells: An experimental study",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.032
4,5892,Cell performance Was found to be strongly dependent on flow Fate and mixing ratio.,"Mixed-reactant, micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells: An experimental study",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.032
5,5892,"At 750 degrees C, the maximum open circuit voltage (OCV) of the cell was 1.05 V at a methane/air ratio of 1:4.76, with a maximum power output of 122 mW cm(-2).","Mixed-reactant, micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells: An experimental study",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.032
6,5892,"The degradation test shows 0.05% performance loss per 24h, thereafter, fluctuations in current density were observed clue to oxidation-reduction cycles over nickel surface.","Mixed-reactant, micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells: An experimental study",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.032
7,5892,It is therefore concluded that although the methane/air ratio of 1:4.76 gives the best performance but the long-term performance is not guaranteed under Such conditions.,"Mixed-reactant, micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells: An experimental study",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.032
