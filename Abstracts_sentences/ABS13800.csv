1,13800,The aim of this paper was to investigate the viability of steam reforming the combined glycerol and water by-product streams of a biodiesel plant.,Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
2,13800,A platinum alumina catalyst was used to optimise the operating conditions for glycerol steam reforming and mass spectroscopy was chosen to measure reformer gas yield.,Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
3,13800,The problem is that glycerol steam reforming is relatively untested even with pure glycerol and the by-product quality may be too poor.,Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
4,13800,The strategy was therefore to optimise the process using pure glycerol and compare the performance with by-product glycerol.,Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
5,13800,"To test catalyst degradation caused by carbon deposition, a Solid Oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was used as a separate reformer and electrical performance was measured to indicate carbon deposition.",Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
6,13800,This is the first time a SOFC has been run on glycerol.,Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
7,13800,The results showed that thermodynamic theory can be used to predict reformer performance.,Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
8,13800,At high temperatures high gas yield can be reached (almost 100%) and selectivities of 70% (dry basis) obtained.,Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
9,13800,"The optimum conditions for glycerol reforming were 860 degrees C temperature (maximum tested), 0.12 mols/min glycerol flow per kg of catalyst and 2.5 steam/carbon ratio.",Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
10,13800,"Reforming catalysts lasted for several days of continuous operation with minimal degradation, 0.4% of feed deposited.",Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
11,13800,"By-product glycerol performed slightly worse with a lower yield and more carbon deposition, 2% of feed.",Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
12,13800,The results show that glycerol steam reforming is a viable alternative use for glycerol and potentially a better option than purification.,Steam reforming of biodiesel by-product to make renewable hydrogen,10.1016/j.biortech.2007.10.003
