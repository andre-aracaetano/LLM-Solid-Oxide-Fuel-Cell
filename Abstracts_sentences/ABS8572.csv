1,8572,The electrochemical behavior of a porous electrode based on Pr2CuO4 (PCO) screen printed on the surface of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) solid electrolyte is studied by impedance spectroscopy.,The effect of temperature and oxygen partial pressure on the reduction mechanism in the Pr2CuO4/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 system,10.1134/S1023193513080120
2,8572,The rate-determining stages of the oxygen reduction reaction at the PCO/CGO interface are found for the oxygen partial pressure interval of 30-10(5) Pa and temperatures of 773-1173 K. Changeover of the rate-determining stage of electrode reaction is shown to occur depending on the temperature and the oxygen partial pressure.,The effect of temperature and oxygen partial pressure on the reduction mechanism in the Pr2CuO4/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 system,10.1134/S1023193513080120
3,8572,The PCO electrode polarization resistance is 1.7 Omega cm(2) at 973 K in air and remains constant at thermocycling of the electrochemical cell in the temperature range of 773-1173 K.,The effect of temperature and oxygen partial pressure on the reduction mechanism in the Pr2CuO4/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 system,10.1134/S1023193513080120
4,8572,"Based on the found data, PCO can be considered as the promising cathodic material for solid-oxide fuel cells operating at moderate temperatures (773-973 K).",The effect of temperature and oxygen partial pressure on the reduction mechanism in the Pr2CuO4/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 system,10.1134/S1023193513080120
