1,17963,"Ceramic-metal and ceramic-ceramic functionally graded materials (FGMs) show promise for hypothesised applications such as thermoelectric converters, graded solid oxide fuel cells, graded piezoelectrics, electrically insulating joints, heatsinks for fusion reactors, and thermal barrier skins for lightweight spaceplanes.",Functionally graded electrical/thermal ceramic systems,10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00165-0
2,17963,"Most research has focussed either on FGM films (microns across), or modelling of hypothetical FGMs.",Functionally graded electrical/thermal ceramic systems,10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00165-0
3,17963,"Large bulk-FGMs with continuous (not layered) gradients are ideal for the above listed applications, however existing bulk-FGM powder-processing technologies give little gradient control and slow processing throughputs.",Functionally graded electrical/thermal ceramic systems,10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00165-0
