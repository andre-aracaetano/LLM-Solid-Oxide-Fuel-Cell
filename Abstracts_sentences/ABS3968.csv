1,3968,The environmental benefits of fuel cells have been increasingly appreciated in recent years.,Proton trapping in yttrium-doped barium zirconate,10.1038/NMAT3638
2,3968,"Among candidate electrolytes for solid-oxide fuel cells, yttrium-doped barium zirconate has garnered attention because of its high proton conductivity, particularly in the intermediate-temperature region targeted for cost-effective solid-oxide fuel cell operation, and its excellent chemical stability.",Proton trapping in yttrium-doped barium zirconate,10.1038/NMAT3638
3,3968,"However, fundamental questions surrounding the defect chemistry and macroscopic proton transport mechanism of this material remain, especially in regard to the possible role of proton trapping.",Proton trapping in yttrium-doped barium zirconate,10.1038/NMAT3638
4,3968,"Here we show, through a combined thermogravimetric and a.c. impedance study, that macroscopic proton transport in yttrium-doped barium zirconate is limited by proton-dopant association (proton trapping).",Proton trapping in yttrium-doped barium zirconate,10.1038/NMAT3638
5,3968,"Protons must overcome the association energy, 29 kJ mol(-1), as well as the general activation energy, 16 kJ mol(-1), to achieve long-range transport.",Proton trapping in yttrium-doped barium zirconate,10.1038/NMAT3638
6,3968,"Proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies show the presence of two types of proton environment above room temperature, reflecting differences in proton-dopant configurations.",Proton trapping in yttrium-doped barium zirconate,10.1038/NMAT3638
7,3968,This insight motivates efforts to identify suitable alternative dopants with reduced association energies as a route to higher conductivities.,Proton trapping in yttrium-doped barium zirconate,10.1038/NMAT3638
