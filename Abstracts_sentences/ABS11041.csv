1,11041,The low temperature aerosol deposition of LSGMC electrolyte and LSCF cathodes on NiO-GDC anodes is developed to minimize reactions between electrolyte and anode during cell fabrication.,"Effects of annealing temperature on solid oxide fuel cells containing (La,Sr) (Ga,Mg,Co)O3-δ electrolyte prepared by aerosol deposition",10.1016/j.matlet.2011.11.103
2,11041,"Annealing of the resulting structure is tested at 1000 and 1200 degrees C, secondary phase formation, Ni-diffusion, and electrochemical behavior are compared with those of an unannealed cell.","Effects of annealing temperature on solid oxide fuel cells containing (La,Sr) (Ga,Mg,Co)O3-δ electrolyte prepared by aerosol deposition",10.1016/j.matlet.2011.11.103
3,11041,"The peak power density of the unannealed cell is 0.90 W.cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, this increases to 1.15 W.cm(-2) with annealing at 1000 degrees C, probably due to enhanced ionic conductivity of the LSGMC by grain growth, and decreases to 0.31 W.cm(-2) with annealing at 1200 degrees C, representative of temperatures during conventional cell fabrication, due to a reduction of OCV by severe Ni diffusion and increased electronic conductivity.","Effects of annealing temperature on solid oxide fuel cells containing (La,Sr) (Ga,Mg,Co)O3-δ electrolyte prepared by aerosol deposition",10.1016/j.matlet.2011.11.103
