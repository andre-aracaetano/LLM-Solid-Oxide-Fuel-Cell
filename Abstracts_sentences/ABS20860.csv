7,20860,"% H2O are significantly increased above the level of the ASC, demonstrating an initial peak power density ranging from 280 to 1638 mW cm(-2) at temperatures between 600 and 800 degrees C and a stable power density of 485 mW cm(-2) at 500 mA cm(-2) and 800 degrees C for 48 h. Carbon deposition in the anode region of the tested CASC cell is not detected, as the NCF-BZCYYb is a more active catalyst than the Ni-(Zr0.92Y008O2-delta)-O-.",Carbon-resistant Ni-Zr0.92Y0.08O2-δ supported solid oxide fuel cells using Ni-Cu-Fe alloy cermet as on-cell reforming catalyst and mixed methane-steam as fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.11.029
