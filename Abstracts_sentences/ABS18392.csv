3,18392,"In this paper, experimental results on the kinetics of the deposition by the EVD method of dense zirconia-yttria layers on porous alpha-alumina substrates are presented, and compared with theoretical models.",KINETICS OF THE EVD PROCESS FOR GROWING THIN ZIRCONIA YTTRIA FILMS ON POROUS ALUMINA SUBSTRATES,10.1051/jp4:1993307
4,18392,The experimental work concerns mainly the effect of temperature on the growth rate of the EVD film.,KINETICS OF THE EVD PROCESS FOR GROWING THIN ZIRCONIA YTTRIA FILMS ON POROUS ALUMINA SUBSTRATES,10.1051/jp4:1993307
5,18392,"At 1000-degrees-C, layer growth occurs linear with time under current process conditions; in this case diffusion of the oxygen source reactant in the substrate pores is the rate limiting step for the EVD process.",KINETICS OF THE EVD PROCESS FOR GROWING THIN ZIRCONIA YTTRIA FILMS ON POROUS ALUMINA SUBSTRATES,10.1051/jp4:1993307
6,18392,"Between 900-degrees-C and 1000-degrees-C the growth rate limitation changes to the electrochemical transport through the film, which is parabolic with time.",KINETICS OF THE EVD PROCESS FOR GROWING THIN ZIRCONIA YTTRIA FILMS ON POROUS ALUMINA SUBSTRATES,10.1051/jp4:1993307
7,18392,This behaviour is predicted by the theoretical model.,KINETICS OF THE EVD PROCESS FOR GROWING THIN ZIRCONIA YTTRIA FILMS ON POROUS ALUMINA SUBSTRATES,10.1051/jp4:1993307
