1,7506,K2NiF4 structured La2Co0.8Ni0.2O4+delta is an oxygen overstoichiometric oxide with high oxygen diffusion and oxygen surface exchange coefficients at temperature range 450-800 degrees C.,K2NiF4 type La2-xSrxCo0.8Ni0.2O4+δ as the cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.11.033
2,7506,"In this work, composites consisting of La2-xSrxCo0.8Ni0.2O4+delta (LSCN, x=O, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6) and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) have been investigated as the cathodes for low-and-intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",K2NiF4 type La2-xSrxCo0.8Ni0.2O4+δ as the cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.11.033
3,7506,"AC impedance spectroscopy on symmetric cells indicated that among the series of LSCN-GDC composites, La1.2Sr0.8Co0.8Ni0.2O4+delta-based electrode had the lowest interfacial polarization resistance, which was 1.36 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C when the electrode was not activated.",K2NiF4 type La2-xSrxCo0.8Ni0.2O4+δ as the cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.11.033
4,7506,Significant activation effect was observed with a single cell when current treatment was performed at 200 mA cm(-2) within 30 min.,K2NiF4 type La2-xSrxCo0.8Ni0.2O4+δ as the cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.11.033
5,7506,The single cell with La1.2Sr0.8Co0.8Ni0.2O4+delta-GDC as the cathode generated power density up to 350mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C.,K2NiF4 type La2-xSrxCo0.8Ni0.2O4+δ as the cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.11.033
6,7506,"In addition, the performance was pretty stable when a constant output voltage of 0.5 V was set for 36 h. These results suggest that La2-xSrxCo0.8Ni0.2O4+delta could be promising materials as the cathodes for SOFCs that operated at low-and-intennediate temperatures.",K2NiF4 type La2-xSrxCo0.8Ni0.2O4+δ as the cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.11.033
