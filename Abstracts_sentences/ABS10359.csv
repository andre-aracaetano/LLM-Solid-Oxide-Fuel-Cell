1,10359,Thin-film solid-oxide fuel cells (TF-SOFCs) fabricated using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) processing techniques not only help lower the cell operating temperature but also provide a convenient platform for studying cathodic losses.,MEMS-based thin-film solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/mrs.2014.171
2,10359,"Utilizing these platforms, cathode kinetics can be enhanced dramatically by engineering the microstructure of the cathode/electrolyte interface by increasing the surface grain-boundary density.",MEMS-based thin-film solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/mrs.2014.171
3,10359,Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies have shown that oxygen exchange at electrolyte surface grain boundaries is facilitated by a high population of oxide-ion vacancies segregating preferentially to the grain boundaries.,MEMS-based thin-film solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/mrs.2014.171
4,10359,"Furthermore, three-dimensional structuring of TF-SOFCs enabled by various lithography methods also helps increase the active surface area and enhance the surface exchange reaction.",MEMS-based thin-film solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/mrs.2014.171
5,10359,"Although their practical prospects are yet to be verified, MEMS-based TF-SOFC platforms hold the potential to provide high-performance for low-temperature SOFC applications.",MEMS-based thin-film solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/mrs.2014.171
