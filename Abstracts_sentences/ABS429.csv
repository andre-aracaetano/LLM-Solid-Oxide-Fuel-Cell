1,429,"To verify the feasibility of applying Taguchi method to fuel cell simulation, an SOFC cathode optimization experiment is purposely designed based on a validated solid oxide fuel cell model.",Feasibility analysis of applying Taguchi method to fuel cell simulation,10.1002/er.7497
2,429,"It is found that (a) the maximum power densities with and without the Taguchi method are 6144.7 and 6157.8 W/m(2), respectively, which proves that the optimal results with the Taguchi method are reliable; (b) the use of the Taguchi method may lead to deviations in conclusions related to less influential factors, thus more attention should be paid to these factors.",Feasibility analysis of applying Taguchi method to fuel cell simulation,10.1002/er.7497
