1,9177,The major degradation issues of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are associated with the Cr2O3 scale growth and Cr diffusion of the Cr-based ferritic stainless steel (FSS) interconnects.,"Highly dense (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel protective coating derived from Mn-Co metal precursors for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.129
2,9177,"Although (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 has been proved as a suitable material for protecting FSS interconnects, the porous structure of the coatings prepared with the pre-synthesized spinel weakens the protective capability of the coatings.","Highly dense (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel protective coating derived from Mn-Co metal precursors for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.129
3,9177,"In this paper, the widely-used pre-synthesized spinel is replaced with metal precursors (Mn and Co powders).","Highly dense (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel protective coating derived from Mn-Co metal precursors for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.129
4,9177,"Due to the low melting point (<= 1290 degrees C) and the volume expansion during oxidation, the metal precursors, can be effectively sintered at 900 degrees C in a reducing atmosphere and form dense, wellprotective coatings at 850 degrees C in the air.","Highly dense (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel protective coating derived from Mn-Co metal precursors for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.129
5,9177,"The samples are characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and a 4-probe area-specific resistance (ASR) test.","Highly dense (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel protective coating derived from Mn-Co metal precursors for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.129
6,9177,"Compared with the coatings derived from pre-synthesized spinel, the metal-derived coatings present denser structures with better electrical conductivity (ASR = 5.76 m Omega cm(2)).","Highly dense (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel protective coating derived from Mn-Co metal precursors for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.129
7,9177,"The weight gain and ASR measurement results indicate that the metal-derived coatings significantly mitigate the increase of weight gain and ASR by inhibiting scale formation and growth, showing better protective capability for SOFC applications.","Highly dense (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel protective coating derived from Mn-Co metal precursors for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.129
