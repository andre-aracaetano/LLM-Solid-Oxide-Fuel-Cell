1,17344,La2NiO4+delta (LNO) impregnated La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Ni0.2O3-delta (LSCN) oxygen electrodes were prepared and investigated under solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) operation conditions.,Enhanced performance and stability of La2NiO4+δ impregnated La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ oxygen electrodes for solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.12.115
2,17344,Electrochemical results indicate that impregnating LNO into LSCN scaffold twice makes electrodes with desirable performance because LNO-LSCN oxygen electrodes take advantages of both the excellent oxygen surface exchange property of LNO and the high electronic conductivity of LSCN.,Enhanced performance and stability of La2NiO4+δ impregnated La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ oxygen electrodes for solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.12.115
3,17344,The stability test of half cells shows that LNO-LSCN oxygen electrodes undergo less performance degradation than that of LNO oxygen electrodes after anodic polarization at 500mA cm(-2) and 750 degrees C in air for 20 h. LNO-LSCN oxygen electrodes show high stability because performance degradation related to both LSCN scaffold and LNO shell are inhibited by the structure built by solution impregnation.,Enhanced performance and stability of La2NiO4+δ impregnated La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Ni0.2O3-δ oxygen electrodes for solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.12.115
