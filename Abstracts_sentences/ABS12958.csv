3,12958,The impedance responses show two separable arcs and are analysed in terms of two different equivalent circuits with comparable information on the electrode processes at high and low frequencies.,"Electrode behaviour at (La,Sr)MnO3/Y2O3-ZrO2 interface by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00259-8
4,12958,"The electrode process associated with the high-frequency arc is essentially independent of O-2 partial pressure with an activation energy of similar to74 kJ mol(-1), while that at the low-frequency arc has an activation energy of similar to202 kJ mol(-1) and a reaction order with respect to O-2 partial pressure of similar to0.5 at low temperatures and similar to0.85 at high temperatures.","Electrode behaviour at (La,Sr)MnO3/Y2O3-ZrO2 interface by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00259-8
