1,15432,A new synthesis method of using dehydration of sugar (sucrose) with concentrated sulfuric acid was developed to synthesize mixed oxide ceramic particles with flaky shape.,Synthesis of Flake-Shaped NiO-YSZ Particles for High-Porosity Anode of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04835.x
2,15432,"The anode disks prepared from flake-shaped NiO-YSZ particles without a pore-forming additive exhibited uniform dispersion of NiO and YSZ and a high porosity (45.6%), leading to improved cell performance as compared with an anode prepared from conventional NiO-YSZ powder in Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSM single cells operated with H-2 as the fuel; their maximum power densities were 381 and 300 mW.cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, respectively.",Synthesis of Flake-Shaped NiO-YSZ Particles for High-Porosity Anode of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04835.x
