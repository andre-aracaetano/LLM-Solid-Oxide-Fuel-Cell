1,6771,Lanthanum strontium cobalt ferum (LSCF) with addition of copper oxide (CuO) can serve as an alternate cathode material in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC) due to its strong catalytic activity for oxygen reduction process at intermediate temperatures and great chemical compatibility.,Physiochemical and Electrochemical Properties of Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferum-Copper (II) Oxide Prepared via Solid State Reaction,10.21315/jps2022.33.3.7
2,6771,This study was done to determine the viability of LSCF-CuO composite as a material for the IT-SOFC cathode.,Physiochemical and Electrochemical Properties of Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferum-Copper (II) Oxide Prepared via Solid State Reaction,10.21315/jps2022.33.3.7
3,6771,The cathode powder was synthesised using the conventional solid-state process at intermediate temperatures range (600 degrees C-900 degrees C).,Physiochemical and Electrochemical Properties of Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferum-Copper (II) Oxide Prepared via Solid State Reaction,10.21315/jps2022.33.3.7
4,6771,"The thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that when LSCF was calcined at temperatures over 600 degrees C, the weight loss curve flattened.",Physiochemical and Electrochemical Properties of Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferum-Copper (II) Oxide Prepared via Solid State Reaction,10.21315/jps2022.33.3.7
5,6771,"In the meantime, x-ray diffraction revealed that the perovskite structure of LSCF-CuO was completely formed after calcined at 800 degrees C. Moreover, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and scanning electron microscope investigations demonstrated that as the calcination temperature rose, the LSCF-CuO particles tended to grow.",Physiochemical and Electrochemical Properties of Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferum-Copper (II) Oxide Prepared via Solid State Reaction,10.21315/jps2022.33.3.7
6,6771,The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy investigation revealed polarisation resistance of samples calcined at 800 degrees C (0.41 Omega cm(2)) was significantly lower than that of samples calcined at 600 degrees C (29.57 Omega cm(2)).,Physiochemical and Electrochemical Properties of Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferum-Copper (II) Oxide Prepared via Solid State Reaction,10.21315/jps2022.33.3.7
7,6771,"Judging from chemical, physical and electrochemical properties, it is evidence that LSCF-CuO prepared via simple solid-state reaction has a potential to be used as cathode material for IT-SOFC.",Physiochemical and Electrochemical Properties of Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferum-Copper (II) Oxide Prepared via Solid State Reaction,10.21315/jps2022.33.3.7
