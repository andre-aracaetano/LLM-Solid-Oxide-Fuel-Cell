2,12791,But a great deal of problems associated with SOFC is needed to be solved before it can find commercial application.,Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.100
3,12791,The relatively high operating temperature of 800-1000 degrees C of SOFC imposes a stringent requirement on materials that significantly increases the cost of SOFC technology.,Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.100
4,12791,"Reducing the operating temperature of an SOFC to below 800 degrees C can reduce degradation of cell components, improve flexibility in cell design, and lower the material and manufacturing cost by the use of cheap and readily available materials such as ferritic stainless steel.",Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.100
5,12791,"The operating temperature can be reduced by two possible approaches: (i) developing alternative electrolyte materials with high ionic conductivity at lower temperature, and (ii) developing much thinner and denser electrolyte layer such that the ohmic losses are minimised.",Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.100
6,12791,In this work we report the use of inexpensive Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique in making about 10 micron thin and dense YSZ electrolyte on NiO-YSZ substrate.,Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.100
7,12791,"The effect of different operating parameters such as applied voltage, deposition time etc have been optimised during deposition from YSZ suspension in acetylacetone.",Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.100
8,12791,The YSZ/NiO-YSZ bi-layers were then co-sintered at 1450 degrees C for 5 h.,Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.100
9,12791,The single SOFC cells were then fabricated by brush painting LSM:YSZ (50:50) paste on the electrolyte layer followed by sintering at 1200 degrees C for 2 h.,Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.100
10,12791,"The single SOFC cell when tested using H(2) as fuel and ambient air as oxidant exhibited an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.03 V and the peak power density of about 624 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C.
