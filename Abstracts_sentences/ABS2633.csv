1,2633,"The chemical reactivity between superconducting ceramic materials (YBa2Cu3O7-x, Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and Bi2Sr2CuO6+x and the cathode material of solid oxide fuel cells (La0.65Sr0.3MnO3) was investigated by long-term annealing experiments of pressed powder mixtures lasting two weeks at 850 degreesC. The chemical properties at the operating temperature of a solid oxide fuel cell revealed that all three superconducting materials reacted with La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 and underwent changes in Volume and density after annealing.",High-temperature superconductor materials for contact layers in solid oxide fuel cells:: II.: Chemical properties at operating temperatures,10.1016/S1359-6454(01)00111-2
