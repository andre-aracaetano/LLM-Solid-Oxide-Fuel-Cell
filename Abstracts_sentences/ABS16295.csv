1,16295,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a promising technology for generating electricity and heat with high efficiency and environmental friendliness.,Hydrogen and power generation via integrated bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell systems: Economic feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.172
2,16295,The use of a bio-oil as a renewable and low-cost feedstock for an external reforming SOFC system can reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.,Hydrogen and power generation via integrated bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell systems: Economic feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.172
3,16295,"From a technical perspective, high-purity hydrogen (H-2) for SOFCs can be produced from the sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SESR).",Hydrogen and power generation via integrated bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell systems: Economic feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.172
4,16295,"In this study, an economic analysis of a bio-oil SESR and SOFC integrated system (160 kW alternating current electricity production) is performed to evaluate the feasibility of the designed process.",Hydrogen and power generation via integrated bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell systems: Economic feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.172
5,16295,"An economic comparison of the systems with different configurations, i.e., SESR-SOFC integrated systems with and without anode gas recirculation and a conventional reforming-based SOFC system (CON-SOFC), is presented in terms of their net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE).",Hydrogen and power generation via integrated bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell systems: Economic feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.172
6,16295,"According to the results, the SESR-SOFC system with anode gas recirculation is more favorable than the CON-SOFC system and SESR-SOFC system without recirculation.",Hydrogen and power generation via integrated bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell systems: Economic feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.172
7,16295,"Nevertheless, it remains economically infeasible because its NPC in the 20th year is approximately 6.13% higher than that of the combined heat and power (CHP) system (a base case).",Hydrogen and power generation via integrated bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell systems: Economic feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.172
8,16295,"However, it can attain economic equivalence with the CHP system when a carbon tax of at least $15 t(CO2)(-1) is considered or when the SOFC capital cost, interest rate, and bio-oil cost are separately reduced by 14%, 21%, and 37%, respectively.",Hydrogen and power generation via integrated bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell systems: Economic feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.172
9,16295,"In addition, an increase in feed-in tariff has the highest impact on the NPC reduction of the renewable bio-oil SESR-SOFC integrated system with recirculation.",Hydrogen and power generation via integrated bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell systems: Economic feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.172
