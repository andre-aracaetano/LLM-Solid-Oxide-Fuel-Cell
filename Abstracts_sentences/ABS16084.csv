1,16084,Hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) mechanisms on a novel perovskite anode with a nominal composition of La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-delta (LSFCr-3) were systematically investigated for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications.,New Insight into Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ Perovskite as a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode,10.1149/2.1571704jes
2,16084,"In terms of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study of LSFCr-3-based half cells in various applied DC bias, hydrogen (pH2) and water vapor partial pressure (pH(2)O), the HOR on the LSFCr-3 perovskite was suggested to be rate-limited by the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen.",New Insight into Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ Perovskite as a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode,10.1149/2.1571704jes

5,16084,"This finding is explained by the hydration of surface oxygen vacancies, that formed more active oxygen anions sites.",New Insight into Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ Perovskite as a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode,10.1149/2.1571704jes
6,16084,"Under humid reducing atmosphere, the exact composition of the bulk of the LSFCr-3 is estimated to be La0.34Sr0.67Fe0.73+Cr0.293+O2.65 at 800 degrees C. On the surface of the LSFCr-3 anode, the average oxidation state of B-site cations (Fe and Cr) is found to be lower than that in the bulk, resulting in a presence of Cr3+, Fe2+ and Fe3+.",New Insight into Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ Perovskite as a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode,10.1149/2.1571704jes
7,16084,"Cr3+ on the surface contributes to holding more active oxygen anions for the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen, due to its backbone action in the perovskite lattice structure.",New Insight into Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ Perovskite as a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode,10.1149/2.1571704jes
