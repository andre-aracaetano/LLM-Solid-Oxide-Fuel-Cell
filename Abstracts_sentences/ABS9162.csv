1,9162,"This study reports the high temperature oxidation kinetics, area specific resistance (ASR), and interfacial microstructure of metallic interconnects coated by (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 (LSM) in air atmosphere at 800 degrees C. An efficient LSM conductive layer was fabricated on metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by using a wet spray coating method.",Characteristic of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.98MnO3 coating on Crofer22APU used as metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.093
2,9162,The optimum conditions for slurries used in the wet spray coating were determined by the measurement of slurry viscosity and coated surface morphology.,Characteristic of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.98MnO3 coating on Crofer22APU used as metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.093

4,9162,The adhesive strength of the interface between the coated layer and the metal substrate increased with increased surface roughness of the metallic interconnects.,Characteristic of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.98MnO3 coating on Crofer22APU used as metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.093
5,9162,"The electrical conductivities of the coated substrates were measured by using a DC two-point and four-wire method under air atmosphere at 800 degrees C. Of note, the Crofer22APU treated at 1100 degrees C in N-2 with 10 vol.% H-2 showed long-term stability and a lower ASR value than other samples(heat-treated at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C).",Characteristic of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.98MnO3 coating on Crofer22APU used as metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.093
6,9162,"After an 8000-h oxidation experiment the coated Crofer22APU substrate, the ASR showed a low value of 23 m Omega cm(2).",Characteristic of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.98MnO3 coating on Crofer22APU used as metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.093
7,9162,"The thickness of the coated conductive oxide layer was about 10-20 mu m. These results show that a coated oxide layer prevents the formation and the growth of scale (Cr2O3 and (Mn, Cr, Fe)(3)O-4 layer) and enhances the long-term stability and electrical performance of metallic interconnects for SOFCs.",Characteristic of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.98MnO3 coating on Crofer22APU used as metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.093
