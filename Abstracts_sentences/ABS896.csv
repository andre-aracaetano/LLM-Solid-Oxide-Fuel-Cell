4,896,It is found that the addition of Fe2O3 can make GDC barrier layer denser at a reduced sintering temperature of 1250 & DEG;C and prevent diffusion of Sr to form ionic insulating interface between YSZ (Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d (LSCF).,The effect of Fe2O3 sintering aid on Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 diffusion barrier layer and solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.004
5,896,The fuel cell based on the GDC-Fe2O3 barrier layer achieves better maximum power density of 0.89 W cm-2 at 800 & DEG;C than that of 0.68 W cm-2 without Fe2O3 addition.,The effect of Fe2O3 sintering aid on Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 diffusion barrier layer and solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.004
6,896,No obvious degradation was observed on fuel cell based on the GDC-Fe2O3 diffusion barrier layer after a stability test at 750 & DEG;C for 100 h under 0.75 V and the thermal cycling between 750 and 400 & DEG;C. The results indicate that the addition of Fe2O3 sintering aid in GDC diffusion barrier layer can promote the densification of GDC and exhibit good long-term stability and thermal cycle stability. & COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.,The effect of Fe2O3 sintering aid on Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 diffusion barrier layer and solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.004
