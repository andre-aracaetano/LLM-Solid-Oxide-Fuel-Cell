4,14214,"Dense LSGM with a thickness of about 60 mu m and a conductivity of about 0.053 S/cm at 800 degrees C shows a good gas tightness and gives an open circuit voltage value > 1 V. The sprayed LSCo cathode with a thickness of 10-20 mu m and a porosity of about 25% keeps the right phase structure and good porous network microstructure for conducting electrons and negative oxygen ions after plasma spraying and heat treatment at about 1000 degrees C for 1 h. A maximum output power density of the sprayed cell achieved 365 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C, 250 mW/cm(2) at 750 degrees C, and 180 mW/cm(2) at 700 degrees C.",Plasma-Sprayed YSZ/Ni-LSGM-LSCo Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02294.x
5,14214,The results show that the use of APS cell allowed the reduction of the operating temperature to below 750 degrees C.,Plasma-Sprayed YSZ/Ni-LSGM-LSCo Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02294.x
