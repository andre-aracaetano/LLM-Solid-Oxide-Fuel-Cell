1,5698,"In this work, the performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) consisting of Cu, Sn and Rh impregnated NiO/CGO91 anode is investigated for butane internal reforming mode at an intermediate terriperature (600 degrees C).","Performance analysis of Cu, Sn and Rh impregnated NiO/CGO91 anode for butane internal reforming SOFC at intermediate temperature",10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.070
2,5698,Steam reforming activities of Ni and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 (CGO91) and Ni and Y0.08Zr0.92O2 (8YSZ) are tested as anode materials of internal reforming SOFC.,"Performance analysis of Cu, Sn and Rh impregnated NiO/CGO91 anode for butane internal reforming SOFC at intermediate temperature",10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.070
3,5698,"In butane steam reforming, NiO/CGO91 shows better performance than NiO/8YSZ.","Performance analysis of Cu, Sn and Rh impregnated NiO/CGO91 anode for butane internal reforming SOFC at intermediate temperature",10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.070
4,5698,"However, butane is incomplete converted over NiO/CGO91 even if the gas hourly space velocity is very low.","Performance analysis of Cu, Sn and Rh impregnated NiO/CGO91 anode for butane internal reforming SOFC at intermediate temperature",10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.070
5,5698,"Cu, Sn and Rh are added to the NiO/CGO91 materials to increase the conversion of butane.","Performance analysis of Cu, Sn and Rh impregnated NiO/CGO91 anode for butane internal reforming SOFC at intermediate temperature",10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.070
6,5698,"Among the additives, the Rh is the most effective, resulting in 100% of butane conversion and no carbon deposition.","Performance analysis of Cu, Sn and Rh impregnated NiO/CGO91 anode for butane internal reforming SOFC at intermediate temperature",10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.070
7,5698,"Moreover, Rh added NiO/CGO91 SOFC single cell have a very low degradation rate when the SOFC sing cell is operated in internal reforming mode using butane.","Performance analysis of Cu, Sn and Rh impregnated NiO/CGO91 anode for butane internal reforming SOFC at intermediate temperature",10.1016/j.renene.2015.04.070
