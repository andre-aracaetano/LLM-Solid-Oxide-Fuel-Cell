1,3601,"In the present work, a two-dimensional model is used to evaluate the voltage distribution of a flat tube segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell (FTS-SOFC) including a fuel channel, an anode, a cathode and an electrolyte layer.",Influence of structure size on voltage uniformity of flat tubular segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228092
2,3601,"The results indicate that when the other cell dimensions are fixed, the anode length of 5 mm gives the highest maximum power density for the FTS-SOFC.",Influence of structure size on voltage uniformity of flat tubular segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228092
3,3601,"By changing the anode length of single cell of FTS-SOFC, the voltage uniformity can be significantly improved, which avoids the low voltage of single cell in the downstream, and provides effective design suggestions for the development and industrialization of FTS-SOFC.",Influence of structure size on voltage uniformity of flat tubular segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228092
