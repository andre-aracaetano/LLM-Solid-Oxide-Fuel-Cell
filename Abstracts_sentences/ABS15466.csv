1,15466,"The present study investigated the role of the reactive-element effect (REE) in improving the corrosion resistance, chromium vaporization rate, and electrical conductivity of the Fe-25Cr ferritic steel modified either by means of yttrium implantation or chemical deposition of yttrium oxide from metaloorganic compound vapors.",Improving the Physicochemical Properties of Fe-25Cr Ferritic Steel for SOFC Interconnects via Y-Implantation and Y2O3-Deposition,10.1007/s11085-012-9345-z
2,15466,"The corrosion kinetics of the Fe-25Cr steel, both pure and modified, were determined under isothermal conditions in air and an Ar-H-2-H2O gas mixture at 1,073 K. A significant improvement in corrosion resistance was observed after surface modification.",Improving the Physicochemical Properties of Fe-25Cr Ferritic Steel for SOFC Interconnects via Y-Implantation and Y2O3-Deposition,10.1007/s11085-012-9345-z
3,15466,XRD and SEM-EDS investigations showed that the protective Cr2O3 layer formed the main part of the scale.,Improving the Physicochemical Properties of Fe-25Cr Ferritic Steel for SOFC Interconnects via Y-Implantation and Y2O3-Deposition,10.1007/s11085-012-9345-z
4,15466,Measurements of Cr vaporization rate in the air-H2O gas mixture revealed that both surface modifications of the steel significantly suppressed the formation of volatile chromium compounds to a large degree.,Improving the Physicochemical Properties of Fe-25Cr Ferritic Steel for SOFC Interconnects via Y-Implantation and Y2O3-Deposition,10.1007/s11085-012-9345-z
5,15466,"The yttrium-implanted steels oxidized both in air and the Ar-H-2-H2O mixture were characterized by the lowest area specific resistance and thereby did not exceed the acceptable ASR level (0.1 Omega cm(2)) for interconnect materials in the temperature range of 973-1,073 K, unlike pure steel and the steel coated with Y2O3.",Improving the Physicochemical Properties of Fe-25Cr Ferritic Steel for SOFC Interconnects via Y-Implantation and Y2O3-Deposition,10.1007/s11085-012-9345-z
