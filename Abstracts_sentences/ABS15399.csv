1,15399,"Although the individual effects of airborne Cr and S contaminants on SOFC cathode performance degradation have been extensively studied, the combined effects of Cr and S contaminants remain largely unexplored.",Combined Cr and S poisoning behaviors of La1-xSrxMnO3±δ and La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147253
2,15399,"Under the real SOFC operating condition where the Cr and S species coexist, their effects may compete, affecting the poisoning behavior.",Combined Cr and S poisoning behaviors of La1-xSrxMnO3±δ and La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147253
3,15399,"Our investigation reveals that the combined Cr and S poisoning behavior of LSCF remains different from those of individual Cr and S poisonings, while the combined poisoning mechanism of LSM is equivalent to the sum of those of individual Cr and S effects.",Combined Cr and S poisoning behaviors of La1-xSrxMnO3±δ and La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147253
4,15399,"For LSCF electrode, gaseous Cr species are deposited mainly at the LSCF/GDC interface by electrochemical reduction, rather than forming SrCrO4 on LSCF surfaces (as in the case of Cr-only poisoning), indicating no reaction between Cr vapors and SrO on the LSCF surface.",Combined Cr and S poisoning behaviors of La1-xSrxMnO3±δ and La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147253
5,15399,"Thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the SrO on LSCF surface absorbs SO2 ((g)) and thereby loses the Cr-gettering effect, allowing Cr vapors to flow through LSCF and to reach the LSCF/GDC interface where the Cr deposition occurs.",Combined Cr and S poisoning behaviors of La1-xSrxMnO3±δ and La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147253
6,15399,"Unlike LSCF, LSM electrode shows cumulative effects of Cr and S, as Cr accumulation occurs at the triple-phase boundary and S absorption takes place at localized Sr-rich regions.",Combined Cr and S poisoning behaviors of La1-xSrxMnO3±δ and La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147253
