3,5918,"However, when methane is directly used, Ni-based cermet anode suffers from coking, which seriously affects the durability of the cell.",Ni-doped Ba0.9Zr0.8Y0.2O3-d as a methane dry reforming catalyst for direct CH4-CO2 solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.391
4,5918,"To alleviate the coking issue, a reforming layer outside the Ni-based anode-supporter was proposed in this study, and Ba0.9(Zr0.8Y0.2)1-xNixO3-$ (BZYNix, x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) was used as reforming layer material.",Ni-doped Ba0.9Zr0.8Y0.2O3-d as a methane dry reforming catalyst for direct CH4-CO2 solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.391
5,5918,"Among BZYNix catalysts, BZYNi0.2 exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward dry reforming of methane, and methane conversion was as high as 85% at 750 & DEG;C. The excellent catalytic durability and coking-resistance of BZYNi0.2 were also confirmed.",Ni-doped Ba0.9Zr0.8Y0.2O3-d as a methane dry reforming catalyst for direct CH4-CO2 solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.391
