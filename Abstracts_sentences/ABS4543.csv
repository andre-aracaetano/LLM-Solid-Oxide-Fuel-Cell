3,4543,"A relatively low thermal expansion coefficient (16.8 x 10(-6) degrees C-1) was obtained for the Ca-doped sample over the temperature range of 25-800 degrees C. Moreover, Ca doping significantly enhanced the electrochemical performance of NdBa1-xCaxCoCuO5+delta.",Enhanced electrochemical performance of Ca-doped NdBa1-xCaxCoCuO5+δ as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.301
4,4543,The highest densities of power for NdBa1-xCaxCoCuO5+delta-based single cells at the temperatures of 800 degrees C increased from 1.42 W cm(-2) for x = 0.0 to 1.84 W cm(-2) for x = 0.3.,Enhanced electrochemical performance of Ca-doped NdBa1-xCaxCoCuO5+δ as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.301
5,4543,This increase in electrochemical performance of NdBa1-xCaxCoCuO5+delta cathode with Ca doping can be ascribed to enhanced concentrations of oxygen vacancies and higher electrical conductivity.,Enhanced electrochemical performance of Ca-doped NdBa1-xCaxCoCuO5+δ as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.301
