2,7699,"The Sr-doped lanthanum manganite/yttria-stabilized zirconia electrodes with different pore structures were prepared, and their inner surfaces were modified with nano-scale Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.95-delta (SDC).",Comparative study of solid oxide fuel cells supported on ceramic cathodes with different pore structures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.163
3,7699,"The cell supported on the electrode with a straight pore structure demonstrated much higher maximum power densities than the one supported on the electrode with a tortuous pore structure, e.g., 652 vs 308 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Impedance analysis revealed that the straight pore structure together with SDC-modified pore surface not only promoted the surface oxygen exchange, but also enhanced the transport of oxygen species to the reaction sites and conduction of oxide ions and electrons in the electrode.",Comparative study of solid oxide fuel cells supported on ceramic cathodes with different pore structures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.163
