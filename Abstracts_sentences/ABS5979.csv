3,5979,"The software package for simulation is reliable through an accuracy comparison, and it analyzes the current density, temperature, and thermal stress distribution of a SOFC stack with 20 layers.",Effect of air flow rate distribution and flowing direction on the thermal stress of a solid oxide fuel cell stack with cross-flow configuration,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.12.014
4,5979,The results show that the progressively increasing profile of the air inlet flow rate along the x direction drops the cell thermal stress of a SOFC unit.,Effect of air flow rate distribution and flowing direction on the thermal stress of a solid oxide fuel cell stack with cross-flow configuration,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.12.014
5,5979,"Moreover, the non-uniform profile of air inlet flow rate in the stacking direction affects the position of the region with high thermal stress of the SOFC stack, and changing flow direction of the air obviously drops down the thermal stress without affecting the power generation of the SOFC stack.",Effect of air flow rate distribution and flowing direction on the thermal stress of a solid oxide fuel cell stack with cross-flow configuration,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.12.014
