3,5844,The reduction of the polarization resistance of a single cell that is applied to the anode functional layer is attributed to the increasing reaction of three-phase boundaries (TPBs) within the layer and the micro-structured uniformity in the electrode.,Applications of nano-composite materials for improving the performance of anode-supported electrolytes of SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.10.089
4,5844,"Two methods were used, namely tape-casting/dip-coating and tape-casting/co-firing, for studying the performance.",Applications of nano-composite materials for improving the performance of anode-supported electrolytes of SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.10.089
5,5844,It can be concluded that the cell with an anode functional layer thickness (15-20 mu m) and a microstructure of NiO-YSZ nano-composite materials which was fabricated by the tape-casting/dip-coating method improved the output power (to 1.3 W cm(-2)) at 800 degrees C using hydrogen as fuel and air as an oxidant.,Applications of nano-composite materials for improving the performance of anode-supported electrolytes of SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.10.089
