1,4137,High-performance Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta- Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (SFM-GDC) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been fabricated by low temperature co-sintering and wet impregnation techniques.,High-performance SOFCs with impregnated Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ anodes toward sulfur resistance,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.01.341
2,4137,Crackfree GDC electrolyte layer was obtained by sintering at low temperature of 1150 degrees C under Li2O sintering aid.,High-performance SOFCs with impregnated Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ anodes toward sulfur resistance,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.01.341
3,4137,"With impregnated SFM nano-catalyst, the cell polarization resistance is significantly reduced compared with that prepared by traditional physical mixing method.",High-performance SOFCs with impregnated Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ anodes toward sulfur resistance,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.01.341
4,4137,"Using Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-(delta) (BCFN) cathode, the maximum power densities of the as-prepared SOFCs can reach 445 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C when using H-2 as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.",High-performance SOFCs with impregnated Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ anodes toward sulfur resistance,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.01.341
5,4137,"In addition, the as-prepared SFM-GDC anode exhibits excellent sulfur tolerance toward H-2 with 100 ppm H2S. The relatively weak sulfur adsorption on surface and limited lattice interstitial sites within perovskite structure might be the possible sulfur tolerant mechanism of SFM anodes.",High-performance SOFCs with impregnated Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ anodes toward sulfur resistance,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.01.341
