7,11573,"The performance comparison between the two SOFC systems which provide the same net electrical efficiency indicates that the SOFC system with the membrane reactor requires a smaller SOFC stack than the conventional SOFC system; however, the former requires an extra cost on palladium membranes and extra electrical power for operating the compressor for the membrane reactor.",Performance analysis of methanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell system incorporated with palladium membrane reactor,10.1016/j.cej.2007.06.021
8,11573,The preliminary economic analysis reveals that the implementation of the membrane reactor to the SOFC system is not cost-effective due to high cost of palladium membranes.,Performance analysis of methanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell system incorporated with palladium membrane reactor,10.1016/j.cej.2007.06.021
9,11573,Finally it was indicated that the use of the palladium membrane reactor in the SOFC system is still technically attractive even when an SOFC cell with lower resistance can be further developed.,Performance analysis of methanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell system incorporated with palladium membrane reactor,10.1016/j.cej.2007.06.021
