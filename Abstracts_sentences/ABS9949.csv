1,9949,The changes with time of the residual stress on the electrolyte were measured in situ during re-oxidation under solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operation conditions using a segmented-in-series (SIS)-type SOFC and a conventional anode-supported planar (ASP)-type SOFC to understand the mechanical behaviour of the materials in the SOFC.,Residual stress change with time of a segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell using an in situ X-ray stress measuring method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.064
2,9949,"In situ X-ray residual stress measurement was successful, and the real-time change with time of the residual stress of the electrolyte was revealed under SOFC operating conditions.",Residual stress change with time of a segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell using an in situ X-ray stress measuring method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.064
3,9949,"In the ASP-type SOFC, the residual stress changed from compression to tensile stress, and destruction of the cell was confirmed 20 min after the air introduction.",Residual stress change with time of a segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell using an in situ X-ray stress measuring method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.064
4,9949,"In contrast, in the case of the SIS-type SOFC, the residual stress was almost constant, even when the anode material was exposed to oxidation conditions for more than 4 h. These results indicate that the SIS-type SOFC has a high tolerance against reduction and oxidation (redox) compared with the ASP-type SOFC, which requires a conductive support material with a high Ni content.",Residual stress change with time of a segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell using an in situ X-ray stress measuring method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.064
5,9949,This is because the SIS-type SOFC has an electrically insulated support material that does not require a high Ni content.,Residual stress change with time of a segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell using an in situ X-ray stress measuring method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.064
