1,13069,The changes in porosity and elastic moduli of YSZ-containing nickel-based anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells were studied as a function of the fraction of reduced NiO. Anode samples were reduced in a gas mixture of 4% hydrogen and 96% argon for different periods of time at 800degreesC and their Young's and shear moduli were determined afterward at room temperature using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy and impulse excitation.,Elastic properties of nickel-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells as a function of the fraction of reduced NiO,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2004.tb07499.x
2,13069,It was found that the magnitude of Young's and shear moduli decreased significantly with increasing fraction of reduced NiO and that the magnitude of the elastic moduli of a fully reduced Ni-YSZ anode was similar to45% lower than that of unreduced NiO-YSZ.,Elastic properties of nickel-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells as a function of the fraction of reduced NiO,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2004.tb07499.x
3,13069,"Because the elastic moduli of NiO are close to those of Ni, the observed decrease in the magnitude of the elastic moduli was found to be caused mainly by the significant increase in the porosity of the sample as a result of NiO reduction.",Elastic properties of nickel-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells as a function of the fraction of reduced NiO,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2004.tb07499.x
