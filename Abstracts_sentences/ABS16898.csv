1,16898,This study is the first to report the development of hydrogen-permeable metal support electrolysis cells (HMECs) bearing a heterojunction of H+-conducting BaZrxCe0.8-xY0.2O3-delta (BZCY) electrolyte and H-permeable Pd.,Development of Hydrogen-Permeable Metal Support Electrolysis Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c03313
2,16898,"The HMECs could conduct galvanostatic steam electrolysis at 0.15 A cm(-2); the HMECs maintained a voltage of similar to 1.2 V and achieved a Faradaic efficiency of similar to 80% at 500 degrees C, which are higher than the values predicted for H+-conducting ceramic electrolysis cells with porous cathodes and anodes.",Development of Hydrogen-Permeable Metal Support Electrolysis Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c03313
3,16898,The relatively high efficiency of HMECs could be attributed to a decrease in the hole carriers due to the defect thermodynamic equilibria near the BZCY/Pd heterointerface.,Development of Hydrogen-Permeable Metal Support Electrolysis Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c03313
