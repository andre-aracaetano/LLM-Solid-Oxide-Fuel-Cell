1,1616,A fuel cell-type microreactor that generates both hydrogen and electrical power from dry butane around 700 degreesC is presented for polymerelectrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) applications.,SOFC-type microreactors that generate hydrogen for PEFC applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.023
2,1616,"To demonstrate this concept, solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with different Fe2O3-based anodes were fabricated, and their performances were evaluated.",SOFC-type microreactors that generate hydrogen for PEFC applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.023
3,1616,A Fe2O3/Cr2O3 composite anode met this criterion the most; hydrogen was produced with increasing current density; CO2/CO concentration ratios in the outlet gases were more than 2; polarization resistances were about 1 Omega cm(2); carbon deposition was much more suppressed with these anodes than with a Ni/SDC cermet anode.,SOFC-type microreactors that generate hydrogen for PEFC applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.023
4,1616,The resulting peak power density was 110 mW cm(-2) by using a 0.25-mm-thick Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) electrolyte.,SOFC-type microreactors that generate hydrogen for PEFC applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.023
5,1616,The effect of Cr2O3 added into the Fe2O3 anode was also discussed in detail.,SOFC-type microreactors that generate hydrogen for PEFC applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.023
