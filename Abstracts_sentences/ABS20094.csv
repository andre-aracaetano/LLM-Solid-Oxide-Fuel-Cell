2,20094,"In this regard, a system is designed, consisting of three main subsystems such as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell, Anaerobic Digester, and a Heat Recovery Steam Generator.","Global warming, environmental and sustainability aspects of a geothermal energy based biodigester integrated SOFC system",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.224
3,20094,"In order to investigate the global warming, environmental and sustainability aspects of the system, the energy and exergy analyses are performed, and the following indicators are taken into consideration, which are i) unit CO2 emission, ii) environmental effect factor, iii) waste exergy ratio, iv) exergy destruction ratio, v) exergy recovery ratio, vi) exergetic sustainability index.","Global warming, environmental and sustainability aspects of a geothermal energy based biodigester integrated SOFC system",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.224
4,20094,"Accordingly, the maximum exergetic sustainability index and exergy efficiency of the integrated system are calculated to be 0.486 and 0.367, respectively, in case the SOFC inlet temperature is equal to 633.3 degrees C while electric current density is 5500 A/m(2).","Global warming, environmental and sustainability aspects of a geothermal energy based biodigester integrated SOFC system",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.224
5,20094,"On the other hand, the minimum exergy destruction ratio and the minimum environmental effect factor are obtained to be 0.74 and 2.33 while SOFC inlet temperature is 633.3 degrees C and SOFC current density is 8000 A/m(2).","Global warming, environmental and sustainability aspects of a geothermal energy based biodigester integrated SOFC system",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.224
6,20094,The minimum unit CO2 emission of the whole system is determined to be 368.4 kg/MWh at 5500 A/m(2) of SOFC current density and 727 degrees C of SOFC inlet temperature while determined as 258.3 kg/MWh at 8000 A/m(2) of SOFC current density and 680 degrees C of SOFC inlet temperature.,"Global warming, environmental and sustainability aspects of a geothermal energy based biodigester integrated SOFC system",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.224
7,20094,"Thus, it can be said that such a system may be applied for reducing the CO2 based global warming effects and improving the environmental sustainability.","Global warming, environmental and sustainability aspects of a geothermal energy based biodigester integrated SOFC system",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.224
