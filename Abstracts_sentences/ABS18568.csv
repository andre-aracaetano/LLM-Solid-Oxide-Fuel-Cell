1,18568,"The defect chemical nature and electronic band structure of Yb-doped BaPrO3 have been examined as a candidate for cathode materials in solid oxide fuel cell using oxide protonics material as a solid electrolyte, because of a possible presence of mixed conductivity of holes (electrons) and protons.",Proton incorporation and defect chemistry of Yb-doped BaPrO3,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.02.006
2,18568,The FT-IR results have shown that the proton concentration increases with the increase of dopant concentration.,Proton incorporation and defect chemistry of Yb-doped BaPrO3,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.02.006
3,18568,"The electrical conductivity measurements suggest that p-type conductivity dominates in both intrinsic and extrinsic regions, showing a linear increase of conductivity with the increase of dopant concentration.",Proton incorporation and defect chemistry of Yb-doped BaPrO3,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.02.006
4,18568,"The photoemission spectroscopy measurements have shown the presence of sub-band at the top of valence band, suggesting that the valence band is composed of O2p and Pr4f multiplet.",Proton incorporation and defect chemistry of Yb-doped BaPrO3,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.02.006
5,18568,These results can be explained by a simple defect chemical model assuming both auto-ionization of Pr4+/Pr3+ in the intrinsic region and the charge compensation for acceptor dopant of Yb3+ on normal Pr4+ site by holes in the extrinsic region.,Proton incorporation and defect chemistry of Yb-doped BaPrO3,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.02.006
