1,10904,"The recent development of solid oxide fuel cells is focused on a significant reduction in their operating temperature, from 850-1000 to 550-750 degreesC. One way to reach this goal is to reduce the thickness of the commonly used electrolyte, yttria stabilised zirconia, YSZ.","Yttria-doped zirconia thin films deposited by atomic layer deposition ALD:: a structural, morphological and electrical characterisation",10.1016/S0022-3697(03)00105-7
