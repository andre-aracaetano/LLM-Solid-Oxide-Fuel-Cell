2,11064,"Here, we describe a low-cost and environmentally friendly method for fabricating LSM ceramics via agar gel casting and high temperature sintering.",Fabrication of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite Ceramics via Agar Gel Casting and Solid State Sintering,10.3390/ma12060848
3,11064,"This new approach uses temperature tuning to fabricate LSM gel bodies, not only by manufacturing in the secondary process but also by remolding and recycling during the gel casting process.",Fabrication of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite Ceramics via Agar Gel Casting and Solid State Sintering,10.3390/ma12060848
4,11064,The effect of the sintering temperature on the properties of LSM ceramics was investigated as well.,Fabrication of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite Ceramics via Agar Gel Casting and Solid State Sintering,10.3390/ma12060848
5,11064,"As a result, the porosity and compressive strength of LSM ceramics sintered at 1000 degrees C are 60% and 5.6 MPa, respectively.",Fabrication of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite Ceramics via Agar Gel Casting and Solid State Sintering,10.3390/ma12060848
6,11064,"When the sintering temperature increases to 1200 degrees C, the porosity decreases to 28%, whereas the compressive strength increases to 25 MPa, which is able to meet the requirement of cathode-supported SOFCs (solid oxide fuel cells).",Fabrication of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite Ceramics via Agar Gel Casting and Solid State Sintering,10.3390/ma12060848
