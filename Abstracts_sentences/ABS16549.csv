1,16549,"At Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, a multi-component SOFC design based on planar stacks has been developed, in which all hot system components are scaled to a nominal SOFC stack power of 5 kW. To optimize the SOFC system it is necessary to investigate the effects of design and operating parameters on the system components like pre-reformer and afterburner.",Operational behavior and reforming kinetics over Ni/YSZ of a planar type pre-reformer for SOFC systems,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.02.140
