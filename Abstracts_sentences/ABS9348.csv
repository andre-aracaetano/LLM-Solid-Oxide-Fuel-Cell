2,9348,"Conduct at low temperatures is a key to developing further utilization, and an understanding of the structures that enable conduction is also important to gain insight into oxygen-diffusion pathways.",Anisotropic oxygen diffusion at low temperature in perovskite-structure iron oxides,10.1038/NCHEM.547
3,9348,"Here we report the structural changes observed when single-crystalline, epitaxial CaFeO2.5 thin films were changes into CaFeO2 by low-temperature reductions with CaH2.",Anisotropic oxygen diffusion at low temperature in perovskite-structure iron oxides,10.1038/NCHEM.547
4,9348,"During the reduction process from the brownmillerite CaFeO2.5 into the infinite-layer structure of CaFeO2, some of the oxygen atoms are released from and others are rearranged within the perovskite-structure framework.",Anisotropic oxygen diffusion at low temperature in perovskite-structure iron oxides,10.1038/NCHEM.547
5,9348,"We evaluated these changes and the reaction time they required, and found two oxygen diffusion pathways and the related kinetics at low temperature.",Anisotropic oxygen diffusion at low temperature in perovskite-structure iron oxides,10.1038/NCHEM.547
6,9348,"The results demonstrate that oxygen diffusion in the brownmillerite is highly anisotropic, significantly higher along the lateral direction of the tetrahedral and octahedral layers.",Anisotropic oxygen diffusion at low temperature in perovskite-structure iron oxides,10.1038/NCHEM.547
