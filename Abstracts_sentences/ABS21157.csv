7,21157,"The analysis of the ESD-CCO/CGO composition showed remarkable similarities with the screen-printed cathodes from the previous study, although a clear change in the magnitudes of the separate contributions (low-frequency redox, mid-frequency Gerischer and high-frequency diffusion) was observed.",E Electrostatic spray deposited Ca3Co4O9+δ and Ca3Co4O9+δ/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 cathodes for SOFC A comparative impedance analysis study,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137142

14,21157,"Considering the coral-like microstructure, the oxygen reaction at the electrode could be interpreted as slow oxygen dissociation and fast diffusion towards a more dense CCO layer at the electrolyte interface, followed by a fast oxygen exchange step at the CCO-layer/platelets + ambient interface.",E Electrostatic spray deposited Ca3Co4O9+δ and Ca3Co4O9+δ/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 cathodes for SOFC A comparative impedance analysis study,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137142
