3,6179,96% relative density was achieved for GYDC at sintering temperature of 800 degrees C with addition of 1.5 mol% LiNO3.,Fabrication of solid oxide fuel cell based on doped ceria electrolyte by one-step sintering at 800 °C,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.015
4,6179,The conductivities of GYDC with sintering aids LiNO3 were measured by a.c. impedance spectroscopy and showed comparable values to that of pure GYDC sample sintered at 1400 degrees C. A single cell with 1.5 mol% LiNO3 infiltrated GYDC electrolyte was fabricated by sintering at 800 degrees C for only 2 h. Lithiated NiO was synthesized by the glycine-nitrate combustion method and employed as cathode material.,Fabrication of solid oxide fuel cell based on doped ceria electrolyte by one-step sintering at 800 °C,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.015
