2,18491,"Therefore, in this work, an experimental investigation of the glass ceramic sealant (GCS) fracture process was carried out using an Acoustic Emission (AE) based approach.",An experimental investigation of fracture processes in glass-ceramic sealant by means of acoustic emission,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.031
3,18491,A series of tensile tests at room temperature were performed and the acoustic activity emitted was recorded by two AE sensors.,An experimental investigation of fracture processes in glass-ceramic sealant by means of acoustic emission,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.031
4,18491,An AE signal analysis was then performed using two approaches: wave mode identification and frequency content analysis.,An experimental investigation of fracture processes in glass-ceramic sealant by means of acoustic emission,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.031

6,18491,"This demonstrated the presence of low-frequency failure mechanisms (50-400 kHz) such as debonding, fiber pull-out and matrix cracking, and high-frequency mechanisms (>400 kHz) such as fiber breakage.",An experimental investigation of fracture processes in glass-ceramic sealant by means of acoustic emission,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.031
7,18491,The results confirm the suitability of using the acoustic emission approach for monitoring failure events and show its potential application in SOC stacks monitoring.,An experimental investigation of fracture processes in glass-ceramic sealant by means of acoustic emission,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.031
