1,19080,"In this study, the phase synthesis and electrochemical properties of A(/)A(//)A(///)B(2)O(5+d) (A(/): Lanthanide, A(//): Ba, and A(//): Sr) layered perovskites in which Pr and Sm were substituted at the A/-site were investigated for cathode materials of Intermediate Temperature-Operating Solid Oxide Fuel cells (IT-SOFC).",Pr- and Sm-Substituted Layered Perovskite Oxide Systems for IT-SOFC Cathodes,10.3390/en14206739
2,19080,"In the PrxSm1-xBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+d (x = 0.1-0.9) systems, tetragonal (x < 0.4) and orthorhombic (x >= 0.5) crystalline structures were confirmed according to the substitution amount of Pr, which has a relatively large ionic radius, and Sm, which has a small ionic radius.",Pr- and Sm-Substituted Layered Perovskite Oxide Systems for IT-SOFC Cathodes,10.3390/en14206739
3,19080,"All of the layered perovskite oxide systems utilized in this study presented typical metallic conductivity behavior, with decreasing electrical conductivity as temperature increased.",Pr- and Sm-Substituted Layered Perovskite Oxide Systems for IT-SOFC Cathodes,10.3390/en14206739
4,19080,"In addition, Pr0.5Sm0.5Ba0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+d (PSBSCO55), showing a tetragonal crystalline structure, had the lowest conductivity values.",Pr- and Sm-Substituted Layered Perovskite Oxide Systems for IT-SOFC Cathodes,10.3390/en14206739
5,19080,"However, the Area-Specific Resistance (ASR) of PSBSCO55 was found to be 0.10 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, which is lower than those of the other compositions.",Pr- and Sm-Substituted Layered Perovskite Oxide Systems for IT-SOFC Cathodes,10.3390/en14206739
