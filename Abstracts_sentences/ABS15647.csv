2,15647,Electrochemical performances of the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were investigated in the present study.,Effect of SDC-impregnated LSM cathodes on the performance of anode-supported YSZ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.088
3,15647,"Four single cells, i.e., Cell-1, Cell-2, Cell-3 and Cell-4 were obtained after the fabrication of four different cathodes, i.e., pure LSM and SDC/LSM composites in the weight ratios of 25/75, 36/64 and 42/58, respectively.",Effect of SDC-impregnated LSM cathodes on the performance of anode-supported YSZ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.088
4,15647,Impedance spectra under open-circuit conditions showed that the cathode performance was gradually improved with the increasing SDC loading.,Effect of SDC-impregnated LSM cathodes on the performance of anode-supported YSZ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.088
5,15647,"Similarly, the maximum power densities (MPD) of the four cells were increased with the SDC amount below 700 degrees C. Whereas, the cell performance of Cell-4 was lower than that of Cell-3 at 800 degrees C, arising from the increased concentration polarization at high current densities.",Effect of SDC-impregnated LSM cathodes on the performance of anode-supported YSZ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.088
6,15647,This was caused by the lowered porosity with the impregnation cycle.,Effect of SDC-impregnated LSM cathodes on the performance of anode-supported YSZ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.088
7,15647,This disadvantage could be suppressed by lowering the operating temperature or by increasing the oxygen concentration at the cathode side.,Effect of SDC-impregnated LSM cathodes on the performance of anode-supported YSZ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.088
8,15647,The ratio of electrode polarization loss in the total voltage drop versus current density showed that the cell performance was primarily determined by the electrode polarization.,Effect of SDC-impregnated LSM cathodes on the performance of anode-supported YSZ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.088
9,15647,The contribution of the ohmic resistance was increased when the operating temperature was lowered.,Effect of SDC-impregnated LSM cathodes on the performance of anode-supported YSZ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.088
10,15647,"When a 100 ml min(-1) oxygen flow was introduced to the cathode side, Cell-3 produced MPDs of 1905, 1587 and 1179 mW cm(-2) at 800, 750 and 700 degrees C, respectively.",Effect of SDC-impregnated LSM cathodes on the performance of anode-supported YSZ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.088
