1,2449,"One of the most appropriate electricity production systems is solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which are important because they are highly efficient, flexible to fuel, and have fewer environmental degradation effects.",Developed Design of Battle Royale Optimizer for the Optimum Identification of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/su14169882
2,2449,A new optimum technique has been provided for providing well-organized unknown parameters identification of the solid oxide fuel cell system.,Developed Design of Battle Royale Optimizer for the Optimum Identification of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/su14169882
3,2449,The main idea is to achieve the lowest amount of the sum of square error between the model's output voltage and the empirical voltage datapoints.,Developed Design of Battle Royale Optimizer for the Optimum Identification of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/su14169882
4,2449,"To get efficient results, the minimum error value has been achieved by designing a new metaheuristic algorithm, called the Developed version of Battle Royale algorithm.",Developed Design of Battle Royale Optimizer for the Optimum Identification of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/su14169882
5,2449,The reason for using this version of Battle Royale algorithm is to achieve results with higher accuracy and better convergence.,Developed Design of Battle Royale Optimizer for the Optimum Identification of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/su14169882
6,2449,The proposed technique was then applied to a 96-cell SOFC stack under different temperature and pressure values and its achievements were compared with several different latest methods to show the proposed method's efficiency.,Developed Design of Battle Royale Optimizer for the Optimum Identification of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/su14169882
