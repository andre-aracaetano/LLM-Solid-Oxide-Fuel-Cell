1,10224,The mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIECs) of Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4Ni0.6O3-delta (SSCN)-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) were investigated for potential application as a cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) based on an SDC electrolyte.,Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4Ni0.6O3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as a potential cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.109
2,10224,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was performed over the temperature range of 600-850 degrees C to determine the cathode polarization resistance which is represented by area specific resistance (ASR).,Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4Ni0.6O3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as a potential cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.109
3,10224,"To investigate the ORR mechanism, the impedance diagram for 70SSCN-30SDC was measured under applied cathodic voltage from E = 0.0 to E = -0.3 V.",Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4Ni0.6O3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as a potential cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.109
4,10224,"It indicated that the charge transfer dominated the rate-determining step at the temperature of 600 degrees C; whereas the diffusion or dissociative adsorption of oxygen dominated the rate-determining step at the temperature of 800 degrees C. In this study, the exchange current density (i(0)) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was determined from the EIS data.",Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4Ni0.6O3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as a potential cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.109
5,10224,"The i(0) value of 70SSCN-30SDC/SDC was 187.6 mA cm(-2) which is larger than the i(0) value of 160 mA cm(-2) for traditional cathode/electrolyte, i.e. LSM/YSZ at 800 degrees C, indicating that the 70SSCN-30SDC composite cathode with a high catalytically active surface area could provide the oxygen reduction reaction areas not only at the triple-phase boundaries but also in the whole composite cathode.",Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4Ni0.6O3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as a potential cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.109
