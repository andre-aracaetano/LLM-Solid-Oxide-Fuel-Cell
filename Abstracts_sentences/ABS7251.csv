1,7251,"By studying the effects of different solvents, dispersants and solid loading amount on the suspension stability from sedimentation and viscosity experiments, a simple, effective and highly stable YSZ particle suspension based on MEK/EtOH was developed for dip-coating anode supported electrolyte films for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Preparation of YSZ thin films for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells by dip-coating method,10.1016/j.memsci.2008.04.038
2,7251,"The morphologies of the prepared YSZ thin films from different dip-coating times were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and a film with a thickness of 16 mu m by twice dip-coating was determined to be homogeneous, crack-free and well adherent to the anode substrate.",Preparation of YSZ thin films for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells by dip-coating method,10.1016/j.memsci.2008.04.038
3,7251,"The single cell assembled with this film presents an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.01 V, and a maximum power density of 262 mWcm(-2) under H-2 as the fuel at 800 degrees C.
