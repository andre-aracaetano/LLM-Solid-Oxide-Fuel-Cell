1,1712,A direct flame fuel cell setup is designed and built based on a multi-element diffusion flame burner (MEDB).,Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Multi-Element Diffusion Flame Burners,10.1149/2.051311jes
2,1712,Flame temperature measurements are made using a fine-wire S-type thermocouple to characterize the flat flame burner performance.,Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Multi-Element Diffusion Flame Burners,10.1149/2.051311jes
3,1712,"The MEDB is proven to provide uniform, similar to 1D conditions above the surface of the burner, with temperature variations of less than +/- 2% in the transverse direction (parallel to the burner surface).",Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Multi-Element Diffusion Flame Burners,10.1149/2.051311jes
4,1712,The temperature distribution in flame height direction is also approximately uniform within the length of 45 mm.,Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Multi-Element Diffusion Flame Burners,10.1149/2.051311jes
5,1712,Direct flame fuel cell experiments were performed using an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based on button cell geometry.,Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Multi-Element Diffusion Flame Burners,10.1149/2.051311jes
6,1712,"The cell power density can reach up to 400 W/m(2) with fuel equivalent ratio at phi = 1.2 and flame temperature at 1085 K, which is around 1/3 of the original performance of the SOFC fueled with 97% hydrogen at 1073 K.",Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Multi-Element Diffusion Flame Burners,10.1149/2.051311jes
7,1712,"Finally, a novel DFFC configuration is proposed to take advantage the flame uniformity in both the vertical and horizontal directions.",Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Multi-Element Diffusion Flame Burners,10.1149/2.051311jes
