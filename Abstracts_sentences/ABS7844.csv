4,7844,"The present paper studies the effect of the method of manufacturing of the initial La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (LSM) powders, their degree of dispersion, introduction of sintering additives and pore agents on their microstructure, conductivity, and possibility of adjusting the temperature of SOFC cathodic substrate formation at which the required characteristics are reached.",Options for Adjustment of Microstructure and Conductivity of Cathodic Substrates of La(Sr)MnO3,10.1134/S1023193510070153
5,7844,"It is shown that sintering of cathodic substrates to the relative density of 65-70% can be carried out at the temperatures from 1050 to 1350-1400 degrees C, which would allow obtaining electrolyte films of powders with different sintering ability on such substrates.",Options for Adjustment of Microstructure and Conductivity of Cathodic Substrates of La(Sr)MnO3,10.1134/S1023193510070153
6,7844,The average pore size in cathodic substrates can be varied in the range of 0.4 to 2.5 mu m by using the initial LSM powder with different dispersion degree and by employing graphite as a pore agent.,Options for Adjustment of Microstructure and Conductivity of Cathodic Substrates of La(Sr)MnO3,10.1134/S1023193510070153
7,7844,"At 900 C, conductivity of cathodic substrates of LSM grows at an increase in their relative density from 50% to 70% approximately from 50 to 100 S/cm and weakly depends on the dispersion degree of the initial powders.",Options for Adjustment of Microstructure and Conductivity of Cathodic Substrates of La(Sr)MnO3,10.1134/S1023193510070153
