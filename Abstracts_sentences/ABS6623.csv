1,6623,We present in this work a strategy for predicting new oxide perovskites with the potential for achieving high ionic conductivity for applications as a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Materials genome project: Mining the ionic conductivity in oxide perovskites,10.1016/j.mseb.2020.114984
2,6623,We employ a throughout multivariate technique based the principal component analysis (PCA) and the partial least square methods (PLS) in order to identify empirical design rules (activation and migration energies) for stable ionic conductors.,Materials genome project: Mining the ionic conductivity in oxide perovskites,10.1016/j.mseb.2020.114984
