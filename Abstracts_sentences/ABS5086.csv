5,5086,"In the fuel cells, it was found that the optimal composition 90CeO(2)-10La(1-2x)Ba(x)Bi(x)FeO(3) electrolyte-based SOFC delivered a peak power density of 834 mW cm(-2) along with an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.04 V at 550 & DEG;C. A comparative study revealed that the nanocomposite electrolyte exhibited a total conductivity of 0.11 S cm(-1) at 550 & DEG;C. Moreover, the rectification curve manifested the formation of the Schottky junction, suppressing the electronic conduction.",Enabling fast ionic transport in CeO2-La1-2xBaxBixFeO3 nanocomposite electrolyte for low temperature solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1039/d3ra01698f
