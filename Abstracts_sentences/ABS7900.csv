1,7900,This study compares the viscosity and strength of three glass-based seals prepared with or without nano or micron-sized alumina powder used as filler material.,Effect of Al2O3 Nano-Filler on Properties of Glass-Based Seals for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2013.6936
2,7900,Measurements of the viscosity and bending strength of the glass-based seals showed that addition of the nano-sized alumina powder to the glass increased both the high-temperature viscosity and the strength of the sintered glass matrix.,Effect of Al2O3 Nano-Filler on Properties of Glass-Based Seals for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2013.6936
3,7900,Strength tests and observations of the microstructure of the fracture surface of the seal samples confirmed the strengthening of the glass network structure.,Effect of Al2O3 Nano-Filler on Properties of Glass-Based Seals for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2013.6936
4,7900,Conversion of non-bridging oxygen to bridging oxygen is presumed to occur upon the addition of alumina to the glass sample.,Effect of Al2O3 Nano-Filler on Properties of Glass-Based Seals for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2013.6936
5,7900,The strengthening of the alumina-glass composite seal was attributed to the alumina nano-filler and prolonged heat treatment at elevated temperatures.,Effect of Al2O3 Nano-Filler on Properties of Glass-Based Seals for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2013.6936
