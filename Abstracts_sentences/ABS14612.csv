1,14612,Nickel nano-honeycombs (NNHC) would be expected to an ideal anode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) because of its high surface area and highly ordered pore network.,Effect of Temperature on Mechanical Properties of Carbon Nanotubes-Reinforced Nickel Nano-Honeycombs,10.11900/0412.1961.2019.00299
2,14612,"But, the anode material requires excellent mechanical properties to withstand stresses that arise during processing and service at different temperatures.",Effect of Temperature on Mechanical Properties of Carbon Nanotubes-Reinforced Nickel Nano-Honeycombs,10.11900/0412.1961.2019.00299
3,14612,"The influence of temperature on the mechanical behaviors under radial (y axis) tension, radial compression, axial (z axis) tension and axial compression, is investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) by taking the carbon nanotubes (CNT)-reinforced NNHC (CRNNHC) composites with the mass fractions of CNT (omega(CNT)) of 5.22% and its corresponding NNHC as the example.",Effect of Temperature on Mechanical Properties of Carbon Nanotubes-Reinforced Nickel Nano-Honeycombs,10.11900/0412.1961.2019.00299
4,14612,The results show that the mechanical properties including elastic modulus (E) and ultimate stress (sigma(u)) in NNHC and CRNNHC both decrease approximately linearly with the increase of temperature.,Effect of Temperature on Mechanical Properties of Carbon Nanotubes-Reinforced Nickel Nano-Honeycombs,10.11900/0412.1961.2019.00299
5,14612,"Compared to NNHC, the addition of CNT has no obvious effect on the enhancement of radial mechanical properties of CRNNHC under different temperatures, but it results in a good reinforced effect on axial mechanical properties.",Effect of Temperature on Mechanical Properties of Carbon Nanotubes-Reinforced Nickel Nano-Honeycombs,10.11900/0412.1961.2019.00299
6,14612,"While the axial tensile and compressive elastic moduli can be increased by 6.4%similar to 10% and 9%similar to 12% respectively, and the ultimate stress can be increased by 1.5%similar to 5.3% and 10%similar to 14% respectively.",Effect of Temperature on Mechanical Properties of Carbon Nanotubes-Reinforced Nickel Nano-Honeycombs,10.11900/0412.1961.2019.00299
7,14612,"The study indicates that axial mechanical properties of the CRNNHC are generally superior to their radial mechanical properties, and the energy absorption before the axial deformation is relatively larger due to the existence of CNT.",Effect of Temperature on Mechanical Properties of Carbon Nanotubes-Reinforced Nickel Nano-Honeycombs,10.11900/0412.1961.2019.00299
