1,10441,"In this paper, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from an uncontrolled landfill site filled with Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) are compared with those from controlled sites in which collected Landfill Gases (LFG) are utilised by various technologies.",The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions using various thermal systems in a landfill site,10.1504/IJGW.2009.027083
2,10441,"These technologies include flaring, conventional electricity generation technologies such as Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and Gas Turbine (GT) and an emerging technology, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC).",The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions using various thermal systems in a landfill site,10.1504/IJGW.2009.027083
3,10441,The results show that SOFC is the best option for reducing the GHG emissions among the studied technologies.,The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions using various thermal systems in a landfill site,10.1504/IJGW.2009.027083
4,10441,"In the case when SOFC is used, GHG emissions from the controlled site are reduced by 63% compared to the uncontrolled site.",The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions using various thermal systems in a landfill site,10.1504/IJGW.2009.027083
5,10441,This case has a specific lifetime GHG emission of 2.38 tonnes CO(2 center dot)eq/MWh when only electricity is produced and 1.12 tonnes CO(2 center dot)eq/MWh for a cogeneration application.,The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions using various thermal systems in a landfill site,10.1504/IJGW.2009.027083
