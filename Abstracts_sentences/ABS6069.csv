2,6069,"Peak power densities of similar to 420 and 135 mW/cm(2) were achieved, respectively, at 700 and 450 degrees C for a cell with 35 gm thick electrolyte operating on hydrogen fuel.","Proton-conducting fuel cells operating on hydrogen, ammonia and hydrazine at intermediate temperatures",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.04.019
3,6069,"The endothermic nature of the ammonia decomposition reaction, however, resulted in cell temperature 30-65 degrees C lower than the furnace when operating on ammonia.","Proton-conducting fuel cells operating on hydrogen, ammonia and hydrazine at intermediate temperatures",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.04.019
4,6069,"Accounting the cooling effect, comparable power density was achieved for the cell operating on ammonia and hydrogen at high temperature.","Proton-conducting fuel cells operating on hydrogen, ammonia and hydrazine at intermediate temperatures",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.04.019
5,6069,"At reduced temperature, the cell demonstrated worse performance when operating on ammonia than on hydrogen due to the poor activity of the anode towards NH3 catalytic decomposition.","Proton-conducting fuel cells operating on hydrogen, ammonia and hydrazine at intermediate temperatures",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.04.019
