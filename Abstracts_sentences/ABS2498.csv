1,2498,"In this work, the three-dimensional (3-D) microstructure of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) composite electrode is reconstructed by a random particle packing procedure and a geometrical dilating process, based on which the different tortuosity factors (t) are calculated by solving the steady state charge conservation equation in different percolated networks.",The tortuosity factor e ff ect on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.seta.2020.100681
2,2498,"After that, the effects of the different t on cell performance are analyzed by a one-dimensional (1-D) SOFC performance simulation model, in which the electrochemical reactions and the gas/ion/electron transport are coupled.",The tortuosity factor e ff ect on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.seta.2020.100681
3,2498,"The results indicate that the tortuosity factor of the ion-conducting phase in SOFC cathode (tio,c) plays the most important role and up to 62% SOFC performance improvement can be expected by decreasing tio,c.",The tortuosity factor e ff ect on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.seta.2020.100681
4,2498,"In addition, by decreasing the tortuosity factor of the gas phase (tgas,a) and the ion-conducting phase in SOFC anode (tio,a), 1.7% and 17% performance improvement can be achieved, respectively.",The tortuosity factor e ff ect on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.seta.2020.100681
