1,5326,NiO-SDC (samaria-doped ceria) composite powder synthesized by glycine-nitrate process was used as the anode material for the solid oxide fuel cells of medium-temperature.,Synthesis of NiO-SDC composite powders for anode by glycine-nitrate process,
2,5326,The phase composition and morphology of NiO-SDC powders synthesized with different molar ration of glycine and metal were investigated by XRD and SEM.,Synthesis of NiO-SDC composite powders for anode by glycine-nitrate process,
3,5326,"The XRD results show that the composite powders obtained directly from glycine-nitrate process contain NiO phase and CeO2 phase as well as Ni2O3 phase, then the NiO-SDC composite powders can be obtained by following a calcination at 900 degrees C for 2 h due to the Ni2O3 decomposition into NiO. Thermogravimetric analysis in hydrogen shows that the ratio of NiO to SDC of NiO-SDC composite powder is in accordance with solution composition.",Synthesis of NiO-SDC composite powders for anode by glycine-nitrate process,
4,5326,The electrolyte-supported single cells with different NiO content anodes have been tested in order to investigate the effect of NiO content on the performance of electrodes made of NiO-SDC cermets.,Synthesis of NiO-SDC composite powders for anode by glycine-nitrate process,
5,5326,The results show that the single cell with an anode of 60%NiO-SDC composition exhibits the maximum open circuit voltage.,Synthesis of NiO-SDC composite powders for anode by glycine-nitrate process,
