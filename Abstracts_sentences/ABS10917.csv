1,10917,"Diffusion barrier layers are typically introduced in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to avoid reaction between state-of-the-art cathode and electrolyte materials, La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-delta and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), respectively.",Enhanced Performance of Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Diffusion Barrier Layers Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Large-Area Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.8b00039
2,10917,"However, commonly used layers of gadolinia-doped ceria (CGO) introduce overpotentials that significantly reduce the cell performance.",Enhanced Performance of Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Diffusion Barrier Layers Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Large-Area Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.8b00039
3,10917,"This performance decrease is mainly due to the low density achievable with traditional deposition techniques, such as screen printing, at acceptable fabrication temperatures.",Enhanced Performance of Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Diffusion Barrier Layers Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Large-Area Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.8b00039
4,10917,"In this work, perfectly dense and reproducible barrier layers for state-of-the-art cells (similar to 80 cm(2)) were implemented, for the first time, using large-area pulsed laser deposition (LA-PLD).",Enhanced Performance of Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Diffusion Barrier Layers Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Large-Area Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.8b00039
5,10917,"In order to minimize cation interdiffusion, the low-temperature deposited barrier layers were thermally stabilized in the range between 1100 and 1400 degrees C. Significant enhanced performance is reported for cells stabilized at 1150 degrees C showing excellent power densities of 1.25 W.cm(-2) at 0.7 V and at a operation temperature of 750 degrees C. Improved cells were finally induded in a stack and operated in realistic conditions for 4500 h revealing low degradation rates (0.5%/1000 h) comparable to reference cells.",Enhanced Performance of Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Diffusion Barrier Layers Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Large-Area Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.8b00039
