1,20227,A modified high-velocity oxy-fuel spray (HVOF) thermal spray torch equipped with liquid feeding hardware was used to spray manganese-cobalt solutions on ferritic stainless steel grade Crofer 22 APU substrates.,Characterization of High-Velocity Solution Precursor Flame-Sprayed Manganese Cobalt Oxide Spinel Coatings for Metallic SOFC Interconnectors,10.1007/s11666-013-9922-y
2,20227,The HVOF torch was modified in such a way that the solution could be fed axially into the combustion chamber through 250- and 300-mu m-diameter liquid injector nozzles.,Characterization of High-Velocity Solution Precursor Flame-Sprayed Manganese Cobalt Oxide Spinel Coatings for Metallic SOFC Interconnectors,10.1007/s11666-013-9922-y
3,20227,"The solution used in this study was prepared by diluting nitrates of manganese and cobalt, i.e., Mn(NO3)(2)center dot 4H(2)O and Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O, respectively, in deionized water.",Characterization of High-Velocity Solution Precursor Flame-Sprayed Manganese Cobalt Oxide Spinel Coatings for Metallic SOFC Interconnectors,10.1007/s11666-013-9922-y
4,20227,The as-sprayed coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy operating in secondary electron mode.,Characterization of High-Velocity Solution Precursor Flame-Sprayed Manganese Cobalt Oxide Spinel Coatings for Metallic SOFC Interconnectors,10.1007/s11666-013-9922-y
5,20227,Chemical analyses were performed on an energy dispersive spectrometer.,Characterization of High-Velocity Solution Precursor Flame-Sprayed Manganese Cobalt Oxide Spinel Coatings for Metallic SOFC Interconnectors,10.1007/s11666-013-9922-y
6,20227,Coatings with remarkable density could be prepared by the novel high-velocity solution precursor flame spray (HVSPFS) process.,Characterization of High-Velocity Solution Precursor Flame-Sprayed Manganese Cobalt Oxide Spinel Coatings for Metallic SOFC Interconnectors,10.1007/s11666-013-9922-y
7,20227,"Due to finely sized droplet formation in the HVSPFS process and the use of as delivered Crofer 22 APU substrate material having very low substrate roughness (R-a < 0.5 mu m), thin and homogeneous coatings, with thicknesses lower than 10 mu m could be prepared.",Characterization of High-Velocity Solution Precursor Flame-Sprayed Manganese Cobalt Oxide Spinel Coatings for Metallic SOFC Interconnectors,10.1007/s11666-013-9922-y
8,20227,The coatings were found to have a crystalline structure equivalent to MnCo2O4 spinel with addition of Co-oxide phases.,Characterization of High-Velocity Solution Precursor Flame-Sprayed Manganese Cobalt Oxide Spinel Coatings for Metallic SOFC Interconnectors,10.1007/s11666-013-9922-y
9,20227,Crystallographic structure was restored back to single-phase spinel structure by heat treatment.,Characterization of High-Velocity Solution Precursor Flame-Sprayed Manganese Cobalt Oxide Spinel Coatings for Metallic SOFC Interconnectors,10.1007/s11666-013-9922-y
