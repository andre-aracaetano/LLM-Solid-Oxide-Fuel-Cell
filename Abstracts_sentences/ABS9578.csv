1,9578,The present work aims to quantify the influence of typical interconnect coatings used for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) on area specific resistance (ASR).,Does the conductivity of interconnect coatings matter for solid oxide fuel cell applications?,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.060
2,9578,"To quantify the effect of the coating, the dependency of coating thickness on the ASR is examined on Crofer 22 APU at 600 degrees C. Three different Co coating thicknesses are investigated, 600 nm, 1500 nm, and 3000 nm.",Does the conductivity of interconnect coatings matter for solid oxide fuel cell applications?,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.060
3,9578,"Except for the reference samples, the material is pre-oxidized prior to coating to mitigate the outward diffusion of iron and consequent formation of poorly conducting (Co,Fe)304 spinel.",Does the conductivity of interconnect coatings matter for solid oxide fuel cell applications?,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.060
4,9578,Exposures are carried out at 600 degrees C in stagnant laboratory air for 500 h and subsequent ASR measurements are performed.,Does the conductivity of interconnect coatings matter for solid oxide fuel cell applications?,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.060
5,9578,Additionally the microstructure is investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).,Does the conductivity of interconnect coatings matter for solid oxide fuel cell applications?,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.060
6,9578,"On all pre-oxidized samples, a homogenous dense Co3O4 top layer is observed beneath which a thin layer of Cr2O3 is present.",Does the conductivity of interconnect coatings matter for solid oxide fuel cell applications?,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.060
7,9578,"As the ASR values range between 7 and 12 m Omega cm(2) for all pre-oxidized samples, even though different Co3O4 thicknesses are observed, the results strongly suggest that for most applicable cases the impact of the coating on ASR is negligible and the main contributor is Cr2O3.",Does the conductivity of interconnect coatings matter for solid oxide fuel cell applications?,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.060
