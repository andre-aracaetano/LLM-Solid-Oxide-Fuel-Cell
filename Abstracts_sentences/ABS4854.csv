1,4854,The crystal structure and oxygen stoichiometry of the proposed double perovskite solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode material PrBaMn2O5+delta were determined under SOFC anode conditions via in-situ neutron diffraction.,Structural analysis of PrBaMn2O5+δ under SOFC anode conditions by in-situ neutron powder diffraction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.013
2,4854,Measurements were performed in reducing atmospheres between 692 K and 984 K. The structure was fit to a tetragonal (space group P4/mmm) layered double perovskite structure with alternating Pr and Ba A-site cation layers.,Structural analysis of PrBaMn2O5+δ under SOFC anode conditions by in-situ neutron powder diffraction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.013
3,4854,"Under all conditions examined, the oxygen sites in the Ba and Mn layers were fully occupied, while the sites in the Pr layer were close to completely vacant.",Structural analysis of PrBaMn2O5+δ under SOFC anode conditions by in-situ neutron powder diffraction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.013
4,4854,The results of the neutron diffraction experiments are compared to previous thermogravimetric analysis experiments to verify the accuracy of both experiments.,Structural analysis of PrBaMn2O5+δ under SOFC anode conditions by in-situ neutron powder diffraction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.013
5,4854,PrBaMn2O5+delta was shown to be stable over a wide range of reducing atmospheres similar to anode operating conditions in solid oxide fuel cells without significant structural changes.,Structural analysis of PrBaMn2O5+δ under SOFC anode conditions by in-situ neutron powder diffraction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.013
