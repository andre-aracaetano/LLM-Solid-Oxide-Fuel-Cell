1,3358,La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSM) has been widely developed as the cathode material for high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) due to its chemical and mechanical compatibilities with the electrolyte materials.,Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La1-xSrxMnO3 as the cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.058
2,3358,"However, its application to low-temperature SOFCs is limited since its electrochemical activity decreases substantially when the temperature is reduced.",Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La1-xSrxMnO3 as the cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.058
3,3358,"In this work, low-temperature SOFCs based on LSM cathodes are developed by coating nanoscale samaria-doped ceria (SDC) onto the porous electrodes to significantly increase the electrode activity of both cathodes and anodes.",Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La1-xSrxMnO3 as the cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.058
4,3358,"A peak power density of 0.46 W cm(-2) and area specific interfacial polarization resistance of 0.36 Omega cm(2) are achieved at 600 degrees C for single cells consisting of Ni-SDC anodes, LSM cathodes, and SDC electrolytes.",Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La1-xSrxMnO3 as the cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.058
5,3358,"The cell performances are comparable with those obtained with cobalt-based cathodes such as Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3, and therefore encouraging in the development of low-temperature SOFCs; with high reliability and durability.",Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La1-xSrxMnO3 as the cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.058
