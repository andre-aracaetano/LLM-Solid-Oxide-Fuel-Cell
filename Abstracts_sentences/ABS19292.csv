1,19292,"BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-alpha (BCN) ceramic is known to be an excellent high-temperature proton conductor and is a candidate electrolyte for use in solid oxide fuel cells, hydrogen or steam sensors and steam electrolysers.",Chemical stability study of BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-alpha high-temperature proton-conducting ceramic,10.1039/a605377g
2,19292,"In this work, the chemical stability of BCN was investigated systematically by combining XRD and DTA-TG techniques to study its processing compatibility and its feasibility in potential applications.",Chemical stability study of BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-alpha high-temperature proton-conducting ceramic,10.1039/a605377g
3,19292,"It was found that above 1200 degrees C, BCN reacted with alumina or zirconia, leading to the loss of barium and an excess of cerium.",Chemical stability study of BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-alpha high-temperature proton-conducting ceramic,10.1039/a605377g
4,19292,"In cold water, both sintered BCN disks and powder samples had very low solubility and did not hydrolyse, but they were soluble in some mineral acids, especially in HCl with the liberation of Cl-2.",Chemical stability study of BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-alpha high-temperature proton-conducting ceramic,10.1039/a605377g
5,19292,"In boiling water, BCN pellets dissolved readily with decomposition into CeO2 and Ba(OH)(2).",Chemical stability study of BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-alpha high-temperature proton-conducting ceramic,10.1039/a605377g
6,19292,"In 1 atm CO2, BCN decomposed to form CeO2 and BaCO3 below 1200 degrees C during heating, but during cooling it was stable above 1000 degrees C, possibly because BCN has different crystal structures al low and high temperatures.",Chemical stability study of BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-alpha high-temperature proton-conducting ceramic,10.1039/a605377g
7,19292,"At 600-1000 degrees C, BCN showed a slight mass loss when exposed to a reducing atmosphere, and a slight mass gain in an oxidizing atmosphere.",Chemical stability study of BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-alpha high-temperature proton-conducting ceramic,10.1039/a605377g
8,19292,XRD results revealed that BCN demonstrated chemical and structural stability in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres.,Chemical stability study of BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-alpha high-temperature proton-conducting ceramic,10.1039/a605377g
