1,16354,"The most common approach to seal an electrolyte or a ceramic anode with a metallic interconnect in solid oxide fuel cells of planar configuration (pSOFC), in order to achieve a hermetic and stable cell, is to use rigid glass or glass-ceramic (GC) seals.","Structure, Sintering, and Crystallization Kinetics of Alkaline-Earth Aluminosilicate Glass-Ceramic Sealants for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03503.x
2,16354,The properties of these sealants can be tailored specifically for use in SOFCs through variation of the glass composition.,"Structure, Sintering, and Crystallization Kinetics of Alkaline-Earth Aluminosilicate Glass-Ceramic Sealants for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03503.x
3,16354,"In the present manuscript, we aim to study the structure, sintering behavior, and crystallization kinetics of a new series of aluminosilicate GC sealants derived from substitution via scheme 0.1(Ca2++Si4+)<-> 0.1(La3++Al3+) in a pure CaMgSi2O6 (diopside) system.","Structure, Sintering, and Crystallization Kinetics of Alkaline-Earth Aluminosilicate Glass-Ceramic Sealants for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03503.x
4,16354,"The substitution of BaO for CaO and the addition of fixed amounts of B2O3, Cr2O3, and NiO were attempted in order to achieve desirable traits that qualify the investigated GCs for sealing application in pSOFCs.","Structure, Sintering, and Crystallization Kinetics of Alkaline-Earth Aluminosilicate Glass-Ceramic Sealants for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03503.x
5,16354,"The investigated glasses showed a steady increase in density, coefficient of thermal expansion, and molar volume with addition of Cr2O3 and increasing BaO contents while no significant variation in glass transition temperature (T-g) was observed.","Structure, Sintering, and Crystallization Kinetics of Alkaline-Earth Aluminosilicate Glass-Ceramic Sealants for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03503.x
6,16354,"Sintering and crystallization behavior of the glasses were investigated using hot-stage microscopy and differential thermal analysis, respectively.","Structure, Sintering, and Crystallization Kinetics of Alkaline-Earth Aluminosilicate Glass-Ceramic Sealants for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03503.x
7,16354,The microstructure and the properties of GCs were investigated under nonisothermal heat treatment conditions (800 degrees and 850 degrees C; 1 h).,"Structure, Sintering, and Crystallization Kinetics of Alkaline-Earth Aluminosilicate Glass-Ceramic Sealants for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03503.x

9,16354,"It was observed that while addition of Cr2O3 improved the sinterability of glass-powder compacts and decreased the amorphous content in the resultant GCs, substitution of BaO for CaO led to an increase in amorphous content in the GCs.","Structure, Sintering, and Crystallization Kinetics of Alkaline-Earth Aluminosilicate Glass-Ceramic Sealants for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03503.x
