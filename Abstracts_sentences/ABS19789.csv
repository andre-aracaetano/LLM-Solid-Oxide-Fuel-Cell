1,19789,The effect of an external alternating electric field on the diffusion of O2- ions in yttria-stabilized zirconia was studied by the molecular dynamics method in a wide frequency range (10(6)-10(9) Hz) with a variation of the molar fraction of the dopant.,Resonant increase of ionic conductance of yttria-stabilized zirconia in an alternating external electric field,10.1007/s10008-023-05420-1
2,19789,"It was found that in the frequency range of the external electric field from 2 center dot 10(8) to 3 center dot 10(8) Hz, the value of the diffusion coefficient resonantly increases; the exact value of the resonant frequency depends on the composition of the solid electrolyte.",Resonant increase of ionic conductance of yttria-stabilized zirconia in an alternating external electric field,10.1007/s10008-023-05420-1
3,19789,"The influence of two simultaneously applied external electric fields, alternating and constant, was studied, and two variants of the relative positions of the field vectors were considered: perpendicular to each other and co-directional.",Resonant increase of ionic conductance of yttria-stabilized zirconia in an alternating external electric field,10.1007/s10008-023-05420-1
4,19789,"With the co-directional imposition of two electric fields, alternating with an amplitude of strength equal to 0.02 V/angstrom and constant with a strength equal to 0.02 V/angstrom, the resonance is especially noticeable: 2.63 center dot 10(-10) m(2)/s at Y2O3 content of 4.6 mol.%, which is 2.22 times more than the average value of the diffusion coefficient at frequencies (1-5)center dot 10(6) Hz and 2 times more than the average value at frequencies (5-9)center dot 10(9) Hz.",Resonant increase of ionic conductance of yttria-stabilized zirconia in an alternating external electric field,10.1007/s10008-023-05420-1
