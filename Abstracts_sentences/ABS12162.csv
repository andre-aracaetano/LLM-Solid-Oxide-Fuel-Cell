2,12162,"Major breakthroughs are then intrinsically linked to a detailed understanding of how parameters tailoring bulk proton conductivity affect surface chemistry in situ, at an early stage.","Assessing Substitution Effects on Surface Chemistry by in Situ Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy on Perovskite Thin Films, BaCexZr0.9-xY0.1O2.95 (x=0; 0.2; 0.9)",10.1021/acsami.8b12546
3,12162,"In this work, we studied proton and oxygen transport at the interface between H+-SOFC electrolyte BaCexZr0.9-x-Y0.1O2.95 (x = 0; 0.2; 0.9) thin films and the gas (100 mTorr of H2O and 02) by using synchrotron-based ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at operating temperature (>400 degrees C).","Assessing Substitution Effects on Surface Chemistry by in Situ Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy on Perovskite Thin Films, BaCexZr0.9-xY0.1O2.95 (x=0; 0.2; 0.9)",10.1021/acsami.8b12546
4,12162,"We developed highly textured BaCexZr0.9-xY0.1O2.95 epitaxial thin films, which exhibit high level of in-plane proton conductivity, that is, up to 0.08 S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C for x = 0.9.","Assessing Substitution Effects on Surface Chemistry by in Situ Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy on Perovskite Thin Films, BaCexZr0.9-xY0.1O2.95 (x=0; 0.2; 0.9)",10.1021/acsami.8b12546
5,12162,"Upon applying 100 mTorr water partial pressure above 300 degrees C, major changes are observed only in the O 1s and Y 3d core level spectra, with a clear Zr/Ce ratio dependency.","Assessing Substitution Effects on Surface Chemistry by in Situ Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy on Perovskite Thin Films, BaCexZr0.9-xY0.1O2.95 (x=0; 0.2; 0.9)",10.1021/acsami.8b12546
6,12162,OH- formation is favored by Ce content while initiated near Y. Hydration is also associated with surface secondary phase growth comprising oxygen-under-coordinated yttrium and/or yttrium hydroxide.,"Assessing Substitution Effects on Surface Chemistry by in Situ Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy on Perovskite Thin Films, BaCexZr0.9-xY0.1O2.95 (x=0; 0.2; 0.9)",10.1021/acsami.8b12546
7,12162,"With BaCe0.2Zr0.7Y0.1O2.95, high levels of ionic conductivities and chemical stability are obtained as a result of the optimized surface reaction kinetics, with low activation energy barrier for proton transport while restraining formation of OH-/SO42- adsorb species.","Assessing Substitution Effects on Surface Chemistry by in Situ Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy on Perovskite Thin Films, BaCexZr0.9-xY0.1O2.95 (x=0; 0.2; 0.9)",10.1021/acsami.8b12546
