3,3713,"The OCV was 1.102 and 0.985 V at 600 and 700 degrees C, respectively, which is fairly consistent with the theoretical values calculated on the assumption of ammonia completely decomposing.",A high-performance ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.099
4,3713,Also a useful power density was achieved; the maximum power density was 355 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C.,A high-performance ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.099
5,3713,"For comparison, cells were also tested with hydrogen as the fuel and CO2-free air as the oxidant at 700 degrees C, where the power density was about 371 or 324 mW cm(-2).",A high-performance ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.099
6,3713,The performance of the cells tested under various conditions implied that ammonia might be a good fuel for a SOFC.,A high-performance ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.099
