1,18241,Symmetric solid oxide cells with Gd doped ceria (GDC) electrolytes and La(0.6)Sr(0.4)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) (LSCF)-infiltrated-GDC cathodes were maintained in air with no current at temperatures from 650 to 850 degrees C. Comparison of SEM images before and after aging showed inhomogeneous coarsening of LSCF nano-particles in the cathodes.,Time-dependent performance changes in LSCF-infiltrated SOFC cathodes: The role of nano-particle coarsening,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.02.003
