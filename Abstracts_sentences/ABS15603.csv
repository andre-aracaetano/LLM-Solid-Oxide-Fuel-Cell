1,15603,"Composites of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and mixed perovskites with the average compositions La0.8Sr0.2Mn(1-x)CoxO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5) and with total loadings of 40 wt % perovskite were prepared by impregnation of aqueous salt solutions into a porous YSZ cathode matrix and examined for their use as cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) at 973 K.",An examination of LSM-LSCo mixtures for use in SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2186183
2,15603,"For calcination at 1173 K, the cathode made from La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.75Co0.25O3 showed the best performance of the mixed perovskites, although the improvement over La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) was only modest.",An examination of LSM-LSCo mixtures for use in SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2186183
3,15603,"After calcination at 1373 K, LSM - YSZ performed better than any of the mixed perovskites.",An examination of LSM-LSCo mixtures for use in SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2186183
4,15603,X-ray diffraction showed that Co-containing mixed perovskites undergo a solid-state reaction with YSZ at 1373 K to form insulating phases that decrease the electrochemical performance.,An examination of LSM-LSCo mixtures for use in SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2186183
5,15603,"While the addition of 10 wt % CoOx to an LSM - YSZ composite was found to have no effect on cathode performance, the addition of 10 wt % La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 to an LSM - YSZ composite dramatically decreased the cathode area-specific resistance from 0.45 Omega cm(2) to approximately 0.1 Omega cm(2).",An examination of LSM-LSCo mixtures for use in SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2186183
6,15603,"Based on these results, the possibilities for improving the performance of LSM-based cathodes through doping with Co-containing compounds are discussed.",An examination of LSM-LSCo mixtures for use in SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2186183
