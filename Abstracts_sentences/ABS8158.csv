1,8158,Two glass-ceramics sealants for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) in the system BaO/SrO-MgO-B2O3-SiO2 have been analysed according to relevant sealing parameters such as sintering and crystallization of the glass powders and dilatation and viscosity evolution with crystallization of glass-ceramic compacts.,Sintering/Crystallization and Viscosity of Sealing Glass-Ceramics,10.3390/cryst11070737
2,8158,"Special emphasis is given to the crystallization kinetics and mechanism, crystalline phases formed and the role of viscosity in the whole sealing process.",Sintering/Crystallization and Viscosity of Sealing Glass-Ceramics,10.3390/cryst11070737
3,8158,The slower crystallization rate of the strontium-containing glass composition results in good joining with the interconnect steel before the glass starts to crystallize and increases its viscosity.,Sintering/Crystallization and Viscosity of Sealing Glass-Ceramics,10.3390/cryst11070737
4,8158,This avoids and excessive sealing temperature and offers better compatibility with the start up and working temperature of an SOFC (750-850 degrees C).,Sintering/Crystallization and Viscosity of Sealing Glass-Ceramics,10.3390/cryst11070737
