3,9096,"To finely adjust the composition ratio of the nickel cermet anode, we deposit NiO-GDC via a reactive co-sputtering process, which reduces the sputtering yield of nickel.",Highly active and stable nanocomposite anode for solid oxide fuel cells on non-conductive substrate,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172046
4,9096,"We fabricate NiO-GDC anodes with various composition ratios by changing the sputtering power for the nickel target (50-100 W), while maintaining the sputtering power for the GDC target (50 W).",Highly active and stable nanocomposite anode for solid oxide fuel cells on non-conductive substrate,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172046
5,9096,"The electrochemical performance of the NiO-GDC anode-based TF-SOFCs is successfully optimized by controlling the composition, crystallinity, and surface morphology of the anodes.",Highly active and stable nanocomposite anode for solid oxide fuel cells on non-conductive substrate,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172046
6,9096,"Structural analysis reveals that the optimized composition ratio of NiO (64.46 vol% Ni) in cermet is higher than that of conventional sintered nickel-based cermet anode (40-50 vol% Ni), which is attributed to the sensitive characteristics of the nano-sized grain structure to thermal agglomeration in a reducing environment.",Highly active and stable nanocomposite anode for solid oxide fuel cells on non-conductive substrate,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172046
7,9096,"Consequently, we obtain the most stable structure and the highest performance (439.5 mW/cm(2) at 500 degree celsius) with the optimal NiO-GDC composition (NiO 75 W / GDC 50 W).",Highly active and stable nanocomposite anode for solid oxide fuel cells on non-conductive substrate,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172046
