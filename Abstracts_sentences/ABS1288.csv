2,1288,"Three different samples, La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-delta, La0.25Pr0.25Sr0.5FeO3-delta, and Pr0.5Sr0.5FeO3-delta,were successfully prepared.",Evaluating the effect of Pr-doping on the performance of strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite cathodes for protonic SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.017
3,1288,The Pr content was shown to have an obvious influence on the hydration ability of the materials.,Evaluating the effect of Pr-doping on the performance of strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite cathodes for protonic SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.017
4,1288,"Hydration was improved at higher Pr-contents, suggesting a promising cathode performance.",Evaluating the effect of Pr-doping on the performance of strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite cathodes for protonic SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.017
5,1288,"However, the improved hydration ability did not always lead to an increased fuel cell performance, and it was found that the fuel cell performed best when an appropriate Pr-doping amount was used that resulted in a good compromise between protonic and oxygen-ion conduction.",Evaluating the effect of Pr-doping on the performance of strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite cathodes for protonic SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.017
6,1288,"As a result, the optimized composition La0.25Pr0.25Sr0.5FeO3-delta generated a high peak power density of 616 mW cm(-2 )and a low polarization resistance of 0.09 at Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, which is an encouraging performance for a traditional cathode material.",Evaluating the effect of Pr-doping on the performance of strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite cathodes for protonic SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.017
