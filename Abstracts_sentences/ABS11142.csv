1,11142,"The Ba2BixSc0.2Co1.8-xO6-delta (x = 0.1 or 0.2) cubic perovskites are confirmed to be mixed-valent Co3+/Co2+ oxides that, as mixed oxide-ion and electronic conductors, are superior cathode materials for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell catalyzing the oxygen-reduction reaction.","Characterization of the Double Perovskite Ba2BixSc0.2Co1.8-xO6-δ (x=0.1, 0.2)",10.1021/cm3021484
2,11142,"Neutron powder diffraction for x = 0.2 was used to confirm also that these compounds have the double-perovskite structure Ba2BB'O6-delta at room temperature with B = Co, B' = Bi0.2Sc0.2Co0.6, delta approximate to 1.3, and a B-O bond length a little longer than the mean B'-O bond length.","Characterization of the Double Perovskite Ba2BixSc0.2Co1.8-xO6-δ (x=0.1, 0.2)",10.1021/cm3021484
3,11142,These data indicate that the room-temperature x = 0.2 phase is Ba2Co2+B'O-4.7 with B' = (Bi5+)(0.2)(Sc3+)(0.2)(Co3+)(0.6).,"Characterization of the Double Perovskite Ba2BixSc0.2Co1.8-xO6-δ (x=0.1, 0.2)",10.1021/cm3021484
4,11142,The presence of Bi5+ was confirmed by comparing the Bi4f core-level X-ray photoelectron spectrum of the x = 0.2 sample with that of BaBiO3.

6,11142,Substitution of Bi and Sc for Co as well as the incorporation of oxygen vacancies increases the mean B-O bond length to reduce t > 1 to where cubic stacking of close-packed BaO3 planes is energetically favored over hexagonal stacking that introduces large B-cation Coulombic repulsions across a shared octahedral-site face.,"Characterization of the Double Perovskite Ba2BixSc0.2Co1.8-xO6-δ (x=0.1, 0.2)",10.1021/cm3021484
7,11142,Cooperative oxygen displacements that create larger B-O than B'-O mean bond length are characteristic of oxide ions in a cubic perovskite with geometric tolerance factor t > 1 as illustrated by ferroelectric BaTiO3.,"Characterization of the Double Perovskite Ba2BixSc0.2Co1.8-xO6-δ (x=0.1, 0.2)",10.1021/cm3021484
8,11142,"Disordering of the double-perovskite oxide-ion displacements occurs over the range 350-400 degrees C; long-range, frustrated magnetic order occurs below a T-c approximate to 35 K. X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show the absence of low-spin Co3+ at room temperature, and the rate-limiting step of the oxygen-reduction reaction on these oxides acting as cathodes of a solid oxide fuel cell is shown to be electron transfer from the oxide to an adsorbed O-2, which we conjecture occurs at surface intermediate-spin Co3+ ions.","Characterization of the Double Perovskite Ba2BixSc0.2Co1.8-xO6-δ (x=0.1, 0.2)",10.1021/cm3021484
