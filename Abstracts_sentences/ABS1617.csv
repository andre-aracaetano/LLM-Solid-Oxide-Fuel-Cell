5,1617,Solid oxide fuel cells adopting this dense gadolinium-doped ceria/yttria-stabilized zirconia bilayer electrolyte exhibited high power density of 1.251 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C and high stability for 100 h. These significant improvements in performances is attributed to the greatly reduced porosity (< 2.5%) of the bilayer electrolyte when there are no side reactions between the gadolinium-doped ceria and yttria-stabilized zirconia layers.,Facile fabrication strategy of highly dense gadolinium-doped ceria/yttria-stabilized zirconia bilayer electrolyte via cold isostatic pressing for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.01.057
