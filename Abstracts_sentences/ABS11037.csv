1,11037,"A Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate, La2NiO4+delta (LN), is examined as a coating material for metallic interconnects of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating at intermediate temperatures.",Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate as coating for chromia-forming stainless steel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.147
2,11037,Isothermal oxidation of the coated and uncoated SS430 alloy with and without pre-annealing at 850 degrees C in air suggests that the coating reduces significantly the oxidation rate and impact of thermal cycle on the integrity of the scale.,Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate as coating for chromia-forming stainless steel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.147
3,11037,"After an annealing in air at 850 degrees C for 50 h, the LN coating has turned into to La(Cr,Ni)O-3 (LCN) perovskite, but no spalling is observed because of the matching thermal expansion of LN and LCN to SS430.",Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate as coating for chromia-forming stainless steel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.147
4,11037,"A low area specific resistance (ASR) of 2.5 x 10(-3) Omega cm(2) is observed for the sample with the resultant LCN coating, indicating LN can be a good candidate as a coating for interconnects of SOFC.",Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate as coating for chromia-forming stainless steel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.147
