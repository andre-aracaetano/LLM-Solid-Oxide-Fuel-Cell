1,4202,"We have studied the properties of a LSM-ScSZ composite cathode fabricated by a two-step process including dip-coating LSM framework and ion-impregnating ScSZ, for using with anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells.","Scandia-stabilized zirconia-impregnated (La, Sr)MnO3 cathode for tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10008-010-1029-5
2,4202,"A preliminary examination of the single tubular cell, consisting of a Ni-YSZ anode support tube, a Ni-ScSZ anode functional layer, a ScSZ electrolyte film, and a LSM-ScSZ cathode fabricated by ion-impregnating, has been carried out, and an improved performance was obtained.","Scandia-stabilized zirconia-impregnated (La, Sr)MnO3 cathode for tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10008-010-1029-5
3,4202,The polarization resistance of the cathode side clearly decreased for impregnating the electronic conducting phase (LSM) with the ionic conducting phase (ScSZ).,"Scandia-stabilized zirconia-impregnated (La, Sr)MnO3 cathode for tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10008-010-1029-5
4,4202,"And the single cell with the impregnated cathode generated a maximum power density of 433 mW cm(-2) at 850 A degrees C, when operating with humidified hydrogen.","Scandia-stabilized zirconia-impregnated (La, Sr)MnO3 cathode for tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10008-010-1029-5
