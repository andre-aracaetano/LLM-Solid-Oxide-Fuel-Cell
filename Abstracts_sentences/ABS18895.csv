3,18895,"From quantitative Rietveld analysis it is found unequivocally that there is a two-phase coexistence (orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases with similar to 89 and 11 weight%, respectively) in the temperature range 300-470 K and a three-phase coexistence (with a new cubic phase with space group Pm3m) in the temperature range 480-1400 K. The weight percentages of the orthorhombic, rhombohedral and cubic phases were found to be similar to 49%, 37% and 14%, respectively, in the temperature range 480-1300 K, while over 1350-1400 K, the average weight percentages of orthorhombic, rhombohedral and cubic phases were found to be similar to 41%, 41% and 18%, respectively.",Structural study of La0.75Sr0.25CrO3 at high temperatures,10.1088/0953-8984/18/37/022
