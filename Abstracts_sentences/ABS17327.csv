1,17327,Anode-supported yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) solid oxide fuel cells utilizing a Sr-doped LaFeO(3) (LSF) cathode show improved performance with the incorporation of a Sm-doped CeO(2) layer between the cathode and YSZ electrolyte.,Interaction between La(Sr)FeO3 SOFC cathode and YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00158-9
2,17327,"Detailed Xray diffraction (XRD) analysis of LSF-YSZ reaction mixtures indicates no strontium or lanthanum zirconate formation between these materials even at 1400 degreesC. However, a significant shift in the LSF diffraction peaks is readily apparent and corresponds to a unit cell volume expansion.",Interaction between La(Sr)FeO3 SOFC cathode and YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00158-9
3,17327,The most likely scenario for the change in volume is considered to be the incorporation of Zr(4+) cations in the perovskite structure.,Interaction between La(Sr)FeO3 SOFC cathode and YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00158-9
4,17327,"The presence of the Zr cations subsequently results in reduced electrical conductivity of the cathode, potentially explaining the need for the aforementioned ceria interlayer.",Interaction between La(Sr)FeO3 SOFC cathode and YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00158-9
