3,6601,"Upon the comparison of electrochemical performance of Ni-YSZ anode and TiO2 modified Ni-YSZ anode in the state-of-the-art single cell (Ni-YSZ/ YSZ/LSCM), the modified anodes exhibit markedly improved peak powder density with simulated biogas fuel (70% CH4+ 30% CO2) at 850 degrees C with less coking after 40 h operation.",High temperature thermo-photocatalysis driven carbon removal in direct biogas fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cclet.2021.01.050
4,6601,"The high activity and carbon deposition resistance of the modified anode is possibly attributed to the in situ generated hydroxyl radical from the reduced TiOx powder under high temperature infrared light excitation, which is supported by detailed analysis of microstructural information of anodes and the powder-based thermo-photocatalytic experiments.",High temperature thermo-photocatalysis driven carbon removal in direct biogas fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cclet.2021.01.050
