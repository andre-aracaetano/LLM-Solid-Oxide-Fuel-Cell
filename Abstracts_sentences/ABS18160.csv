1,18160,A proton-conducting solid oxide electrolysis cell (H-SOEC) is a promising device that efficiently converts electrical energy to chemical energy.,Intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells with thin proton-conducting electrolyte and a robust air electrode,10.1039/c7ta05841a
2,18160,A H-SOEC offers a number of merits over oxygen-ion-conducting solid oxide electrolysis cells (O-SOECs).,Intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells with thin proton-conducting electrolyte and a robust air electrode,10.1039/c7ta05841a
3,18160,"However, the development of H-SOECs is far behind that of O-SOECs, mainly due to technical challenges such as the stability of the electrolyte and electrode in a H2O-containing atmosphere under operating conditions and the fabrication of a thin electrolyte layer.",Intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells with thin proton-conducting electrolyte and a robust air electrode,10.1039/c7ta05841a
4,18160,"In this study, BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BZY) electrolyte and a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (SFM) air electrode, both are stable in a H2O-containing atmosphere under operating conditions, are evaluated in H-SOECs.",Intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells with thin proton-conducting electrolyte and a robust air electrode,10.1039/c7ta05841a
5,18160,"In addition, in order to improve the performance of H-SOECs, a thin BZY electrolyte layer (about 16 mu m in thickness) and nano-scaled SFM-BZY air electrode are fabricated successfully, showing excellent SOEC performance (-0.21 A cm(-2) at 600 degrees C) and achieving a faradaic efficiency of 63.6% at intermediate temperature.",Intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells with thin proton-conducting electrolyte and a robust air electrode,10.1039/c7ta05841a
