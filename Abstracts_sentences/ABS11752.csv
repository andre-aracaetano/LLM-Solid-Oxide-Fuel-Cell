1,11752,"Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) comprising NiO-samarium-doped ceria (SDC) (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9) composite anode, thin tri-layer electrolyte, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF)-La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) composite cathode were fabricated.",Electrical and stability performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate thin electrolyte,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.01.039
2,11752,The thin tri-layer consisting of an 11-mu m thick LSGM electrolyte layer and a 12-mu m thick La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 (LDC) layer on each side of the LSGM was prepared by centrifugal casting and co-firing technique.,Electrical and stability performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate thin electrolyte,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.01.039
3,11752,"The performance of the cells operated with humidified H-2 as fuel and ambient air as oxidant showed a maximum power density of 1.23 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. A stability test of about 100 h was carried out and some deterioration of output power was observed, while the open circuit voltage (OCV) kept unchanged.",Electrical and stability performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate thin electrolyte,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.01.039
4,11752,Impedance measurements showed that both the electrolyte ohmic resistance and the electrode polarization increased with time and the latter dominated the degradation.,Electrical and stability performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate thin electrolyte,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.01.039
