5,8749,"The distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analyses of electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in different oxygen partial pressure and long-term operation indicate that the performance enhancement is caused by the facilitated oxygen surface adsorption-dissociation process and suppression of Sr segregation on modified LSCF cathode, thus achieving a higher peak power density of 1.40 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and better long-term operation stability of only 3% voltage decline rate after 80 h operation.",Enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction activity and durability of a solid oxide fuel cell cathode by surface modification of a hybrid coating,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.198
