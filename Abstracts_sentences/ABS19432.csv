1,19432,"We study the structure, crystallization, and performances of the sealing glasses with the composition (mol.%) of 12Al(2)O(3)center dot 8B(2)O(3)center dot 40SiO(2)center dot 40RO (R = Mg, Ca, Sr) for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) before and after isothermal treatment at 700 degrees C, which is within the operation temperature range (600-800 degrees C) of SOFCs.","Structure, crystallization, and performances of alkaline-earth boroaluminosilicate sealing glasses for SOFCs",10.1111/jace.17718
2,19432,The crystallization behavior has been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction under both dynamic and isothermal conditions.,"Structure, crystallization, and performances of alkaline-earth boroaluminosilicate sealing glasses for SOFCs",10.1111/jace.17718
3,19432,The structural evolution is probed using the Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies.,"Structure, crystallization, and performances of alkaline-earth boroaluminosilicate sealing glasses for SOFCs",10.1111/jace.17718
4,19432,"The performances of the sealing glasses are characterized in terms of the coefficient of thermal expansion, the crystallization-induced stress at glass-steel interface.","Structure, crystallization, and performances of alkaline-earth boroaluminosilicate sealing glasses for SOFCs",10.1111/jace.17718
5,19432,We find that strong crystallization occurs at the operation temperature (700 degrees C) far below the crystallization onset temperature measured by DSC.,"Structure, crystallization, and performances of alkaline-earth boroaluminosilicate sealing glasses for SOFCs",10.1111/jace.17718
6,19432,The structure origin of this anomalous crystallization is discussed in terms of structural heterogeneity of the three studied glasses.,"Structure, crystallization, and performances of alkaline-earth boroaluminosilicate sealing glasses for SOFCs",10.1111/jace.17718
7,19432,"We determine the residual stress at the interface between the Ca-containing glass and the steel after isothermal treatment at 700 degrees C for 48 h, but this stress does not lead to falling off the glass layer from the steel.","Structure, crystallization, and performances of alkaline-earth boroaluminosilicate sealing glasses for SOFCs",10.1111/jace.17718
8,19432,This indicates that this glass is a good candidate to be applied in SOFCs.,"Structure, crystallization, and performances of alkaline-earth boroaluminosilicate sealing glasses for SOFCs",10.1111/jace.17718
