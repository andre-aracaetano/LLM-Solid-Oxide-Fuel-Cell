2,442,"The models are compared and tested for single fuel cells and multi-cell stacks of planar solid-oxide fuel cells, the three main approaches considered are (a) a detailed numerical model (DNM) of flow, heat and mass transfer and electrochemistry, (b) a flow-based methodology based on a distributed resistance analogy (DRA), and (c) a presumed-flow methodology (PFM).",Computer methods for performance prediction in fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00065-X
3,442,"The results from each of the above approaches are compared in detail, and merits and drawbacks discussed.",Computer methods for performance prediction in fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00065-X
4,442,"It is shown that, under certain circumstances, the simpler approaches have the potential to supplant or complement the direct numerical method in the analysis of fuel cells.",Computer methods for performance prediction in fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00065-X
