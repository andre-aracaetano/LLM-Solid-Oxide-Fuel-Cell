6,4605,"Electrochemical impedance and scanning electron microscopy analyses show that the evolution of SDCN40 is minimal, and coarsening and Cr poisoning of the Pr6O11 catalyst are the dominant degradation mechanisms.",Progress in durability of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226935
7,4605,"These degradation mechanisms are addressed by implementing three additional fabrication steps: (1) preoxidation of the metal support, (2) deposition of thin and protective atomic layer deposition (ALD) coatings throughout the cathode-side electrode and support, and (3) in situ pre-coarsening of the catalysts.",Progress in durability of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226935
8,4605,"A favorable tradeoff is achieved: the combination of the three fabrication steps reduces degradation rate at 0.7 V and 700 degrees C by two orders of magnitude to 2.3% kh(-1), while sacrificing 35% of initial power density.",Progress in durability of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226935
9,4605,The catalyst pre-coarsening step is primarily responsible for the loss of performance.,Progress in durability of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226935
