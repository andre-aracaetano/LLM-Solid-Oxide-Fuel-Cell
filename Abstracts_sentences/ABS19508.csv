2,19508,"By using SrTiO3 as a model system of technological importance, and by combining electrical and chemical tracer diffusion experiments with computational modeling, it is revealed that dislocations alter the equilibrium concentration and distribution of electronic and ionic defects.",Tunable Oxygen Diffusion and Electronic Conduction in SrTiO3 by Dislocation-Induced Space Charge Fields,10.1002/adfm.201700243
3,19508,The easier reducibility of the dislocation cores increases the n-type conductivity by 50 times at oxygen pressures below 10(-5) atm at 650 degrees C. At higher oxygen pressures the p-type conductivity decreases by 50 times and the oxygen diffusion coefficient reduces by three orders of magnitude.,Tunable Oxygen Diffusion and Electronic Conduction in SrTiO3 by Dislocation-Induced Space Charge Fields,10.1002/adfm.201700243
4,19508,The strongly altered electrical and oxygen diffusion properties in SrTiO3 arise because of the existence of overlapping electrostatic fields around the positively charged dislocation cores.,Tunable Oxygen Diffusion and Electronic Conduction in SrTiO3 by Dislocation-Induced Space Charge Fields,10.1002/adfm.201700243
5,19508,"The findings and the approach are broadly important and have the potential for significantly impacting the functionalities of electrochemical and/or electronic applications such as thin film oxide electronics, memristive systems, sensors, micro-solid oxide fuel cells, and catalysts, whose functionalities rely on the concentration and distribution of charged point defects.",Tunable Oxygen Diffusion and Electronic Conduction in SrTiO3 by Dislocation-Induced Space Charge Fields,10.1002/adfm.201700243
