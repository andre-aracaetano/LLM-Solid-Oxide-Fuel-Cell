1,1958,"The performance of a series of perovskite oxides having the mutual chemical formula and structure La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5X0.5O3-delta (X Co, Fe, Ti, Mn) as solid oxide fuel cell anode electrocatalysts depends on the nature of the substituent element X. The electrocatalytic activity for methane oxidation in a fuel cell correlates well with ex-situ temperature programmed catalytic conversion of CH4, X = CO > Mn similar to Fe > Ti, tinder temperature programmed reaction conditions in 5% CH4/He.","Correlation of Fuel Cell Anode Electrocatalytic and ex situ Catalytic Activity of Perovskites La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5X0.5O3-δ (X = Ti, Mn, Fe, Co)",10.1021/cm901875u
