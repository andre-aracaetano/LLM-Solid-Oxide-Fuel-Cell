1,8933,"Doped ceria is one of the most promising materials for an electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and electrolysis cells (SOECs), because it has higher ionic conductivity than stabilized zirconia.",Blocking layer for prevention of current leakage for reversible solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysis cells with ceria-based electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.176
2,8933,"However, current leakage through the ceria-based electrolyte occurs in SOFC and SOEC operating conditions, because electron conductivity appears at low oxygen partial pressures.",Blocking layer for prevention of current leakage for reversible solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysis cells with ceria-based electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.176
3,8933,"In order to prevent the current leakage, the BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BCY) blocking layer was inserted between Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolyte (GDC) and Ni-GDC fuel electrode.",Blocking layer for prevention of current leakage for reversible solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysis cells with ceria-based electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.176
4,8933,"The open circuit voltage for the cell with BCY blocking layer increased by 50 -60 mV compared to that without BCY, suggesting that BCY is a proton -O(2-)on mixed conductor and it has low electronic conductivity.",Blocking layer for prevention of current leakage for reversible solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysis cells with ceria-based electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.176
5,8933,The performance of SOFC and SOEC using the GDC electrolyte and the BCY blocking layer was better than that using a conventional yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte at 500 degrees C.,Blocking layer for prevention of current leakage for reversible solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysis cells with ceria-based electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.176
6,8933,The hydrogen consumption and production was successfully demonstrated in accordance with Faradays law for the reversible SOFC -SOEC with the GDC electrolyte and BCY blocking layer.,Blocking layer for prevention of current leakage for reversible solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysis cells with ceria-based electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.176
