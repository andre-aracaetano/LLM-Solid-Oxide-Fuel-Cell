6,17666,Activation overpotential is predicted by use of temperature dependent linear equations at both the anode and cathode sides.,Modeling of Overpotentials in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC Using a Detailed Simulation Model,10.1115/1.4004018
7,17666,"It is found that both ohmic and activation overpotentials decrease considerably with increasing temperature, while concentration overpotentials increase moderately with increasing temperature.",Modeling of Overpotentials in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC Using a Detailed Simulation Model,10.1115/1.4004018
8,17666,"The effect on concentration overpotentials can be explained by the reduced gas density with increased temperature, despite the increasing diffusion coefficient.",Modeling of Overpotentials in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC Using a Detailed Simulation Model,10.1115/1.4004018

10,17666,At low pore size the Knudsen diffusion coefficient is a bottleneck for the diffusion coefficient since it is much lower than the binary diffusion coefficient.,Modeling of Overpotentials in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC Using a Detailed Simulation Model,10.1115/1.4004018
11,17666,It has been demonstrated that by increasing the pore size the Knudsen diffusion coefficient is improved.,Modeling of Overpotentials in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC Using a Detailed Simulation Model,10.1115/1.4004018
12,17666,The effect of porosity has much in common with the effect of pore size; increasing porosity leads to decreased concentration overpotential due to the improved diffusion coefficient.,Modeling of Overpotentials in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC Using a Detailed Simulation Model,10.1115/1.4004018
13,17666,"As a natural phenomenon for anode-supported cells, most of the concentration overpotentials take place at the anode side due to its thick structure despite the high diffusion coefficient of hydrogen.",Modeling of Overpotentials in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC Using a Detailed Simulation Model,10.1115/1.4004018
14,17666,It must be underlined that in this study the effect of different porosities and pore sizes is modeled at the anode and cathode substrates only without taking into account the length of the three phase boundary (L-TPB) near the electrolyte interface.,Modeling of Overpotentials in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC Using a Detailed Simulation Model,10.1115/1.4004018
15,17666,"However, since these microstructural parameters can have an impact on the L-TPB, they can also have an impact on the activation overpotentials.",Modeling of Overpotentials in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC Using a Detailed Simulation Model,10.1115/1.4004018
