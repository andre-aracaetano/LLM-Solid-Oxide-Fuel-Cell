1,10128,A chemically stable electrolyte structure was developed for proton-conducting SOFCs by using two layers of stable BaZr0.7Pr0.1Y0.2O3-delta to sandwich a highly-conductive but unstable BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta electrolyte layer.,A chemically stable electrolyte with a novel sandwiched structure for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.elecom.2013.09.011
2,10128,"The sandwiched electrolyte structure showed good chemical stability in both CO2 and H2O atmosphere, indicating that the BZPY layers effectively protect the inner BCY electrolyte, while the BCY electrolyte alone decomposed completely under the same conditions.",A chemically stable electrolyte with a novel sandwiched structure for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.elecom.2013.09.011
3,10128,"Fuel cell prototypes fabricated with the sandwiched electrolyte achieved a relatively high performance of 185 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, with a high electrolyte film conductivity of 4 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C.
