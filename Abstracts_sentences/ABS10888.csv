1,10888,"Although the influence of supporting layer features on the steady performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has been discussed in previous studies, the literature shows a lack of similar studies for unsteady performance.","A comprehensive comparison of performances of anode-supported, cathode-supported, and electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells during warming-up process",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125779
2,10888,The present study numerically assesses the effects of the type and thickness of the supporting layer on the warming-up process of an SOFC.,"A comprehensive comparison of performances of anode-supported, cathode-supported, and electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells during warming-up process",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125779
3,10888,"The warming-up process is desired to be rapid; however, the rapidness can impose harmful temperature gradients.","A comprehensive comparison of performances of anode-supported, cathode-supported, and electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells during warming-up process",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125779
4,10888,The warming-up process is also energy-demanding.,"A comprehensive comparison of performances of anode-supported, cathode-supported, and electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells during warming-up process",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125779
5,10888,"Therefore, all the mentioned factors are considered in the present study, and an optimal set of supporting layer features is proposed using a multi-criteria decision analysis approach.","A comprehensive comparison of performances of anode-supported, cathode-supported, and electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells during warming-up process",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125779
6,10888,The results indicate that the warming-up durations of anodesupported and cathode-supported cells are close to each other but considerably lower than that of the electrolytesupported cell.,"A comprehensive comparison of performances of anode-supported, cathode-supported, and electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells during warming-up process",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125779
7,10888,"Furthermore, the warming-up duration, which is directly proportional to the supporting layer thickness, is more sensitive to the electrolyte thickness than the anode and cathode thicknesses.","A comprehensive comparison of performances of anode-supported, cathode-supported, and electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells during warming-up process",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125779
8,10888,"On the other hand, the temperature gradients inside the SOFC, which are inversely proportional to the supporting layer thickness, are more affected by the electrolyte thickness than the anode and cathode thicknesses.","A comprehensive comparison of performances of anode-supported, cathode-supported, and electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells during warming-up process",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125779
9,10888,"In terms of energy usage, the electrode-supported cells are seen to be superior to the electrolyte-supported cells.","A comprehensive comparison of performances of anode-supported, cathode-supported, and electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells during warming-up process",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125779
10,10888,"Considering all the concerns simultaneously, the anode-supported cell with a supporting layer thickness of 1.5 mm is proposed as the best trade-off solution.","A comprehensive comparison of performances of anode-supported, cathode-supported, and electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells during warming-up process",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125779
