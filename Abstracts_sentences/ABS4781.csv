1,4781,"In this work, a cost-competitive oxide system of Ni-substituted Sr(1-x)Ti(0.5)Pe(0.5)Ni(0.1)O(3-delta) (STFN, x = 0, 0.02, 0.05), is evaluated as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathode.","Stable, efficient and cost-competitive Ni-substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of A-site deficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227762
2,4781,All STFN oxides present cubic perovskite structure with maximum conductivities over 22 S/cm in air.,"Stable, efficient and cost-competitive Ni-substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of A-site deficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227762
3,4781,The introduction of Sr deficiency yields higher oxygen vacancy and lower thermal expansion coefficient.,"Stable, efficient and cost-competitive Ni-substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of A-site deficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227762
4,4781,"As a result, the cathode polarization resistance of 0.107 Omega cm(2) is obtained for Sr0.95Ti0.3Fe0.6Ni0.1O3-delta (STFN-95) at 750 degrees C and po(2) = 0.21 atm, with weak oxygen partial pressure dependence.","Stable, efficient and cost-competitive Ni-substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of A-site deficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227762
5,4781,"Specially, STFN-95 presents higher stability with slower R-p increasing rate in lower oxygen partial pressure of 0.14 atm than in 0.21 atm, which greatly facilitates the cathode practical application in SOFC stack under high air utilization condition.","Stable, efficient and cost-competitive Ni-substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of A-site deficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227762
6,4781,"Finally, a stable operation of 400 h is achieved using STFN-95 cathode on anode supported single cell at 750 degrees C, without showing Sr and other elements diffusions.","Stable, efficient and cost-competitive Ni-substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of A-site deficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227762
