1,8815,Lanthanum silicate oxyapatite (LSO) has superior properties as a solid electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications.,Anisotropic Electric Conductivity and Battery Performance in C-axis Oriented Lanthanum Silicate Oxyapatite Prepared by Slip Casting in a Strong Magnetic Field,10.2320/matertrans.Y-M2019832
2,8815,This is because LSO has a higher oxide-ion conductivity compared to yttria-stabilized zirconia at temperatures below 600 degrees C. Textured LSO bulk ceramics were fabricated based on a magnetic field-assisted colloidal processing technique.,Anisotropic Electric Conductivity and Battery Performance in C-axis Oriented Lanthanum Silicate Oxyapatite Prepared by Slip Casting in a Strong Magnetic Field,10.2320/matertrans.Y-M2019832
3,8815,The c-axis of the LSO was aligned parallel to the applied magnetic field during the consolidation by slip casting.,Anisotropic Electric Conductivity and Battery Performance in C-axis Oriented Lanthanum Silicate Oxyapatite Prepared by Slip Casting in a Strong Magnetic Field,10.2320/matertrans.Y-M2019832
4,8815,The anisotropic electric conductivity of the textured bulk ceramics was evaluated by the impedance spectroscopy method.,Anisotropic Electric Conductivity and Battery Performance in C-axis Oriented Lanthanum Silicate Oxyapatite Prepared by Slip Casting in a Strong Magnetic Field,10.2320/matertrans.Y-M2019832
5,8815,It was confirmed that very high conductivity was obtained along the c-axis.,Anisotropic Electric Conductivity and Battery Performance in C-axis Oriented Lanthanum Silicate Oxyapatite Prepared by Slip Casting in a Strong Magnetic Field,10.2320/matertrans.Y-M2019832
6,8815,Higher fuel cell performance was demonstrated in the textured LSO compared to the random LSO.,Anisotropic Electric Conductivity and Battery Performance in C-axis Oriented Lanthanum Silicate Oxyapatite Prepared by Slip Casting in a Strong Magnetic Field,10.2320/matertrans.Y-M2019832
