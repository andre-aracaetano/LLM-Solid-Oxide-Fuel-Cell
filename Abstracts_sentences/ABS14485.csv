3,14485,"Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and impedance spectroscopy were employed for phase formation, chemical compatibility, and electrochemical characterization.",Structural and electrochemical characterization of Ce0.85Ca0.05Sm0.1O1.9 oxide ion electrolyte with Sr-doped LaMnO3 and SmCoO3 cathodes,10.1007/s11581-008-0240-1
4,14485,"PXRD studies on 1:1 weight ratio of heat-treated (1,000 degrees C for 3 days) mixtures of SSC or LSM and CCS revealed the presence of fluorite-type and perovskite-like phases.",Structural and electrochemical characterization of Ce0.85Ca0.05Sm0.1O1.9 oxide ion electrolyte with Sr-doped LaMnO3 and SmCoO3 cathodes,10.1007/s11581-008-0240-1
5,14485,"The area-specific resistance (ASR) value in air was lower for SSC cathodes (4.3-0.15 Omega cm(2)) compared to those of LSM (407-11 Omega cm(2)) over the investigated temperature range of 600-800 degrees C. As expected, a significant increase in ASR was observed in Ar as compared to air.",Structural and electrochemical characterization of Ce0.85Ca0.05Sm0.1O1.9 oxide ion electrolyte with Sr-doped LaMnO3 and SmCoO3 cathodes,10.1007/s11581-008-0240-1
