2,15116,"By impregnating this 'backbone' with electrocatalytically active coatings of metal oxides and metallic particles, it is possible to create high performance SOFC anodes which offer improved redox stability and tolerance to non-optimal fuel gases.","Preparation and Testing of Metal/Ce0.80Gd0.20O1.90 (Metal: Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) Co-Impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Anode Microstructures for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/2.1181904jes
3,15116,"Here, we present short-term test data for SOFC containing LSCTA-anode 'backbones' impregnated with a variety of catalyst systems including: Ni/CGO, Pd/CGO, Pt/CGO, Rh/CGO and Ru/CGO.","Preparation and Testing of Metal/Ce0.80Gd0.20O1.90 (Metal: Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) Co-Impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Anode Microstructures for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/2.1181904jes
4,15116,"Electrolyte-supported SOFC containing Ni/CGO impregnated anodes showed large reductions in Area Specific Resistance (ASR), in comparison to previous generation research (0.55 Omega cm(2) versus 1.2 Omega cm(2), respectively).","Preparation and Testing of Metal/Ce0.80Gd0.20O1.90 (Metal: Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) Co-Impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Anode Microstructures for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/2.1181904jes
5,15116,"Exchange of the Ni component, for Pd and Rh, led to much lower ASR of 0.39 Omega cm(2) and 0.41 Omega cm(2) (in 97% H-2: 3% H2O, at 900 degrees C and 0.8 V), respectively.","Preparation and Testing of Metal/Ce0.80Gd0.20O1.90 (Metal: Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) Co-Impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Anode Microstructures for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/2.1181904jes
6,15116,"Equivalent circuit fitting of AC impedance spectra revealed the absence of an anode charge transfer process for the Rh/CGO catalyst system above 875 degrees C, in comparison to all other systems, identifying this system as a potential replacement for the Ni-based cermet.","Preparation and Testing of Metal/Ce0.80Gd0.20O1.90 (Metal: Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) Co-Impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Anode Microstructures for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/2.1181904jes
