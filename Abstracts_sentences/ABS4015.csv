1,4015,Past research in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) performance assessment and improvement has focused on cell operating voltage (efficiency).,Degradation measurement and analysis for cells and stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.06.047
2,4015,"Related to this metric, but distinct and equally important, is performance degradation.",Degradation measurement and analysis for cells and stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.06.047
3,4015,"This paper examines cell degradation, provides key definitions needed for its characterization, and discusses the relationship of various cell performance variables.",Degradation measurement and analysis for cells and stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.06.047
4,4015,"To characterize degradation, two parameters are defined, namely, area-specific resistance (ASR), and degradation rate (DR).",Degradation measurement and analysis for cells and stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.06.047
5,4015,"The ASR of a cell/stack increases as a result of degradation, and therefore needs to be modeled as a time-dependent parameter.",Degradation measurement and analysis for cells and stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.06.047
6,4015,"A model for SOFC cell performance is used to describe polarization losses, and to predict degradation performance.",Degradation measurement and analysis for cells and stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.06.047
7,4015,The model is then used to demonstrate the use of ASR and DR in the assessment of degradation.,Degradation measurement and analysis for cells and stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.06.047
8,4015,Available experimental data is separately used to do the same.,Degradation measurement and analysis for cells and stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.06.047
9,4015,ASR is shown to be insensitive to certain variations in test conditions and therefore is the preferred parameter for fuel cell developers when comparing performance differences arising from incremental changes in design/materials.,Degradation measurement and analysis for cells and stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.06.047
10,4015,"DR is the preferred parameter for determining changes in efficiency over the lifetime of the cell/stack, which is a key concern for end users.",Degradation measurement and analysis for cells and stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.06.047
