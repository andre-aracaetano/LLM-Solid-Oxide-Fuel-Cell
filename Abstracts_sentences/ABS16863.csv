1,16863,"This study aimed to enhance the sinterability and conductivity of yttria fully stabilized zirconia electrolyte through co-doping by 2 mol% of ZnO and different contents of MnO2 (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 mol%) at two sintering temperatures of 1300 and 1400 degrees C. Phase composition identification, density, microstructure, and conductivity of the samples were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Archimedes' method, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively.",Enhancing sintering behavior and conductivity of YSZ electrolyte by co-doping of ZnO and MnO2,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2024.129051
