1,6587,The electrochemical performances of Ag-(BaO)(0.11)(Bi2O3)(0.89) (BSB) composite cathodes on Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolytes have been investigated for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs) using ac impedance spectroscopy from 500 to 700 degrees C. Results indicate that the electrochemical properties of these composites are quite sensitive to the composition and the microstructure of the cathode.,Development of Ag-(BaO)0.11(Bi2O3)0.89 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.026
2,6587,"The optimum BSB addition (50% by volume) to Ag resulted in about 20 times lower area specific resistance (ASR) at 650 degrees C. The ASR values for the Ag50-BSB and Ag cathodes were 0.32 and 6.5 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C, respectively.",Development of Ag-(BaO)0.11(Bi2O3)0.89 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.026
