3,4343,"The results indicated that the cell with the nanostructured porous thin cathode sintered at 950 degrees C showed relatively high maximum power density of 212 mW cm(-2) at 500 degrees C and 114 mW cm(-2) at 450 degrees C, and low interfacial polarization resistance of 0.79 Omega cm(2) at 500 degrees C and 2.81 Omega cm(2) at 450 degrees C. Hence, the nanostructured porous thin cathode is expected to be a promising cathode for low-temperature SOFCs.",Preparation and performance of nanostructured porous thin cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells by spin-coating method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.09.092
