1,10305,Solid oxide cells (SOCs) are mutually convertible energy devices capable of generating electricity from chemical fuels including hydrogen in the fuel cell mode and producing green hydrogen using electricity from renewable but intermittent solar and wind resources in the electrolysis cell mode.,Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of Oxygen Electrodes via Incorporating Highly Conductive Sm3+ and Nd3+ Double-Doped Ceria for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.0c17238
2,10305,An effective approach to enhance the performance of SOCs at reduced temperatures is by developing highly active oxygen electrodes for both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions.,Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of Oxygen Electrodes via Incorporating Highly Conductive Sm3+ and Nd3+ Double-Doped Ceria for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.0c17238

4,10305,We develop a novel La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-SNDC composite oxygen electrode.,Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of Oxygen Electrodes via Incorporating Highly Conductive Sm3+ and Nd3+ Double-Doped Ceria for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.0c17238
5,10305,"Compared with the conventional LSCF-Gd-doped ceria oxygen electrode, the LSCF-SNDC exhibits similar to 35% lower cathode polarization resistance (0.042 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C) owing to rapid oxygen incorporation and surface diffusion kinetics.",Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of Oxygen Electrodes via Incorporating Highly Conductive Sm3+ and Nd3+ Double-Doped Ceria for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.0c17238
6,10305,"Furthermore, the SOC with the LSCF-SNDC oxygen electrode and the SNDC buffer layer yields a remarkable performance in both the fuel cell (1.54 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C) and electrolysis cell (1.37 A cm(-2) at 750 degrees C) modes because the incorporation of SNDC promotes the surface diffusion kinetics at the oxygen electrode bulk and the activity of the triple phase boundary at the interface.",Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of Oxygen Electrodes via Incorporating Highly Conductive Sm3+ and Nd3+ Double-Doped Ceria for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.0c17238
