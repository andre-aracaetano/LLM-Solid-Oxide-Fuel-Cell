1,684,"The semiconductor-ionic composite membrane has been recently developed for a novel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), i.e., the semiconductor-ion membrane fuel cell (SIMFC).",High-performance SOFC based on a novel semiconductor-ionic SrFeO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ membrane,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.209
2,684,"In this work, the perovskite-type SrFeO3-delta (SFO) as semiconductor material was composited with ionic conductor Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) to form the SFO-SDC composite membrane for SIMFCs.",High-performance SOFC based on a novel semiconductor-ionic SrFeO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ membrane,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.209
3,684,"The SFO-SDC SIMFCs using the optimized weight ratio of 3:7 SFO-SDC membrane obtained the best performances, 780 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C, compared to 348 mW cm(-2) obtained from the pure SDC electrolyte fuel cell.",High-performance SOFC based on a novel semiconductor-ionic SrFeO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ membrane,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.209
4,684,"Introduction of SFO into SDC can extend the triple phase boundary and provide more active sites for accelerating the fuel cell reactions, thus significantly enhanced the cell power output.",High-performance SOFC based on a novel semiconductor-ionic SrFeO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ membrane,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.209
5,684,"Moreover, SFO was employed as the cathode, and a higher power output, 907 mW cm(-2) was achieved, suggesting that SFO cathode is more compatible for the SFO-SDC system in SIMFCs.",High-performance SOFC based on a novel semiconductor-ionic SrFeO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ membrane,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.209
