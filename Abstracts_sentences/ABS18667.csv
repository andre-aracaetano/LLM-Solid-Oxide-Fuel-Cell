2,18667,Thermodynamic and electrochemical performance tests confirmed the effectiveness of the LSF20 protective layer for decreasing the oxidation rate of the alloy and abating the chromium poisoning to the cathode.,Evaluation of lanthanum ferrite coated interconnect for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2007.09.002
3,18667,"Upon exposure to air at 800 degrees C for 100 h, the oxidation rate of LSF20-coated alloy was reduced 56 folds compared to that of the uncoated alloy, and the LSF20-coated alloy produced a low area specific resistance of 1 m Omega cm(2) after oxidized in air at 800 degrees C for 1000 h. Half-cell measurement results indicate that the influence of chromium poisoning on the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta cathode was greatly inhibited with the LSF20-coated SUS430 alloy as interconnects.",Evaluation of lanthanum ferrite coated interconnect for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2007.09.002
