3,9050,"The coarsening of nickel after high temperature thermal treatment poses substantial degradation to the deposited structure, therefore, methods of anchoring the nickel metal to the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) scaffold have been evaluated to stabilize fine scale electro-catalyst particles.",Anchoring of Infiltrated Nickel Electro-Catalyst by Addition of Aluminum Titanate,10.1149/1.3610226
4,9050,Metastable aluminum titanate was introduced into the porous YSZ anode scaffold to facilitate a step-wise chemical reaction in the formation of nickel aluminate followed by zirconium titanate to anchor the nickel metal catalyst.,Anchoring of Infiltrated Nickel Electro-Catalyst by Addition of Aluminum Titanate,10.1149/1.3610226
5,9050,"SEM observation of thermally treated nickel infiltrated scaffolds indicates excellent preservation of the nickel network at 800 degrees C for 72 h. Electrochemical tests show not only decreased degradation rates, but also increased initial performance levels due to the additive.",Anchoring of Infiltrated Nickel Electro-Catalyst by Addition of Aluminum Titanate,10.1149/1.3610226
