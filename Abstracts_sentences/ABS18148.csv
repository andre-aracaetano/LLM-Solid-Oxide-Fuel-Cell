1,18148,"Ceria doped with rare earth ions (Ce1-xMxO2-y (y = x/2)), which contain many oxygen vacancies, have become excellent electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells and important buffer layers for coated conductors.",Microstructural evolution and its influence on oxygen diffusion in yttrium-doped ceria thin films,10.1088/2053-1591/ac3952
2,18148,"In this paper, Y3+ ions were doped into the lattice of CeO2 to form Ce1-xYxO2-y (CYO) thin films regarded as buffer layers to reduce oxygen diffusion on silicon substrates.",Microstructural evolution and its influence on oxygen diffusion in yttrium-doped ceria thin films,10.1088/2053-1591/ac3952
3,18148,"It was revealed that the CYO films gradually transformed from a complete fluorite structure into a defective fluorite structure with more and more oxygen vacancies as the proportion of Y3+ ions in CYO films increased from zero, and then the defective fluorite structure transformed into rare earth C-type structure when the proportion of Y3+ ions was beyond 0.5.",Microstructural evolution and its influence on oxygen diffusion in yttrium-doped ceria thin films,10.1088/2053-1591/ac3952
4,18148,"Moreover, at the beginning, the degree of oxygen diffusion showed an uptrend; but after the proportion of Y3+ ions reached a certain value, the degree of oxygen diffusion turned into a downtrend.",Microstructural evolution and its influence on oxygen diffusion in yttrium-doped ceria thin films,10.1088/2053-1591/ac3952
