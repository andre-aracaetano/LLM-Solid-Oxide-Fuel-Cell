3,9686,It is found that carbon nanofibers are obviously formed on PSCFN while spherical carbons are formed on Ni-YSZ.,Mechanisms of methane decomposition and carbon species oxidation on the Pr0.42Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-σ electrode with high catalytic activity,10.1039/c5ta07599h
4,9686,Analyses of the results on CH4 temperature-programmed decomposition and O-2 temperature-programmed oxidation reveal that the high catalytic activity for the cracking of CH4 and the easier oxidation of the generated carbon species on PSCFN could be the main reason why PSCFN shows high performance and good stability in direct CH4 fuel solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Mechanisms of methane decomposition and carbon species oxidation on the Pr0.42Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-σ electrode with high catalytic activity,10.1039/c5ta07599h
