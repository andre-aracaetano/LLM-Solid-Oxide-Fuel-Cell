5,14720,"Controlling the sputtering deposition angle and rotation speed of the substrate significantly improves the in-plane connectivity of the nanostructured Ni anode, resulting in a 50% enhancement in the peak power density of the cell.","Low-temperature, high-performance thin-film solid oxide fuel cells with tailored nano-column structures of a sputtered Ni anode",10.1039/d0ta06255c
6,14720,"The maximum performance of the cell with the tailored anode nanostructure was 304 and 477 mW cm(-2) at 450 and 500 degrees C, respectively, which represents the best recorded performance of an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO)-supported Ni-based thin-film SOFC.","Low-temperature, high-performance thin-film solid oxide fuel cells with tailored nano-column structures of a sputtered Ni anode",10.1039/d0ta06255c
7,14720,"Further investigation via 1-dimensional simulation showed that the enhancement in the in-plane continuity of the columnar anode structure dominantly affects the performance of TF-SOFCs, which means that the novel process is promising for practical applications of nano-energy devices fabricated by sputtering.","Low-temperature, high-performance thin-film solid oxide fuel cells with tailored nano-column structures of a sputtered Ni anode",10.1039/d0ta06255c
