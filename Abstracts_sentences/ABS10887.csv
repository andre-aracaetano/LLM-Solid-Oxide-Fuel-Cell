1,10887,A distributed charge transfer (DCT) model has been developed to analyze solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and electrolyzers operating in H-2-H2O and CO-CO2 atmospheres.,Solid Oxide Cell Microstructural Performance in Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide Reactant Streams,10.1115/1.4034114
2,10887,"The model couples mass transport based on the dusty-gas model (DGM), ion and electron transport in terms of charged species electrochemical potentials, and electrochemical reactions defined by Butler-Volmer kinetics.",Solid Oxide Cell Microstructural Performance in Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide Reactant Streams,10.1115/1.4034114
3,10887,"The model is validated by comparison to published experimental data, particularly cell polarization curves for both fuel cell and electrolyzer operation.",Solid Oxide Cell Microstructural Performance in Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide Reactant Streams,10.1115/1.4034114
4,10887,Parametric studies have been performed to compare the effects of microstructure on the performance of SOFCs and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) operating in H-2-H2O and CO-CO2 gas streams.,Solid Oxide Cell Microstructural Performance in Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide Reactant Streams,10.1115/1.4034114
5,10887,"Compared to the H-2-H2O system, the power density of the CO-CO2 system shows a greater sensitivity to pore microstructure, characterized by the porosity and tortuosity.",Solid Oxide Cell Microstructural Performance in Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide Reactant Streams,10.1115/1.4034114
6,10887,Analysis of the pore diameter concurs with the porosity and tortuosity parametric studies that CO-CO2 systems are more sensitive to microstructural changes than H-2-H2O systems.,Solid Oxide Cell Microstructural Performance in Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide Reactant Streams,10.1115/1.4034114
7,10887,"However, the concentration losses of the CO-CO2 system are significantly higher than those of the H-2-H2O system for the pore sizes analyzed.",Solid Oxide Cell Microstructural Performance in Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide Reactant Streams,10.1115/1.4034114
8,10887,"While both systems can be shown to improve in performance with higher porosity, lower tortuosity, and larger pore sizes, the results of these parametric studies imply that CO-CO2 systems would benefit more from such microstructural changes.",Solid Oxide Cell Microstructural Performance in Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide Reactant Streams,10.1115/1.4034114
9,10887,These results further suggest that objectives for tailoring microstructure in solid oxide cells (SOCs) operating in CO-CO2 are distinct from objectives for more common H-2-focused systems.,Solid Oxide Cell Microstructural Performance in Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide Reactant Streams,10.1115/1.4034114
