2,3095,"Yttria-stabilized zirconia is perhaps the material with the most potential as an electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), owing to its stability and near-unity ionic transference number(5).",Strongly correlated perovskite fuel cells,10.1038/nature17653
3,3095,"Although there exist materials with superior ionic conductivity, they are often limited by their ability to suppress electronic leakage when exposed to the reducing environment at the fuel interface.",Strongly correlated perovskite fuel cells,10.1038/nature17653
4,3095,Such electronic leakage reduces fuel cell power output and the associated chemo-mechanical stresses can also lead to catastrophic fracture of electrolyte membranes(6).,Strongly correlated perovskite fuel cells,10.1038/nature17653
5,3095,Here we depart from traditional electrolyte design that relies on cation substitution to sustain ionic conduction.,Strongly correlated perovskite fuel cells,10.1038/nature17653
6,3095,"Instead, we use a perovskite nickelate as an electrolyte with high initial ionic and electronic conductivity.",Strongly correlated perovskite fuel cells,10.1038/nature17653
7,3095,"Since many such oxides are also correlated electron systems, we can suppress the electronic conduction through a filling-controlled Mott transition induced by spontaneous hydrogen incorporation.",Strongly correlated perovskite fuel cells,10.1038/nature17653
8,3095,"Using such a nickelate as the electrolyte in free-standing membrane geometry, we demonstrate a low-temperature micro-fabricated SOFC with high performance.",Strongly correlated perovskite fuel cells,10.1038/nature17653
9,3095,"The ionic conductivity of the nickelate perovskite is comparable to the best-performing solid electrolytes in the same temperature range, with a very low activation energy.",Strongly correlated perovskite fuel cells,10.1038/nature17653
10,3095,The results present a design strategy for high-performance materials exhibiting emergent properties arising from strong electron correlations.,Strongly correlated perovskite fuel cells,10.1038/nature17653
