6,3584,The electrolyte-supported (thickness of electrolyte is 300 mu m) fuel cells generate good performance with the maximum power densities of 617 mW cm(-2) on GDC electrolyte and 1021 mW cm(-2) on LSGM electrolyte at 800 degrees C. All results demonstrate that PBSC oxide is a very promising cathode material for application in IT-SOFCs and this cathode based on LSGM electrolyte obtained better performance than on GDC electrolyte.,PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+x as cathode material based on LSGM and GDC electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.12.134
