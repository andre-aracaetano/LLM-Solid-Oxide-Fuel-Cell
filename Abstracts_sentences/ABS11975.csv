3,11975,"The governing three-dimensional equations for fluid mass, momentum, energy, and species transport, along with those for electrochemical kinetics, where the homogeneous porouslayer flow is in thermal equilibrium with the solid matrix, are coupled with the electrochemical reaction rate to properly account for the heat and mass transfer across flow-ducts and electrode-interfaces.",Heat and Mass Transfer in Planar Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Effects of Interconnect Fuel/Oxidant Channel Flow Cross Section,10.1115/1.4030636
