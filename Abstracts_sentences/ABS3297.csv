1,3297,"An advanced bond coat has been developed for solid oxide fuel cell interconnector applications; a low thermal expansion superalloy has been selected as the substrate, and the newly developed bond coat is applied between the substrate and the LSM top coat.",Development of an advanced bond coat for solid oxide fuel cell interconnector applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.076
2,3297,The bond coat composition is designed to be near thermodynamic equilibrium with the substrate to minimize interdiffusion with the substrate while providing oxidation protection for the substrate.,Development of an advanced bond coat for solid oxide fuel cell interconnector applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.076
3,3297,"The bond coat exhibits good oxidation resistance, a low area specific resistance, and a low thermal expansion coefficient at 800 degrees C; experimental results indicate that interdiffusion between the bond coat and the substrate can be hindered.",Development of an advanced bond coat for solid oxide fuel cell interconnector applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.076
