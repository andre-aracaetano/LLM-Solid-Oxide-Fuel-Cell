3,15602,"The influence of iron content in BSCF oxides on the unit cell volume via high temperature X-ray diffraction, the overall electrical conductivity and the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) has also been investigated The lattice cell parameters for the BSCF series increase as a function of the temperature and exhibit a non-linear behaviour, with a sudden increase at around 673 K due to the loss of lattice oxygen, which in turn is caused by the reduction of Co4+ and Fe4+ to lower oxidation states This was determined by O-2 temperature-programmed desorption and thermogravimetric analysis Such oxygen non-stoichiometry results in a significant thermal expansion and conductivity change for all compositions at the same temperature.",On Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1-yFeyO3-δ (y=0.1-0.9) oxides as cathode materials for La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 based IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.09.041
