2,9481,"Electrodes with highly controlled microstructure, i.e., high porosity and uniform large pores are therefore essential to achieve high performance electrochemical cells.",Challenge for lowering concentration polarization in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.10.024
3,9481,"In this study, state-of-the-art technology for controlling the microstructure of electrodes has been developed for realizing high performance support electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Challenge for lowering concentration polarization in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.10.024
4,9481,"The key is controlling the porosity and pore size distribution to improve gas diffusion, while maintaining the integrity of the electrolyte and the structural strength of actual sized electrode supports needed for the target application.",Challenge for lowering concentration polarization in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.10.024
5,9481,Planar anode-supported SOFCs developed in this study realize 5 gm thick dense electrolyte (yttria-stabilized zirconia: YSZ) and the anode substrate (Ni-YSZ) of 53.6 vol.% porosity with a large median pore diameter of 0.911 mu m. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the performance of the anode-supported SOFCs improves with increasing anode porosity.,Challenge for lowering concentration polarization in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.10.024
6,9481,"This Ni-YSZ anode minimizes the concentration polarization, resulting in a maximum power density of 3.09 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C using humidified hydrogen fuel without any electrode functional layers.",Challenge for lowering concentration polarization in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.10.024
