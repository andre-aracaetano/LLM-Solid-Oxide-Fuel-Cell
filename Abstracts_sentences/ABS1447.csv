1,1447,Anode supported (Ni/YSZ-YSZ-LSM/YSZ) solid oxide fuel cells were tested and the degradation over time was monitored and analyzed by impedance spectroscopy.,Ni/YSZ electrode degradation studied by impedance spectroscopy Effects of gas cleaning and current density,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.04.001
2,1447,Test conditions were chosen to focus on the anode degradation and all tests were operated at 750 degrees C. O-2 was supplied to the cathode and the anode inlet gas mixture had a high p(H2O)/p(H-2) ratio of 0.4/0.6.,Ni/YSZ electrode degradation studied by impedance spectroscopy Effects of gas cleaning and current density,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.04.001

4,1447,"Cells were tested over a few hundred hours applying varying current densities (OCV, 0.75 A/cm(2) and 1 A/cm2).",Ni/YSZ electrode degradation studied by impedance spectroscopy Effects of gas cleaning and current density,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.04.001
5,1447,"To investigate the effects of possible impurities in the inlet gas stream on the anode degradation, tests were setup both with and without gas cleaning.",Ni/YSZ electrode degradation studied by impedance spectroscopy Effects of gas cleaning and current density,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.04.001
6,1447,Gas cleaning was done by passing the H-2 over porous nickel at room temperature.,Ni/YSZ electrode degradation studied by impedance spectroscopy Effects of gas cleaning and current density,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.04.001
7,1447,It was found that cleaning of the inlet H-2 gas more than halved the anode degradation under current load.,Ni/YSZ electrode degradation studied by impedance spectroscopy Effects of gas cleaning and current density,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.04.001
8,1447,For tests at OCV the increase in the Ni-YSZ charge transfer reaction resistance changed from similar to 0.10 Omega cm(2) to become negligible (below 0.002 Omega cm(2)) upon applying H-2 gas cleaning over the couple of hundred of hours of testing.,Ni/YSZ electrode degradation studied by impedance spectroscopy Effects of gas cleaning and current density,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.04.001
9,1447,"Both for tests with and without H-2 gas cleaning applied, it was surprisingly found that operating the solid oxide fuel cells at OCV prior to fuel cell testing provided fuel cell tests with minimal/negligible anode degradation compared to tests where fuel cell testing was started immediately after initial characterization of the cells.",Ni/YSZ electrode degradation studied by impedance spectroscopy Effects of gas cleaning and current density,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.04.001
