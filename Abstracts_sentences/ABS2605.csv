1,2605,"dA new high performance ceramic solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode, Ca- and Co-doped yttrium chromite (YCCC)-samaria-doped ceria (SDC) composite, that resists deactivation by sulfur and does not show degradation during multiple reduction-oxidation cycles is developed.",Doped yttrium chromite-ceria composite as a redox-stable and sulfur-tolerant anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.08.025
2,2605,The electrocatalytic activity of the YCCC-SDC anodes in yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte-supported cells toward hydrogen oxidation is comparable to that of the Ni/YSZ anode.,Doped yttrium chromite-ceria composite as a redox-stable and sulfur-tolerant anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.08.025
3,2605,"YCCC-SDC exhibits superior sulfur tolerance showing less than 10% increase in electrode resistance, fully reversible, upon exposure to 20 ppm H2S. The excellent redox tolerance is attributed to the dimensional and chemical stability of the YCCC exhibiting minimal isothermal chemical expansion.",Doped yttrium chromite-ceria composite as a redox-stable and sulfur-tolerant anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.08.025
