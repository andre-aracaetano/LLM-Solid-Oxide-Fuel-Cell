1,7056,"A new cathode ink for a solid oxide fuel cell has been developed (patent pending: UK Patent Application Number 1107672,6).",A novel water-based cathode ink formulation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.105
2,7056,"A novel, water-based formulation was created and tested against the standard, in-house, acetone-based ink recipe.",A novel water-based cathode ink formulation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.105
3,7056,Poly(N-VinylPyrrolidone) (PVP) was selected as a suitable dispersant and Poly(Vinyl Alcohol) (PVA) as the binder and a range of chain lengths and quantities was tested.,A novel water-based cathode ink formulation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.105
4,7056,"The PVA content was adjusted to optimise adhesion of the two layers, as some delamination was observed with the first attempt.",A novel water-based cathode ink formulation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.105
5,7056,"Various PVP chain lengths and quantities were tested to determine the effect on ink dispersion, and hence cathode structure and porosity.",A novel water-based cathode ink formulation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.105
6,7056,"The electrical performance was tested and found to be favourably comparable with the in-house recipe, giving a marginally higher peak power density of 0.48 W/cm(2).",A novel water-based cathode ink formulation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.105
