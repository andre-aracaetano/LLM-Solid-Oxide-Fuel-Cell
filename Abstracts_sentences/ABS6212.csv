1,6212,"Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SSC-SDC) composites, which are often used as the cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with oxygen-ion conducting electrolytes, have been recently shown to be also applicable in SOFCs based on proton conductors such as BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY).",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-Ce1.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrodes enhanced by Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 impregnation for proton conductor based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.12.012
2,6212,The electrochemical performances of blank SSC-SDC electrodes on BZCY electrolytes are substantially improved in this work by impregnating SSC nanoparticles additionally.,Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-Ce1.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrodes enhanced by Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 impregnation for proton conductor based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.12.012
3,6212,"When the loading increases, the interfacial polarization resistance of the symmetric cell decreases gradually at first, notably when it exceeds 14 wt.%, and to the lowest value at about 22 wt.%.",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-Ce1.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrodes enhanced by Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 impregnation for proton conductor based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.12.012
