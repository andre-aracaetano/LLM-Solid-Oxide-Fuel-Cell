4,20835,"The Bi0.76Y0.24-xGdxO1.5, Bi0.76Y0.24-xNbxO1.5+delta, and Bi0.76Y0.24-xScxO1.5 ceramics retain a cubic fluorite structure of 8-Bi203 phase while Bi0.76Y0.24-xBaxO1.5-delta displays a mixture of cubic and rhombohedral phases.",The phase stability and electrical conductivity of Bi2O3 ceramics stabilized by Co-dopants,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.06.056
5,20835,"Despite the fact that the ionic radius of Sc3+ and Zr4+ ions are smaller than that of Y3+ ion, the lattice constant of the Bi0.76Y0.24O1.5 ceramic rises with the Gd2O3, Sc2O3, or ZrO2 replacement but drops with the Nb2O5 substitution.",The phase stability and electrical conductivity of Bi2O3 ceramics stabilized by Co-dopants,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.06.056
6,20835,"Of the compositions studied, the Bi0.76Y0.20Zr0.04O1.5+delta ceramic emerges with the best electrical conductivities of 0.27 and 0.55 5cm(-1) at 600 and 700 degrees C, much higher than those of the Y2O3-doped and ZrO2-doped Bi2O3 ceramics.",The phase stability and electrical conductivity of Bi2O3 ceramics stabilized by Co-dopants,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.06.056
7,20835,"It is observed that, with the same total dopant concentration, the co-dopant stabilized Bi2O3 ceramics outperforms their single-dopant stabilized counterparts in terms of conductivity, probably due to the larger lattice constants.",The phase stability and electrical conductivity of Bi2O3 ceramics stabilized by Co-dopants,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.06.056
