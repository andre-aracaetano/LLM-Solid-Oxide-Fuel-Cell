1,3421,Different approaches are proposed for increasing the overall performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by promoting the nano-structuring of perovskitic cathode layers.,Nano-structuring of solid oxide fuel cells cathodes,10.1007/s11244-006-0114-6
2,3421,The formation of pore systems in the nanometer scale will make available a larger surface area (three-phase-boundary) for the electrocatalytic processes occurring on the air electrode.,Nano-structuring of solid oxide fuel cells cathodes,10.1007/s11244-006-0114-6
3,3421,Two different concepts can be pursued for this purpose: (i) synthesis of thermally-stable mesoporous particles and ulterior deposition of them as macroporous films using coating techniques such as screen printing; and (ii) production of nano-structured films of regularly-arranged nano-sized particles of electrocatalytic materials over the dense electrolyte.,Nano-structuring of solid oxide fuel cells cathodes,10.1007/s11244-006-0114-6
4,3421,The first progresses in the synthesis of nano-structured LSFC cathode layers following the first approach are depicted as well as their electrochemical characterization when using them as SOFC cathodes assembled on complete anode-supported (Ni-YSZ/YSZ) fuel cells.,Nano-structuring of solid oxide fuel cells cathodes,10.1007/s11244-006-0114-6
