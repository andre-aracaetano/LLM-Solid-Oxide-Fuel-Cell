1,6085,La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF) nanoparticles are formed in micropores of La0.8Sr0.2MnO2(LSM)-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cathodes by reaction-infiltration method.,La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Nanoparticles Formed in Micropores of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Cathodes,10.1115/1.2971052
2,6085,Bismuth nitrate is added in the precursor nitrate solution for LSCF as the reaction promoter.,La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Nanoparticles Formed in Micropores of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Cathodes,10.1115/1.2971052
3,6085,"The LSCF phase is observed at 600 degrees C by the addition of bismuth nitrate, and about 100 nm particle size LSCF(Bi) is homogenously distributed on the LSM-YSZ surface.",La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Nanoparticles Formed in Micropores of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Cathodes,10.1115/1.2971052
4,6085,The electrode impedance of LSM-YSZ/YSZ/LSM-YSZ cells is examined and has found that the electrode polarization resistance is extremely reduced by the LSCF(Bi) infiltration in LSM-YSZ.,La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Nanoparticles Formed in Micropores of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Cathodes,10.1115/1.2971052
5,6085,The performance of the anode support fuel cell of Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSM-YSZ is examined at 700 degrees C. The LSCF(Bi) infiltrated LSM-YSZ cathode significantly enhanced the cell performance with a 97%H-2-3%H-2 fuel at 700 degrees C.,La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Nanoparticles Formed in Micropores of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Cathodes,10.1115/1.2971052
