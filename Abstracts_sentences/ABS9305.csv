1,9305,"In this study, Nd2Ni1-xCuxO4+delta (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) layered perovskite powders were synthesized by the glycine nitrate process (GNP) and the chromium poisoning effect on the electrochemical performance of the Nd2Ni0.95Cu0.05O4+delta and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta cathodes were investigated.",Cr POISONING ON ND2NI0.95CU0.05O4+δ CATHODE FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1515/amm-2016-0107
2,9305,"In the case of the LSCF cathode, the strontium chromite phase formed after the exposure of the gaseous chromium species, while there was no additional phase in the Nd2Ni0.95Cu0.05O4+delta cathode.",Cr POISONING ON ND2NI0.95CU0.05O4+δ CATHODE FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1515/amm-2016-0107
3,9305,The area specific resistance (ASR) of the Nd2Ni0.95Cu0.05O4+delta cathode did not change significantly after the exposure of the gaseous chromium species at 800 degrees C.,Cr POISONING ON ND2NI0.95CU0.05O4+δ CATHODE FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1515/amm-2016-0107
