1,1809,We simulated the performance of systems using a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack which generates electricity by electrochemical partial oxidation of methane and a conventional steam-reforming-type SOFC (SRSOFC) stack.,Performance evaluation of SOFC systems using electrochemical partial oxidation of methane,10.1002/eej.10314
2,1809,The net thermal efficiency in an atmospheric partial-oxidation-type SOFC (POSOFC)-SRSOFC system was 8% higher than that in an atmospheric SRSOFC system at system outputs of 35 kW or more.,Performance evaluation of SOFC systems using electrochemical partial oxidation of methane,10.1002/eej.10314
3,1809,The net thermal efficiency of a pressurized POSOFC-SRSOFC-gas turbine (GT) system was slightly higher than that of a pressurized SRSOFC-GT system.,Performance evaluation of SOFC systems using electrochemical partial oxidation of methane,10.1002/eej.10314
