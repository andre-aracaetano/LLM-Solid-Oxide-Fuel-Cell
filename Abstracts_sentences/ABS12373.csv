1,12373,"The electrochemical oxidative dimerization of methane to give C2 hydrocarbon species was investigated in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) possessing the general configuration: CH4, (anode) electrocatalyst/ZrO2(8M/oY2O3)/La0.9Sr0.1MnO3, O2(air).",THE ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATIVE DIMERIZATION OF METHANE,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90377-2
2,12373,"Perovskite anode electrocatalysts shown to possess activity towards promoting the subject reaction included Sm0.5Ce0.5CuO3, Tb0.8Sm0.2CuO3, Gd0.9Th0.1CuO3, Gd0.9Na0.1MnO3 and Th0.8Yb0.2NiO3.",THE ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATIVE DIMERIZATION OF METHANE,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90377-2
3,12373,An inverse linear dependence was found for methane conversion to C2 Species on both perovskite electrocatalyst molecular volumes and their lattice-ionic free volumes.,THE ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATIVE DIMERIZATION OF METHANE,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90377-2
4,12373,"These observations suggested that anode electrocatalyst activity towards promoting C2 synthesis may be either dependent upon lattice spacings or on their intrinsic ionic transport properties, both of which might be expected to be related to the lattice metal-oxygen bonding energy.",THE ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATIVE DIMERIZATION OF METHANE,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90377-2
5,12373,"The maximum partial Faradaic current densities at copper based perovskite were found to exhibit a linear dependence to the experimentally determined magnetic moments, consistent with an increasing population of Cu3+ sites, favoring stabilization of reactive surface O- species.",THE ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDATIVE DIMERIZATION OF METHANE,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90377-2
