1,3598,"Our previously developed numerical model has been used to study the flow, species and temperature distribution in a micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell stack.","Micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC) stacks: Model development",10.1016/j.cherd.2011.09.013
2,3598,"The stack consists of three cells, spaced equally inside the gas-chamber.","Micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC) stacks: Model development",10.1016/j.cherd.2011.09.013
3,3598,"Two different configurations of the gas-chamber have been investigated, i.e., a bare gas-chamber and a porous material filled gas-chamber.","Micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC) stacks: Model development",10.1016/j.cherd.2011.09.013
4,3598,"The results show that the porous material filled gas-chamber is advantageous in improving the cell performance, as it forces the flow to pass through the cell, which improves mass transport via convection and enhances the reaction rate.","Micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC) stacks: Model development",10.1016/j.cherd.2011.09.013
5,3598,The cell performance in the case of a bare gas-chamber follows in the following order: cell 1 > cell 2 > cell 3.,"Micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC) stacks: Model development",10.1016/j.cherd.2011.09.013
6,3598,"However, the performance order is reversed for the porous gas-chamber case.","Micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC) stacks: Model development",10.1016/j.cherd.2011.09.013
7,3598,"This is due to enhanced flow which is forced to flow through the downstream cells, as we move along the gas-chamber length.","Micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC) stacks: Model development",10.1016/j.cherd.2011.09.013
