1,12799,The long-term stability of composite electrodes consisting of silver and yttrium-stabilized bismuth oxide (Ag-YSB) or silver and erbium-stabilized bismuth oxide (Ag-ESB) has been examined in order to evaluate the potential of such systems for use as cathodes in low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Silver-bismuth oxide cathodes for IT-SOFCs; Part I - Microstructural instability,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.06.009
2,12799,The performance of these electrodes at 650 degrees C is initially among the best reported to date.,Silver-bismuth oxide cathodes for IT-SOFCs; Part I - Microstructural instability,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.06.009
3,12799,"However, the polarization resistance isothermally increases by more than 70% for Ag-YSB and nearly 70% for Ag-ESB, from 0.04 Omega cm to 0.07 Omega cm(2) and from 0.06 Omega cm(2) to 0.10 Omega cm(2), respectively, after 100 h at 650 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) reveal no evidence of reactivity or interdiffusion between the silver and bismuth oxide phases.",Silver-bismuth oxide cathodes for IT-SOFCs; Part I - Microstructural instability,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.06.009
4,12799,A pure silver electrode tested under the same conditions showed a near fourfold increase in ASR (from 0.92 Omega cm(2) to 3.55 Omega cm(2)).,Silver-bismuth oxide cathodes for IT-SOFCs; Part I - Microstructural instability,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.06.009
5,12799,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis reveals that the silver phase microstructure undergoes dramatic growth during this timeframe.,Silver-bismuth oxide cathodes for IT-SOFCs; Part I - Microstructural instability,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.06.009
6,12799,"This microstructural growth and consequent reduction in porosity is believed to diminish the cathodic reaction zone size and inhibit gas transport, thus resulting in the observed rise in polarization.",Silver-bismuth oxide cathodes for IT-SOFCs; Part I - Microstructural instability,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.06.009
