3,3109,"The high-frequency impedance (>10(4) Hz) can be assigned to transfer of the charged species across the Ni/YSZ interface, and the mid-frequency arc (10(2)similar to 10(3) Hz) is possibly associated with the gas-solid interaction such as adsorption, dissociation, desorption, etc.",Electrochemical characterization of Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia electrode for hydrogen production in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.033
4,3109,The impedance spectra are strongly influenced by the gas composition in both fuel cell (H-2 oxidation) and electrolysis (H2O reduction) reactions; polarization resistance decreases with increasing concentration of the reactant species.,Electrochemical characterization of Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia electrode for hydrogen production in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.033
5,3109,"In fuel cell mode, both high- and mid-frequency arcs increase with decreasing H-2 concentration, while the impedance spectra are dominated by the mid-frequency arc and the high-frequency arc remains negligible even at low H2O concentration in electrolysis mode.",Electrochemical characterization of Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia electrode for hydrogen production in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.033
6,3109,Reaction mechanisms and elementary reaction pathways for H-2 oxidation and H2O reduction are suggested based on impedance spectra.,Electrochemical characterization of Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia electrode for hydrogen production in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.033
7,3109,"The minimum impedance is observed at 50% H2O in electrolysis mode, and further increase in H2O concentration causes degradation of the electrode performance, possibly due to local oxidation of Ni.",Electrochemical characterization of Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia electrode for hydrogen production in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.033
