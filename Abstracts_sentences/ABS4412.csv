1,4412,"The present work investigates Fe2O3 doping as a method of improving the oxygen ion conductivity (OIC) of electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) working in a temperature range between 773 K and 973 K. Yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ), which alone does not have an OIC sufficiently high for working in the specified temperature range, is used as the electrolyte in the present work.",Enhancing oxygen iron conductivity of 8YSZ electrolytes in SOFC by doping with Fe2O3,10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.01.057
2,4412,"A molecular dynamics (MD) modelling approach is employed to simulate the electrolyte, and the oxygen ion conductivity is characterised and examined for a range of doping proportions and working temperatures.",Enhancing oxygen iron conductivity of 8YSZ electrolytes in SOFC by doping with Fe2O3,10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.01.057
3,4412,"Modelling results indicate that there exists an upper limit of oxygen vacancy concentration for doped 8YSZ electrolytes, and that the optimum OIC is achieved by an 8YSZ electrolyte doped with approximately 4% Fe2O3.",Enhancing oxygen iron conductivity of 8YSZ electrolytes in SOFC by doping with Fe2O3,10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.01.057
