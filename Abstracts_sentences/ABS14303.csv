1,14303,Doped bismuth ruthenates and bismuth ruthenate-stabilized bismuth oxide composites were studied as prospective cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells.,Impedance studies on bismuth-ruthenate-based electrodes,10.1007/s11581-008-0289-x
2,14303,Symmetric cells were fabricated on gadolinium-doped ceria electrolytes and studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.,Impedance studies on bismuth-ruthenate-based electrodes,10.1007/s11581-008-0289-x
3,14303,Ca- and Ag-doped bismuth ruthenate electrodes (5-10 mol%) showed the same characteristic frequency as undoped bismuth ruthenate but with higher activation energy and slightly better performance above similar to 550 A degrees C.,Impedance studies on bismuth-ruthenate-based electrodes,10.1007/s11581-008-0289-x
4,14303,"At 700 A degrees C, area-specific resistance (ASR) of undoped, 5 mol% Ca and 5 mol% Sr-doped bismuth ruthenate electrode was 1.45, 1.24, and 1.41 Omega cm(2), respectively.",Impedance studies on bismuth-ruthenate-based electrodes,10.1007/s11581-008-0289-x
5,14303,The change in ASR as a function of oxygen partial pressure and current bias suggests that the rate-limiting steps for oxygen reduction in bismuth ruthenate systems are charge transfer and surface diffusion of dissociatively adsorbed oxygen to triple phase boundaries.,Impedance studies on bismuth-ruthenate-based electrodes,10.1007/s11581-008-0289-x
6,14303,Introduction of the erbia-stabilized bismuth oxide (ESB) phase reduced both the rate-limiting steps resulting in much improved electrode performance.,Impedance studies on bismuth-ruthenate-based electrodes,10.1007/s11581-008-0289-x
