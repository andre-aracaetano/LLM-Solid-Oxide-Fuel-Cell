1,6435,The microstructure and interfacial property of a thin film electrolyte solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).,Transmission Electron Microscopy Study on Microstructure and Interfacial Property of Thin Film Electrolyte SOFC,10.1149/1.3518451
2,6435,"The NiO-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) nanocomposite layer, the electrolyte, and the cathode layers were fabricated by using pulsed laser deposition and exhibited various microstructures such as a dense microstructure with equiaxed grains, a dense microstructure with columnar grains, and a nanoporous and granular microstructure, depending on their material, deposition condition, and deposition surface.",Transmission Electron Microscopy Study on Microstructure and Interfacial Property of Thin Film Electrolyte SOFC,10.1149/1.3518451
3,6435,"In addition, the TEM analysis revealed that the reaction buffer to suppress the chemical reaction of lanthanum strontium cobaltite and YSZ is required even for the low temperature fabrication and operation (<= 650 degrees C).",Transmission Electron Microscopy Study on Microstructure and Interfacial Property of Thin Film Electrolyte SOFC,10.1149/1.3518451
