3,7199,"They behave as thermal-activated semiconductors in the temperature range from 300 to 800 degrees C, and the electrical conductivity is progressively enhanced with increasing x. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the composite electrodes exhibit reduced area specific resistance, and the x = 0.5 composite cathode shows the lowest polarization behavior.",One-pot synthesized hetero-structured Ca3Co2O6/La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 dual-phase composite cathode materials for solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.07.104
