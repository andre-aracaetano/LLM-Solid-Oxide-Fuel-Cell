3,8003,The doping of high-valence Mo cations into Fe-site obviously enhanced the electrical conductivity of BSFMo sample with the maximum value of 174 S cm(-1).,Potentiality of cobalt-free perovskite Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ as a single-phase cathode for intermediate-to-low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.089
4,8003,"XRD results showed that BSEMo cathode was chemically compatible with the BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) electrolyte for temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. Laboratory-sized tri-layer cells of NiO-BZCYYb/BZCYYb/BSEMo were operated from 550 to 700 degrees C with humidified hydrogen (similar to 3% H2O) as fuel and the static air as oxidant, respectively.",Potentiality of cobalt-free perovskite Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ as a single-phase cathode for intermediate-to-low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.089
5,8003,"An open-circuit potential of 1.001 V, the maximum power density of 428 mW cm(-2), and a low electrode polarization resistance of 0.148 Omega cm(2) were achieved at 700 degrees C.",Potentiality of cobalt-free perovskite Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ as a single-phase cathode for intermediate-to-low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.089
