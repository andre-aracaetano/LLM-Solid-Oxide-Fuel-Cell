1,14326,"Cation-stoichiometric and strontium-deficient Sr1-xCexTiO3 +/-delta (0<0.15) have been appraised using controlled-atmosphere dilatometry, thermogravimetric analysis, and measurements of total conductivity and Seebeck coefficient in the oxygen partial pressure range from 10 (20) to 0.5 atm at 650 degrees-950 degrees C. As for other donor-doped titanates, perovskite-type Sr1-xCexTiO3 +/-delta exhibit predominant n-type electronic conductivity and slow changes in the charge-compensation mechanism on reduction, associated with kinetically stagnated diffusion.",Electrical Properties and Dimensional Stability of Ce-Doped SrTiO3-δ for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04483.x
2,14326,"The resultant hysteresis and kinetic stabilization of nonequilibrium states make it possible to substantially increase the conductivity by preliminary reduction at high temperatures, such as 1350 degrees C.",Electrical Properties and Dimensional Stability of Ce-Doped SrTiO3-δ for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04483.x
3,14326,"Owing to relatively small variations in the defect concentrations, the chemically induced expansion of Ce-substituted titanate ceramics is very low, while the thermal expansion at 130 degrees-1100 degrees C is almost linear and essentially P-O2 independent.",Electrical Properties and Dimensional Stability of Ce-Doped SrTiO3-δ for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04483.x

5,14326,All of these properties make the material an attractive choice as a solid oxide fuel cell anode material.,Electrical Properties and Dimensional Stability of Ce-Doped SrTiO3-δ for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04483.x
6,14326,"However, the nature of the reduced, highly conductive, state appears to be metastable and may not be completely recoverable after redox cycling.",Electrical Properties and Dimensional Stability of Ce-Doped SrTiO3-δ for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04483.x
