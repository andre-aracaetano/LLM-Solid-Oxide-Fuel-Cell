1,15922,"The fabrication and electrochemical performance of co-fired, LSM-SYSZ [i.e. La0.65Sr0.30MnO3 (LSM)-(SC2O3)(0.1)(Y2O3)(0.01) (ZrO2)(0.89)] supported thin-film cells were examined using humidified hydrogen as a fuel.",Catalyst-infiltrated supporting cathode for thin-film SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.023
2,15922,Co-firing of bilayers and trilayers was successful at 1250 degreesC by optimizing the amount of carbon pore formers.,Catalyst-infiltrated supporting cathode for thin-film SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.023
3,15922,"A power density of a factor of 2.5 higher than that recently reported for the same type of cell at 800 degreesC [H. Ohrui, K. Watanabe, M. Arakawa, J. Power Sources, H 2, 90 (2002)] was obtained for a cell with cobalt infiltration into the supporting cathode: the peak power densities were 455, 389, 285, 202, 141 mW/cm(2) at 800, 750, 700, 650, 600 degreesC, respectively, and in most cases power densities at 0.7 V exceeded more than 90% of the peak output.",Catalyst-infiltrated supporting cathode for thin-film SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.023
4,15922,"Increasing the cathode porosity from 43% to 53% improved peak power densities by as much as 1.3, shifting the diffusion limitation to high current densities.",Catalyst-infiltrated supporting cathode for thin-film SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.023
5,15922,Cobalt infiltration into the support improved those by as much as a factor of 2 due to a significant reduction in nonohmic resistance.,Catalyst-infiltrated supporting cathode for thin-film SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.023
6,15922,These results demonstrate that cobalt catalyst-infiltrated LSM can be effective and low-cost supporting electrodes for reduced temperature thin film solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Catalyst-infiltrated supporting cathode for thin-film SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.023
