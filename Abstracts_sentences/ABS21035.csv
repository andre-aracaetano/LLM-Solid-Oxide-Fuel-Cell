1,21035,"Recently LaNi1-xFexO3 materials have been indicated as good candidates for cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (LNF) showed the highest specific conductivity in the LaNi1-xFexO3 series.","Preparation, characterization, and electrochemical properties of pure and composite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Based cathodes for IT-SOFC",10.1021/cm071622n
2,21035,"Here we report the results of our investigation on the performances of LNF, synthesized by the coprecipitation method.","Preparation, characterization, and electrochemical properties of pure and composite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Based cathodes for IT-SOFC",10.1021/cm071622n
3,21035,"A detailed local structure analysis, performed using X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) techniques, indicated that both Fe and Ni are in the (111) oxidation state with coordination numbers of similar to 6, suggesting the absence of appreciable amount of oxygen vacancies.","Preparation, characterization, and electrochemical properties of pure and composite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Based cathodes for IT-SOFC",10.1021/cm071622n
4,21035,The fresh LNF material was used as a precursor for LNF-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) and LNF-SDC (samaria-doped ceria) electrodes.,"Preparation, characterization, and electrochemical properties of pure and composite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Based cathodes for IT-SOFC",10.1021/cm071622n
5,21035,"In the case of the LNF-YSZ nanocornposile, even a short (5 h) treatment at 1000 degrees C induced a strong reaction between the cathode components, leading to the formation of an undesirable La2Zr2O7 insulating layer.","Preparation, characterization, and electrochemical properties of pure and composite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Based cathodes for IT-SOFC",10.1021/cm071622n
6,21035,"In the case of LNF-SDC, no evidences of reaction between the two components have been observed even at 1100 degrees C. Low area specific resistance (ASR) values were obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for the composite LNF-SDC electrode in accordance with the good electronic conductivity of LNF and the high ionic conductivity of SDC.","Preparation, characterization, and electrochemical properties of pure and composite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Based cathodes for IT-SOFC",10.1021/cm071622n
7,21035,"Pure LNF and composite LNF-SDC electrodes showed identical apparent activation energy, suggesting the presence of the same rate-determining step.","Preparation, characterization, and electrochemical properties of pure and composite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Based cathodes for IT-SOFC",10.1021/cm071622n
8,21035,"However, ASR values for LNF-SDC were significantly smaller with respect to pure LNE","Preparation, characterization, and electrochemical properties of pure and composite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Based cathodes for IT-SOFC",10.1021/cm071622n
9,21035,"This is consistent with the hypothesis that the addition of SDC does not change the reaction mechanism, but it increases the triple phase boundary (TPB) length where the reaction occurs.","Preparation, characterization, and electrochemical properties of pure and composite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Based cathodes for IT-SOFC",10.1021/cm071622n
10,21035,"Notably, the polarization of the electrode further improved the cathodic performance, increasing the number of active sites for the 0, adsorption and activation.","Preparation, characterization, and electrochemical properties of pure and composite LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Based cathodes for IT-SOFC",10.1021/cm071622n
