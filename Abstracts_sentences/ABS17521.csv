2,17521,Several new formulations have been prepared and investigated: silica alkali borosilicate glass formulations that will create a glass sealant and calcium aluminosilicate formulations that will create a glass ceramic sealant.,Development and characterisation of glass and glass ceramic sealants for solid oxide electrolyser cells,10.1007/s11581-012-0685-0
3,17521,Thermal and physicochemical properties of several glasses and glass ceramics along with the crystallisation behaviour were investigated.,Development and characterisation of glass and glass ceramic sealants for solid oxide electrolyser cells,10.1007/s11581-012-0685-0
4,17521,"The glass transition temperatures (T (g)) of the prepared glasses were found to be within the range of 600-730 A degrees C. Shrinkage, sintering, softening, deformation and crystallisation temperatures of the parent glasses have been measured by hot stage microscopy.",Development and characterisation of glass and glass ceramic sealants for solid oxide electrolyser cells,10.1007/s11581-012-0685-0
