1,16866,"Measurements of the elastic modulus of pure and doped ceria are summarized from the literature and analyzed with a view towards understanding the experimentally established dependence on temperature, doping level and oxygen vacancy concentration.",The elastic modulus of pure and doped ceria,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2010.09.021
2,16866,At least two chemical properties affect the elastic modulus of pure and doped ceria: (i) the presence of vacancies decreases the strength of the chemical bonds; and (ii) low-temperature adaptation of the fluorite structure to the presence of oxygen vacancies is accompanied by an increase in unit cell volume.,The elastic modulus of pure and doped ceria,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2010.09.021
