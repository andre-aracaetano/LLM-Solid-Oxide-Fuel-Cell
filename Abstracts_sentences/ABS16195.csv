4,16195,"First, a thermodynamic analysis was performed to evaluate the heat production of SOFC to sustain the thermochemical reaction in the combined reactor, resulting in a required waste heat of 0.565 kW from the SOFC that was obtained by consuming 0.0241 kg.h(-1) of H-2 to process 1.0 kg.h(-1) of the H2SO4 mixture for the H2SO4 decomposer.",Computational design of H2SO4 decomposer combined with SOFC for thermochemical hydrogen production,10.1002/er.6904
5,16195,"For the SOFC inlet temperatures 923, 1023, and 1173 K, the corresponding SO3 conversions of the combined reactor were 72.1%, 77.3%, and 85.1%, respectively.",Computational design of H2SO4 decomposer combined with SOFC for thermochemical hydrogen production,10.1002/er.6904
6,16195,A further increase of over 1200 K in the operating temperature led to a minor improvement in the SO3 conversion efficiency.,Computational design of H2SO4 decomposer combined with SOFC for thermochemical hydrogen production,10.1002/er.6904
7,16195,"In the SOFC section, the H-2 mass fraction decreased from 67.9% to 10.8% in the anode channel, and 0.169 kW of electrical power was generated when the operating cell voltage and energy efficiency were 0.7 Vand 53.71%, respectively.",Computational design of H2SO4 decomposer combined with SOFC for thermochemical hydrogen production,10.1002/er.6904
