1,18642,Improvement of solid oxide fuel cells strongly relies on the development of cathode materials with high catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction.,Real-time impedance monitoring of oxygen reduction during surface modification of thin film cathodes,10.1038/NMAT4879
2,18642,"Excellent activity was found for perovskite-type oxides such as La1-xSrxCoO3-delta (LSC), but performance degradation, probably caused by surface composition changes, hinders exploitation of the full potential of LSC.",Real-time impedance monitoring of oxygen reduction during surface modification of thin film cathodes,10.1038/NMAT4879
3,18642,This study reveals that the potentially very high activity of the LSC surface can be traced back to few very active sites.,Real-time impedance monitoring of oxygen reduction during surface modification of thin film cathodes,10.1038/NMAT4879
4,18642,"Already tiny amounts of SrO, for example, 4% of a monolayer, deposited on an LSC surface, lead to severe deactivation.",Real-time impedance monitoring of oxygen reduction during surface modification of thin film cathodes,10.1038/NMAT4879
5,18642,"Co, on the other hand, causes (re-)activation, suggesting that active sites are strongly related to Co being present at the surface.",Real-time impedance monitoring of oxygen reduction during surface modification of thin film cathodes,10.1038/NMAT4879
6,18642,"These insights could be gained by a novel method to measure changes of the electrochemical performance of thin film electrodes in situ, while modifying their surface: impedance spectroscopy measurements during deposition of well-defined fractions of monolayers of Sr-, Co- and La-oxides by single laser pulses in a pulsed laser deposition chamber.",Real-time impedance monitoring of oxygen reduction during surface modification of thin film cathodes,10.1038/NMAT4879
