2,14685,Micro-tubular anodes were shaped by a gelcasting method based on a new and simple forming technique that operates as a syringe.,Processing of graded anode-supported micro-tubular SOFCs based on samaria-doped ceria via gel-casting and spray-coating,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.015
3,14685,"The aqueous slurry formulation of the NiO-SDC substrate using agarose as a gelling agent, and the effect of spray-coating parameters used to deposit the anode functional layers (AFLs) and electrolyte were investigated.",Processing of graded anode-supported micro-tubular SOFCs based on samaria-doped ceria via gel-casting and spray-coating,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.015
4,14685,"Furthermore, pre-sintering temperature of anode substrates was systematically studied to avoid the anode electrolyte delamination and obtain a dense electrolyte without cracks, after co-sintering process at 1450 degrees C. Despite the high shrinkage of substrate (similar to 70%), an anode porosity of similar to 37% was achieved.",Processing of graded anode-supported micro-tubular SOFCs based on samaria-doped ceria via gel-casting and spray-coating,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.015
5,14685,"MT-SOFCs with similar to 2.5 mm of outer diameter, 370 mu m thick substrate, 20 mu m thick AFLs and 15 mu m thick electrolyte were successfully obtained.",Processing of graded anode-supported micro-tubular SOFCs based on samaria-doped ceria via gel-casting and spray-coating,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.015
6,14685,The use of AFLs with 30:70 and 50:50 wt% NiO-SDC allowed to obtain a continuous gradation of composition and porosity in the anode-electrolyte interface.,Processing of graded anode-supported micro-tubular SOFCs based on samaria-doped ceria via gel-casting and spray-coating,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.01.015
