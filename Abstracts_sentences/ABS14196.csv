4,14196,H2S poisoning test was performed simulating H2S contamination of biogas.,Feasibility of direct-biogas SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.101
5,14196,Electrochemical and catalytic properties of Ni-ScSZ anode in feeding simulated biogas mixture (CH4/CO2 = 1.5) and their changes by H2S supply were measured at 1000 degrees C under 200 mA cm(-2).,Feasibility of direct-biogas SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.101
6,14196,"1 ppm H2S poisoning caused about 9% voltage drop and about 40% decrease in reaction rate of internal reforming, however, stable operation was achieved and complete recovery of cell voltage and reaction rate after stopping the H2S supply was confirmed, indicating that direct-biogas SOFC operated at 1000 degrees C is tolerant to 1 ppm level H2S contamination.",Feasibility of direct-biogas SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.101
