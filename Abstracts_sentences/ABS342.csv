1,342,This paper aims to investigate the performance and testing of joined Crofer22APU/glass-ceramic sealant/anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) in dual atmosphere in order to study the stability and effectiveness of the sealant.,Performance and testing of joined Crofer22APU-glass-ceramic sealant-anode supported cell in SOFC relevant conditions,10.1016/j.matlet.2010.12.050
2,342,"The sealant was able to prevent corrosion effects of the Crofer22APU after thermal treatments in SOFC relevant conditions at 800 degrees C for 460 h; an effective gas stream separation between the anode and cathode side was also obtained, as indicated by a very high measured open circuit potential, close to the theoretical one.",Performance and testing of joined Crofer22APU-glass-ceramic sealant-anode supported cell in SOFC relevant conditions,10.1016/j.matlet.2010.12.050
3,342,"Chromium poisoning was found to degrade the fuel cell performance, whereas the sealant was chemically and physically stable, as shown by post-mortem analysis.",Performance and testing of joined Crofer22APU-glass-ceramic sealant-anode supported cell in SOFC relevant conditions,10.1016/j.matlet.2010.12.050
