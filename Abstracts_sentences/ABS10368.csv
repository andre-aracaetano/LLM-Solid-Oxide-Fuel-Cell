2,10368,Microstructures of the anode were carefully characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).,Microstructural control of Ni-YSZ cermet anode for planer thin-film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2005.08.191
3,10368,"The Ni-YSZ cermet anode was consisting of fine YSZ connections, as the conducting pass of oxygen ions, on the surface of Ni network, as that of electrons, with continuous pore structure and as that of gaseous species.",Microstructural control of Ni-YSZ cermet anode for planer thin-film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2005.08.191
4,10368,"No amorphous phases were present at the interface between Ni and YSZ, and there was an orientation relationship between Ni and YSZ grains, (111)(Ni)//(111)(YSZ).",Microstructural control of Ni-YSZ cermet anode for planer thin-film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2005.08.191
5,10368,The cermet anode showed a high electrical performance at 800 degrees C. These results indicated that the electrochemical activity of the Ni-YSZ cermet anode was enhanced with the present microstructure.,Microstructural control of Ni-YSZ cermet anode for planer thin-film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2005.08.191
