2,6146,"At 45 vol.% solids loading, the suspension could be subjected to elongational flow processes and was prepared in thin film form by tubular film blowing;the manufacturing process used to make thermoplastic polymer film.",Film blowing of ceria electrolyte plates,10.1080/10426919808935225
3,6146,This provides a potential route for the manufacture of ceramic electrolyte plates for solid oxide fuel cells for which doped ceria is a candidate material.,Film blowing of ceria electrolyte plates,10.1080/10426919808935225
4,6146,"After sintering, film thickness down to 50 mu m could be achieved with relative; densities >95%.",Film blowing of ceria electrolyte plates,10.1080/10426919808935225
5,6146,The main problem with this route is in retaining flatness of films of less than 100 mu m in thickness during sintering; a problem which exists whatever the particle assembly route.,Film blowing of ceria electrolyte plates,10.1080/10426919808935225
