2,10954,"The effect of the material preparation scenario on the phase constituents, transport property, and catalyzing activity for H-2 oxidization was investigated.",Anode Material Sr2MgMoO6: Preparation and Catalytic Performance,10.11862/CJIC.2022.187
3,10954,"The results show that the preparation process of SM requires strict control, and a phase-pure sample with a double-perovskiie structure can be hardly sylithesized by a one-step annealing reaction, and a high purity grade of SMMO requires the repeated thorough mixing and full annealing.",Anode Material Sr2MgMoO6: Preparation and Catalytic Performance,10.11862/CJIC.2022.187
4,10954,"in the meanwhile, impurity phase SrMoO4 in a very small amount is almost unavoidable.",Anode Material Sr2MgMoO6: Preparation and Catalytic Performance,10.11862/CJIC.2022.187
5,10954,"The impure substance in samples affects a great deal of the electrical conductivity of this material, and a purer sample exhibits better conductive performance.",Anode Material Sr2MgMoO6: Preparation and Catalytic Performance,10.11862/CJIC.2022.187
6,10954,"The purity of SMMO has a tremendous impact on the electrochemical performance of this material, and a purer sample exhibits a lower anode interfacial resistance, a higher catalyzing activity for H-2 oxidizing, and a larger power output of the corresponding single cell.",Anode Material Sr2MgMoO6: Preparation and Catalytic Performance,10.11862/CJIC.2022.187
7,10954,"At a temperature of 800 degrees C, the area-specific resistance of the SMMO anode was as low as 1.07 Omega.cm(2), and power output from the corresponding single cell reached to 710 mW.cm(-2).",Anode Material Sr2MgMoO6: Preparation and Catalytic Performance,10.11862/CJIC.2022.187
