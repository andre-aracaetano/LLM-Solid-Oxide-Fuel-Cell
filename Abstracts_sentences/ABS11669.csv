1,11669,The Sr(0.75)Y(0.25)Co(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3-y) (SYCM) oxide with a cubic perovskite structure was examined as a promising cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Sr0.75Y0.25Co0.5Mn0.5O3-y Perovskite Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3184152
2,11669,"The electrical conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), and reactivity with gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) or yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were studied.",Sr0.75Y0.25Co0.5Mn0.5O3-y Perovskite Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3184152
3,11669,Reflections from SrZrO(3) (similar to 6 wt %) after beat-treatment of the SYCM:YSZ mixture at 900 degrees C for 48 h and no reaction after heat-treatment with GDC were observed.,Sr0.75Y0.25Co0.5Mn0.5O3-y Perovskite Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3184152
4,11669,"In the low and intermediate temperature region (473-873 K), the TEC value is 13.3 ppm K(-1) and most closely matches the common IT-SOFC electrolyte material GDC but the TEC value increases to 19.6 ppm K(-1) at 873-1073 K.",Sr0.75Y0.25Co0.5Mn0.5O3-y Perovskite Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3184152
5,11669,"The investigations of the electrochemical properties of the model SOFCs at 900 degrees C with the SYCM cathode show that substituting the SYCM cathode for the standard (La,Sr)MnO(3) cathode improves the cell performance.",Sr0.75Y0.25Co0.5Mn0.5O3-y Perovskite Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3184152
