2,16374,This paper describes the initial results of in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the cathode on an operating anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell.,Lattice expansion of LSCF-6428 cathodes measured by in situ XRD during SOFC operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.099
3,16374,It has been demonstrated that XRD measurements of the cathode can be performed simultaneously with electrochemical measurements of cell performance or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).,Lattice expansion of LSCF-6428 cathodes measured by in situ XRD during SOFC operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.099
4,16374,"While improvements to the technique are still to be made, the XRD pattern of a lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) cathode with the composition La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF-6428) was found to continually but gradually change over the course of more than 60 h of operation in air under typical SOFC operating conditions.",Lattice expansion of LSCF-6428 cathodes measured by in situ XRD during SOFC operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.099
5,16374,It was determined that the most significant change was a gradual increase in the cubic lattice parameters of the LSCF from 3.92502 angstrom (as determined from the integration of the first 20 h of XRD patterns) to 3.92650 angstrom (from the integration of the last 20 h).,Lattice expansion of LSCF-6428 cathodes measured by in situ XRD during SOFC operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.099
6,16374,This analysis also revealed that there were several peaks from unidentified minor phases that increased in intensity over this timeframe.,Lattice expansion of LSCF-6428 cathodes measured by in situ XRD during SOFC operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.099
7,16374,"After a temporary loss of airflow early in the test, the cell generated between 225 and 250 mW cm(-2) for the remainder of the test.",Lattice expansion of LSCF-6428 cathodes measured by in situ XRD during SOFC operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.099
8,16374,A large low frequency arc in the impedance spectra suggests the cell performance was gas diffusion limited and that there is room for improvement in air delivery to the cell.,Lattice expansion of LSCF-6428 cathodes measured by in situ XRD during SOFC operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.099
