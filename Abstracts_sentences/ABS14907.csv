1,14907,"For the purposes of optimising important system parameters in direct internally reforming (DIR) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems, a detailed knowledge of the methane steam reforming rate on the anode is needed.",Intrinsic reaction kinetics of methane steam reforming on a nickel/zirconia anode,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00447-4
2,14907,"In order to shed light on the present poorly understood kinetics, a study of the methane steam reforming rate given by a typical thin electrolyte-supported nickel/zirconia SOFC anode has been carried out using a tubular plug flow differential reactor.",Intrinsic reaction kinetics of methane steam reforming on a nickel/zirconia anode,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00447-4
3,14907,These tests were essentially gradientless.,Intrinsic reaction kinetics of methane steam reforming on a nickel/zirconia anode,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00447-4
4,14907,"The reaction rate was studied as a function of temperature (700-1000 degrees C) and the partial pressure of methane (2-40 kPa), hydrogen (10-70 kPa) and steam (10-70 kPa).",Intrinsic reaction kinetics of methane steam reforming on a nickel/zirconia anode,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00447-4
5,14907,The total pressure was nominally 1 arm.,Intrinsic reaction kinetics of methane steam reforming on a nickel/zirconia anode,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00447-4
6,14907,"The reaction was first order in methane with a weak positive effect of hydrogen, and a stronger negative effect of steam, The kinetics were complicated by the fact that reaction orders in hydrogen and steam were either temperature dependent and/or depended on the partial pressures of other components in the gas mixture.",Intrinsic reaction kinetics of methane steam reforming on a nickel/zirconia anode,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00447-4
7,14907,"Furthermore, Arrhenius-type plots gave gradients which were dependent on the steam partial pressure.",Intrinsic reaction kinetics of methane steam reforming on a nickel/zirconia anode,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00447-4
8,14907,It is clear from this study that the reaction cannot be represented as simply as is generally attempted in the literature.,Intrinsic reaction kinetics of methane steam reforming on a nickel/zirconia anode,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00447-4
