2,12232,Degradation of cathode performances by Cr poisoning is studied.,Chromium poisoning and degradation at LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 cathode with LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2 functional layer for SOFC under open circuit condition,10.1007/s10008-018-3923-1
3,12232,"Specific polarization resistance (R (p)) increases with time to power of 1/4 and 1/3 in LNF cathode with and without functional layer under exposure of Cr vapors at 750 A degrees C for 900 and 500 h, respectively.",Chromium poisoning and degradation at LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 cathode with LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2 functional layer for SOFC under open circuit condition,10.1007/s10008-018-3923-1
4,12232,Electrochemical impedance spectra illustrate LNF exhibits greater R (p) than that of LNF with functional layer under exposure of Cr vapors due to strong Cr deposition at LNF/ scandia stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) interface.,Chromium poisoning and degradation at LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 cathode with LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2 functional layer for SOFC under open circuit condition,10.1007/s10008-018-3923-1
5,12232,"No significant degradation in performance has been observed after 900 h of operating under the same condition due to very little Cr deposition at LNF-GDC/ScSZ interface, suggesting little poisoning effect for O-2 reduction on LNF cathode with functional layer.",Chromium poisoning and degradation at LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 cathode with LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2 functional layer for SOFC under open circuit condition,10.1007/s10008-018-3923-1
6,12232,These demonstrate LNF cathode with functional layer has high resistance towards Cr deposition and high tolerance towards Cr poisoning.,Chromium poisoning and degradation at LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 cathode with LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2 functional layer for SOFC under open circuit condition,10.1007/s10008-018-3923-1
