1,9545,A Pt functional layer was deposited between a Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (50 wt. % Ni) anode and an 8 mol.,Influence of a platinum functional layer on a Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 anode for thin-film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1116/1.4927160
2,9545,% yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte in order to enhance the performance of a thin film solid oxide fuel cell.,Influence of a platinum functional layer on a Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 anode for thin-film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1116/1.4927160
3,9545,"By inserting this ultrathin functional layer, the ohmic impedance of the single cell was significantly reduced, and the maximum power density was increased by a factor of similar to 1.55.",Influence of a platinum functional layer on a Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 anode for thin-film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1116/1.4927160
4,9545,"However, excessive deposition of the Pt functional layer caused ionic conduction pathway blocking between the yttria-stabilized zirconia and Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (Ni-GDC), deactivating the Ni-GDC as a mixed ionic and electronic conducting anode.",Influence of a platinum functional layer on a Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 anode for thin-film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1116/1.4927160
5,9545,"As a result, both the ohmic impedance and anodic faradaic impedance were increased after introduction of excessive Pt functional layer, and the maximum power density was also reduced.",Influence of a platinum functional layer on a Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 anode for thin-film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1116/1.4927160
