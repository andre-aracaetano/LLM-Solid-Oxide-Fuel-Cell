1,18367,The kinetics of the steam reforming reaction of CH(4) were investigated at temperatures 750 to 950 degrees C under both open-circuit and closed-circuit conditions on Ni-YSZ (Yttria Stabilized Zirconia) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes and polycrystalline Ni film SOFC anodes of measured Ni surface area.,"Catalysis, Electrocatalysis and Electrochemical Promotion of the Steam Reforming of Methane over Ni Film and Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes",10.1007/BF02375296
2,18367,It was found that the rate of methane reforming on the Ni surface exhibits a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type dependence on P(CH4) and P(H2O) which results from competitive adsorption of carbonaceous species and oxygen or OH.,"Catalysis, Electrocatalysis and Electrochemical Promotion of the Steam Reforming of Methane over Ni Film and Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes",10.1007/BF02375296
3,18367,Consequently the rate is maximized for intermediate P(CH4) to P(H2O),"Catalysis, Electrocatalysis and Electrochemical Promotion of the Steam Reforming of Methane over Ni Film and Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes",10.1007/BF02375296

5,18367,The reaction kinetics are affected significantly by cell current and potential under closed-circuit conditions.,"Catalysis, Electrocatalysis and Electrochemical Promotion of the Steam Reforming of Methane over Ni Film and Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes",10.1007/BF02375296
6,18367,"Over a rather wide range of operating conditions the observed rate changes are Faradaic, which implies negligible variation in the catalytic properties of the Ni surface with potential.","Catalysis, Electrocatalysis and Electrochemical Promotion of the Steam Reforming of Methane over Ni Film and Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes",10.1007/BF02375296
7,18367,"At lower temperatures, however, and particularly under conditions of carbon deposition, the rates of CO, H(2), CO(2) and, more importantly, carbon formation exhibit pronounced non-Faradaic (NEMCA), or electrochemical promotion, behaviour.","Catalysis, Electrocatalysis and Electrochemical Promotion of the Steam Reforming of Methane over Ni Film and Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes",10.1007/BF02375296
8,18367,Some non-Faradaic behaviour is also observed for higher H(2)O to CH(4) ratios but in this ease the effect of applied potential is reproducible but not readily reversible.,"Catalysis, Electrocatalysis and Electrochemical Promotion of the Steam Reforming of Methane over Ni Film and Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes",10.1007/BF02375296
