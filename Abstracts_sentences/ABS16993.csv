1,16993,Thermal cycling and thermal ageing tests were performed on Crofer22APU/glass-ceramic/Anode-Supported-Electrolyte (ASE) joined samples in air at the SOFC operating temperature of 800 degrees C.,Thermal cycling and ageing of a glass-ceramic sealant for planar SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.083
2,16993,The Crofer22APU had been polished and preoxidised at 900 degrees C for 2 h. The diffusion behaviour at the two interfaces was examined and revealed slight diffusion of chromium and manganese from Crofer22APU into the glass-ceramic.,Thermal cycling and ageing of a glass-ceramic sealant for planar SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.083
