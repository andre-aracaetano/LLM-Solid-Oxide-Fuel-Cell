2,12127,A prereyui-site for introducing this technology on the market is the controlled formation of the interface between electrodes and the electrolyte.,Chemical interaction and diffusion on interface cathode/electrolyte of SOFC,10.1007/s002160051488
3,12127,In the case of using an electrolyte based on LaGaO(3) the formation of third phases and the diffusion of individual metallic cations from and to the electrolyte was investigated with the aid of point analyses on micrographs of the environment of the interface using quantitative EDS analysis.,Chemical interaction and diffusion on interface cathode/electrolyte of SOFC,10.1007/s002160051488
4,12127,"In case of an anode of Ni-CeO(2) cermet the mixed oxide SrLaGa(3)O(7) is formed and, in addition, a relatively pronounced transport of La from the electrolyte into the CeO(2) phase was observed.",Chemical interaction and diffusion on interface cathode/electrolyte of SOFC,10.1007/s002160051488
5,12127,"A relatively strong diffusion of Mn and an even stronger diffusion of Co into the electrolyte took place between the cathode of, e.g., La(0.75)Sr(0.2)Mn(0.8)Co(0.2)O(3) and the La(0.9)Sr(0.1)Ga(0.8)Mg(0.2)O(3) electrolyte, whereas a weak transport of Ga to the cathode was identified.",Chemical interaction and diffusion on interface cathode/electrolyte of SOFC,10.1007/s002160051488
