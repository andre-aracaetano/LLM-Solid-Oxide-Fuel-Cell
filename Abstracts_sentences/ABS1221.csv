1,1221,Preliminary results indicate that acetylene and hydrogen peroxide are viable reactants for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system.,Results Using Processed Acetylene Fuel Stream in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1115/1.3211102
2,1221,Acetylene was hydrogenated and reformed to a suitable feed at the anode while hydrogen peroxide was decomposed to provide oxygen to the cathode.,Results Using Processed Acetylene Fuel Stream in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1115/1.3211102
3,1221,"Roughly 45% fuel and oxidant utilization were demonstrated on a SOFC stack manufactured by Delphi Corporation (Troy, MI).",Results Using Processed Acetylene Fuel Stream in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1115/1.3211102
4,1221,These reactants offer high energy storage as well as an entirely self-contained power system with no exhaust streams.,Results Using Processed Acetylene Fuel Stream in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1115/1.3211102
5,1221,Such attributes are favorable for undersea vehicles and perhaps other applications that require a self-contained or air-independent power system.,Results Using Processed Acetylene Fuel Stream in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1115/1.3211102
