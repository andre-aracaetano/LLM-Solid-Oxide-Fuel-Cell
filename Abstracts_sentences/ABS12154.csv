1,12154,"Grain-boundary plane distributions (GBPDs), grain size distribution (GSDs), and upper tail departure from log-normal GSDs were quantified in dense and porous La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 samples to understand expected microstructures in solid oxide fuel cells.",Crystallography of Interfaces and Grain Size Distributions in Sr-Doped LaMnO3,10.1111/jace.12984
2,12154,Samples were sintered at 1450 degrees C for 4 h and then annealed between 800 degrees C and 1450 degrees C. The GBPDs and normalized GSDs reached steady state during sintering and little variation occurred during annealing.,Crystallography of Interfaces and Grain Size Distributions in Sr-Doped LaMnO3,10.1111/jace.12984
3,12154,"The GBPDs were nearly isotropic, with the relative areas of {001} planes being slightly higher than random (and the relative areas of {111} planes being less than random).",Crystallography of Interfaces and Grain Size Distributions in Sr-Doped LaMnO3,10.1111/jace.12984
4,12154,"The porous sample had an almost identical GBPD, whereas the almost isotropic pore boundary plane distribution was essentially opposite to the GBPD.",Crystallography of Interfaces and Grain Size Distributions in Sr-Doped LaMnO3,10.1111/jace.12984
5,12154,"The upper tails of the experimental GSDs, and several theoretical distributions, were characterized using peaks-over-threshold analysis.",Crystallography of Interfaces and Grain Size Distributions in Sr-Doped LaMnO3,10.1111/jace.12984
6,12154,"Dense samples, and all normal grain growth models, exhibit lower frequencies of large grains in the upper tail than would a log-normal distribution, and the experimental distributions are similar to the Mullins distribution.",Crystallography of Interfaces and Grain Size Distributions in Sr-Doped LaMnO3,10.1111/jace.12984
7,12154,"Porous samples, however, have an anomalous increased frequency of large grains in the upper tail, as compared to all the model distributions, even though other metrics of the microstructure indicate the dense and porous systems are similar.",Crystallography of Interfaces and Grain Size Distributions in Sr-Doped LaMnO3,10.1111/jace.12984
