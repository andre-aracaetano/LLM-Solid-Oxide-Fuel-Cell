3,20351,"However, most work has focused on the behavior of oxygen while cation transport has received relatively little attention, even though cation diffusion is responsible for many phenomena, including sintering, radiation damage evolution, and deformation processes.",Insights into dynamic processes of cations in pyrochlores and other complex oxides,10.1039/c5cp03372a
4,20351,"Here, we use accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to examine the kinetics of cation defects in one class of complex oxides, A(2)B(2)O(7) pyrochlore.",Insights into dynamic processes of cations in pyrochlores and other complex oxides,10.1039/c5cp03372a
5,20351,"We find that, in some pyrochlore chemistries, B cation defects are kinetically unstable, transforming to A cation defects and antisites at rates faster than they can diffuse.",Insights into dynamic processes of cations in pyrochlores and other complex oxides,10.1039/c5cp03372a

7,20351,"Further, these A cation defects, either interstitials or vacancies, can interact with antisite disorder, reordering the material locally, though this process is much more efficient for interstitials than vacancies.",Insights into dynamic processes of cations in pyrochlores and other complex oxides,10.1039/c5cp03372a
