1,11593,"In this paper a phosphorus doped perovskite, SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3-delta (SCFP), is evaluated as a cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.",SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3-δ perovskite as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta12781h
2,11593,"It is observed that the phosphorus dopant can prevent the Sr-Co-Fe-O system from oxygen vacancy ordering and stabilise the crystallite structure of the oxide in the 3C perovskite phase at high temperature as proved by XRD, TGA, O-2-TPD and electrical conductivity characterization.",SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3-δ perovskite as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta12781h
3,11593,SCFP shows excellent chemical compatibility with Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte even at 1200 degrees C.,SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3-δ perovskite as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta12781h
4,11593,"The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity is investigated on a dense SDC pellet in a symmetrical cell configuration, and the area specific resistance (ASRs) of SCFP is as low as 0.097 Omega cm(2) at 589 degrees C, which is comparable to the performance of the benchmark cathode BSCF.",SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3-δ perovskite as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta12781h
5,11593,The stabilised structure for SCFP also improves the stability of the ORR activity at high temperature.,SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3-δ perovskite as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta12781h
