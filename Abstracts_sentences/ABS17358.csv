3,17358,We show that introduction of chemically mismatched octahedral cations into a cubic perovskite oxide parent phase modifies structure and composition beyond the unit cell length scale on the B sublattice alone.,Single Sublattice Endotaxial Phase Separation Driven by Charge Frustration in a Complex Oxide,10.1021/ja403611s
