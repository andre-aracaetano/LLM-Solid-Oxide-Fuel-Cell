1,18479,"Electrical properties of grain boundaries, free of any secondary phases, have been investigated in cubic nanostructured zirconia ceramics.",Blocking Effect in High Purity Nanostructured Cubic Zirconia Ceramics,10.1002/fuce.200800016
2,18479,Pure 8YSZ powders were synthesised by spray pyrolysis process.,Blocking Effect in High Purity Nanostructured Cubic Zirconia Ceramics,10.1002/fuce.200800016
3,18479,These powders were used to perform dense nanostructured ceramics using two compaction techniques: cold isostatic pressing (CIP) and hot uniaxial pressing (HUP) in an oxidising atmosphere.,Blocking Effect in High Purity Nanostructured Cubic Zirconia Ceramics,10.1002/fuce.200800016
4,18479,Grain sizes ranging from 25 to 242 nm and relative densities from 93 up to 98% were obtained.,Blocking Effect in High Purity Nanostructured Cubic Zirconia Ceramics,10.1002/fuce.200800016
5,18479,Electrical contribution of the bulk and the blocking effect due to grain boundaries were determined by impedance spectroscopy and analysed according to the brick layer model.,Blocking Effect in High Purity Nanostructured Cubic Zirconia Ceramics,10.1002/fuce.200800016
6,18479,The additional blocking effect is a decreasing function of the grain size but its magnitude reaches a plateau quite insensitive to the grain size below 100 nm.,Blocking Effect in High Purity Nanostructured Cubic Zirconia Ceramics,10.1002/fuce.200800016
7,18479,This indicates that the recorded electrical contribution originates from an intrinsic effect.,Blocking Effect in High Purity Nanostructured Cubic Zirconia Ceramics,10.1002/fuce.200800016
8,18479,This can be related to a dominant electrical contribution of space charge layers located at the grain boundaries area of nanoscale grain sizes.,Blocking Effect in High Purity Nanostructured Cubic Zirconia Ceramics,10.1002/fuce.200800016
