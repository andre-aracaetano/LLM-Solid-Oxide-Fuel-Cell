1,14795,Positive muons implanted in proton-conducting oxides can be used to gain insight into the diffusion and trapping behaviour of light particles in these materials which are used as solid oxide electrolytes in high-temperature fuel cells.,μSR-Experiments on proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/S0921-4526(00)00442-7
2,14795,"We have studied both SrZrO3 and Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O8.73 compounds, and the muon mobility was investigated in order to get more information about internal hydrogen motion.",μSR-Experiments on proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/S0921-4526(00)00442-7
3,14795,With this knowledge we intend to improve the hydrogen usability for fuel cell applications by chemical tailoring of new compounds.,μSR-Experiments on proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/S0921-4526(00)00442-7
4,14795,"In SrZrO3 which does not contain any large nuclear dipole moments, the material was doped with Sc in various concentrations.",μSR-Experiments on proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/S0921-4526(00)00442-7
5,14795,Sc3+ as an aliovalent substitution for the Zr4+ causes on the one hand the proton conductivity and on the other a lower positive charge at a regular Zr4+-site.,μSR-Experiments on proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/S0921-4526(00)00442-7
6,14795,"From the peak in the muon depolarization rates between 150 and 300 K we conclude that the muons are trapped at a site 2.5 Angstrom from the dopant with an activation energy for escape of about 300meV, The measurements on Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O8.73 do not show any pronounced peak in the relaxation rates, and the results appear insensitive to the loading of the samples with hydrogen.",μSR-Experiments on proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/S0921-4526(00)00442-7
7,14795,The results indicate comparatively low muon mobility without tendencies to a preferred trapping at the Nb atoms.,μSR-Experiments on proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/S0921-4526(00)00442-7
