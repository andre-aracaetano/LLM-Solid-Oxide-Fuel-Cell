4,20626,"cm(2) at 400 degrees C. Naturally, grains and pores at the nanoscale are essential, but the decisive aspect to high-performance is presented here for the first time.","Hetero-Interfaces at Nanoscaled (La,Sr)CoO3-δ Thin-Film Cathodes Enhancing Oxygen Surface-Exchange Properties",10.1149/2.017304jes
5,20626,"In fact, our LSC thin-film cathodes exhibit enhanced oxygen surface-exchange properties, with a k* value up to 47 times better than that of bulks of (nominally) equal composition.","Hetero-Interfaces at Nanoscaled (La,Sr)CoO3-δ Thin-Film Cathodes Enhancing Oxygen Surface-Exchange Properties",10.1149/2.017304jes
6,20626,"The presence of secondary phases such as (La,Sr)(2)CoO4+/-delta and Co3O4 leads to this significant improvement, forming finely dispersed hetero-interfaces with LSC.","Hetero-Interfaces at Nanoscaled (La,Sr)CoO3-δ Thin-Film Cathodes Enhancing Oxygen Surface-Exchange Properties",10.1149/2.017304jes
7,20626,"Interesting enough, these secondary phases crystallize out during a low-temperature decomposition of the metal organic sal-gel film.","Hetero-Interfaces at Nanoscaled (La,Sr)CoO3-δ Thin-Film Cathodes Enhancing Oxygen Surface-Exchange Properties",10.1149/2.017304jes
8,20626,"Thermodynamic calculations revealed that low oxygen partial pressures must prevail for this, which occur during the oxidation of the organics.","Hetero-Interfaces at Nanoscaled (La,Sr)CoO3-δ Thin-Film Cathodes Enhancing Oxygen Surface-Exchange Properties",10.1149/2.017304jes
9,20626,"Deliberate stoichiometry variations with up to 10 % A-site (La, Sr) or B-site (Co) excess added to La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta did not lead to further beneficial effects.","Hetero-Interfaces at Nanoscaled (La,Sr)CoO3-δ Thin-Film Cathodes Enhancing Oxygen Surface-Exchange Properties",10.1149/2.017304jes
