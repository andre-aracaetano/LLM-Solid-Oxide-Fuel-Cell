2,3739,This paper focuses the electrolyte manufacturing on the basis of 8YSZ (8 mol.-% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2).,Multi-layer thin-film electrolytes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.01.043
3,3739,The electrolyte layers are applied by a physical vapor deposition (PVD) gas flow sputtering (GFS) process.,Multi-layer thin-film electrolytes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.01.043
4,3739,"The gas-tightness of the electrolyte is significantly improved when sequential oxidic and metallic thin-film multi-layers are deposited, which interrupt the columnar grain structure of single-layer electrolytes.",Multi-layer thin-film electrolytes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.01.043
5,3739,Such electrolytes with two or eight oxide/metal layers and a total thickness of about 4 mu m obtain leakage rates of less than 3 x 10(-4) hPa dm(3) s(-1) cm(-2) (Delta p: 100 hPa) at room temperature and therefore fulfill the gas tightness requirements.,Multi-layer thin-film electrolytes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.01.043
6,3739,They are also highly tolerant with respect to surface flaws and particulate impurities which can be present on the graded anode underground.,Multi-layer thin-film electrolytes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.01.043
7,3739,MSC cell tests with double-layer and multilayer electrolytes feature high power densities more than 1.4 W cm(-2) at 850 degrees C and underline the high potential of MSC cells.,Multi-layer thin-film electrolytes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.01.043
