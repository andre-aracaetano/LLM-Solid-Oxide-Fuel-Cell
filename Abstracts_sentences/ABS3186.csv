1,3186,"We have adopted three different methods dip-coating, brush pen painting, and ion-impregnating, to fabricate cathodes for anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells; and studied the performances of the cells using cathodes fabricated by these three different methods.",Effect of cathode fabrication method on characteristics of anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.11.046
2,3186,"The cell with ion-impregnated cathode presented the best electrochemical performances in these three cells, and it generated a maximum power density of 446 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, when operating with humidified hydrogen.",Effect of cathode fabrication method on characteristics of anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.11.046
3,3186,"The cells with dip-coated cathode and brush pen painted cathode produced acceptable electrochemical performances: they generated maximum power densities of 403 and 405 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, respectively, when running on humidified hydrogen; also, they represented more stable, much easier processes and lower cost.",Effect of cathode fabrication method on characteristics of anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.11.046
