1,17290,"The synthesis and electrical characterisation over a range of oxygen partial pressures (10(-20) to 1 atm) are reported for the cubic perovskite niobate-titanates Sr(1-x/2)Ti(1-x)Nb(x)O(3-delta), which are proposed as potential anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells.","Synthesis and Electrical Characterisation of the Perovskite Niobate-Titanates, Sr1-x/2Ti1-xNbxO3-δ",10.1007/BF02376024
2,17290,"Single phase samples were observed for 0 <= x <= 0.4, and phase purity was retained on annealing at both high and low oxygen partial pressures.","Synthesis and Electrical Characterisation of the Perovskite Niobate-Titanates, Sr1-x/2Ti1-xNbxO3-δ",10.1007/BF02376024
3,17290,"Good electrical conductivity was observed on reduction in low oxygen partial pressures, with a maximum for the sample with 25% Nb (x=0.25), sigma = 5.6 Scm(-1) at 930 degrees C (P (O(2))= 10(-18) atm).","Synthesis and Electrical Characterisation of the Perovskite Niobate-Titanates, Sr1-x/2Ti1-xNbxO3-δ",10.1007/BF02376024
4,17290,For dense samples the higher the Nb content the more resistant the reduced sample was to reoxidation as the oxygen partial pressure was increased.,"Synthesis and Electrical Characterisation of the Perovskite Niobate-Titanates, Sr1-x/2Ti1-xNbxO3-δ",10.1007/BF02376024
