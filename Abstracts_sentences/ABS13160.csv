1,13160,"Solid oxide fuel cells are thought to be capable of a wide range of fuels, but the direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuels increases the risk of carbon deposition at the anode.",Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 impregnated with Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3-δ@CuO as SOFC anode with increased carbon-deposition resistant for direct hydrocarbon fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.069
2,13160,"In this research, a novel full cell structure supported by porous Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) skeleton is proposed and anode material Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3-delta (BCYN) is proposed to be impregnated on the skeleton to form a multi-functional anode.",Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 impregnated with Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3-δ@CuO as SOFC anode with increased carbon-deposition resistant for direct hydrocarbon fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.069
3,13160,"In the operating reductional atmosphere, Ni is reduced from the BCYN and provides electrochemical catalyticity, and BCYN can absorb water on its surface to prevent carbon deposition.",Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 impregnated with Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3-δ@CuO as SOFC anode with increased carbon-deposition resistant for direct hydrocarbon fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.069
4,13160,"5% Cu is also applied to the anode to increase electron conductivity by impregnation, and it doubles the peak power density.",Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 impregnated with Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3-δ@CuO as SOFC anode with increased carbon-deposition resistant for direct hydrocarbon fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.069
5,13160,"The composite Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3-delta@CuO anode is evaluated and found to have good carbon deposition resistance with 3% humidified C2H6 in constant current operation for 120 h, and withstand 3% humidified CH4 in OCV condition for nearly 160 h.",Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 impregnated with Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)0.8Ni0.2O3-δ@CuO as SOFC anode with increased carbon-deposition resistant for direct hydrocarbon fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.069
