1,10053,Bias-dependent mechanisms of reversible and irreversible electrochemical processes on a (La0.5Sr0.5)2CoO4 +/- modified (LaxSr1-x)CoO3- surface are studied using dynamic electrochemical strain microscopy (D-ESM).,Nanoscale Probing of Voltage Activated Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions in Nanopatterned (LaxSr1-x)CoO3-Cathodes,10.1002/aenm.201200681
2,10053,The reversible oxygen reduction/evolution process is activated at voltages as low as 3-4 V and the degree of transformation increases linearly with applied bias.,Nanoscale Probing of Voltage Activated Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions in Nanopatterned (LaxSr1-x)CoO3-Cathodes,10.1002/aenm.201200681
3,10053,The irreversible processes associated with static surface deformation become apparent above 10-12 V. Post-mortem focused-ion milling combined with atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy is used to establish the mechanisms of irreversible transformations and attribute it to amorphization of the top layer of material.,Nanoscale Probing of Voltage Activated Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions in Nanopatterned (LaxSr1-x)CoO3-Cathodes,10.1002/aenm.201200681
4,10053,These studies both establish the framework for probing irreversible electrochemical processes in solids and illustrate rich spectrum of electrochemical transformations underpinning electrocatalytic activity in cobaltites.,Nanoscale Probing of Voltage Activated Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions in Nanopatterned (LaxSr1-x)CoO3-Cathodes,10.1002/aenm.201200681
