2,13276,"Its use with the cathode material La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) is advantageous due to their reaction (above 1000 degrees C) that leads to the formation of perovskite compounds called BLSITCFx (Ba(x)L(0.58(1-x))Sr(0.4(1-x))In(0.3)Ti(0.7)xCo(0.2(1-x))Fe(0.8(1-x))O(3-delta), with 0 <= x <= 1) at the cathode/electrolyte interface.",Characterisation and optimisation of the cathode/electrolyte couple for SOFC LSCF/BIT07,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.042

4,13276,"An area specific resistance (ASR) value of 0.07 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C has been reached and more generally the cathodes exhibit good performance (below 0.2 Omega cm(2)) for a large range of thermal treatments, cathode grain sizes and thicknesses.",Characterisation and optimisation of the cathode/electrolyte couple for SOFC LSCF/BIT07,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.042
