1,11989,In this work we report on the combined use of microwave (MW) heating sources for the powder synthesis and the ceramic sintering of Sm and Ca co-doped ceria Ce0.8Sm0.18Ca0.02O1.9 polycrystalline materials for potential application as an electrolyte in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Microwave synthesis & sintering of Sm and Ca co-doped ceria ceramics,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.07.161

3,11989,"MW sintering of ceramic pellets leads to only slightly increased resistivity as compared to conventional sintering, but offers massive energy and time savings for potential industrial production processes.",Microwave synthesis & sintering of Sm and Ca co-doped ceria ceramics,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.07.161
4,11989,"Exceptionally high oxygen ion conductivity without any significant electronic contribution was found in MW synthesized and MW sintered pellets, where the total resistivity, composed of grain boundary and bulk contributions, was found to be in the range of 0.5-1 ka at 500 degrees C. Sm- and Ca co-doped ceria may be well-suited for electrolyte materials in IT-SOFCs.",Microwave synthesis & sintering of Sm and Ca co-doped ceria ceramics,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.07.161
