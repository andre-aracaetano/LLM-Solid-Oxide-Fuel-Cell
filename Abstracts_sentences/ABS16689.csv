3,16689,Electrochemical impedance spectra of these LSCF-GDC composite cathodes at open circuit potentials were measured using an electrolyte-supported LSCF-GDC/GDC/LSCF-GDC symmetric cell configuration for stability evaluation.,Stability of nanorod-structured La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.084
4,16689,"The results show that the conventional LSCF-GDC composite cathode has poor stability, with its polarization resistance increasing from 0.80 to 1.37 Omega cm(2) after being polarized under a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for 120 h at 650 degrees C.",Stability of nanorod-structured La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.084
5,16689,This degradation is attributed to the agglomeration of cathode materials and to poor contact between the cathode and the electrolyte.,Stability of nanorod-structured La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.084
6,16689,"hi contrast, the nanorod-structured LSCF-GDC composite cathode exhibits an excellent performance stability, since its polarization resistance decreases from 0.097 to 0.077 Omega cm(2) after polarization for 144 h under a current density as high as 300 mA cm(-2).",Stability of nanorod-structured La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.084
