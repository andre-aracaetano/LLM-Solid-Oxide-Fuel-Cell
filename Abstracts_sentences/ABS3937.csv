7,3937,"The results indicate that the cell performance can be significantly enhanced using catalyst layers of 30:35:35 and 40:30:30 wt.% Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 sintered at 1100 degrees C, achieving power densities above 50 mW cm(-2) under 0.45 ethanol-air ratio at temperatures as low as 450 degrees C. After testing for 15 h, all cells present a gradual loss of power density, without carbon deposition, which is mainly attributed to the partial re-oxidation of Ni at the anode.",Improvement of performance in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells operated on ethanol and air mixtures using Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 catalyst layer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.05.097
