5,1583,"Thus, feeding dry ethanol to the SOFC with a Ni/doped-ceria anodic catalytic layer evidenced that water produced from the electrochemical hydrogen oxidation provides steam for the internal reforming resulting in great stability of the fuel cells tested during similar to 100 h. The combined catalysis and SOFC results demonstrate Ni/doped-ceria is as candidate anode layer for stable SOFC running on bioethanol.",The role of the ceria dopant on Ni / doped-ceria anodic layer cermets for direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.155
