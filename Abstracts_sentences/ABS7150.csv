1,7150,"In order to offer a guideline to search for new oxyapatites exhibiting high ionic conductivities (a) for possible application in solid oxide fuel cells operating at intermediate temperatures (IT-SOFCs), a mathematical model is developed, i.e., a linear relation of a and the relative Coulomb energy, to predict the a of oxyapatites.",Prediction of oxygen ion conduction from relative Coulomb electronic interactions in oxyapatites,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.017
2,7150,"The inputs to the model are two readily available elemental properties, namely the ionic radius and the electronegativity of the constituent elements.",Prediction of oxygen ion conduction from relative Coulomb electronic interactions in oxyapatites,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.017
3,7150,The model not only predicts the ionic conductivities of 45 oxyapatites but also rationalizes the observed trends reported in the literatures.,Prediction of oxygen ion conduction from relative Coulomb electronic interactions in oxyapatites,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.017
