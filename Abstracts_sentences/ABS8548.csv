1,8548,"Mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) oxides, SrFeCo0.5Ox, SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta have been synthesized and prepared on yttria-stabilized zirconia as anodes for solid oxide fuel cells.",Electrochemical performance of mixed ionic-electronic conducting oxides as anodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00558-X
2,8548,"Power output measurements show that the anodes composed of such kinds of oxides exhibit modest electrochemical activities to both H-2 and CH4 fuels, giving maximum power densities of around 0.1 W/cm(2) at 950 degrees C. Polarization and AC impedance measurements found that large activation overpotentials and ohmic resistance drops were the main causes for the relative inferior performance to the Ni-YSZ anode.",Electrochemical performance of mixed ionic-electronic conducting oxides as anodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00558-X

4,8548,"in particular, for the SrFeCo0.5Ox oxide interlayered Ni-YSZ anode, the maximum power output reaches 0.25 W/cm2 on CH,, exceeding those of both SrFeCo0.5Ox and the Ni-YSZ, as anodes alone.",Electrochemical performance of mixed ionic-electronic conducting oxides as anodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00558-X
