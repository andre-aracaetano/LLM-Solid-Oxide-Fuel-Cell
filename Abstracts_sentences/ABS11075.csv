1,11075,Anode-supported electrolyte composite membranes were prepared by a multilayer tape casting and co-sintering procedure.,Improvement of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.03.022
2,11075,"Nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ), nickel/scandia-stabilized zirconia (Ni/ScSZ) cermets, ScSZ, and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.9 (CGO) were used as materials of anode substrate, anode functional layer, electrolyte and interlayer.",Improvement of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.03.022
3,11075,"After tape casting and dryness, the green tapes were co-sintered at 1350, 1400, and 1450 degrees C for 4 h in air.",Improvement of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.03.022
4,11075,Then the LSCF-CGO composite cathode was deposited on the CGO surface by screen-printing and sintered at 1100 degrees C for 3 h. The performance of the anode-supported planar single SOFC was investigated in detail.,Improvement of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.03.022
