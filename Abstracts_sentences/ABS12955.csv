8,12955,"Microstructural and analytical results indicate a complex interdiffusion behaviour of several cations: Mn and Cr from the steel diffuse into the ceramic layers, Mn from the Mn2O3 diffuses into the perovskite-based contact layer, and Ca and Cu from the perovskite diffuse into the manganese oxide layer.","Interface reactions between electrically conductive ceramics and ferritic steel-I.: The system Cr-22Fe-0.5Mn/Mn2O3/(La,Ca)(Cr,Co,Cu)O3",10.1016/j.mseb.2008.03.018
9,12955,Chemical equilibrium is established after about 2000 h of operation at 800 degrees C. Longer operation times only showed continuous scale growth of the formed reaction layers.,"Interface reactions between electrically conductive ceramics and ferritic steel-I.: The system Cr-22Fe-0.5Mn/Mn2O3/(La,Ca)(Cr,Co,Cu)O3",10.1016/j.mseb.2008.03.018
