2,12724,The sealing must take place on sintering the glass powder during the start-up of the cell between 700 and 850 degrees C. Further treatment at the operation temperature provokes the crystallisation of barium silicates with the subsequent increase of viscosity and seal rigidity.,"Sintering of glasses in the system RO-BaO-SiO2 (R= Mg, Zn) for sealing SOFC",10.3989/cyv.2007.v46.i2.251
3,12724,This work is a study of the sintering behaviour of these glasses using different heating rates and particle-size distributions of the glass powder in order to obtain dense and homogeneous seals.,"Sintering of glasses in the system RO-BaO-SiO2 (R= Mg, Zn) for sealing SOFC",10.3989/cyv.2007.v46.i2.251
4,12724,The glasses Zn1.5-55 and Mg1.5-55 with a particle size <63 pm heated at 2 degrees C/min reach final densities higher than 95%.,"Sintering of glasses in the system RO-BaO-SiO2 (R= Mg, Zn) for sealing SOFC",10.3989/cyv.2007.v46.i2.251
5,12724,A good agreement has been demonstrated between the measured sintering kinetics and those predicted with the sintering model of Clusters formation in the absence of concurrent crystallisation.,"Sintering of glasses in the system RO-BaO-SiO2 (R= Mg, Zn) for sealing SOFC",10.3989/cyv.2007.v46.i2.251
