1,20867,Significant attention has been directed towards the enhancement of the efficiency of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for energy applications.,Elucidating the origin of oxide ion blocking effects at GDC/SrZr(Y)O3/YSZ interfaces,10.1039/c7ta01589e
2,20867,"One of the main issues of an industry-applicable cathode material, (La0.6Sr0.4)(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-delta, used in conjunction with an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, is the formation of a SrZrO3 (SZ) phase which results from the chemical reaction between these two materials at high operating temperatures, notwithstanding the utilization of a diffusion barrier layer such as gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC).",Elucidating the origin of oxide ion blocking effects at GDC/SrZr(Y)O3/YSZ interfaces,10.1039/c7ta01589e
3,20867,"To gain a better understanding of the effect of the SZ phase on the oxide ion transport through SOFC heterostructures, dense GDC/SZ/YSZ and GDC/SZY(Y-doped SrZrO3)/YSZ multilayer films with well-defined interfaces are prepared using pulsed laser deposition (PLD).",Elucidating the origin of oxide ion blocking effects at GDC/SrZr(Y)O3/YSZ interfaces,10.1039/c7ta01589e
4,20867,"Isotope exchange depth profiling with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is employed to probe oxide ion transport through the multilayer films, and advanced analytical techniques including scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) and spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) are used to examine the heterointerfaces.",Elucidating the origin of oxide ion blocking effects at GDC/SrZr(Y)O3/YSZ interfaces,10.1039/c7ta01589e
5,20867,A steep drop in the concentration of the O-18 tracer SIMS depth profile reveals the existence of an oxide ion blocking effect occurring at the GDC/SZ(Y) and SZ(Y)/YSZ interfaces.,Elucidating the origin of oxide ion blocking effects at GDC/SrZr(Y)O3/YSZ interfaces,10.1039/c7ta01589e
6,20867,"By correlating this result with the EELS analysis of the O K-edge at SZ(Y)/YSZ interfaces, it was found that an interface-induced oxygen disorder possibly arising from Y diffusion across the interface could account for this behavior.",Elucidating the origin of oxide ion blocking effects at GDC/SrZr(Y)O3/YSZ interfaces,10.1039/c7ta01589e
7,20867,Thermodynamic considerations have been made on the construction of plausible phase diagrams for the Sr-Y-Zr-O system to analyze the stability of interfaces.,Elucidating the origin of oxide ion blocking effects at GDC/SrZr(Y)O3/YSZ interfaces,10.1039/c7ta01589e
8,20867,The implications of this interfacial disorder on the performance of SOFCs are discussed.,Elucidating the origin of oxide ion blocking effects at GDC/SrZr(Y)O3/YSZ interfaces,10.1039/c7ta01589e
