1,13681,Apatite-type rare-earth silicates are attractive materials with extensive applications such as in solid-oxide fuel cells due to their extremely high oxide-ion conductivity below 600 degrees C.,High oxide-ion conductivity in Si-deficient La9.565(Si5.826□ 0.174)O26 apatite without interstitial oxygens due to the overbonded channel oxygens,10.1039/c8ta02237b
2,13681,The presence of interstitial (excess) oxygens has been believed to be responsible for the high conductivity of apatite-type materials.,High oxide-ion conductivity in Si-deficient La9.565(Si5.826□ 0.174)O26 apatite without interstitial oxygens due to the overbonded channel oxygens,10.1039/c8ta02237b
3,13681,"On the contrary, the present study clearly reveals the presence of Si vacancies square instead of interstitial oxygens in La-rich La-9.565(Si-5.826 square(0.174))O-26 using single-crystal neutron and X-ray diffraction analyses, density measurements and ab initio electronic calculations.",High oxide-ion conductivity in Si-deficient La9.565(Si5.826□ 0.174)O26 apatite without interstitial oxygens due to the overbonded channel oxygens,10.1039/c8ta02237b
4,13681,"Higher mobility (i.e., lower activation energy) of oxide ions along the c axis is a major reason for the high oxide-ion conductivity of La-9.565(Si-5.826 square(0.174))O-26 when compared with that of La9.333Si6O26.",High oxide-ion conductivity in Si-deficient La9.565(Si5.826□ 0.174)O26 apatite without interstitial oxygens due to the overbonded channel oxygens,10.1039/c8ta02237b
5,13681,"Excess La cations yield overbonded channel oxygens, leading to their highly anisotropic atomic displacements and high oxygen mobility along the c axis.",High oxide-ion conductivity in Si-deficient La9.565(Si5.826□ 0.174)O26 apatite without interstitial oxygens due to the overbonded channel oxygens,10.1039/c8ta02237b
6,13681,This novel finding of the overbonding effect without interstitial oxygens will open a new window for the design of better ion conductors.,High oxide-ion conductivity in Si-deficient La9.565(Si5.826□ 0.174)O26 apatite without interstitial oxygens due to the overbonded channel oxygens,10.1039/c8ta02237b
