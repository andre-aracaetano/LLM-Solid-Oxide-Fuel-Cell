1,8693,Non-sealed solid oxide fuel cell (NS-SOFC) micro-stacks with two gas channels were fabricated and operated successfully under various CH4/O-2 gas mixtures in a box-like stainless-steel chamber.,A non-sealed solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack with two gas channels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.057
2,8693,The cells with an anode-facing-cathode configuration were connected in serial by zigzag sliver sheets.,A non-sealed solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack with two gas channels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.057
3,8693,"Each cell consisted of the Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode, the YSZ electrolyte, and the Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9-impregnated (La0.75Sr0.25)(0.95)MnO3 cathode.",A non-sealed solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack with two gas channels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.057
4,8693,"In this configuration, to ensure the identical gas distribution over the electrode surfaces, two gas channels with small vents flanking the stacks were used as gas channels of methane and oxygen for anodes and cathodes, respectively.",A non-sealed solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack with two gas channels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.057
5,8693,The selectivity requirement of both the anode and cathode for the oxidation and reduction of CH4 and O-2 was lowered and the sheets could extend the residence time of gas flow over the electrode surface.,A non-sealed solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack with two gas channels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.057
