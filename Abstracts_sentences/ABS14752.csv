1,14752,"Dense proton-conducting BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3 (-) (delta) (BZCY) electrolyte membranes were successfully fabricated on NiO-BZCY anode substrates at a low temperature of 1,150 degrees C via a combined co-press and co-firing process.","Fabrication of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3 - δ -Based Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Co-Fired at 1,150 °C",10.1002/fuce.200900206
2,14752,"To fabricate full cells, the LaSr3Co1.5Fe1.5O10 (- delta)-BZCY composite cathode layer was fixed to the electrolyte membrane by two means of one-step co-firing and two-step co-firing, respectively.","Fabrication of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3 - δ -Based Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Co-Fired at 1,150 °C",10.1002/fuce.200900206
3,14752,The SEM results revealed that the cathode layer bonded more closely to the electrolyte membrane via the one-step co-firing process.,"Fabrication of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3 - δ -Based Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Co-Fired at 1,150 °C",10.1002/fuce.200900206
4,14752,"Correspondingly, determined from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measured under open current conditions, the electrode polarisation and Ohmic resistances of the one-step co-fired cell were dramatically lower than the other one for its excellent interface adhesion.","Fabrication of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3 - δ -Based Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Co-Fired at 1,150 °C",10.1002/fuce.200900206
5,14752,"With humidified hydrogen (2% H2O) as the fuel and static air as the oxidant, the maximum power density of the one-step co-fired single cell achieved 328 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, showing a much better performance than that of the two-step co-fired single cell, which was 264 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C.","Fabrication of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3 - δ -Based Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Co-Fired at 1,150 °C",10.1002/fuce.200900206
