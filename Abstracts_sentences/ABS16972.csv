1,16972,"Promising candidates of intermediate temperature electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), Ln(1 - x)Sr(x)Co(1 - y)Fe(y)O(3 - delta) (LSCF) (Ln = Pr, Nd, Gd; x = 0.2, 0.3; 0 less than or equal to y less than or equal to 1) were studied for their electrical conductivity, thermal expansion rate, cathodic polarization, and reactivity with gadolinia-doped ceria (Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95, CGO) or yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).","Ln1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ (Ln=Pr, Nd, Gd; x=0.2, 0.3) for the electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00757-9
2,16972,Superiorly electrical conductivity has been demonstrated for LSCF electrodes and all samples except Ln = Gd (y greater than or equal to 0.8) compositions demonstrate above 200 S/cm at 800 degreesC.,"Ln1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ (Ln=Pr, Nd, Gd; x=0.2, 0.3) for the electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00757-9
3,16972,"The adjustment of thermal expansion rate to electrolyte, which is one of the main problems of Ln(1-x)Sr(x)CoO(3 - delta), can be achieved to lower thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) values with more Fe substitution.","Ln1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ (Ln=Pr, Nd, Gd; x=0.2, 0.3) for the electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00757-9
4,16972,"Using CGO electrolytes, LSCF electrodes over the composition range of y=0.0-0.8 show high cathodic activity for oxygen reduction operating at temperatures from 700 to 900 degreesC and exhibit no significant dependence on the kind of lanthanide elements.","Ln1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ (Ln=Pr, Nd, Gd; x=0.2, 0.3) for the electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00757-9
5,16972,"These electrode behaviors are analogous to widely used La1 - xSrxCo1 - yFeyO3 - delta, Ln(1 - x)Sr(x)Co(1 - y)Fe(y) O3 - delta (Ln=Pr, Nd, Gd) systems, however, have potential advantages in reactivity with YSZ.","Ln1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ (Ln=Pr, Nd, Gd; x=0.2, 0.3) for the electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00757-9
6,16972,"In Ln=Pr, Nd (y=0.8) compositions, for example, the by-products of Ln(2)Zr(2)O(7) and SrZrO3 are both suppressed when sintered at 1000 degreesC for 100 h. LSCF also yield no reaction product with CGO when sintered at 1200 T for 36 h.
