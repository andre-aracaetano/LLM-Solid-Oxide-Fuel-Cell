3,19903,"The resultant SDCC electrolyte composite powder was uniaxially pressed into a circular pellet and sintered at 500 degrees C, 550 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 650 degrees C for 5 h. A symmetrical cell was finally fabricated by painting a conductive silver paste on both sides of the dense SDCC electrolyte composite pellet, and its I-V performance was measured using hydrogen and air as the fuel and oxidant, respectively.",Influence of sintering temperature on the power density of samarium-doped-ceria carbonate electrolyte composites for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.01.002
