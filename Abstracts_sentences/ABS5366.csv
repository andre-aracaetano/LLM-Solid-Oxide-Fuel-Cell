1,5366,"A novel type of LaNi1-xFexO3 (x=0.4-0.8) (LNF) perovskite oxide, specifically LaNi0.4Fe0.6O3 (LNF-46), was synthesized and studied as the cathode for low-temperature, 400-500 degrees C, solid oxide fuel cells (LTSOFCs).",A high functional cathode material,10.1149/1.2153898
2,5366,The maximum power density of 227 mW/cm(2) was obtained at 450 degrees C and a rather close result was also obtained at 400 degrees C.,A high functional cathode material,10.1149/1.2153898
3,5366,"The cell performance showed that with a proper choice of the LNF-based cathode material and a suitable electrolyte, the operation of LTSOFC at temperatures 400-500 degrees C is a realistic goal.",A high functional cathode material,10.1149/1.2153898
