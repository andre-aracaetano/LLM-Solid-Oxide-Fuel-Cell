3,20397,Geometry optimizations of 100 structures with a 12.5% dopant concentration allowed us to identify a clear correlation between the bending of the metal-oxygen-metal angle and the energies of the simulated cells.,Local Distortions and Dynamics in Hydrated Y-Doped BaZrO3,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04594
4,20397,"Depending on the type of bending, two configurations, designated as inward bending and outward bending, were defined.",Local Distortions and Dynamics in Hydrated Y-Doped BaZrO3,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04594
5,20397,The results demonstrate that a larger bending decreases the energy and that the lowest energies are observed for structures combining inward bending with protons being close to the dopant atoms.,Local Distortions and Dynamics in Hydrated Y-Doped BaZrO3,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04594
6,20397,These lowest energy structures are the ones with the strongest hydrogen bonds.,Local Distortions and Dynamics in Hydrated Y-Doped BaZrO3,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04594
7,20397,DFT-MD simulations in cells with different yttrium distributions provide complementary microscopic information on proton diffusion as they capture the dynamic distortions of the lattice caused by thermal motion.,Local Distortions and Dynamics in Hydrated Y-Doped BaZrO3,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04594
8,20397,A careful analysis of the proton jumps between different environments confirmed that the inward and outward bending states are relevant for the understanding of proton diffusion.,Local Distortions and Dynamics in Hydrated Y-Doped BaZrO3,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04594
9,20397,"Indeed, intra-octahedral jumps were shown to only occur starting from an outward configuration while the inward configuration seems to favor rotations around the oxygen.",Local Distortions and Dynamics in Hydrated Y-Doped BaZrO3,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04594
10,20397,"On average, in the DFT-MD simulations, the hydrogen bond lengths are shorter for the outward configuration which facilitates the intra-octahedral jumps.",Local Distortions and Dynamics in Hydrated Y-Doped BaZrO3,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04594
11,20397,"Diffusion coefficients and activation energies were also determined and compared to previous theoretical and experimental data, showing a good agreement with previous data measuring local proton motion.",Local Distortions and Dynamics in Hydrated Y-Doped BaZrO3,10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c04594
