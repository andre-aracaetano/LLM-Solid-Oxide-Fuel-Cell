2,19131,Such anode encompasses conventional NiO-YSZ (40 vol% Ni) with higher porosity at the fuel inlet side and Ni-YSZ electroless cermet (28-32 vol% Ni) with less porosity toward the electrolyte.,Engineered anode structure for enhanced electrochemical performance of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.077
3,19131,Microstructures and thicknesses of the bilayer anodes (BLA) are varied sequentially from 50 to 250 mu m for better thermal compatibility and cell performance.,Engineered anode structure for enhanced electrochemical performance of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.077
4,19131,"Significant augmentation in performance (3.5 A cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, 0.7 V) is obtained with engineered trilayer anode (TLA) having conventional anode support in conjunction with layers of electroless cermet each of 50 mu m having 28 and 32 vol% Ni.",Engineered anode structure for enhanced electrochemical performance of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.077
5,19131,Engineered TLA accounts for substantial reduction both in cell polarization (ohmic ASR: 78 m Omega cm(2) versus 2835 m Omega cm(2); cell impedance: 0.35 Omega cm(2) versus 0.9 Omega cm(2)) and degradation rate (76 mu V h(-1) versus 219 mu V h(-1)) compared to cells fabricated with conventional cermet.,Engineered anode structure for enhanced electrochemical performance of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.077
