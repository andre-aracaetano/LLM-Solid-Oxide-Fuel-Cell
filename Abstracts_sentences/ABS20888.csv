3,20888,"To elucidate the phenomenon of catalyst deactivation in the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon, dodecane (C12H26) and hexadecane (C16H34) were blended with an aromatic hydrocarbon such as 1-methylnaphthalene (C12H10) to obtain a diesel surrogate fuel.",Deactivation of Ni-Al-Based Catalysts for Autothermal Reforming of Diesel Surrogate Fuel in the Presence of an Aromatic Hydrocarbon,10.1166/jnn.2020.18848
4,20888,"The experiments were performed for autothermal reforming of the diesel surrogate fuel under conditions of S/C = 1.17, O-2/C = 0.24, 750 C and GHSV = 12,000 h(-1).",Deactivation of Ni-Al-Based Catalysts for Autothermal Reforming of Diesel Surrogate Fuel in the Presence of an Aromatic Hydrocarbon,10.1166/jnn.2020.18848

6,20888,"Whereas all of the Ni-Al-based catalysts were deactivated with increasing reaction time, the catalysts with greater Ni contents tended to maintain their catalytic performance for a longer time.",Deactivation of Ni-Al-Based Catalysts for Autothermal Reforming of Diesel Surrogate Fuel in the Presence of an Aromatic Hydrocarbon,10.1166/jnn.2020.18848
7,20888,"Correlation between the catalytic performances and Ni content were analyzed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope with energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).",Deactivation of Ni-Al-Based Catalysts for Autothermal Reforming of Diesel Surrogate Fuel in the Presence of an Aromatic Hydrocarbon,10.1166/jnn.2020.18848
8,20888,"Also, we concluded that ethylene (C2H4), which was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), was the fundamental cause of deactivation of the Ni-Al-based catalysts by accelerating the deposition of wire-type carbon on the catalytic surface.",Deactivation of Ni-Al-Based Catalysts for Autothermal Reforming of Diesel Surrogate Fuel in the Presence of an Aromatic Hydrocarbon,10.1166/jnn.2020.18848
