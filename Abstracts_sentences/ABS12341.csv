1,12341,A new process to fabricate a composite LSCF-Ag cathode material for SOFCs by electron beam (e-beam) irradiation process has been suggested for operation under intermediate temperature range of 600-700 degrees C. A composite LSCF-Ag cathode with uniformly coated Ag nanoparticles on the surface of the LSCF material was prepared by a facile e-beam irradiation method at room temperature.,Fabrication and Characterization of Composite LSCF-Ag Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells using Electron Beam Irradiation Process,10.5012/bkcs.2014.35.10.2969
