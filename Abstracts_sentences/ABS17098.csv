1,17098,La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSC) thin-film electrodes are prepared on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates by pulsed laser deposition at different deposition temperatures.,Optimized La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin-Film Electrodes with Extremely Fast Oxygen-Reduction Kinetics,10.1002/adfm.200900362
2,17098,"The decrease of the film crystallinity, occurring when the deposition temperature is lowered, is accompanied by a strong increase of the electrochemical oxygen exchange rate of LSC.",Optimized La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin-Film Electrodes with Extremely Fast Oxygen-Reduction Kinetics,10.1002/adfm.200900362
3,17098,For more or less X-ray diffraction (XRD)-amorphous electrodes deposited between ca. 340 and 510 degrees C polarization resistances as low as 0.1 Omega cm(2) can be obtained at 600 degrees C. Such films also exhibit the best stability of the polarization resistance while electrodes deposited at higher temperatures show a strong and fast degradation of the electrochemical kinetics (thermal deactivation).,Optimized La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin-Film Electrodes with Extremely Fast Oxygen-Reduction Kinetics,10.1002/adfm.200900362
4,17098,Possible reasons for this behavior and consequences with respect to the preparation of high-performance solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes are discussed.,Optimized La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin-Film Electrodes with Extremely Fast Oxygen-Reduction Kinetics,10.1002/adfm.200900362
