1,9037,The individual electrode processes from anode and cathode have been clearly identified from practical impedance spectra with high-frequency inductive impedances for the Mitsubishi segmented-in-series tubular solid oxide fuel cell by combining the distribution of relaxation time analysis and the complex nonlinear least square fitting.,Analysis of Impedance Spectra for Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3494214
2,9037,"Anodic gas diffusion process and charge transfer reaction near anodic triple phase boundary appear at similar to 0.3 and 1000 Hz, respectively.",Analysis of Impedance Spectra for Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3494214
3,9037,"Cathodic oxygen reduction processes appear at similar to 10 Hz at 700 degrees C, whereas the impedance arc over 10 000 Hz is dominated by the cathodic oxygen ion transfer through the (La,Sr)MnO(3) (LSM)/Y(2)O(3)-stabilized ZrO(2) (YSZ) interface and YSZ of the composite.",Analysis of Impedance Spectra for Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3494214
4,9037,The results also exhibit an excellent agreement with those from the analysis of difference in impedance spectra.,Analysis of Impedance Spectra for Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3494214
