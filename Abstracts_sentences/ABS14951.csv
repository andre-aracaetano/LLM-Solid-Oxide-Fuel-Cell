1,14951,Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is now a well established colloidal processing technique which uses electrophoresis mechanism for the movement of suspended charged particles in a suspension in the presence of an electric field.,Electrophoretic deposition studies of Ba(Zr-Ce-Y)O3 ceramic coating,10.1111/ijac.13152
2,14951,"In this work, electrophoretic deposition of BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY) in ethanol medium was performed under different conditions on both conducting and non-conducting (porous anode) substrate without using any external additives in a suspension bath.",Electrophoretic deposition studies of Ba(Zr-Ce-Y)O3 ceramic coating,10.1111/ijac.13152
3,14951,"Process parameters such as deposition time, voltage, and rate of deposition of suspended particles were studied under various conditions.",Electrophoretic deposition studies of Ba(Zr-Ce-Y)O3 ceramic coating,10.1111/ijac.13152
4,14951,"Green coating deposited under different potential (30, 50, and 70V) was uniform and crack free, even at extended time of deposition.",Electrophoretic deposition studies of Ba(Zr-Ce-Y)O3 ceramic coating,10.1111/ijac.13152
5,14951,Surface roughnesses have also been evaluated to correlate it with deposition conditions.,Electrophoretic deposition studies of Ba(Zr-Ce-Y)O3 ceramic coating,10.1111/ijac.13152
