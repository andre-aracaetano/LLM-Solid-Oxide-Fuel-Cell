1,8686,"We have fabricated thin film-solid oxide fuel cells (TF-SOFCs) with tri-layer electrolytes, which are composed of YSZ deposited by sputtering, YSZ deposited by plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), and GDC deposited by sputtering.",Effect of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited YSZ inter-layer on cathode interface of GDC electrolyte in thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.renene.2018.11.021
2,8686,"Then, we have investigated the effects of the PEALD YSZ on the GDC layer and the whole cell.",Effect of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited YSZ inter-layer on cathode interface of GDC electrolyte in thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.renene.2018.11.021
3,8686,Open circuit voltages (OCVs) and peak power densities of the cells kept being enhanced as the thickness of the PEALD YSZ layer increases.,Effect of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited YSZ inter-layer on cathode interface of GDC electrolyte in thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.renene.2018.11.021
4,8686,"The 1000 cycle of PEALD YSZ deposited TF-SOFC exhibited 214 mW/cm(2) of peak power density, while TF-SOFC without PEALD YSZ inter-layer showed 124 mW/cm(2), almost half of that of the 1000 cycle sample.",Effect of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited YSZ inter-layer on cathode interface of GDC electrolyte in thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.renene.2018.11.021
5,8686,FE-SEM images and AFM analysis of the top surface of GDC electrolytes sustain this phenomenon.,Effect of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited YSZ inter-layer on cathode interface of GDC electrolyte in thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.renene.2018.11.021
6,8686,"As the PEALD YSZ inter-layer thickness increases, the top surface of GDC electrolyte become rough, with pin-holes disappeared, and the grain size of GDC electrolyte grew smaller.",Effect of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited YSZ inter-layer on cathode interface of GDC electrolyte in thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.renene.2018.11.021
7,8686,"As a result, the improved quality of the electrolytes enhanced OCV and smaller grain size of the electrolytes caused better catalytic activity on the electrolyte-cathode interface, leading to lower faradaic impedances in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).",Effect of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposited YSZ inter-layer on cathode interface of GDC electrolyte in thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.renene.2018.11.021
