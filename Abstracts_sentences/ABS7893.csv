2,7893,Nickel film was prepared on the oxide substrates of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and gadolinia doped ceria (GDC).,Carbon deposition map for nickel particles onto oxide substrates analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy,10.2109/jcersj2.119.307
3,7893,Carbon deposition was induced by annealing in dry methane for 10 min at both 863 and 933K. Morphology of nickel film was changed into particles with the size of several ten-nanometer to several micrometer at the edge of the nickel film after annealing.,Carbon deposition map for nickel particles onto oxide substrates analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy,10.2109/jcersj2.119.307
