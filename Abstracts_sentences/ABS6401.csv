1,6401,This study discusses the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology paths in the United States and Japan under the national innovation system (NIS) framework using the available literature and a patent landscape.,Solid oxide fuel cell technology paths: National innovation system contributions from Japan and the United States,10.1016/j.rser.2020.109879
2,6401,"By examining technology trajectories, it is possible to identify and justify the patterns of key players and institutions from the NISs of the two countries that shaped the development of these technologies.",Solid oxide fuel cell technology paths: National innovation system contributions from Japan and the United States,10.1016/j.rser.2020.109879
3,6401,These patterns are especially relevant to the analysis of the role of institutional arrangements in policymaking.,Solid oxide fuel cell technology paths: National innovation system contributions from Japan and the United States,10.1016/j.rser.2020.109879
4,6401,This study presents the concept of a NIS and explores the main aspects of the Japanese and U.S. NISs regarding the SOFC technology path.,Solid oxide fuel cell technology paths: National innovation system contributions from Japan and the United States,10.1016/j.rser.2020.109879
5,6401,"This study analyzes historical patent evolution, patent applicants and their industrial sectors, international patent classifications (IPCs) and international patent activity.",Solid oxide fuel cell technology paths: National innovation system contributions from Japan and the United States,10.1016/j.rser.2020.109879
6,6401,"Moreover, this study highlights the correlations of the SOFC manufacturing and operation with patent data.",Solid oxide fuel cell technology paths: National innovation system contributions from Japan and the United States,10.1016/j.rser.2020.109879
7,6401,This study examines the role of NISs in SOFC technology shaping from two main aspects: through independent historical events that motivated the establishment of institutional arrangements from which SOFCs have benefited and through shaping policies and efforts that are intended to promote the development of SOFC and related technologies.,Solid oxide fuel cell technology paths: National innovation system contributions from Japan and the United States,10.1016/j.rser.2020.109879
8,6401,"The results of this study demonstrate differences in terms of the sectors that are involved in the SOFC patenting activity, the IPCs of the filed patents and the international patent activity, which support the role of NISs in technology shaping.",Solid oxide fuel cell technology paths: National innovation system contributions from Japan and the United States,10.1016/j.rser.2020.109879
