1,17422,The cathode-supported tubular solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) fabricated by dip-coating and co-sintering techniques have been studied for high temperature steam electrolysis application.,Fabrication of Cathode-supported Tubular Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell for High Temperature Steam Electrolysis,10.14447/jnmes.v14i3.107
2,17422,The microstructure and electrochemical performeances were investigated in both SOEC and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) modes.,Fabrication of Cathode-supported Tubular Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell for High Temperature Steam Electrolysis,10.14447/jnmes.v14i3.107
3,17422,"In SOFC model, the maximum power densitity reached 390.7, 311.0 and 248.3 mW cm(-2) at 850, 800, and 700 C, respectively, running with H(2) (105 mL min(-1)) and O(2) (70 mL min(-1)) as working gases.",Fabrication of Cathode-supported Tubular Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell for High Temperature Steam Electrolysis,10.14447/jnmes.v14i3.107
4,17422,"In SOEC mode, the results indicated that the steam ratio had a strong impact on the performance of the tubular SOEC, and it's better to operate the tubular SOEC in high steam ratio.",Fabrication of Cathode-supported Tubular Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell for High Temperature Steam Electrolysis,10.14447/jnmes.v14i3.107
5,17422,I-V curves and EIS results suggested that the microstructure of the tubular SOEC needs to be optimized for mass transportation.,Fabrication of Cathode-supported Tubular Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell for High Temperature Steam Electrolysis,10.14447/jnmes.v14i3.107
