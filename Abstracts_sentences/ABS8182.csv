1,8182,"In this paper, we study a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) controlled by a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) compensator, which uses the blower/fan power and cathode inlet temperature as actuators.",Enhanced Power Generation in SOFCs Using Artificial Limits on Actuator Control Signals,10.1115/1.4040057
2,8182,The usable power of the fuel cell (FC) is maximized by limiting the air flow rate deliberately when an increase in power is demanded.,Enhanced Power Generation in SOFCs Using Artificial Limits on Actuator Control Signals,10.1115/1.4040057
3,8182,Possible rate bounds on the cathode inlet temperature are also modeled.,Enhanced Power Generation in SOFCs Using Artificial Limits on Actuator Control Signals,10.1115/1.4040057
4,8182,These bounds could represent the physical limitations (due to slow dynamics of heat exchangers) and/or a control concept for accommodating the power saving objective.,Enhanced Power Generation in SOFCs Using Artificial Limits on Actuator Control Signals,10.1115/1.4040057
5,8182,"Applying proper limits to the amplitude and rate of the actuator signals, and incorporating antiwindup (AW) techniques, can raise the net power of the FC by 16% with negligible effects on the spatial temperature profile.",Enhanced Power Generation in SOFCs Using Artificial Limits on Actuator Control Signals,10.1115/1.4040057
