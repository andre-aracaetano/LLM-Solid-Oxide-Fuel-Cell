1,4548,BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY7) perovskite oxide was prepared by gel-casting and solid-state reaction techniques as proton-conducting electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).,BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ proton-conducting electrolyte prepared by gel-casting for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.06.106
2,4548,X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the phase formation temperature of BZCY7 powder synthesized by gel-casting was 100-150 degrees C lower than that by solid-state reaction method.,BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ proton-conducting electrolyte prepared by gel-casting for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.06.106
3,4548,The BZCY7 electrolytes prepared by gel-casting exhibited better sintering activity and higher electrical conductivity.,BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ proton-conducting electrolyte prepared by gel-casting for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.06.106
4,4548,"After sintering at 1550 degrees C for 5 h. the relative density and electrical conductivity of the gel-casting derived BZCY7 reached 95% and 5 x 10(-3) S/cm in H-2 (similar to 3% H2O) at 500 degrees C. However, for the solid-state reaction method, the sample had a relative density of 86% and electrical conductivity of 2 x 10(-3) S/CM under the same condition.",BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ proton-conducting electrolyte prepared by gel-casting for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.06.106
