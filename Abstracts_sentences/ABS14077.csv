6,14077,"The cell demonstrated good durability lasting for at least 100 h. While the bare cell without the protective layer showed poor durability with the cell voltage fast dropped from 0.75V to 0.4V within 30mM. Under wet coal bed methane (CBM) operation, obvious performance degradation within 35 h (1.7 mV h(-1)) was observed due to the influence of heavy carbon compounds in CBM.",Enhanced coking resistance of a Ni cermet anode by a chromates protective layer,10.1016/j.jechem.2018.12.007
