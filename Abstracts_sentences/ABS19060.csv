1,19060,This study focuses on the effects of acceptor dopants in proton-conductive Sr2TiO4-based layered perovskites.,"Crystal structures and proton transport properties of Sr2(Ti1-xMx)O4-δ (M = Fe, Al)",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2020.106407
2,19060,"We synthesized Sr2Ti0.9Fe0.1O4-delta (STF10) and Sr2Ti0.95Al0.05O4-delta (STA05) and evaluated the influence of ion substitution on their crystal structures, electrical conductivities, and proton transport properties.","Crystal structures and proton transport properties of Sr2(Ti1-xMx)O4-δ (M = Fe, Al)",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2020.106407
3,19060,"Our obtained results suggest that a redox reaction is the more favorable mechanism for the introduction of proton defects to Fe-doped samples compared with water vapor absorption, while the reverse is true for Al-doped samples.","Crystal structures and proton transport properties of Sr2(Ti1-xMx)O4-δ (M = Fe, Al)",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2020.106407
4,19060,STF10 was found to exhibit a larger electrical conductivity at low temperatures than STA05.,"Crystal structures and proton transport properties of Sr2(Ti1-xMx)O4-δ (M = Fe, Al)",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2020.106407
5,19060,"In addition, STF10 presented a proton transport number of 0.5 at 600 degrees C, while the corresponding value for STA05 was 0.5-0.6 at 450-600 degrees C.","Crystal structures and proton transport properties of Sr2(Ti1-xMx)O4-δ (M = Fe, Al)",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2020.106407
6,19060,The higher proton transport number of STA05 at 450-550 degrees C compared to that of STF10 indicates that the Al-dopant suppressed the electronic conductivity owing to its constant valency.,"Crystal structures and proton transport properties of Sr2(Ti1-xMx)O4-δ (M = Fe, Al)",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2020.106407
7,19060,We therefore considered that characterization of the changes in material properties related to ion substitution can serve as a guide for material selection when developing proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell technologies.,"Crystal structures and proton transport properties of Sr2(Ti1-xMx)O4-δ (M = Fe, Al)",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2020.106407
