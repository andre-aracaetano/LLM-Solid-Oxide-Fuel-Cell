2,13310,"La(4)Sr(8)Ti(11)Mn(1-x)Ga(x)O(38-delta) (0 <= x <= 1) oxides were synthesized by solid state reaction and the influences of the manganese and/or gallium content on the structure, morphology, thermal properties and electrical conductivity of these materials has been investigated.",Development of anode material based on La-substituted SrTiO3 perovskites doped with manganese and/or gallium for SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.132
3,13310,All compounds show cubic structure with a space group Pm-3m.,Development of anode material based on La-substituted SrTiO3 perovskites doped with manganese and/or gallium for SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.132
4,13310,"These compounds presented high electrical conductivity values under reducing atmosphere between 7.9 and 6.8 S cm(-1) at 900 C. For the composition x >= 0.5, the thermal expansion coefficient in both reducing and oxidizing atmosphere are close to that of SOFC electrolytes (8YSZ, CGD).",Development of anode material based on La-substituted SrTiO3 perovskites doped with manganese and/or gallium for SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.132
