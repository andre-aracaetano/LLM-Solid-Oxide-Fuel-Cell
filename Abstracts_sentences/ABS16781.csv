7,16781,It is shown that fuel starvation occurs when the J (load) is increased by approximately 100% and FU is above 0.85 at final value of J (when steady state is assumed).,"Modeling and analysis of short-period transient response of a single, planar, anode supported, solid oxide fuel cell during load variations",10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.133
8,16781,"Moreover, the time-dependent profile of FU give us guideline for setting appropriate inlet flow rate of fuel to prevent fuel starvation.","Modeling and analysis of short-period transient response of a single, planar, anode supported, solid oxide fuel cell during load variations",10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.133
9,16781,The results show that a SOFC with very thin (d(s) = 0.1 mm) porous anode support layer is prone to fuel starvation during large load variation.,"Modeling and analysis of short-period transient response of a single, planar, anode supported, solid oxide fuel cell during load variations",10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.133
10,16781,"Using a thicker porous anode support layer (d(s) = 0.5 mm) is proposed to avoid fuel starvation and, consequently, mitigate the degradation of a realistic SOFC.","Modeling and analysis of short-period transient response of a single, planar, anode supported, solid oxide fuel cell during load variations",10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.133
