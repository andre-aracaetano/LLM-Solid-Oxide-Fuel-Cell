3,20864,"The novelty of the study consists in the assessment of the phase transformation dynamics in lanthanum-strontium ferrite-based ceramics in relation to the annealing temperature, alongside the study of the effect of the phase composition of ceramics on the resistance to high-temperature aging, which is characteristic of the operating modes of these ceramics as materials for solid oxide fuel cells.","Synthesis, Structural Properties, and Resistance to High-Temperature Degradation of Perovskite Ceramics Based on Lanthanum-Strontium Ferrite",10.3390/inorganics11060234
4,20864,"To study the properties, the methods of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive analysis, and scanning electron microscopy were applied.","Synthesis, Structural Properties, and Resistance to High-Temperature Degradation of Perovskite Ceramics Based on Lanthanum-Strontium Ferrite",10.3390/inorganics11060234
5,20864,"Pursuant to the outcome of elemental analysis, it was established that no impurity inclusions appear in the ceramic structure during the synthesis, and a growth in the annealing temperature results into a decline in the grain size and a growth in their density.","Synthesis, Structural Properties, and Resistance to High-Temperature Degradation of Perovskite Ceramics Based on Lanthanum-Strontium Ferrite",10.3390/inorganics11060234
6,20864,"During the analysis of the acquired X-ray diffraction patterns, it was found that a growth in the annealing temperature above 500 & DEG;C results in phase transformations of the LaFeO3/SrFe2O4 & RARR; La0.3Sr0.7FeO3/LaSr2FeO8/La3FeO6 type, followed by structural ordering and a decline in deformation distortions with a growth in the annealing temperature.","Synthesis, Structural Properties, and Resistance to High-Temperature Degradation of Perovskite Ceramics Based on Lanthanum-Strontium Ferrite",10.3390/inorganics11060234
7,20864,An analysis of the conductive properties of ceramics has established that the dominance of the La0.3Sr0.7FeO3 phase in the structure results in a growth in conductivity and a decline in resistance.,"Synthesis, Structural Properties, and Resistance to High-Temperature Degradation of Perovskite Ceramics Based on Lanthanum-Strontium Ferrite",10.3390/inorganics11060234
8,20864,"Life tests for degradation resistance have shown that for three-phase ceramics, the rate of degradation and amorphization is significantly lower than for two-phase ceramics.","Synthesis, Structural Properties, and Resistance to High-Temperature Degradation of Perovskite Ceramics Based on Lanthanum-Strontium Ferrite",10.3390/inorganics11060234
