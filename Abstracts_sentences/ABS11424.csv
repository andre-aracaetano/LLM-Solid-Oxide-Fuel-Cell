4,11424,"The effects of water and iodine content, of the applied voltage, and of powder loading on the EPD rate were systematically studied using metallic substrates (Pt and stainless steel).",Electrophoretic Deposition of Dense Sr- and Mg-Doped LaGaO3 Electrolyte Films on Porous La-Doped Ceria for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800022
5,11424,"This allowed to identify the suitable set of EPD process parameters that were used to deposit LSGM films on tape-cast composite electrodes, composed of lanthanum-doped ceria (La0.4Ce0.6O2, LDC), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and carbon powders.",Electrophoretic Deposition of Dense Sr- and Mg-Doped LaGaO3 Electrolyte Films on Porous La-Doped Ceria for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800022
6,11424,"After EPD, dense and crack-free 15 mu m thick LSGM films were obtained on porous LDC by co-firing in air at 1,490 degrees C. Line profile analyses performed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) did not reveal any interdiffusion of ions across the LSGM/LDC interface.",Electrophoretic Deposition of Dense Sr- and Mg-Doped LaGaO3 Electrolyte Films on Porous La-Doped Ceria for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800022
7,11424,"The chemical and structural compatibility of LSGM with LDC was also checked by heat treating a mixture of the two powders (1:1 weight ratio) using the same thermal cycle as that of the LDC/LSGM bi-layer co-firing at 1,490 degrees C. EPD has thus proven to be a viable way for manufacturing anode-supported LSGM electrolyte films.",Electrophoretic Deposition of Dense Sr- and Mg-Doped LaGaO3 Electrolyte Films on Porous La-Doped Ceria for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800022
