1,14181,"Mixed oxides in the binary Y2O3-CeO2 (YC) and ternary Y2O3-CeO2-TiO2 (YCT) systems as well as the corresponding Ni cermets were evaluated in terms of application as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) between 650 and 900 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the YCT powders calcined up to 1,400 degrees C showed the cubic fluorite structure of YC and also the formation of an additional phase with pyrochlore structure.",Physical characterization of Y2O3-CeO2-TiO2 (YCT) mixed oxides and Ni/YCT cermets as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10853-008-3063-6
2,14181,The thermal expansion of the ceramics measured in air and Ar/4% H-2 showed no significant differences in the temperature range of 25-800 degrees C.,Physical characterization of Y2O3-CeO2-TiO2 (YCT) mixed oxides and Ni/YCT cermets as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10853-008-3063-6
3,14181,The absolute values of the total electrical conductivity of the ceramics measured between 450 and 900 degrees C in Ar/4% H-2 increased by about 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to those measured in air.,Physical characterization of Y2O3-CeO2-TiO2 (YCT) mixed oxides and Ni/YCT cermets as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10853-008-3063-6
