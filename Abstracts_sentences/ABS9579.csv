1,9579,Development of high performance anode materials with resisting coking and sulfur poisoning is significant for the practical application of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Resisting coking and sulfur poisoning of double perovskite Sr2TiFe0.5Mo0.5O6-δ anode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.134
2,9579,"Here we report a nickel-free double perovskite anode material Sr2TiFe0.5Mo0.5O6-delta (STFM05), which exhibits excellent electrochemical performance using H-2 as fuel and acceptable electrochemical stability in syngas fuel containing H2S. At 800 degrees C, the STFM05 anode shows the electrical conductivity value of 22.3 S cm(-1) in H-2 and the maximum power densities of 547 and 215 mWcm(-2) with electrolyte-supported cell using H-2 and syngas as fuels, respectively.",Resisting coking and sulfur poisoning of double perovskite Sr2TiFe0.5Mo0.5O6-δ anode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.134
3,9579,"The single cell with STFM05 anode shows a relatively stable electrochemical performance in syngas at 750 degrees C, and no carbon deposition is detected by Raman spectroscopy.",Resisting coking and sulfur poisoning of double perovskite Sr2TiFe0.5Mo0.5O6-δ anode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.134
