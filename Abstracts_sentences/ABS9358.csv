1,9358,A flat tubular segmented-in-series (SIS) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was fabricated using decalcomania paper.,Fabrication of a Flat Tubular Segmented-in-series Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Decalcomania Paper,10.1002/fuce.201300188
2,9358,The performance of a two-cell stack with 4.5-mm-wide electrodes was investigated in a temperature range of 650-800 degrees C. The decalcomania paper allowed fabrication of the SIS-SOFC on all sides of the flat tubular support and achieve an effective electrode area larger than that obtained using typical SOFC fabrication techniques such as screen printing or slurry coating.,Fabrication of a Flat Tubular Segmented-in-series Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Decalcomania Paper,10.1002/fuce.201300188
3,9358,"SEM observations revealed that each component layer was flat, uniformly thick, and well adherent to adjacent layers.",Fabrication of a Flat Tubular Segmented-in-series Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Decalcomania Paper,10.1002/fuce.201300188
4,9358,Measured values of open circuit voltages were very close to the theoretical values; confirming that the processing technique utilizing decalcomania paper is suitable for SIS-SOFC fabrication.,Fabrication of a Flat Tubular Segmented-in-series Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Decalcomania Paper,10.1002/fuce.201300188
5,9358,"The power densities of the two-cell-stack were 437.4, 375.6, 324.6, and 257.1 mWcm(-2) at 800, 750, 700 and 650 degrees C, respectively.",Fabrication of a Flat Tubular Segmented-in-series Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Using Decalcomania Paper,10.1002/fuce.201300188
