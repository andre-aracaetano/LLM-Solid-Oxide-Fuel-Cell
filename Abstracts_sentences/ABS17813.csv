1,17813,"In this study, high-resolution focused ion beam sectioning assisted with SEM imaging was used to study the indentation microstructures of porous bulks and films of a solid oxide fuel cell cathode material (La0.6Sr0.4C0.2Fe0.8O3-delta) sintered at different temperatures.",Characterisation of indentation microstructures for porous SOFC cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.035
2,17813,The crack morphologies and pore-filling densification caused by crushing of particle networks were studied in details.,Characterisation of indentation microstructures for porous SOFC cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.035
3,17813,Analysis showed distinct permanent deformation mechanisms of the indentation microstructures between porous bulks and films.,Characterisation of indentation microstructures for porous SOFC cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.035
4,17813,"Whilst remarkable porosity gradient was found for the porous films under both Berkovich and spherical indenters, the porous bulks were found to behave more like dense materials.",Characterisation of indentation microstructures for porous SOFC cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.035
5,17813,Results also showed that radial cracks induced by Berkovich indentation on the bulks could not generate observable pop-in/pop-out events in the loading-unloading curves.,Characterisation of indentation microstructures for porous SOFC cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.035
6,17813,"However, when indenting with the spherical indenter on a thick film, the shear sliding of the particle networks immediately under the indenter could cause phenomenal disruption in the loading unloading curves shown.",Characterisation of indentation microstructures for porous SOFC cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.035
