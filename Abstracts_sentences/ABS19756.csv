2,19756,"Regarding single cell tests with ideal contacting (gold, platinum, nickel meshes) and inert flow fields (Al2O3), performance is limited by intrinsic losses in the cell.","Impact of CeCo-Coated Metallic Interconnectors on SOCs Towards Performance, Cr-Oxide-Scale, and Cr-Evaporation",10.1149/1945-7111/ad44da
3,19756,Contact losses and poisoning effects are minimized.,"Impact of CeCo-Coated Metallic Interconnectors on SOCs Towards Performance, Cr-Oxide-Scale, and Cr-Evaporation",10.1149/1945-7111/ad44da
4,19756,"In a SOC-stack with metallic interconnectors, performance is affected by contact resistances, chromium (Cr) evaporation, and limitations in gas supply.","Impact of CeCo-Coated Metallic Interconnectors on SOCs Towards Performance, Cr-Oxide-Scale, and Cr-Evaporation",10.1149/1945-7111/ad44da
5,19756,"Here, 1 cm2 single cells were tested with a stack-like contact applying metallic flow fields made from three different steel grades (Crofer 22 APU, AISI 441, UNS S44330) with and without a cerium-cobalt PVD-coating.","Impact of CeCo-Coated Metallic Interconnectors on SOCs Towards Performance, Cr-Oxide-Scale, and Cr-Evaporation",10.1149/1945-7111/ad44da
6,19756,"Cell performance and losses were analyzed by IV-characteristics, impedance spectroscopy, and DRT analysis.","Impact of CeCo-Coated Metallic Interconnectors on SOCs Towards Performance, Cr-Oxide-Scale, and Cr-Evaporation",10.1149/1945-7111/ad44da
7,19756,"For all uncoated interconnectors, significant performance losses due to increased contact losses and air electrode polarization were observed, which is attributed to Cr-oxide scale formation on the metallic interconnectors and Cr-poisoning of the air electrode as revealed by scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.","Impact of CeCo-Coated Metallic Interconnectors on SOCs Towards Performance, Cr-Oxide-Scale, and Cr-Evaporation",10.1149/1945-7111/ad44da
8,19756,A CeCo-coating leads to similar oxide scales irrespective of the substrate material.,"Impact of CeCo-Coated Metallic Interconnectors on SOCs Towards Performance, Cr-Oxide-Scale, and Cr-Evaporation",10.1149/1945-7111/ad44da
9,19756,"Moreover, with the coating the electrochemical performance drastically improved due to decreased contact losses and an effective blocking of Cr-evaporation leading to a cell performance close to the ideal case for all three steel grades.","Impact of CeCo-Coated Metallic Interconnectors on SOCs Towards Performance, Cr-Oxide-Scale, and Cr-Evaporation",10.1149/1945-7111/ad44da
