1,16909,"Oxidation-resistant alloys find use as interconnect materials, heat exchangers, and gas supply tubing in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems, especially when operated at temperatures below similar to 800 degrees C. If fueled with synthesis gas derived from coal or biomass, such metallic components could be exposed to impurities contained in those fuel sources.",Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide fuel cell metallic components,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.081
2,16909,"In this study, coupons of ferritic stainless steels Crofer 22 APU and SS 441, austenitic nickel-chromium superalloy Inconel 600, and an alumina-forming high nickel alloy alumel were exposed to synthesis gas containing <= 2 ppm phosphorus, arsenic and antimony, and reaction products were tested.",Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide fuel cell metallic components,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.081
3,16909,"Crofer 22 APU coupons coated with a (Mn,Co)(3)O(4) protective layer were also evaluated.",Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide fuel cell metallic components,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.081
4,16909,Phosphorus was found to be the most reactive.,Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide fuel cell metallic components,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.081
5,16909,"On Crofer 22 APU, the (Mn,Cr)(3)O(4) passivation layer reacted to form an Mn-P-O product, predicted to be manganese phosphate from thermochemical calculations, and Cr(2)O(3).",Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide fuel cell metallic components,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.081
6,16909,"On SS 441, reaction of phosphorus with (Mn,Cr)(3)O(4) led to the formation of manganese phosphate as well as an Fe-P product, predicted from thermochemical calculations to be Fe(3)P. Minimal interactions with antimony or arsenic in synthesis gas were limited to Fe-Sb and Fe-As solid solution formation.",Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide fuel cell metallic components,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.081
7,16909,"Though not intended for use on the anode side, a (Mn,Co)(3)O(4) spinel coating on Crofer 22 APU reacted with phosphorus in synthesis gas to produce products consistent with Mn(3)(PO(4))(2) and Co(2)P. A thin Cr(2)O(3) passivation layer on Inconel 600 did not prevent the formation of nickel phosphides and arsenides and of iron phosphides and arsenides, though no reaction with Cr(2)O(3) was apparent.",Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide fuel cell metallic components,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.081
8,16909,"On alumel, an Al(2)O(3) passivation layer rich in Ni did not prevent the formation of nickel phosphides, arsenides, and antimonides, though no reaction with Al(2)O(3) occurred.",Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide fuel cell metallic components,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.081
9,16909,"This work shows that unprotected metallic components of an SOFC stack and system can provide a sink for P. As and Sb impurities that may be present in fuel gases, and thus complicate experimental studies of impurity interactions with the anode.",Interaction of coal-derived synthesis gas impurities with solid oxide fuel cell metallic components,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.081
