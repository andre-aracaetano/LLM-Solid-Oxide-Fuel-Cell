1,19462,delta-Bi2O3 has long been touted as a potential material for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) due to its intrinsically high ionic conductivity.,High ionic conductivity in fluorite δ-bismuth oxide-based vertically aligned nanocomposite thin films,10.1039/d1ta07308g
2,19462,"However, its limited operational temperature has led to stabilising the phase from >725 degrees C to room temperature either by doping, albeit with a compromise in conductivity, or by growing the phase confined within superlattice thin films.",High ionic conductivity in fluorite δ-bismuth oxide-based vertically aligned nanocomposite thin films,10.1039/d1ta07308g
3,19462,Superlattice architectures are challenging to implement in functional mu SOFC devices owing to their ionic conducting channels being in the plane of the film.,High ionic conductivity in fluorite δ-bismuth oxide-based vertically aligned nanocomposite thin films,10.1039/d1ta07308g
4,19462,"Vertically aligned nanocomposites (VANs) have the potential to overcome these limitations, as their nanocolumnar structures are perpendicular to the plane of the film, hence connecting the electrodes at top and bottom.",High ionic conductivity in fluorite δ-bismuth oxide-based vertically aligned nanocomposite thin films,10.1039/d1ta07308g
5,19462,"Here, we demonstrate for the first time the growth of epitaxially stabilised delta-Bi2O3 in VAN films, stabilised independently of substrate strain.",High ionic conductivity in fluorite δ-bismuth oxide-based vertically aligned nanocomposite thin films,10.1039/d1ta07308g
6,19462,The phase is doped with Dy and is formed in a VAN film which incorporates DyMnO3 as a vertically epitaxially stabilising matrix phase.,High ionic conductivity in fluorite δ-bismuth oxide-based vertically aligned nanocomposite thin films,10.1039/d1ta07308g
7,19462,"Our VAN films exhibit very high ionic conductivity, reaching 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C.",High ionic conductivity in fluorite δ-bismuth oxide-based vertically aligned nanocomposite thin films,10.1039/d1ta07308g
8,19462,"This work opens up the possibility to incorporate thin film delta-Bi2O3 based VANs into functional mu SOFC devices, either as cathodes (by pairing delta-Bi2O3 with a catalytically active electronic conductor) and/or electrolytes (by incorporating delta-Bi2O3 with an insulator).",High ionic conductivity in fluorite δ-bismuth oxide-based vertically aligned nanocomposite thin films,10.1039/d1ta07308g
