1,10199,"Nanocrystalline and homogeneous powder mixtures of (Ni1-xCoxOy)+YSZ were obtained by combustion synthesis, and reduced in H-2 at 800 degreesC to obtain Ni1-xCox/YSZ cermets, and three layer symmetrical cells cermet/YSZ/cermet.",Ni1-xCox/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00689-8
2,10199,"These three layer cells were co-firing at 1450 degreesC, and then reduced to obtain porous Ni1-xCox/YSZ cermet layers with good adhesion to the electrolyte.",Ni1-xCox/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00689-8
3,10199,"Results obtained under OCV show that partial substitution of Ni with Co lowers the polarisation resistance, especially the main contribution which is usually most dependent on the cermets microstructure.",Ni1-xCox/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00689-8
4,10199,"This trend is reverted for high fractions of Co, and the polarisation resistance obtained for Co/YSZ cermets is much higher than for Ni/YSZ.",Ni1-xCox/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00689-8
5,10199,"The low frequency contribution of the polarisation resistance was mainly dependent on the partial pressures of H-2 and H2O, and is less dependent on the substitution of Ni with Co. (C) 2002",Ni1-xCox/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00689-8
