3,12202,The Ag paste is applied as a current-collecting layer on the cathode side at the corresponding position in contact with the punctuate structure of the interconnect.,Mechanism of the cathode current collector on cell performance in a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.105
4,12202,The difference in power densities between the two single cells is due to the in-plane electron transfer on the cathode surface.,Mechanism of the cathode current collector on cell performance in a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.105
5,12202,"When the structure of the interconnect is changed from a convex punctuate structure to liner strips, the cell performance is governed by both gas flow rate and in-plane electron transfer; however, the latter plays a more important role than the gas flow rate.",Mechanism of the cathode current collector on cell performance in a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.105
6,12202,An appropriate arrangement of current collection at the cathode side is necessary to improve current collection and thus the cell performance inside the SOFC stack.,Mechanism of the cathode current collector on cell performance in a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.105
