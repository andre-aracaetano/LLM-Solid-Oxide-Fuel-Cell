1,340,This work presents a microporous silver cathode membrane reinforced with infiltration of samarium-doped ceria (SDC).,SDC-Infiltrated Microporous Silver Membrane with Superior Resistance to Thermal Agglomeration for Cathode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en11092181
2,340,The ion-conducting SDC effectively confines the surface of a porous silver membrane to maintain microporous structure and prevents the electrode agglomeration.,SDC-Infiltrated Microporous Silver Membrane with Superior Resistance to Thermal Agglomeration for Cathode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en11092181
3,340,SDC precursor solution is fired together with silver membrane at 700 degrees C for 2 h and formed as a nanocrystalline SDC on the silver pore surface.,SDC-Infiltrated Microporous Silver Membrane with Superior Resistance to Thermal Agglomeration for Cathode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en11092181
4,340,"The SDC-infiltrated microporous silver membrane shows superior resistance to agglomeration without noticeable change in microstructures even at 900 degrees C for 12 h, which makes it promising for the application of solid oxide fuel cells as a cathode support.",SDC-Infiltrated Microporous Silver Membrane with Superior Resistance to Thermal Agglomeration for Cathode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en11092181
