2,8082,"In this study, we explored the oxidation behaviors of the SUS430 alloy interconnect in methanol-water anode atmosphere and investigated the possibility of using Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (SFM) perovskite materials as an oxidation-resistant coating on the anode side of the SUS430 alloy interconnect.",Oxidation behaviors of the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ-coated SUS430 metal interconnect in anode atmosphere for direct methanol solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.105
3,8082,"The bare SUS430 alloy and the SUS430 alloy with SFM coating (thickness: approximate to 40 mu m) were exposed in methanol/H2O anode atmosphere at 750 degrees C for 1000 h. After oxidation, a dense oxide scale with a thickness of 3.50 mu m was formed on the surface of the bare SUS430 alloy; the area-specific resistance (ASR) of the alloy increased from 1.70 m omega cm2 to 279.00 m omega cm2.",Oxidation behaviors of the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ-coated SUS430 metal interconnect in anode atmosphere for direct methanol solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.105
4,8082,"By contrast, the thickness of the oxide scale on the surface of SUS430 alloy with protective SFM coating under the same working condition was 0.70 mu m; the ASR grows from 12.47 m omega cm2 to 14.51 m omega cm2.",Oxidation behaviors of the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ-coated SUS430 metal interconnect in anode atmosphere for direct methanol solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.105
5,8082,These results suggest that SFM forms an effective anode-side protective coating on the interconnects of SOFC stacks.,Oxidation behaviors of the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ-coated SUS430 metal interconnect in anode atmosphere for direct methanol solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.105
