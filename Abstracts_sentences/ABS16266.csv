5,16266,"Using the overpotentials, which characterize the cell's inefficiencies, we compare without ambiguity the electro-catalytic efficiencies of Ni and Pt, finding that on Ni H(2)O splitting proceeds more rapidly than H(2) oxidation, while on Pt, H(2) oxidation proceeds more rapidly than H(2)O splitting.",Measuring individual overpotentials in an operating solid-oxide electrochemical cell,10.1039/c003581e
