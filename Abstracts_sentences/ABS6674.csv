6,6674,"For the stability testing in wet methane (similar to 3 mol% H-2O in methane) at 650 degrees C and 0.2 A cm(-2), the voltage of the conventional Ni-SDC anode decreases by 43.1% in approximately 26 h, whereas the CNO internal reforming layer operates stably for 40 h. In wet methane at 650 degrees C, with the addition of the CNO internal reforming layer, the polarization resistance of the Ni-SDC anode reduces by 22.3% from 0.0917 to 0.0712 U cm(2), and the maximum current density of it increases from 614 to 664mWcm(-2).",Coking-resistant Ce0.8Ni0.2O2-δ internal reforming layer for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.06.088
