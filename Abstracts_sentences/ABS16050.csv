1,16050,Si-diffusion from Si-based substrates into yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) thin films and its impact on their microstructure and chemistry is investigated.,Impact of substrate material and annealing conditions on the microstructure and chemistry of yttria-stabilized-zirconia thin films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.077
2,16050,"YSZ thin films used in electrochemical applications based on micro-electrochemical systems (MEMS) are deposited via spray pyrolysis onto silicon-based and silicon-free substrates, i.e. Si(x)N(y)-coated Si wafer, SiO(2) single crystals and Al(2)O(3), sapphire.",Impact of substrate material and annealing conditions on the microstructure and chemistry of yttria-stabilized-zirconia thin films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.077
3,16050,The samples are annealed at 600 degrees C and 1000 degrees C for 20 h in air.,Impact of substrate material and annealing conditions on the microstructure and chemistry of yttria-stabilized-zirconia thin films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.077
4,16050,"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the Si(x)N(y)-coated Si wafer is oxidized to SiO(z) at the interface to the YSZ thin film at temperatures as low as 600 degrees C. On all YSZ thin films, silica is detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).",Impact of substrate material and annealing conditions on the microstructure and chemistry of yttria-stabilized-zirconia thin films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.077
5,16050,A particular large Si concentration of up to 11 at% is detected at the surface of the YSZ thin films when deposited on silicon-based substrates after annealing at 1000 degrees C. Their grain boundary mobility is reduced 2.5 times due to the incorporation of SiO(2).,Impact of substrate material and annealing conditions on the microstructure and chemistry of yttria-stabilized-zirconia thin films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.077
