1,19536,Symmetrical cells consisting of La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) oxygen electrodes screen printed on both sides of a Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CGO) electrolyte were tested at 800 degrees C while being held close to a piece of Crofer 22 APU alloy.,Correlating Oxygen Electrode Degradation to Cr Vaporization from Metallic Interconnects in Solid Oxide Cell Stacks,10.1149/1945-7111/ad1168
2,19536,The alloy was either just pre-oxidized or coated with MnCo2O4 and heat treated prior to the exposure test to elucidate the effects of different Cr vaporization rates.,Correlating Oxygen Electrode Degradation to Cr Vaporization from Metallic Interconnects in Solid Oxide Cell Stacks,10.1149/1945-7111/ad1168
3,19536,"Degradation of the symmetrical cells was monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and TOF-SIMS, SEM and EDX analysis were used to examine Cr deposition on the electrodes after the exposure.",Correlating Oxygen Electrode Degradation to Cr Vaporization from Metallic Interconnects in Solid Oxide Cell Stacks,10.1149/1945-7111/ad1168
4,19536,"The results show that the degradation rate of the symmetrical cell is directly proportional to the concentration of gaseous Cr(VI)-species, which had been assessed in a previous experiment.",Correlating Oxygen Electrode Degradation to Cr Vaporization from Metallic Interconnects in Solid Oxide Cell Stacks,10.1149/1945-7111/ad1168
5,19536,The Cr vaporization rate from Crofer 22 APU with a dense MnCo2O4 coating was measured in moisturized air up with up to 40% H2O and found to be invariant with respect to the steam activity.,Correlating Oxygen Electrode Degradation to Cr Vaporization from Metallic Interconnects in Solid Oxide Cell Stacks,10.1149/1945-7111/ad1168
6,19536,"The degradation rate of symmetrical cells was accelerated by humidity in the air, but, noteworthy, this was found also in the absence of a Cr source.",Correlating Oxygen Electrode Degradation to Cr Vaporization from Metallic Interconnects in Solid Oxide Cell Stacks,10.1149/1945-7111/ad1168
