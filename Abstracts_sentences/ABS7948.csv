1,7948,Nanostructured and palladium-promoted Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM)-based cathodes are developed via solution impregnation for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,"Development of Nanostructured and Palladium Promoted (La,Sr)MnO3-Based Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature SOFCs",10.1149/1.2987693
2,7948,"Both the nanostructured and Pd-promoted LSM-based cathodes show significantly improved electrochemical performance compared to the conventional LSM/Y2O3-doped ZrO2 YSZ composite cathode, with electrode polarization resistances of 1.5 and 0.9 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, respectively, in contrast to 70 Omega cm(2) obtained from the conventional LSM/YSZ cathode.","Development of Nanostructured and Palladium Promoted (La,Sr)MnO3-Based Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature SOFCs",10.1149/1.2987693
3,7948,"Low activation energies are also obtained with the developed cathodes, indicating a promising applicability of such nanostructured and Pd-promoted electrodes as cathodes for the intermediate-temperature SOFCs.","Development of Nanostructured and Palladium Promoted (La,Sr)MnO3-Based Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature SOFCs",10.1149/1.2987693
