1,10992,Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with varying Ni content in the anode function layer (AFL) were fabricated and investigated.,Effect of Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Anode Functional Layer Composition on Performance of Lower Temperature SOFCs,10.1149/2.009207jes
2,10992,The observed open circuit potential (OCP) was higher with lower Ni content.,Effect of Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Anode Functional Layer Composition on Performance of Lower Temperature SOFCs,10.1149/2.009207jes
3,10992,"However, the highest maximum power densities (MPDs) in the low temperature range, from 450 to 650 degrees C, were achieved at 60 wt% NiO in the AFL, which is a 1: 1 volume ratio of Ni (49 vol%) to Gd-doped ceria (GDC) (51 vol%) phase after reduction.",Effect of Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Anode Functional Layer Composition on Performance of Lower Temperature SOFCs,10.1149/2.009207jes
4,10992,The long term stability of the SOFC of this composition was demonstrated with a power density of similar to 1.1 W/cm(2) at 650 degrees C for 200 hours.,Effect of Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Anode Functional Layer Composition on Performance of Lower Temperature SOFCs,10.1149/2.009207jes
5,10992,"Electrochemical impedance was consistent with these results showing the lowest electrode area specific resistance (ASR) at 49 vol% Ni, which has a linear relationship with MPD.",Effect of Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Anode Functional Layer Composition on Performance of Lower Temperature SOFCs,10.1149/2.009207jes
