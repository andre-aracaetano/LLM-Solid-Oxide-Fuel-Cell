2,8580,"Results indicate that the sulfide and lithiated sulfide derived from Yi(0.9)Ca(0.1)FeO(3) exhibit not only high stability but also high electrical conductivity, implying that they are viable candidate electrode materials for H2S polishing and for solid oxide fuel cells using H2S-containing fuels.",Stabilities and electrical conductivities of electrode materials for use in H2S-containing gases,10.1007/s100080000142
3,8580,"In contrast, the lithiated sulfides derived from La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Cr0.2O3 and LaCr0.9 Ti0.1O3 exhibit relatively low electrical conductivity, although their chemical and thermal stability appeal.",Stabilities and electrical conductivities of electrode materials for use in H2S-containing gases,10.1007/s100080000142
