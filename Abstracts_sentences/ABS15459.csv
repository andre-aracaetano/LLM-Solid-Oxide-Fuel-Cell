1,15459,"The present paper describes the electrochemical results and the post exposure microstructural characterization by means of SEM/EDS of a four layer SOFC stack after 34,000 h operation under load at 700 degrees C, showing low voltage degradation rate less than 0.3% per 1,000 h. Emphasis was put on the behavior of the ferritic interconnect steel and its interaction with glass sealants as well as contacting and coating materials.","Post-test Characterization of Metallic Materials and Adjacent Components in an SOFC Stack After 34,000 h Operation at 700 °C",10.1002/fuce.201800050
