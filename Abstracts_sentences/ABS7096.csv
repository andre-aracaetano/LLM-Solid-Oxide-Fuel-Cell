1,7096,Cathode properties of La0.8Sr0.2Co1-xMnxO3 (LSCM) perovskite oxides were investigated for their application to metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,La0.8Sr0.2Co1-xMnxO3 Cathode and Its Application to Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182738
2,7096,"La0.8Sr0.2Co0.4Mn0.6O3 (LSCM-8246) had the lowest impedance on Zr0.85Y0.15O2 (YSZ) electrolyte among various compositions because the properties of the cathodic reaction kinetics, thermal expansion compatibility, and chemical reactivity were optimized.",La0.8Sr0.2Co1-xMnxO3 Cathode and Its Application to Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182738
3,7096,A Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 (CGO) interlayer was introduced between LSCM and YSZ to inhibit the formation of resistive phases at the interface.,La0.8Sr0.2Co1-xMnxO3 Cathode and Its Application to Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182738
4,7096,The cathode impedance was decreased to about 1/3 of the noninterlayer samples.,La0.8Sr0.2Co1-xMnxO3 Cathode and Its Application to Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182738
5,7096,The study of the partial oxygen pressure dependence and activation energy of LSCM-8246 on CGO-layered YSZ showed that the ionization of the adsorbed oxygen is the rate-determining step of the cathode reaction at the general operation condition of SOFCs.,La0.8Sr0.2Co1-xMnxO3 Cathode and Its Application to Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182738
6,7096,Metal-supported single cell SOFCs with LSCM-8246 cathode were fabricated and characterized.,La0.8Sr0.2Co1-xMnxO3 Cathode and Its Application to Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182738
7,7096,The single cell impedance was much greater than values expected from the half cell test because the cathode in the single cell was sintered in situ during the measurement.,La0.8Sr0.2Co1-xMnxO3 Cathode and Its Application to Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182738
8,7096,The effect of cathode sintering was observed by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) curves and impedance spectra with time.,La0.8Sr0.2Co1-xMnxO3 Cathode and Its Application to Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182738
