1,14419,"Three cathode compositions (La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta,La0.7Sr0.3 Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-delta, and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-delta) have been tested as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes at operating temperatures from 650 to 750degrees C. Sintering temperatures were established for each cathode composition to provide optimized cell performance.",Optimized lanthanum ferrite-based cathodes for anode-supported SOFCs,10.1149/1.1483156
2,14419,"La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta exhibited the highest power density (>900 mW/cm(2) at 750degrees C and 0.7 V), and indicated excellent performance stability over a 300 h period.",Optimized lanthanum ferrite-based cathodes for anode-supported SOFCs,10.1149/1.1483156
