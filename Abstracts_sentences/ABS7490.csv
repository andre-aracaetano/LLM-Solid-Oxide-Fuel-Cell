1,7490,The interconnects used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are usually shaped into a corrugated form that creates gas channels.,Self-healing properties of Ce/Co-coated stainless steel under simulated intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.127894
2,7490,Coatings are applied onto an interconnect to increase its longevity by reducing Cr(VI) evaporation and oxide scale growth.,Self-healing properties of Ce/Co-coated stainless steel under simulated intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.127894
3,7490,To date many manufacturers first deform the interconnect and then apply the coating.,Self-healing properties of Ce/Co-coated stainless steel under simulated intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.127894
4,7490,"However, the reverse (hereinafter termed pre-coating) would be more cost-effective, because large-scale roll-toroll coating processes could then be used instead of batch coating processes.",Self-healing properties of Ce/Co-coated stainless steel under simulated intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.127894
5,7490,The drawback of this method is that cracks are introduced into the coating during deformation.,Self-healing properties of Ce/Co-coated stainless steel under simulated intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.127894
6,7490,The present work shows that the cracks heal after relatively short exposure times for the often-used Ce/Co coating (10 nm Ce and 640 nm Co) even at low operating temperatures (650 degrees C and 750 degrees C).,Self-healing properties of Ce/Co-coated stainless steel under simulated intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.127894
7,7490,"The Cr evaporation rate of pre-coated deformed Ce/Co-coated AISI 441, even though slightly elevated in the beginning of the exposure, decreases and stabilizes to rates that are comparable to that of undeformed Ce/Co-coated AISI 441.",Self-healing properties of Ce/Co-coated stainless steel under simulated intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.127894
8,7490,SEM micrographs show that the cracks introduced during the shaping of the interconnect heal after roughly 70 h of exposure at 750 degrees C and 360 h of exposure at 650 degrees C.,Self-healing properties of Ce/Co-coated stainless steel under simulated intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2021.127894
