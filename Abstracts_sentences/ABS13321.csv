1,13321,A novel multistep dip-coating method was developed and successfully applied to the fabrication of anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using carbon rods as combustible cores.,A novel multistep dip-coating method for the fabrication of anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-014-2429-8
2,13321,"The fabricated microtubular SOFCs consisted of Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), YSZ, strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM)-YSZ, and LSM as the anode, electrolyte, cathode, and cathode current collector materials, respectively.",A novel multistep dip-coating method for the fabrication of anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-014-2429-8
3,13321,"To investigate the role of anode porosity on cell performance, two types of anode supports were prepared: one without a pore former and the other with a 10 wt.% graphite pore former.",A novel multistep dip-coating method for the fabrication of anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-014-2429-8
4,13321,The microstructural features of the microtubular SOFCs were examined using scanning electron microscope images whereas the electrochemical performance was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements as well as I-V characteristic curves.,A novel multistep dip-coating method for the fabrication of anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-014-2429-8
5,13321,The results showed that the method used is a simple and low-cost alternative to conventional methods for the fabrication of microtubular SOFCs.,A novel multistep dip-coating method for the fabrication of anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-014-2429-8
6,13321,We found that the anode porosity played an important role in improving the overall performance of the microtubular SOFC by reducing the concentration polarization.,A novel multistep dip-coating method for the fabrication of anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-014-2429-8
