1,18666,"The isometric, pyrochlore structure type, A(2)B(2)O(7), exhibits a wide variety of properties that find application in a large number of different technologies, from electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells to actinide-bearing compositions that can be used as nuclear waste forms or inert matrix nuclear fuels.",Structural modifications of Gd2Zr2-xTixO7 pyrochlore induced by swift heavy ions: Disordering and amorphization,10.1557/JMR.2009.0151
2,18666,Swift xenon ions (1.43 GeV) have been used to systematically modify different compositions in the Gd2Zr2-xTixO7 binary at the nanoscale by radiation-induced phase transitions that include the crystal line-to-amorphous and order-disorder structural transformations.,Structural modifications of Gd2Zr2-xTixO7 pyrochlore induced by swift heavy ions: Disordering and amorphization,10.1557/JMR.2009.0151
3,18666,"Synchrotron x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy provide a complete and consistent description of structural changes induced by the swift heavy ions and demonstrate that the response of pyrochlore depends strongly on chemical composition.",Structural modifications of Gd2Zr2-xTixO7 pyrochlore induced by swift heavy ions: Disordering and amorphization,10.1557/JMR.2009.0151
4,18666,"The high and dense electronic energy deposition primarily results in amorphization of Ti-rich pyrochlore; whereas the formation of the fully disordered, defect-fluorite structure is the dominant process for Zr-rich pyrochlore.",Structural modifications of Gd2Zr2-xTixO7 pyrochlore induced by swift heavy ions: Disordering and amorphization,10.1557/JMR.2009.0151
