1,2675,"Rare earth silicates with apatite structure are being actively studied as an alternative electrolyte material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) operating in the intermediate temperature range In this paper we report on the synthesis of La9 33+3AlxSi6-tau O26+delta (with = 0-1.5) and La-9 Fe-83(1) Si-5(4) O-5(26) powders using a modified sot-gel process The parameters Involved in the process have been optimized for preparing phase pure, homogeneous and nanometer sized powders The obtained powders were characterized using scanning electron microscopy.",Synthesis of nano-crystalline apatite type electrolyte powders for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.01.003
