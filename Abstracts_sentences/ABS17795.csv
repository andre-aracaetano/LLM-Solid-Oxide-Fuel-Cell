1,17795,"Spinel oxides with the general formula Mn1.7Cu1.3-xFexO4 (x= 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) were prepared and evaluated in this work for their properties at high temperatures.","Preparation and characterisation of iron substituted Mn1.7Cu1.3-xFexO4 spinel oxides (x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5)",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.07.001
2,17795,The effect of partially substituting Cu by Fe has not been studied so far for this group of materials and is thus evaluated in this work.,"Preparation and characterisation of iron substituted Mn1.7Cu1.3-xFexO4 spinel oxides (x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5)",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.07.001
3,17795,"Mn1.7Cu1.3-xFexO4 powders were synthesised by a soft chemistry process and studied in terms of crystallographic phase analysis, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, and sinterability behaviour.","Preparation and characterisation of iron substituted Mn1.7Cu1.3-xFexO4 spinel oxides (x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5)",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.07.001
