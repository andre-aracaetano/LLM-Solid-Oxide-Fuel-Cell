1,8251,This work describes the performance and testing of a glass-ceramic sealant used to join the ceramic electrolyte (anode-supported-electrolyte (ASE)) to the metallic interconnect (Crofer22APU) in planar SOFC stacks.,Performance and testing of glass-ceramic sealant used to join anode-supported-electrolyte to Crofer22APU in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.042
2,8251,"The designed glass-ceramic sealant is a barium and boron free silica-based glass, which crystallizes by means of the heat-treatment after being deposited on substrates by the slurry technique.",Performance and testing of glass-ceramic sealant used to join anode-supported-electrolyte to Crofer22APU in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.042
3,8251,"Joined ASE/glass-ceramic seal/Crofer22APU samples were tested for 500 h in H-2-3H(2)O atmosphere at the fuel cell operating temperature of 800 degrees C. Moreover, the joined ASE/glass-ceramic seal/Crofer22APU samples were submitted to three thermal cycles each of 120 h duration, in order to evaluate the thermomechanical stability of the sealant.",Performance and testing of glass-ceramic sealant used to join anode-supported-electrolyte to Crofer22APU in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.042
4,8251,The microstructures and elemental distribution at Crofer22APU/glass-ceramic and ASE/glass-ceramic interfaces were investigated.,Performance and testing of glass-ceramic sealant used to join anode-supported-electrolyte to Crofer22APU in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.042
5,8251,SEM micrograph observations of joined samples that underwent cyclic thermal tests and exposure for 500 h in H-2-3H(2)O atmosphere showed that the adhesion between the glass-ceramic and Crofer22APU at either interface was very good and no microstructural changes were detected at the interfacial boundaries.,Performance and testing of glass-ceramic sealant used to join anode-supported-electrolyte to Crofer22APU in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.042
6,8251,The study showed that the use of the glass-ceramic was successful in preventing strong adverse corrosion effects at the Crofer22APU/glass-ceramic sealant interface.,Performance and testing of glass-ceramic sealant used to join anode-supported-electrolyte to Crofer22APU in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.042
