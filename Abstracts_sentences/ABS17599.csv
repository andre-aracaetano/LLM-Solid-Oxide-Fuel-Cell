1,17599,"As part of a study of the long-term operation of solid-oxide fuel cells, three (Mn,Co,Cr)(3)O-4 samples have been synthesized and characterized.","Cation distribution in spinel (Mn,Co,Cr)3O4 at room temperature",10.1107/S0021889810008150
2,17599,X-ray and neutron diffraction patterns from the powder samples at room temperature were measured and the data were co-refined.,"Cation distribution in spinel (Mn,Co,Cr)3O4 at room temperature",10.1107/S0021889810008150
3,17599,"The neutron data were indispensible in locating Mn, Co and Cr within the crystallographic unit cell with their respective atomic occupancies.","Cation distribution in spinel (Mn,Co,Cr)3O4 at room temperature",10.1107/S0021889810008150
4,17599,Two of these samples have been identified as cubic Mn0.76Co0.58Cr1.66O4 and Mn1.28Co1.72O4.,"Cation distribution in spinel (Mn,Co,Cr)3O4 at room temperature",10.1107/S0021889810008150
5,17599,The third is a two-phase sample containing cubic Mn1.66Co1.34O4 and tetragonal Mn2.05Co0.91O4 in a 59.1 (6): 40.9 (6)% mass fraction ratio.,"Cation distribution in spinel (Mn,Co,Cr)3O4 at room temperature",10.1107/S0021889810008150
6,17599,"Cr, which might be introduced from reaction with chromia during oxidation of interconnect materials, exhibits a preference for the octahedral site rather than the tetrahedral site.","Cation distribution in spinel (Mn,Co,Cr)3O4 at room temperature",10.1107/S0021889810008150
7,17599,"Without Cr, Mn dominates the octahedral site.","Cation distribution in spinel (Mn,Co,Cr)3O4 at room temperature",10.1107/S0021889810008150
