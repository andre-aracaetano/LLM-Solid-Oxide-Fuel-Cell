1,11576,"To avoid the proneness to degradation due to coking in the operation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) directly running on methane (CH4) fuels, a modified porous anode of the Ni1-XCoX/YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) cermet prepared by an impregnation method is presented.",Improved Electrochemical Properties of an Ni-Based YSZ Cermet Anode for the Direct Supply of Methane by Co Alloying with an Impregnation Method,10.3390/ceramics3010012
2,11576,"The influence of the Co alloying content on the cermet microstructure, SOFC characteristics, and prolonged cell performance stability has been studied.",Improved Electrochemical Properties of an Ni-Based YSZ Cermet Anode for the Direct Supply of Methane by Co Alloying with an Impregnation Method,10.3390/ceramics3010012
3,11576,Co was incorporated into Ni and formed a solid solution of Ni1-XCoX alloy connected with the YSZ as the cermet anode.,Improved Electrochemical Properties of an Ni-Based YSZ Cermet Anode for the Direct Supply of Methane by Co Alloying with an Impregnation Method,10.3390/ceramics3010012
4,11576,The porous microstructure of the Ni1-XCoX/YSZ cermet anode formed by sintering exhibited a grain growth with an increase in the Co alloying content.,Improved Electrochemical Properties of an Ni-Based YSZ Cermet Anode for the Direct Supply of Methane by Co Alloying with an Impregnation Method,10.3390/ceramics3010012
5,11576,"The electrochemical performance of the cells consisting of the Ni1-XCoX/YSZ cermet anode, the YSZ electrolyte, and the LSM (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) cathode showed an enhancement by the Ni1-XCoX impregnation treatment for the respective supply of H-2 and CH4 to the anode.",Improved Electrochemical Properties of an Ni-Based YSZ Cermet Anode for the Direct Supply of Methane by Co Alloying with an Impregnation Method,10.3390/ceramics3010012
6,11576,The cell using the Ni0.75Co0.25/YSZ cermet anode (the Ni0.75Co0.25 cell) showed the highest cell performance among the cells tested.,Improved Electrochemical Properties of an Ni-Based YSZ Cermet Anode for the Direct Supply of Methane by Co Alloying with an Impregnation Method,10.3390/ceramics3010012
7,11576,"In particular, the performance enhancement of this cell was found to be more significant for CH4 than that for H-2; a 45% increase in the maximum power density for CH4 and a 17% increase for H-2 at 750 & DEG;C compared with the performance of the cell using the Ni/YSZ cermet anode.",Improved Electrochemical Properties of an Ni-Based YSZ Cermet Anode for the Direct Supply of Methane by Co Alloying with an Impregnation Method,10.3390/ceramics3010012
8,11576,"Furthermore, the prolonged cell performance stability with a continuous CH4 supply was found for the Ni0.85Co0.15 and Ni0.75Co0.25 cells at least for 60 h at 750 & DEG;C. These enhancement effects were caused by the optimum porous microstructure of the cermet anode with the low anodic polarization resistance.",Improved Electrochemical Properties of an Ni-Based YSZ Cermet Anode for the Direct Supply of Methane by Co Alloying with an Impregnation Method,10.3390/ceramics3010012
