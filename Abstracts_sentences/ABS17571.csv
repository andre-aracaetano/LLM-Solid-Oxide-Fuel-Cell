6,17571,"The other impeded reactions discussed are those that show up in a single chamber or mixed gas solid oxide fuel cell, in the electrocatalytic enhancement of reactions, NEMCA, when the reaction cell is based on an oxygen ion conductor (YSZ) and finally, the catalytic activity (enhancement and retardation of reactions) of certain metallic electrodes in cells based on the proton conductor Nafion.",The significance of impeded reactions in solid state electrochemistry,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.015
