1,7522,"As anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), one of the significant advantages for perovskite alternatives over conventional Ni-based cermets is the high tolerance to sulfur poisoning.",Investigations on sulfur poisoning mechanisms of a solid oxide fuel cell with niobium-doped ferrate perovskite anode,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.135703
2,7522,"However, there are some controversies on sulfur poisoning mechanisms of perovskite anode cells and many related works are not systematic and convincible enough.",Investigations on sulfur poisoning mechanisms of a solid oxide fuel cell with niobium-doped ferrate perovskite anode,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.135703
3,7522,"Herein, with 200 ppm H2S-H-2 fed to anode chamber, we find that (LA(0.8)Sr(0.2))(0.95)MnO3-delta/(Sc2O3)(0.1)(CeO2)(0.01)(ZrO2)(0.89) (LSM/ScSZ) cathode undergoes a severe deactivation using Ceramabond 552 sealant, while La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-delta (LSFNb) anode keeps activating.",Investigations on sulfur poisoning mechanisms of a solid oxide fuel cell with niobium-doped ferrate perovskite anode,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.135703
4,7522,"Adopting annealing-quenching treatment to simulate in-situ conditions, transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that similar to 5 nm hexagonal FeS nanoparticles and ultrathin sulfur species layer are dynamically-formed on LSFNb surface upon exposure to 200 ppm H2S-H-2 since they disappear after the subsequent annealing in H-2.",Investigations on sulfur poisoning mechanisms of a solid oxide fuel cell with niobium-doped ferrate perovskite anode,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.135703
