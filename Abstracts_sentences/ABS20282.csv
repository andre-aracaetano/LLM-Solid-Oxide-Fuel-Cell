4,20282,"Detailed electrochemical evaluation of the cells reveals that: The short-term degradation of the fuel electrode is reflected on the rapid increase of the fuel electrode polarization resistance (R-Fuel) while in the long-term, its degradation primarily stems from a continuous increase of ohmic resistance (R-Ohmic).",Quantifying Galvanostatic Degradation of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells: The onset of accelerated degradation of Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia electrode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234490
5,20282,Microstructure analysis suggests that physical detachment of Ni from YSZ is not a prerequisite for Ni migration but constitutes an additional degradation phenomenon.,Quantifying Galvanostatic Degradation of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells: The onset of accelerated degradation of Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia electrode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234490
6,20282,"More specifically, the Ni-YSZ electrode exhibits accelerated degradation, when the fuel electrode overpotential (eta(Fuel)) exceeds -205 mV (at 800 degrees C) and -285 mV (at 750 degrees C).",Quantifying Galvanostatic Degradation of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells: The onset of accelerated degradation of Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia electrode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234490
