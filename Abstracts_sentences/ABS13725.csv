1,13725,"Highly homogeneous (Ce,Tb) oxides are prepared by a microemulsion technique, and their structural and electronic state after high temperature calcination is examined with X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron and absorption (XANES) spectroscopies and impedance spectroscopy measurements.",Cerium-terbium mixed oxides as potential materials for anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.02.079
2,13725,"Addition of Tb stabilizes significantly (in comparison to pure ceria) specific surface area and small particles sizes during high temperature calcination (up to 1100 degrees C); phase decomposition at these high temperatures, similar to that occurring when stabilization of ceria is carried out with Zr, does not occur, and the mixed oxide remains homogeneous throughout.",Cerium-terbium mixed oxides as potential materials for anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.02.079
3,13725,Tb addition to ceria may thus be beneficial when used as a component of SOFC anodes.,Cerium-terbium mixed oxides as potential materials for anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.02.079
4,13725,"TEM data indicate reshaping of oxide particles and provide evidence of crystal superstructures after high temperature treatments, while XPS and XANES reveal an increase in the Tb4+/Tb3+ ratio (for a given pretreatment) with the Tb/Ce ratio; Ce seems to be less reducible to Ce3+ in the presence of Tb.",Cerium-terbium mixed oxides as potential materials for anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.02.079
5,13725,"Total electrical conductivity of CT samples under H-2 is mediated by electron transport (involving probably only Cc) and is lower than in gadolinia-doped ceria (GCO); in air conductivity is higher than for GCO, particularly at low temperatures, and it is probable that a p-type transport mechanism predominates in this case.",Cerium-terbium mixed oxides as potential materials for anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.02.079
