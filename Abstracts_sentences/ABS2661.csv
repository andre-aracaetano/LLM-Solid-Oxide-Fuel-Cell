1,2661,Fuel cell is an energy conversion device that transforms the chemical energy of a fuel gas directly into electrical energy without direct combustion as an intermediate step.,Simulation of an atmospheric SOFC and gas turbine hybrid system using Aspen Plus software,10.1002/er.1941
2,2661,One type of fuel cell is the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with the operation temperature of around 1273 degrees K.,Simulation of an atmospheric SOFC and gas turbine hybrid system using Aspen Plus software,10.1002/er.1941
3,2661,The high operating temperature of the SOFC also provides excellent possibilities for feeding into a gas turbine (GT) to generate additional electricity.,Simulation of an atmospheric SOFC and gas turbine hybrid system using Aspen Plus software,10.1002/er.1941
4,2661,"In this paper, an atmospheric SOFC and GT hybrid system have been simulated by application of Aspen Plus existing functions and unit operation modules.",Simulation of an atmospheric SOFC and gas turbine hybrid system using Aspen Plus software,10.1002/er.1941
5,2661,The study has shown that the system efficiency and voltage reduce continuously as the current density increases due to increase of Ohmic and concentration losses.,Simulation of an atmospheric SOFC and gas turbine hybrid system using Aspen Plus software,10.1002/er.1941
6,2661,"However, the output power increases due to enhancement of the current density.",Simulation of an atmospheric SOFC and gas turbine hybrid system using Aspen Plus software,10.1002/er.1941
7,2661,"Therefore, the system should operate at low current density if the goal is to generate power at higher efficiency.",Simulation of an atmospheric SOFC and gas turbine hybrid system using Aspen Plus software,10.1002/er.1941
8,2661,"Moreover, if the goal is to produce more power, the system should operate at high current density.",Simulation of an atmospheric SOFC and gas turbine hybrid system using Aspen Plus software,10.1002/er.1941
9,2661,"The simulation results indicate that the cycle can achieve high electrical generation efficiency (68.2%), which is very attractive compared to the ideal efficiency of combined cycle power plants around 50%.",Simulation of an atmospheric SOFC and gas turbine hybrid system using Aspen Plus software,10.1002/er.1941
10,2661,"Moreover, a parametric analysis has been performed to assess the effects of the several operating condition variation on the system performance.",Simulation of an atmospheric SOFC and gas turbine hybrid system using Aspen Plus software,10.1002/er.1941
