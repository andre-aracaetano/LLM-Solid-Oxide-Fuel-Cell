1,758,"We proposed a new type of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating without using an anode material, where the anode was spontaneously formed by reduction of the electrolyte surface under reducing gas conditions.",Solid oxide fuel cells operating without using an anode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.01.024
2,758,A BaCe(0.76)Y(0.20)Pr(0.04)O(3 - x) electrolyte most successfully met this criterion.,Solid oxide fuel cells operating without using an anode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.01.024
3,758,"This material showed high mixed protonic-electronic conduction, whereas the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the cell was slightly lower than the theoretical value.",Solid oxide fuel cells operating without using an anode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.01.024
4,758,"The resulting SOFC exhibited reasonable fuel cell performances together with a good stability to thermal and redox cyclings and high resistance to carbon deposition up to 800 degreesC for dry methane, ethane, and propane.",Solid oxide fuel cells operating without using an anode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.01.024
