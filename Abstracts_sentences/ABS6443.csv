1,6443,High-temperature raw coke oven gas (COG) is a promising fuel for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) because it is rich in both hydrogen (55%-60%) and methane (23%-27%).,A strategy to reduce the impact of tar on a Ni-YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.4484
2,6443,"However, the tar present in COG limits its ability to directly generate power using state-of-art SOFCs because the presence of tar limits the cell's performance and stability.",A strategy to reduce the impact of tar on a Ni-YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.4484
3,6443,"In this work, a strategy is presented in the attempt to reduce the influence of tar on SOFCs by applying a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 catalyst as a protective layer for the cell.",A strategy to reduce the impact of tar on a Ni-YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.4484
4,6443,"The results showed that 44-g Nm(-3) toluene had a profoundly negative effect on the performance of a conventional cell, which showed severely reduced performance after only 1.4 hours of exposure to toluene-contaminated hydrogen.",A strategy to reduce the impact of tar on a Ni-YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.4484
5,6443,"In contrast, the catalyst-modified cell showed good stability for at least 110 hours under the same conditions.",A strategy to reduce the impact of tar on a Ni-YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.4484
6,6443,This work provides a promising route to directly utilize raw COG as an SOFC fuel that is also suitable for biosyngas.,A strategy to reduce the impact of tar on a Ni-YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.4484
