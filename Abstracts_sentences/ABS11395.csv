2,11395,"In this work, fully dense ceria ceramics doped with 20 mol% samarium were fabricated through the Pechini method.",Effect of the calcination temperature on the properties of Sm-doped CeO2,10.1680/jemmr.18.00082
3,11395,"Characterization studies including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to investigate the properties of the SDC powders calcined at 400 and 500 degrees C for 4 h. XRD and SEM results showed that a complete solid solution between ceria and samarium was obtained when the sintering temperature and time were 1400 degrees C and 6 h, respectively.",Effect of the calcination temperature on the properties of Sm-doped CeO2,10.1680/jemmr.18.00082
