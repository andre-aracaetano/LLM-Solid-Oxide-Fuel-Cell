1,11204,"In order to improve the chemical stability of BaCeO3, Ti4+ was introduced into B site of BaCeO3 to modify the chemical stability.",A stable BaCeO3-based proton conductor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-009-0363-z
2,11204,XRD test demonstrates that BaCe0.6Ti0.2Y0.2O3-delta (BCTY) keeps its original pervoskite-type structure at a high doping level of 20%.,A stable BaCeO3-based proton conductor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-009-0363-z
3,11204,"After exposure in 94% N-2+ 3% CO2+ 3% H2O at 700 degrees C for 10 h, BCTY exhibited adequate chemical stability while decomposition was found in BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BCY).",A stable BaCeO3-based proton conductor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-009-0363-z
4,11204,"Accordingly, the conductivity of BCTY reaches 0.0072 S/cm at 700 degrees C in humidified hydrogen which is a little lower than BCY (0.0085).",A stable BaCeO3-based proton conductor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-009-0363-z
5,11204,"Besides, BCTY displayed better sintering characteristics than BCY at high temperatures and the relative density reaches 96.4% and 94.8%, respectively.",A stable BaCeO3-based proton conductor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-009-0363-z
6,11204,"The two samples also exhibited similar thermal expansion behavior from 30 to 1,000 degrees C. A fuel cell with BCTY as electrolyte exhibited 244 mW/cm(2) at 700 degrees C and the stable short-term performance further proved the stability of BCTY.",A stable BaCeO3-based proton conductor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-009-0363-z
