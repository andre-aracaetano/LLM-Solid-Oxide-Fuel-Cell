1,20620,"Cubic perovskite oxide La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-delta (LBCO) and its composite with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) electrolyte, LBCO-GDC in 1:1 weight ratio were prepared.",A comparative study of electrochemical performance of La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ and La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.156
2,20620,Chemical compatibility between LBCO and GDC was studied and no serious phase reaction occurred at temperatures up to 1050 degrees C in air.,A comparative study of electrochemical performance of La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ and La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.156
3,20620,Electrochemical performance of the cathodes was measured by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure.,A comparative study of electrochemical performance of La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ and La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.156
4,20620,Electrode reaction mechanism was analyzed based on fitting results of the EIS with proper equivalent circuit models.,A comparative study of electrochemical performance of La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ and La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.156
5,20620,Comparison of the results demonstrated that introduction of the ionic conductive GDC component to the LBCO-GDC composite cathode hardly influenced gas diffusion through bulk of the cathode (low-frequency process) while greatly enhanced oxygen ionic transfer across the cathode/electrolyte interface (high-frequency process) and the electrode reaction occurring in the medium-frequency range.,A comparative study of electrochemical performance of La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ and La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.156
6,20620,"As a result, the LBCO-GDC composite cathode exhibited lower area-specific resistance (ASR) than the LBCO cathode, with ASR value ranging from similar to 0.12 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C to similar to 0.01 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C.",A comparative study of electrochemical performance of La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ and La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.156
7,20620,These results have demonstrated that the LBCO-GDC composite (1:1 weight ratio) is highly promising as a cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell.,A comparative study of electrochemical performance of La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ and La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.156
