1,435,Hydrazine was examined as a fuel for a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) that employed atypical nickel-based anode.,Solid-oxide fuel cell operated on in situ catalytic decomposition products of liquid hydrazine,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.062
2,435,An in situ catalytic decomposition of hydrazine at liquid state under room temperature and ambient pressure before introducing to the fuel cell was developed by applying a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) oxide catalyst.,Solid-oxide fuel cell operated on in situ catalytic decomposition products of liquid hydrazine,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.062
3,435,Catalytic testing demonstrated that liquid N2H4 can be decomposed to gaseous NH3 and H-2 at a favorable rate and at a temperature as low as 20 degrees C and H-2 selectivity reaching values as high as 10% at 60 degrees C. Comparable fuel cell performance was observed using either the in situ decomposition products of hydrazine or pure hydrogen as fuel.,Solid-oxide fuel cell operated on in situ catalytic decomposition products of liquid hydrazine,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.062
