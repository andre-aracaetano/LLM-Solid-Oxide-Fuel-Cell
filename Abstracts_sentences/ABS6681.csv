1,6681,The p-i-n junction structure has garnered great interest from researchers due to its increased photoactive area and wider space charger region compared with that of the p-n junction.,Accelerated Proton Transport Based on a p-i-n Heterostructure Membrane for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02773
2,6681,Herein the ultrawide bandgap (similar to 6.7 eV) semiconductor alumina (Al2O3) has been introduced to construct a p-i-n junction with ZnO and NiO. ZnO-Al2O3-NiO powders are suitable for electrolyte membrane material of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).,Accelerated Proton Transport Based on a p-i-n Heterostructure Membrane for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02773
3,6681,"The insulating Al2O3 brings a doubled depletion region and more effective charge separation compared with the p-n junction consisting of ZnO and NiO. The fuel cell based on the p-i-n junction membrane material delivers an enhanced maximum power density (MPD) of 917 mW cm(-2) along with a high open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.013 V at 550 degrees C. An analysis based on the space charge region and energy band alignment in the p-i-n junction is proposed to account for the appreciable cell performance and ionic conductivity, as well as the electron blocking and charge separation ability.",Accelerated Proton Transport Based on a p-i-n Heterostructure Membrane for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02773
4,6681,This study presents a practical p-i-n junction design based on ZnO-Al2O3-NiO via a solution process for LT-SOFC electrolyte material and sheds light on the extensive exploration of p-i-n junctions applied in LT-SOFCs.,Accelerated Proton Transport Based on a p-i-n Heterostructure Membrane for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02773
