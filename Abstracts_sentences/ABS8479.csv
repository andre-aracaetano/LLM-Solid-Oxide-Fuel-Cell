1,8479,"An electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method was applied for the preparation of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) films for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications, Dense YSZ films with uniform thickness can be readily prepared with the EPD method by using acetylacetone or acetone as a solvent, The open-circuit voltages of SOFC, for which the YSZ films were prepared by the EPD method, increased with increasing repetitions of deposition and sintering.",Electrophoretic deposition of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte films in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1151-2916.1996.tb08525.x
2,8479,It was found that the open-circuit voltage exceeded 1.0 V after five repetitions.,Electrophoretic deposition of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte films in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1151-2916.1996.tb08525.x
3,8479,"When the planar SOFC was fabricated using La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 as a cathode, and electroless plating Pt as an anode, the open-circuit voltage and the maximum power density attained were 1.03 V and 1.84 W .",Electrophoretic deposition of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte films in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1151-2916.1996.tb08525.x
4,8479,"cm(-2), respectively, Consequently, it became evident that the electrophoretic deposition was a suitable processing route for the formation of gas-tight YSZ films with thickness less than 10 mu m.",Electrophoretic deposition of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte films in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1151-2916.1996.tb08525.x
