1,4832,A series of alkaline-earth aluminosilicate glass-ceramics (GCs) were appraised with respect to their suitability as sealants for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Electrical behavior of aluminosilicate glass-ceramic sealants and their interaction with metallic solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.007
2,4832,"The parent composition with general formula Ca0.9MgAl0.1La0.1Si1.9O6 was modified with Cr2O3 and BaO. The addition of BaO led to a substantial decrease in the total electrical conductivity of the GCs, thus improving their insulating properties.",Electrical behavior of aluminosilicate glass-ceramic sealants and their interaction with metallic solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.007
3,4832,BaO-containing GCs exhibited higher coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in comparison to BaO-free GCs.,Electrical behavior of aluminosilicate glass-ceramic sealants and their interaction with metallic solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.007
4,4832,"An extensive segregation of oxides of Ti and Mn, components of the Crofer22 APU interconnect alloy, along with negligible formation of BaCrO4 was observed at the interface between GC/interconnects diffusion couples.",Electrical behavior of aluminosilicate glass-ceramic sealants and their interaction with metallic solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.007
5,4832,Thermal shock resistance and gas-tightness of GC sealants in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte (8YSZ) was evaluated in air and water.,Electrical behavior of aluminosilicate glass-ceramic sealants and their interaction with metallic solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.007
6,4832,"Good matching of CTE and strong, but not reactive, adhesion to the solid electrolyte and interconnect, in conjunction with a high level of electrical resistivity, are all advantageous for potential SOFC applications.",Electrical behavior of aluminosilicate glass-ceramic sealants and their interaction with metallic solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.007
