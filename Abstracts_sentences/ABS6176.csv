1,6176,This work establishes a mathematical model of fuel transport efficiency in anode that permeates from the surface to the triple phase boundaries through the porous electrode of solid oxide fuel cells.,Impact on Fuel Transport Efficiency in Anode of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
2,6176,And the relationship between the fuel transport efficiency and the parameters of the porous anode and gas channel is verified with the reported experimental results.,Impact on Fuel Transport Efficiency in Anode of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
3,6176,The result shows that the fuel transport efficiency in anode is proportional to the porosity of the supported-anode and the length of the gas channel on interconnects.,Impact on Fuel Transport Efficiency in Anode of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
4,6176,The fuel transport efficiency is also inversely proportional to the porosity and height of the gas channel on interconnect and the thickness of the porous supported-anode.,Impact on Fuel Transport Efficiency in Anode of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
5,6176,"When the porosity of the supported-anode is fixed, the fuel transport efficiency can be improved by reducing the porosity or extending the gas channel length, or reducing the gas channel height on the interconnect, or reducing the thickness of the porous-anode.",Impact on Fuel Transport Efficiency in Anode of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
6,6176,"When the porosity, height, and length of the gas channel on the interconnect are fixed, the fuel transport efficiency in anode can be improved by increasing the porosity or reducing the thickness of the porous anode.",Impact on Fuel Transport Efficiency in Anode of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
