2,7174,Coconut shell carbon was used as the renewable biomass for the gasification to power the SOFC at 800 degrees C.,Study of a renewable biomass fueled SOFC: The effect of catalysts,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.147
3,7174,"The study was particularly focused on the effect of catalysts on the efficiency of the gasification process, thus the performance of tubular SOFC powered by these gasified fuels.",Study of a renewable biomass fueled SOFC: The effect of catalysts,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.147
4,7174,SOFCs with catalysts such as Fe2O3 and K2CO3 added coconut shell carbon showed higher power density compared to that without catalyst.,Study of a renewable biomass fueled SOFC: The effect of catalysts,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.147
5,7174,"The improved cell performance can be ascribed to a promoted carbon conversion rate by the catalysts, and consequently higher concentration of gaseous fuels.",Study of a renewable biomass fueled SOFC: The effect of catalysts,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.147
