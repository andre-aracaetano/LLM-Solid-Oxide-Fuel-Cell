1,11429,"This paper presents the performance and multi-criteria assessment of a combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system applied to a residence under electric-following and thermal-following strategies.","Multi-criteria assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-combined cooling, heating, and power system model for residential application",10.1016/j.energy.2022.124974
2,11429,"The CCHP system mainly consists of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), LiBr absorption chiller, and water tank or lithium battery to simultaneously provide electric power, cooling power, thermal power, and domestic hot water for the household.","Multi-criteria assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-combined cooling, heating, and power system model for residential application",10.1016/j.energy.2022.124974
3,11429,"The output power, system efficiency, exergy analysis, economic analysis, annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, and thermoelectric ratio of the CCHP system under the two control strategies above are investigated.","Multi-criteria assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-combined cooling, heating, and power system model for residential application",10.1016/j.energy.2022.124974
4,11429,The results show that the SOFC-CCHP system with the hot water tank controlled by the electric -following strategy in summer and winter improves system and exergy efficiencies as well as reduces daily cost and annual GHG reduction with decreased economic performance.,"Multi-criteria assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-combined cooling, heating, and power system model for residential application",10.1016/j.energy.2022.124974
5,11429,"System efficiency is between 67.1% and 96.8%, exergy efficiency stabilizes at approximately 42%, the annual GHG reduction is between 1.356 t and 4.71 t, the daily cost is 9 $ and the thermoelectric ratio is between 0.132 and 1.819 in summer.","Multi-criteria assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-combined cooling, heating, and power system model for residential application",10.1016/j.energy.2022.124974
6,11429,"System efficiency is between 86.5% and 88%, exergy efficiency stabilizes at approximately 43%, the annual GHG reduction is be-tween 0.886 t and 7.742 t, the daily cost is 7.31 $ and the thermoelectric ratio is between 0.091 and 1.62 in winter.","Multi-criteria assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-combined cooling, heating, and power system model for residential application",10.1016/j.energy.2022.124974
