1,10587,"3YSZ specimens with variable open porosity (1-57%) were fabricated, and the stiffness, strength and fracture properties (fracture toughness and R-curve) were measured to investigate their potential use as support structures for solid oxide fuel or electrolysis cells.",Influence of porosity on mechanical properties of tetragonal stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.09.029
2,10587,The ball-on-ring test was used to characterize Young's modulus and Weibull strength.,Influence of porosity on mechanical properties of tetragonal stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.09.029
3,10587,The variation of fracture toughness with porosity was investigated and modelled using the results from fracture mechanical testing.,Influence of porosity on mechanical properties of tetragonal stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.09.029
4,10587,"A distinct R-curve behaviour was observed in dense 3YSZ specimens, in samples with a porosity around 15% and in some of the highly porous samples (porosities similar to 45%) reflecting a transformation toughening in the material.",Influence of porosity on mechanical properties of tetragonal stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.09.029
5,10587,"For the most porous samples, the R-curve behaviour disappeared and subcritical crack growth was observed.",Influence of porosity on mechanical properties of tetragonal stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.09.029
6,10587,The studies indicate that even highly porous 3YSZ structures (porosities exceeding 40%) are feasible supports for SOFC/SOECs from a mechanical point of view.,Influence of porosity on mechanical properties of tetragonal stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.09.029
