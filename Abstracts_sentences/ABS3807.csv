2,3807,"The effectiveness of the spinel layer in suppressing volatile Cr species from the metallic interconnects is strongly dependent on layer density, which is influenced by particle size distributions and agglomerations of the spinel powders.","Synthesis of (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 Spinel: Effects of Citrate-to-Nitrate Ratio on Its Homogeneity and Electrical Properties",10.3390/en16031382
3,3807,"Considering that the material properties were influenced by the synthesizing conditions, this study elucidated the influences of citric acid (fuel) on the structure, morphology, and electrical properties of sol-gel derived CMC spinel powders.","Synthesis of (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 Spinel: Effects of Citrate-to-Nitrate Ratio on Its Homogeneity and Electrical Properties",10.3390/en16031382
4,3807,"Dual-phase CMC spinel powders, consisting of cubic CuMnCoO and tetragonal Mn2CoO4, were successfully synthesized at citrate-to-nitrate (CA/MN) ratios of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2.","Synthesis of (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 Spinel: Effects of Citrate-to-Nitrate Ratio on Its Homogeneity and Electrical Properties",10.3390/en16031382
5,3807,An undesired CuCo2O4 phase was observed in spinel powders synthesized at a low CA/MN ratio of 0.5.,"Synthesis of (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 Spinel: Effects of Citrate-to-Nitrate Ratio on Its Homogeneity and Electrical Properties",10.3390/en16031382
6,3807,"The CA/MN ratio has influenced not only the phase formation of CMC spinel, but also the particle size distributions.","Synthesis of (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 Spinel: Effects of Citrate-to-Nitrate Ratio on Its Homogeneity and Electrical Properties",10.3390/en16031382
7,3807,"The CA/MN ratio of 1.0 yielded the finest CMC spinel with the least agglomerates, which then produced the highest electrical conductivity of 116 Scm(-1).","Synthesis of (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 Spinel: Effects of Citrate-to-Nitrate Ratio on Its Homogeneity and Electrical Properties",10.3390/en16031382
8,3807,"Therefore, the CA/MN ratio of 1.0 was recommended for the synthesis of CMC spinel, which can be used in fabricating the protective coating of solid oxide fuel cell interconnects.","Synthesis of (Cu,Mn,Co)3O4 Spinel: Effects of Citrate-to-Nitrate Ratio on Its Homogeneity and Electrical Properties",10.3390/en16031382
