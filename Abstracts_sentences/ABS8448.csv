1,8448,An anode supported solid oxide fuel cell with an La0.6Sr0.4Co1.05O3-delta (LSC) infiltrated-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) cathode that shows a stable performance has been developed.,Highly durable anode supported solid oxide fuel cell with an infiltrated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.040
2,8448,"The cathode was prepared by screen printing a porous CGO backbone on top of a laminated and co-fired anode supported half cell, consisting of a Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode support, a Ni-scandia-doped yttria-stabilized zirconia (ScYSZ) anode, a ScYSZ electrolyte, and a CGO barrier layer.",Highly durable anode supported solid oxide fuel cell with an infiltrated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.040
3,8448,LSC was introduced into the CGO backbone by multiple infiltrations of an aqueous nitrate solution followed by firing.,Highly durable anode supported solid oxide fuel cell with an infiltrated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.040
4,8448,The cell was tested at 700 degrees C under a current density of 0.5 A cm(-2) for 1500 h using air as oxidant and humidified hydrogen as fuel.,Highly durable anode supported solid oxide fuel cell with an infiltrated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.040
5,8448,The electrochemical performance of the cell was analyzed by impedance spectroscopy and current-voltage relationships.,Highly durable anode supported solid oxide fuel cell with an infiltrated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.040
6,8448,No measurable degradation in the cell voltage or increase in the resistance from the recorded impedance was observed during long term testing.,Highly durable anode supported solid oxide fuel cell with an infiltrated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.040
7,8448,The power density reached 0.79 W cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 0.6 V at 750 degrees C. Post test analysis of the LSC infiltrated-CGO cathode by scanning electron microscopy revealed no significant micro-structural difference to that of a nominally identical untested counterpart.,Highly durable anode supported solid oxide fuel cell with an infiltrated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.040
