1,6751,Solid oxide fuel cell (SCFC) running directly on hydrocarbon fuels has attracted much attention in recent years.,Characterization of the Ni-ScSZ anode with a LSCM-CeO2 catalyst layer in thin film solid oxide fuel cell running on ethanol fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.126
2,6751,"In this paper, a dual-layer Structure anode running on ethanol is fabricated by tape casting and screen-printing method, the addition of a LSCM-CeO2 catalyst layer to the supported anode surface yields better performance in ethanol fuel.",Characterization of the Ni-ScSZ anode with a LSCM-CeO2 catalyst layer in thin film solid oxide fuel cell running on ethanol fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.126
3,6751,The effect that the synthesis conditions of the catalyst layer have on the performances of the composite anodes is investigated.,Characterization of the Ni-ScSZ anode with a LSCM-CeO2 catalyst layer in thin film solid oxide fuel cell running on ethanol fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.126
4,6751,"Single cells with this anode are also fabricated, of which the maximum power density reaches 669mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C running on ethanol steam.",Characterization of the Ni-ScSZ anode with a LSCM-CeO2 catalyst layer in thin film solid oxide fuel cell running on ethanol fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.126
5,6751,"No significant degradation in performance has been observed after 216 h of cell testing when the Ni-ScSZ13 anode is exposed to ethanol steam at 700 degrees C. Very little carbon is detected on the anode, suggesting that carbon deposition is limited during cell operation.",Characterization of the Ni-ScSZ anode with a LSCM-CeO2 catalyst layer in thin film solid oxide fuel cell running on ethanol fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.126
6,6751,"Consequently, the LSCM-CeO2 catalyst layer on the surface of the supported anode makes it possible to have good stability for long-term operation in ethanol fuel due to low carbon deposition.",Characterization of the Ni-ScSZ anode with a LSCM-CeO2 catalyst layer in thin film solid oxide fuel cell running on ethanol fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.126
