1,18830,Reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC) technology allows use of a single device to efficiently derive chemicals from power (power-to-fuel) and power from chemicals (fuel-to-power).,Novel Composite Fuel Electrode for CO2/CO-RSOCs,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2c15
2,18830,"Fuel flexibility is a key aspect, as developing SOCs able to operate on fuels other than hydrogen can ease their integration into existing infrastructure.",Novel Composite Fuel Electrode for CO2/CO-RSOCs,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2c15
3,18830,"In addition, H2O and/or CO2 reduction is favorable in SOECs as polarization losses are reduced at high temperature.",Novel Composite Fuel Electrode for CO2/CO-RSOCs,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2c15
4,18830,"Here, a composite fuel electrode, 60 wt.% La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Mn0.2O3-delta (LSFMn) and 40 wt.% (5 wt.% Ni)-containing Ce0.85Sm0.15O2-delta (Ni-SDC) was investigated in H-2-fueled, CO-fueled SOFCs and for CO2 reduction in SOEC mode.",Novel Composite Fuel Electrode for CO2/CO-RSOCs,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2c15
