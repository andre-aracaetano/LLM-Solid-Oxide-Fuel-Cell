4,12746,"With cathodes consisting of yttria-stabilized bismuth oxide and sliver, anodes of samaria-doped ceria and nickel, the supported YSZ films were characterized as electrolytes for single cells with humidified hydrogen as fuel and stationary air as oxidant.",YSZ thin films deposited by spin-coating for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.11.005
5,12746,"Open circuit voltage was 1.08 Vat 700 degrees C, close to the theoretical value and power density was 535 mW/cm(2) at 750 degrees C and 400 mW/cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Impedance analysis indicates that the performances of the SOFCs are determined essentially by the interfacial resistances, suggesting that optimizing the electrode materials are especially important for IT-SOFCs.",YSZ thin films deposited by spin-coating for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.11.005
