1,6137,Molten Sn and Bi were examined at 973 and 1073 K for use as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes.,A Comparison of Molten Sn and Bi for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3282443
2,6137,"Cells were operated under battery conditions, with dry He flow in the anode compartment, to characterize the electrochemical oxidation of the metals at the YSZ interface.",A Comparison of Molten Sn and Bi for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3282443
3,6137,"For both metals, the open-circuit voltages (OCVs) were close to that expected based on their oxidation thermodynamics, similar to 0.93 V for Sn and similar to 0.48 V for Bi.",A Comparison of Molten Sn and Bi for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3282443
4,6137,"With Sn, the cell performance degraded rapidly after the transfer of approximately 0.5-1.5 C/cm(2) of charge due to the formation of a SnO2 layer at the YSZ interface.",A Comparison of Molten Sn and Bi for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3282443
5,6137,"At 973 K, the anode impedance at OCV for freshly reduced Sn was approximately 3 cm(2) but this increased to well over 250 cm(2) after the transfer of 1.6 C/cm(2) of charge.",A Comparison of Molten Sn and Bi for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3282443
6,6137,"Following the transfer of 8.2 C/cm(2) at 1073 K, the formation of a 10 mu m thick SnO2 layer was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy.",A Comparison of Molten Sn and Bi for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3282443
7,6137,"With Bi, the OCV anode impedance at 973 K was less than 0.25 cm(2) and remained constant until essentially all of the Bi had been oxidized to Bi2O3.",A Comparison of Molten Sn and Bi for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3282443
8,6137,Some implications of these results for direct carbon fuel cells are discussed.,A Comparison of Molten Sn and Bi for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3282443
