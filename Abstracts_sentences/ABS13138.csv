1,13138,"Praseodymium-Cerium Oxide (PrxCe1-xO2-delta; PCO), a potential three way catalyst oxygen storage material and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode, exhibits surprisingly high levels of oxygen nonstoichiometry, even under oxidizing (e.g. air) conditions, resulting in mixed ionic electronic conductivity (MIEC).",Praseodymium-cerium oxide thin film cathodes: Study of oxygen reduction reaction kinetics,10.1007/s10832-011-9678-z
2,13138,"In this study we examine the redox kinetics of dense PCO thin films using impedance spectroscopy, for x = 0.01, 0.10 and 0.20, over the temperature range of 550 to 670A degrees C, and the oxygen partial pressure range of 10(-4) to 1 atm O-2.",Praseodymium-cerium oxide thin film cathodes: Study of oxygen reduction reaction kinetics,10.1007/s10832-011-9678-z
3,13138,"The electrode impedance was observed to be independent of electrode thickness and inversely proportional to electrode area, pointing to surface exchange rather than bulk diffusion limited kinetics.",Praseodymium-cerium oxide thin film cathodes: Study of oxygen reduction reaction kinetics,10.1007/s10832-011-9678-z
4,13138,The large electrode capacitance (10(-2)F) was found to be consistent with an expected large electrochemically induced change in stoichiometry for x = 0.1 and x = 0.2 PCO.,Praseodymium-cerium oxide thin film cathodes: Study of oxygen reduction reaction kinetics,10.1007/s10832-011-9678-z
5,13138,"The PCO films showed surprisingly rapid oxygen exchange kinetics, comparable to other high performance SOFC cathode materials, from which values for the surface exchange coefficient, k (q) , were calculated.",Praseodymium-cerium oxide thin film cathodes: Study of oxygen reduction reaction kinetics,10.1007/s10832-011-9678-z
6,13138,This study confirms the suitability of PCO as a model MIEC cathode material compatible with both zirconia and ceria based solid oxide electrolytes.,Praseodymium-cerium oxide thin film cathodes: Study of oxygen reduction reaction kinetics,10.1007/s10832-011-9678-z
