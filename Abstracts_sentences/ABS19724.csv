1,19724,"Through the use of ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and specially designed ceria-based solid oxide electrochemical cells, carbon dioxide (CO2) electrolysis reactions (CO2 + 2e(-) -> CO + O2-) and carbon monoxide (CO) electro-oxidation reactions (CO + O2- -CO2 + 2e(-)) over cerium oxide electrodes have been investigated in the presence of 0.5 Torr CO-CO2 gas mixtures at similar to 600 degrees C. Carbonate species (CO32-) are identified on the ceria surface as reaction intermediates.",CO2 activation and carbonate intermediates: an operando AP-XPS study of CO2 electrolysis reactions on solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1039/c4cp01054j
2,19724,"When CO2 electrolysis is promoted on ceria electrodes at + 2.0 V applied bias, we observe a higher concentration of CO32- over a 400 mu m-wide active region on the ceria surface, accompanied by Ce3+/Ce4+ redox changes.",CO2 activation and carbonate intermediates: an operando AP-XPS study of CO2 electrolysis reactions on solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1039/c4cp01054j
3,19724,This increase in the CO32- steady-state concentration suggests that the process of pre-coordination of CO2 to the ceria surface to form a CO32- intermediate (CO2(g) + O-(surface)(2-) -> CO32- ((surface))) precedes a rate-limiting electron transfer process involving CO32- reduction to give CO and oxide ions (CO32- ((surface)) +,CO2 activation and carbonate intermediates: an operando AP-XPS study of CO2 electrolysis reactions on solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1039/c4cp01054j

6,19724,"When the applied bias is switched to -1.5 V to promote CO electro-oxidation on ceria, the surface CO32- concentration slightly decreases from the equilibrium value, suggesting that the electron transfer process is also a rate-limiting process in the reverse direction.",CO2 activation and carbonate intermediates: an operando AP-XPS study of CO2 electrolysis reactions on solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1039/c4cp01054j
