3,15504,"Overall, it appeared that chromites such as (La,Sr)CrO3 improved surface stability, but might not be good candidates for protection layer applications due to chromium vaporization, albeit at a lower rate than Cr2O3, from these oxides at high temperatures in air or moist air.",Conductive protection layers on oxidation resistant alloys for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2006.08.082
