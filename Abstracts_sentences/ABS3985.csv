1,3985,BaCe0.8Pr0.2O3 (BCP20) and BaCe0.6Pr0.4O3 (BCP40) powders are successfully synthesized through the Pechini method and used as the cathode materials for proton-conducting solid state oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Pr Doped Barium Cerate as the Cathode Material for Proton-Conducting SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201300205
2,3985,"The prepared cells consisting of the structure of a BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3- (BZCY7)-NiO anode substrate, a BZCY7 anode functional layer, a BZCY7 electrolyte membrane, and a cathode layer, are measured from 600 to 700 degrees C with humidified hydrogen (approximate to 3% H2O) as the fuel and static air as the oxidant.",Pr Doped Barium Cerate as the Cathode Material for Proton-Conducting SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201300205
3,3985,"The electricity results show that the cell with BCP40 cathode has a higher power density, which could obtain an open-circuit potential of 0.99V and a maximum power density of 378mWcm(-2) at 700 degrees C.",Pr Doped Barium Cerate as the Cathode Material for Proton-Conducting SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201300205
4,3985,"The polarization resistance measured at the open-circuit condition of BCP40 is only 0.16cm(2) at 700 degrees C, which was less than BCP20.",Pr Doped Barium Cerate as the Cathode Material for Proton-Conducting SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201300205
