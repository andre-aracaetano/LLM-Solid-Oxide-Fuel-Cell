1,20335,"The structural, electronic and surface properties of the mixed lithium-sodium (LiNaCO3) and lithium-potassium (LiKCO3) carbonates were studied through periodic calculations performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level, using three different exchange-correlation functionals.","Mixed lithium-sodium (LiNaCO3) and lithium-potassium (LiKCO3) carbonates for low temperature electrochemical applications: Structure, electronic properties and surface reconstruction from ab-initio calculations",10.1016/j.susc.2015.12.027
2,20335,The hybrid functional PBE0 was found to be the best one to describe both geometric and electronic features of bulk LiNaCO3 and LiKCO3.,"Mixed lithium-sodium (LiNaCO3) and lithium-potassium (LiKCO3) carbonates for low temperature electrochemical applications: Structure, electronic properties and surface reconstruction from ab-initio calculations",10.1016/j.susc.2015.12.027
3,20335,"Polar (001) and non-polar (110) low index surfaces were taken into account, the first one being found the most stable in both cases, after reconstruction.","Mixed lithium-sodium (LiNaCO3) and lithium-potassium (LiKCO3) carbonates for low temperature electrochemical applications: Structure, electronic properties and surface reconstruction from ab-initio calculations",10.1016/j.susc.2015.12.027
4,20335,"Both introduction of vacancies (RI) and octopolar terminations (R-2) of (001), exposing Li ((001)(Li)) or Na ((001)(Na)) were described in detail.","Mixed lithium-sodium (LiNaCO3) and lithium-potassium (LiKCO3) carbonates for low temperature electrochemical applications: Structure, electronic properties and surface reconstruction from ab-initio calculations",10.1016/j.susc.2015.12.027
5,20335,The computed stability order for the reconstructed surfaces in gas phase is: (001)R1Na > > (001)(R1)(Li) > (001)(R2)(Na) approximate to(Li)(R2).,"Mixed lithium-sodium (LiNaCO3) and lithium-potassium (LiKCO3) carbonates for low temperature electrochemical applications: Structure, electronic properties and surface reconstruction from ab-initio calculations",10.1016/j.susc.2015.12.027
6,20335,"The obtained information, in particular regarding the electronic and surface properties, could be used in future to help understanding the role of mixed carbonates as component of oxide-carbonate electrolytes for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) applications, especially as reasonable starting points for dynamics calculations of liquid molten carbonates based systems.","Mixed lithium-sodium (LiNaCO3) and lithium-potassium (LiKCO3) carbonates for low temperature electrochemical applications: Structure, electronic properties and surface reconstruction from ab-initio calculations",10.1016/j.susc.2015.12.027
