1,2971,"Atomic scale computer simulations, validated with experimental data, are used to uncover the factors responsible for defect-induced chemical expansion observed in non-stoichiometric oxides, exemplified by CeO2 and ZrO2.",Understanding Chemical Expansion in Non-Stoichiometric Oxides: Ceria and Zirconia Case Studies,10.1002/adfm.201102648
2,2971,It is found that chemical expansion is the result of two competing processes: the formation of a vacancy (leading to a lattice contraction primarily due to electrostatic interactions) and the cation radius change (leading to a lattice expansion primarily due to steric effects).,Understanding Chemical Expansion in Non-Stoichiometric Oxides: Ceria and Zirconia Case Studies,10.1002/adfm.201102648
3,2971,The chemical expansion coefficient is modeled as the summation of two terms that are proportional to the cation and oxygen radius change.,Understanding Chemical Expansion in Non-Stoichiometric Oxides: Ceria and Zirconia Case Studies,10.1002/adfm.201102648
