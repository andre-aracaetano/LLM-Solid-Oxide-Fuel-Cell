3,1261,"In this paper, the direct utilization of methanol in solid oxide fuel cells with impregnated Ni/YSZ and Ni-Zr0.35Ce0.65O2-delta (ZDC)/YSZ anodes was investigated at 1073 K. Performance and stability of these anodes, as measured by steady-state polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, were improved by the presence of ZDC; although, the deposition of carbon, as detected by scanning electron microscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation analysis, was not entirely avoided.",Direct utilization of methanol on impregnated Ni/YSZ and Ni-Zr0.35Ce0.65O2/YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.119
