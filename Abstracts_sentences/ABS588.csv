1,588,"Different transition metals are employed to tune the Y -doped BaZrO 3 proton conductor, resulting in the new BaZr 0.125 Y 0.125 M 0.75 O 3 (M = Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) compositions as cathodes for proton -conducting solid oxide fuel cells.","New BaZr0.125Y0.125M0.75O3 (M=Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.271
2,588,"Only Co and Fe dopants can yield pure phases, whereas the use of other dopants results in impurities.","New BaZr0.125Y0.125M0.75O3 (M=Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.271
3,588,"Further experimental studies and first -principles calculations show that using Fe dopant has some advantages over Co -doped material, such as increased oxygen vacancies, lower proton migration energy barriers, and faster proton and oxygen diffusion kinetics.","New BaZr0.125Y0.125M0.75O3 (M=Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.271
4,588,The fuel cell employing the BaZr 0.125 Y 0.125,"New BaZr0.125Y0.125M0.75O3 (M=Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.271
5,588,Fe 0.75 O 3 (BZYFe) cathode has a larger fuel cell output than the fuel cell using the BaZr 0.125 Y 0.125,"New BaZr0.125Y0.125M0.75O3 (M=Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.271
6,588,Co 0.75 O 3 (BZYCo) cathode.,"New BaZr0.125Y0.125M0.75O3 (M=Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.271
7,588,"Furthermore, the CO 2 adsorption energy on the BZYFe surface is larger than that at the BZYCo surface, indicating that BZYFe has significantly better chemical stability than BZYCo.","New BaZr0.125Y0.125M0.75O3 (M=Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.271
8,588,The long-term stability of the fuel cell demonstrates that the fuel cell with the BZYCo cathode is degrading.,"New BaZr0.125Y0.125M0.75O3 (M=Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.271
9,588,"In contrast, the BZYFe cell has good operating stability.","New BaZr0.125Y0.125M0.75O3 (M=Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.271
10,588,"Given its phase purity, fuel cell performance, and stability, the Fe element is an appropriate dopant for altering BZY and creating a new cathode.","New BaZr0.125Y0.125M0.75O3 (M=Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Co, and Fe) cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.271
