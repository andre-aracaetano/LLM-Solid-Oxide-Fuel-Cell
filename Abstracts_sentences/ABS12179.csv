6,12179,"This phase transition takes place at a temperature around 25 degrees C lower than that previously described for the oxidized sample, and it is affected by a significant hysteresis (T-t = 174 degrees C in the cooling run).",Evaluation of Sr2CoMoO6-δ as anode material in solid-oxide fuel cells: A neutron diffraction study,10.1063/1.3544068
7,12179,"The absence of tilting of the CoO6 and MoO6 octahedra in the high-temperature cubic phase favors the orbital overlap and the electronic conductivity; a high mobility of the oxygen atoms is derived from the elevated displacement parameters, for instance 3.2 angstrom(2) at 867 degrees C. Both factors contribute to the excellent performance described for this mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC) oxide as anode in single fuel cells.",Evaluation of Sr2CoMoO6-δ as anode material in solid-oxide fuel cells: A neutron diffraction study,10.1063/1.3544068
