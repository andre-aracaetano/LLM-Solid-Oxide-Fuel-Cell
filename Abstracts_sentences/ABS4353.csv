1,4353,"At the present, a major technological challenge for the development of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is the reduction of their operation temperature in order to reduce the costs and increase the fuel cell lifetime.",Characterisation of thin films of ceria-based electrolytes for IntermediateTemperature -: Solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC),10.1007/BF02376531
2,4353,"Nevertheless, decrease in the operating temperature leads to losses in cell performance mainly due to the ohmic drop through the electrolyte.",Characterisation of thin films of ceria-based electrolytes for IntermediateTemperature -: Solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC),10.1007/BF02376531
3,4353,"Therefore, several approaches are currently under investigation to overcome the electrolyte problem and the use of oxygen ion conductor thin films seems to be the most promising solution.",Characterisation of thin films of ceria-based electrolytes for IntermediateTemperature -: Solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC),10.1007/BF02376531
4,4353,"In this respect, the well-known electrolyte CeO2-Gd2O3 (CGO) was investigated.",Characterisation of thin films of ceria-based electrolytes for IntermediateTemperature -: Solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC),10.1007/BF02376531
5,4353,Thin layers of less than 5 mum of CGO were deposited using two different techniques: RF magnetron sputtering and Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD).,Characterisation of thin films of ceria-based electrolytes for IntermediateTemperature -: Solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC),10.1007/BF02376531
