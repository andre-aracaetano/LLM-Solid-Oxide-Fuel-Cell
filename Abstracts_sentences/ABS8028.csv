1,8028,"The effect of catalyst loading, operation temperature and co-infiltration of the palladium-based catalysts on the performance and stability of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) cathode of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is investigated.",Performance and stability of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode promoted with palladium based catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.01.157
2,8028,The result shows that adding a small amount of Pd catalyst (0.08 mg cm(-2)) has a remarkable effect on the reduction of overpotential of LSM cathodes and high palladium loading is detrimental to the electrochemical activity of LSM cathodes.,Performance and stability of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode promoted with palladium based catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.01.157
3,8028,The performance and stability of the Pd-impregnated LSM cathodes can be enhanced significantly by co-infiltration of palladium with either 20 mol% of silver or 5 mol% of cobalt.,Performance and stability of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode promoted with palladium based catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.01.157
4,8028,Increased stability of the co-infiltrated catalyst materials is probably related to the enhanced resistance of the co-impregnated Pd0.95Co0.05 and Pd0.8Ag0.2 nanoparticles against agglomeration and sintering at SOFC operation temperatures.,Performance and stability of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode promoted with palladium based catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.01.157
5,8028,The results indicate the co-impregnation is effective not only to enhance the electrochemical activity but also to improve the stability of LSM cathodes for the O-2 reduction reaction of SOFCs.,Performance and stability of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode promoted with palladium based catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.01.157
