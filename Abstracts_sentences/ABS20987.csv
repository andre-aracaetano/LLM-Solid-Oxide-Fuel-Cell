1,20987,"The bulk structure, the relative stability, and the electronic properties of monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic ZrO2 have been studied from a theoretical point of view, through periodic ab initio calculations using different Gaussian basis sets together with Hartree-Fock (HF), pure Density Functional Theory (DFT), and mixed HF/DFT schemes as found in hybrid functionals.",A Comprehensive DFT Investigation of Bulk and Low-Index Surfaces of ZrO2 Polymorphs,10.1002/jcc.23761
2,20987,"The role of a posteriori empirical correction for dispersion, according to the Grimme D2 scheme, has also been investigated.",A Comprehensive DFT Investigation of Bulk and Low-Index Surfaces of ZrO2 Polymorphs,10.1002/jcc.23761
3,20987,"The obtained results show that, among the tested functionals, PBE0 not only provides the best structural description of the three polymorphs, but it also represents the best compromise to accurately describe both the geometric and electronic features of the oxide.",A Comprehensive DFT Investigation of Bulk and Low-Index Surfaces of ZrO2 Polymorphs,10.1002/jcc.23761
4,20987,"The relative stability of the three phases can also be qualitatively reproduced, as long as thermal contributions to the energy are taken into account.",A Comprehensive DFT Investigation of Bulk and Low-Index Surfaces of ZrO2 Polymorphs,10.1002/jcc.23761
5,20987,"Four low-index ZrO2 surfaces [monoclinic (-111), tetragonal (101 and 111), and cubic (111)] have then been studied at this latter level of theory.",A Comprehensive DFT Investigation of Bulk and Low-Index Surfaces of ZrO2 Polymorphs,10.1002/jcc.23761
6,20987,"Surface energies, atomic relaxations, and electronic properties of these surfaces have been computed.",A Comprehensive DFT Investigation of Bulk and Low-Index Surfaces of ZrO2 Polymorphs,10.1002/jcc.23761
7,20987,"The most stable surface is the cubic one, which is associated to small relaxations confined to the outermost layers.",A Comprehensive DFT Investigation of Bulk and Low-Index Surfaces of ZrO2 Polymorphs,10.1002/jcc.23761
8,20987,"It is followed by the monoclinic (-111) and the tetragonal (101), which have very similar surface energies and atomic displacements.",A Comprehensive DFT Investigation of Bulk and Low-Index Surfaces of ZrO2 Polymorphs,10.1002/jcc.23761
9,20987,"The tetragonal (111) was instead found to be, by far, the less stable with large displacements not only for the outermost but also for deeper layers.",A Comprehensive DFT Investigation of Bulk and Low-Index Surfaces of ZrO2 Polymorphs,10.1002/jcc.23761
10,20987,"Through the comparison of different methods and basis sets, this study allowed us to find a reliable and accurate computational protocol for the investigation of zirconia, both in its bulk and surfaces forms, in view of more complex technological applications, such as ZrO2 doped with aliovalent oxides as found in solid oxide fuel cells.",A Comprehensive DFT Investigation of Bulk and Low-Index Surfaces of ZrO2 Polymorphs,10.1002/jcc.23761
