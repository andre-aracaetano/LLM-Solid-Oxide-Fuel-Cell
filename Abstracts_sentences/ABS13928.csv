2,13928,Phase structure has been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement.,One-step synthesized nano-composite cathode material of Pr0.83BaCo1.33Sc0.5O6-δ-0.17PrCoO3 for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.051
3,13928,The results indicate that the composite material is composed of two cubic perovskite phases with nano-scaled grain sizes.,One-step synthesized nano-composite cathode material of Pr0.83BaCo1.33Sc0.5O6-δ-0.17PrCoO3 for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.051
4,13928,"Thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the composite material was measured to be 18.4 x 10(-6)/degrees C at temperatures of 30-900 degrees C. Electrical conductivities were measured in air by DC four-electrode method, and the conductivity values increase monotonically with the higher temperatures from 100 degrees C up to 750 degrees C. Electrochemical performance of the PBCS-0.17PCO composite materials was studied by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements using GDC-based symmetric cell.",One-step synthesized nano-composite cathode material of Pr0.83BaCo1.33Sc0.5O6-δ-0.17PrCoO3 for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.051
5,13928,"Low area specific resistance (ASR) values ranging from 0.127 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, 0.069 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C, 0.039 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C to 0.026 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C were achieved for the composite cathode, demonstrating its promising application in IT-SOFCs.",One-step synthesized nano-composite cathode material of Pr0.83BaCo1.33Sc0.5O6-δ-0.17PrCoO3 for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.051
