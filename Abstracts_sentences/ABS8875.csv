2,8875,"wt % Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (samaria-doped ceria, SDC)-Ni\SDC\Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3, was studied in a mixture of methane and air between 450 and 550degreesC. The addition of a small amount of Pd (0.145 mg cm(-2)) to the anode significantly promoted the partial oxidation of methane by oxygen to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which resulted in electromotive forces of ca.",High performance anodes for SOFCs operating in methane-air mixture at reduced temperatures,10.1149/1.1430226
