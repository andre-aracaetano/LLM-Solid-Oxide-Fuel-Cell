1,11138,Metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with thin YSZ electrolyte films and infiltrated Ni and LSM catalysts are operated in the temperature range 650-750 degrees C. A five-layer structure consisting of porous metal- support/porous YSZ interlayer/dense YSZ electrolyte film/porous YSZ interlayer/porous metal current collector is prepared at 1300 degrees C in reducing atmosphere.,Performance of metal-supported SOFCs with infiltrated electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.076
