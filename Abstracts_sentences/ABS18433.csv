2,18433,"xCuxN0.2O3 (x = 0.0 similar to 0.2) (LFCN), a new cathode material of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), was synthesized by Co-precipitation method using sodium bicarbonate.",Synthesis and sintering of cathode materials LaFe0.8-xCuNi0.2O3,
3,18433,The lattice structures of samples with different x contents were characterized by XRD.,Synthesis and sintering of cathode materials LaFe0.8-xCuNi0.2O3,
4,18433,Porosity and density of the porous LaFe0.8-xCuxNi0.2O3 (x = 0.0 similar to 0.1) as a function of sintering temperature were investigated.,Synthesis and sintering of cathode materials LaFe0.8-xCuNi0.2O3,
5,18433,It was found that the orthorhombic structure could be formed after calcination at 900 degrees C for 4 h. The particle size of LFCN was about 350 nm.,Synthesis and sintering of cathode materials LaFe0.8-xCuNi0.2O3,
6,18433,"The density of the porous LFCN increased with sintering temperature, but the opposite was true for the porosity.",Synthesis and sintering of cathode materials LaFe0.8-xCuNi0.2O3,
7,18433,"On the other hand, at the same sintering temperature, the porosity of LaFe0.8-xCuxNi0.2O3 (x = 0.0 similar to 0.1) decreased with increasing x contents.",Synthesis and sintering of cathode materials LaFe0.8-xCuNi0.2O3,
8,18433,It is indicated that the dopant of Cu on LaFe0.8Ni0.2O3 can facilitate the sintering of the materials.,Synthesis and sintering of cathode materials LaFe0.8-xCuNi0.2O3,
9,18433,"After sintering at 1 100 degrees C for 4 h, the porous LaFe0.7Cu0.1Ni0.2O3 was still with appropriate structure, and its porosity was 29%.",Synthesis and sintering of cathode materials LaFe0.8-xCuNi0.2O3,
