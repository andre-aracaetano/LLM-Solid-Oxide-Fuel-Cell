1,18533,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) fueled with dimethyl ether (DME) were investigated.,Dimethyl ether fueled intermediate temperature SOFC using LaGaO3-based perovskite electrolytes,10.1149/1.1489135
2,18533,"The performance of a single cell, Ni/La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3/Sm0.5Sr0.5O3, fueled with DME was comparable to that of the cell fueled with hydrogen at 1073 K.",Dimethyl ether fueled intermediate temperature SOFC using LaGaO3-based perovskite electrolytes,10.1149/1.1489135
3,18533,"However, the power density of the DME cell decreased dramatically with decreasing temperature and showed lower maximum power density than H-2 cell at 973 K due to high anodic overpotential.",Dimethyl ether fueled intermediate temperature SOFC using LaGaO3-based perovskite electrolytes,10.1149/1.1489135
4,18533,"The oxidation of DME on Ni was rather complex, and there were at least two arcs in the impedance spectra under polarization, while there was only one arc when the anode was exposed to H-2.",Dimethyl ether fueled intermediate temperature SOFC using LaGaO3-based perovskite electrolytes,10.1149/1.1489135
5,18533,The activity of the anode was improved greatly by using Ni-Sm3+ doped ceria (Ni-SDC) composite anode or Ni-SDC/SDC bilayer anode.,Dimethyl ether fueled intermediate temperature SOFC using LaGaO3-based perovskite electrolytes,10.1149/1.1489135
6,18533,"DME decomposition into CH4, CO, and H-2 takes place at the first step, and the overall reaction is close to the partial oxidation of DME into CO and H-2 with increasing current density.",Dimethyl ether fueled intermediate temperature SOFC using LaGaO3-based perovskite electrolytes,10.1149/1.1489135
