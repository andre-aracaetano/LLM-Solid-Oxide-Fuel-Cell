2,8042,"Recently, stainless steels have attractive materials for metallic bipolar plate because metallic bipolar plates have many benefits compared to others such as graphite and composite bipolar plates.",Effect of Surface Treatments of Stainless Steels on Oxidation Behavior Under Operating Condition of IT SOFC Interconnect,10.3365/KJMM.2011.49.1.025
3,8042,SOFC operates on high temperature of about 800 similar to 1000 degrees C than other fuel cell systems.,Effect of Surface Treatments of Stainless Steels on Oxidation Behavior Under Operating Condition of IT SOFC Interconnect,10.3365/KJMM.2011.49.1.025
4,8042,"Thus, many studies have attempted to reduced the operation temperature of SOFC to about 600 similar to 800 degrees C, which is the intermediate temperature (IT) of SOFC.",Effect of Surface Treatments of Stainless Steels on Oxidation Behavior Under Operating Condition of IT SOFC Interconnect,10.3365/KJMM.2011.49.1.025
5,8042,Low cost and high-temperature corrosion resistance are very important for the practical applications of SOFC in various industries.,Effect of Surface Treatments of Stainless Steels on Oxidation Behavior Under Operating Condition of IT SOFC Interconnect,10.3365/KJMM.2011.49.1.025
6,8042,"In this study, two specimens, 304 and 430 stainless steels with and without different pre-surface treatments on the surface were investigated.",Effect of Surface Treatments of Stainless Steels on Oxidation Behavior Under Operating Condition of IT SOFC Interconnect,10.3365/KJMM.2011.49.1.025
7,8042,"And, specimens were exposed at high temperature in the box furnace under oxidation atmosphere of 800 degrees C. Oxidation behavior have been investigated with the materials exposed at different times (100 hrs and 400 hrs) by SEM, EDS and XRD.",Effect of Surface Treatments of Stainless Steels on Oxidation Behavior Under Operating Condition of IT SOFC Interconnect,10.3365/KJMM.2011.49.1.025
8,8042,"By increasing exposure time, the amount of metal oxide increased in the order like; STS304 < STS430 and As-received < As-polished < Sand-blast specimens.",Effect of Surface Treatments of Stainless Steels on Oxidation Behavior Under Operating Condition of IT SOFC Interconnect,10.3365/KJMM.2011.49.1.025
