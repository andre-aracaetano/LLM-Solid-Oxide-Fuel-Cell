2,11302,"in a solid oxide fuel cell system, that is it main novelty.",Design and operation of a gas cleaning system for biomass gasification in a two-stage air-blown downdraft gasifier to meet quality requirements of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s13399-021-01796-0
3,11302,"Variations in total air flow and air ratio (AR) as the main methods for the gas cleaning system had a significant effect on the gasification temperature, reducing tar, particulate, H2S, HCl, and NH3 at 12.50 mg/Nm(3), 6.00 mg/Nm(3), 2.85 mg/Nm(3), 102.60 mg/Nm(3), and 15.25 mg/Nm(3), respectively.",Design and operation of a gas cleaning system for biomass gasification in a two-stage air-blown downdraft gasifier to meet quality requirements of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s13399-021-01796-0
4,11302,"Subsequently, a new secondary method for gas cleaning included the external installation of a granular sand bed filter, a venturi scrubber, a spray scrubber, a fixed-bed adsorber with activated carbon, and a ceramic filter to remove contaminants.",Design and operation of a gas cleaning system for biomass gasification in a two-stage air-blown downdraft gasifier to meet quality requirements of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s13399-021-01796-0
5,11302,"As a result of using the secondary cleaning method, the concentrations of tar, PM, H2S, NH3, and HCl could be reduced to 12.51 mg/Nm(3), 6.02 mg/Nm(3), 2.85 mg/Nm(3), 121.72 mg/Nm(3), and 9.18 mg/Nm(3), respectively.",Design and operation of a gas cleaning system for biomass gasification in a two-stage air-blown downdraft gasifier to meet quality requirements of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s13399-021-01796-0
6,11302,"It is possible to conclude that the proposed secondary gas cleaning system, coupled with primary measures, can produce gas with concentrations of pollutants low enough to satisfy fuel cleaning requirements in a SOFC.",Design and operation of a gas cleaning system for biomass gasification in a two-stage air-blown downdraft gasifier to meet quality requirements of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s13399-021-01796-0
