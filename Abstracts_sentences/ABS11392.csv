1,11392,"Epitaxial model-type platinum (Pt) film electrodes with a high three-phase boundary (tpb) density on single crystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte, YSZ(1 1 1), are characterized electrochemically in air at a temperature of 673 K - which is comparatively low for the system Pt(O-2)/YSZ.","Oxygen reduction and oxidation at epitaxial model-type Pt(O2)/YSZ electrodes - On the role of PtOx formation on activation, passivation, and charge transfer",10.1016/j.cattod.2012.02.058
2,11392,"By combining different electrochemical measurements including impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with and without applied potential bias, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and 'steady state' current-overpotential characteristics (I-eta curves) with different sample starting conditions, the impact of annealing time and pre-polarization on the polarization resistance and on the oxygen exchange rate are investigated in detail.","Oxygen reduction and oxidation at epitaxial model-type Pt(O2)/YSZ electrodes - On the role of PtOx formation on activation, passivation, and charge transfer",10.1016/j.cattod.2012.02.058
3,11392,"A model, based on the electrochemical control of thermally grown Pt oxide, is suggested to explain the experimental results.","Oxygen reduction and oxidation at epitaxial model-type Pt(O2)/YSZ electrodes - On the role of PtOx formation on activation, passivation, and charge transfer",10.1016/j.cattod.2012.02.058
4,11392,It is assumed that Pt oxide passivates the electrode and decreases the electrocatalytic activity of Pt for the oxygen exchange reaction.,"Oxygen reduction and oxidation at epitaxial model-type Pt(O2)/YSZ electrodes - On the role of PtOx formation on activation, passivation, and charge transfer",10.1016/j.cattod.2012.02.058
5,11392,"Additionally, it is suggested that Pt oxide has a similar passivating effect as in aqueous electrochemistry, despite the higher temperature.","Oxygen reduction and oxidation at epitaxial model-type Pt(O2)/YSZ electrodes - On the role of PtOx formation on activation, passivation, and charge transfer",10.1016/j.cattod.2012.02.058
6,11392,"Additionally, blocking impurities at the tpb and activating morphological changes are discussed.","Oxygen reduction and oxidation at epitaxial model-type Pt(O2)/YSZ electrodes - On the role of PtOx formation on activation, passivation, and charge transfer",10.1016/j.cattod.2012.02.058
7,11392,Together with the experimental results the model provides new insights in the observed electrode processes and offers routes to improve the electrode performance of Pt(O-2)/YSZ at low temperature.,"Oxygen reduction and oxidation at epitaxial model-type Pt(O2)/YSZ electrodes - On the role of PtOx formation on activation, passivation, and charge transfer",10.1016/j.cattod.2012.02.058
8,11392,This might be of significant interest e. g. for mu-solid oxide fuel cells (micro-SOFCs).,"Oxygen reduction and oxidation at epitaxial model-type Pt(O2)/YSZ electrodes - On the role of PtOx formation on activation, passivation, and charge transfer",10.1016/j.cattod.2012.02.058
