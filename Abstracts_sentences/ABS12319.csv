1,12319,"Ruddlesden - Popper phases are promising materials for solid oxide fuel cell/electrolyzer air electrodes, oxygen separation membranes and other electrochemical devices due to their high oxygen mobility provided by a cooperative mechanism of oxygen migration involving both regular and highly-mobile interstitial oxygen.","Structural, surface and oxygen transport properties of Sm-doped Nd nickelates",10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116596
2,12319,"This work aims at studying structural, surface and oxygen transport properties of Sm-doped Nd nickelates sintered in a furnace at the temperatures in the range of 800-1250 degrees C and using electron beams at the temperatures in the range of 1150-1250 degrees C. Nd2-xSmxNiO4+delta, x = 0.2 and 0.4 are synthesized by a modified Pechini technique and characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed isotope exchange of oxygen with (CO2)-O-18 in a flow reactor.","Structural, surface and oxygen transport properties of Sm-doped Nd nickelates",10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116596
