5,6753,"We find that households with small to average energy demands do not benefit from installation of a SOFC micro-CHP system, but larger energy demands do benefit under these conditions.",Solid oxide fuel cell systems for residential micro-combined heat and power in the UK: Key economic drivers,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.008
6,6753,"However, this result is sensitive to a number of factors including stack capital cost, energy import and export prices, and plant lifetime.",Solid oxide fuel cell systems for residential micro-combined heat and power in the UK: Key economic drivers,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.008
7,6753,"The results for small and average dwellings are shown to reverse under an observed change in energy import prices, an increase in electricity export price, a decrease in stack capital costs, or an improvement in stack lifetime.",Solid oxide fuel cell systems for residential micro-combined heat and power in the UK: Key economic drivers,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.008
