1,6026,"While the integration of base-load fuel cells into the built environment is expected to provide numerous benefits to the user, the steady-state and dynamic behavior of these stationary fuel cell systems can produce an undesirable impact on the grid distribution circuit at the point of connection.",Load-following active power filter for a solid oxide fuel cell supported load,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.005
2,6026,"In the present paper, a load-following active power filter (LFAPF) is proposed to mitigate the grid impact of such systems and instead improve overall local power quality.",Load-following active power filter for a solid oxide fuel cell supported load,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.005
3,6026,"To evaluate the strategy, the LFAPF is integrated into a SOFC system inverter with one-cycle control (OCC) to provide the fundamental benefits of a traditional active power filter (APF) while also damping out short-term line current transients.",Load-following active power filter for a solid oxide fuel cell supported load,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.005
4,6026,The LFAPF benefit is illustrated through simulation of an SOFC interconnected with the utility electric distribution system and a building electricity demand that is modeled as a dynamic non-linear load.,Load-following active power filter for a solid oxide fuel cell supported load,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.005
5,6026,"Three installation cases are examined: (1) a load-following SOFC, (2) a base-loaded SOFC, and (3) an offline SOFC.",Load-following active power filter for a solid oxide fuel cell supported load,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.005
6,6026,"Without LFAPF, the load-following SOFC causes load transients due to the finite SOFC response time, and the base-loaded SOFC case has transients that appear more severe because they represent a larger overall percentage of the grid-provided load.",Load-following active power filter for a solid oxide fuel cell supported load,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.005
7,6026,The integration of an LFAPF improves the steady-state behavior over the base case and mitigates voltage sags and step changes.,Load-following active power filter for a solid oxide fuel cell supported load,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.005
8,6026,"Thus integrating an LFAPF can, by providing useful services to both the utility and the end-user, facilitate the integration of an SOFC into the distribution system.",Load-following active power filter for a solid oxide fuel cell supported load,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.005
