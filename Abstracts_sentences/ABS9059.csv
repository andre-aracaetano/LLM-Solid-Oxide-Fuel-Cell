4,9059,"Thus, this article presents the recent findings on performance enhancement of H-SOFCs through the utilization of a novel composite cathode, consisting of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3+delta (LSCF) and La2-xNixCe2O7-delta (LNCOx) (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4).",Enhancing chemical stability and performance in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells through novel composite cathode design,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233576
5,9059,"The novel composite LSCF-LNCO0.3 cathode has shown significant improvements in the catalytic activity and durability, achieving a maximum power density of 1283 mW cm-2 at 700 degrees C. Density functional theoretical calculation (DFT) results reveal that the Ni doping in La2Ce2O7+delta (LCO) can effectively reduce the proton migration energy and enhance hydration ability, thereby obtaining high cathode performance.",Enhancing chemical stability and performance in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells through novel composite cathode design,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233576
