1,13497,The increasing interest in lightweight solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems for mobile applications has raised the awareness for questions concerning mechanical robustness of sealing materials in thermo-cyclic operation.,Damage and Failure of Silver Based Ceramic/Metal Joints for SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200181
2,13497,"In the planar SOFC design considered in the current work, a metallic silver based braze sealant is used.",Damage and Failure of Silver Based Ceramic/Metal Joints for SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200181
3,13497,"Although, these rather ductile metallic seals are considered to have advantages compared to brittle glass ceramics under thermal cycling conditions, the behavior of such sealant materials after application relevant thermal cyclic operation has not been reported so far.",Damage and Failure of Silver Based Ceramic/Metal Joints for SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200181
4,13497,"Hence, the post-operational characterization of a series of silver braze sealed stacks operated isothermally and under thermal cycling conditions is reported with particular emphasis on the braze morphology.",Damage and Failure of Silver Based Ceramic/Metal Joints for SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200181
5,13497,"The stacks were disassembled after operation, specimens were extracted in various characteristic positions, and metallographically prepared cross-sections were analyzed by optical and electron microscopy.",Damage and Failure of Silver Based Ceramic/Metal Joints for SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200181
6,13497,"It was observed that micro-pores were formed in the sealant that terminated stack operation, and that the extent of this porosity depended on the actual operation conditions leading eventually to leakage and in some cases even to melting effects.",Damage and Failure of Silver Based Ceramic/Metal Joints for SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200181
7,13497,The discussion of the results focuses on the influence of different operation conditions on the damage progress and failure of silver based braze joints.,Damage and Failure of Silver Based Ceramic/Metal Joints for SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201200181
