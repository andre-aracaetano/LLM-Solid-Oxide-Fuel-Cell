1,21158,"Based upon the thermodynamic simulation of a biogas-SOFC integrated process and the costing of its elements, the present work examines the economic feasibility of biogas-SOFCs for combined heat and power (CHP) generation, by the comparison of their economic performance against the conventional biogas-CHP with internal combustion engines (ICEs), under the same assumptions.",Economic Feasibility of Power/Heat Cogeneration by Biogas-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Integrated Systems,10.3390/en16010404
2,21158,"As well as the issues of process scale and an SOFC's cost, examined in the literature, the study brings up the determinative effects of: (i) the employed SOFC size, with respect to its operational point, as well as (ii) the feasibility criterion, on the feasibility assessment.",Economic Feasibility of Power/Heat Cogeneration by Biogas-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Integrated Systems,10.3390/en16010404
3,21158,"Two plant capacities were examined (250 m(3)center dot h(-1) and 750 m(3)center dot h(-1) biogas production), and their feasibilities were assessed by the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Pay Back Time (PBT) criteria.",Economic Feasibility of Power/Heat Cogeneration by Biogas-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Integrated Systems,10.3390/en16010404
4,21158,"For SOFC costs at 1100 and 2000 EUR center dot kW(el)(-1), foreseen in 2035 and 2030, respectively, SOFCs were found to increase investment (by 2.5-4.5 times, depending upon a plant's capacity and the SOFC's size) and power generation (by 13-57%, depending upon the SOFC's size), the latter increasing revenues.",Economic Feasibility of Power/Heat Cogeneration by Biogas-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Integrated Systems,10.3390/en16010404
5,21158,"SOFC-CHP exhibits considerably lower IRRs (5.3-13.4% for the small and 16.8-25.3% for the larger plant), compared to ICE-CHP (34.4%).",Economic Feasibility of Power/Heat Cogeneration by Biogas-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Integrated Systems,10.3390/en16010404
6,21158,"Nonetheless, according to NPV that does not evaluate profitability as a return on investment, small scale biogas-SOFCs (NPVmax: EUR 3.07 M) can compete with biogas-ICE (NPV: EUR 3.42 M), for SOFCs sized to operate at 70% of the maximum power density (MPD) and with a SOFC cost of 1100 EUR center dot kW(el)(-1), whereas for larger plants, SOFC-CHP can lead to considerably higher NPVs (EUR 12.5-21.0 M) compared to biogas-ICE (EUR 9.3 M).",Economic Feasibility of Power/Heat Cogeneration by Biogas-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Integrated Systems,10.3390/en16010404
7,21158,"Nonetheless, PBTs are higher for SOFC-CHP (7.7-11.1 yr and 4.2-5.7 yr for the small and the large plant, respectively, compared to 2.3 yr and 3.1 yr for biogas-ICE) because the criterion suppresses the effect of SOFC-CHP-increased revenues to a time period shorter than the plant's lifetime.",Economic Feasibility of Power/Heat Cogeneration by Biogas-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Integrated Systems,10.3390/en16010404
8,21158,"Finally, the economics of SOFC-CHP are optimized for SOFCs sized to operate at 70-82.5% of their MPD, depending upon the SOFC cost and the feasibility criterion.",Economic Feasibility of Power/Heat Cogeneration by Biogas-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Integrated Systems,10.3390/en16010404
9,21158,"Overall, the choice of the feasibility criterion and the size of the employed SOFC can drastically affect the economic evaluation of SOFC-CHP, whereas the feasibility criterion also determines the economically optimum size of the employed SOFC.",Economic Feasibility of Power/Heat Cogeneration by Biogas-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Integrated Systems,10.3390/en16010404
