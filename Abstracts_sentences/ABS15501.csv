5,15501,"The mean open circuit voltage of the bundle of the 10 kW class SOFC module was 5.45 V within +/- 0.7% precision, when the mean central temperature of the bundle was 665.5 degrees",Development of Direct Heating Method of SOFC Using Combustion Gases of Surface Combustion Burner,10.5796/electrochemistry.80.239
6,15501,C. The difference of the cell temperatures in the axial direction was controlled at less than 66 degrees C and the difference between the temperatures inside and outside of the cells was controlled at less than 4 degrees C. As a result a cell was able to reduce thermal stress and to maintain soundness.,Development of Direct Heating Method of SOFC Using Combustion Gases of Surface Combustion Burner,10.5796/electrochemistry.80.239
