1,18103,Results obtained in synthesis and certification of new materials based on Ba-doped Ln(2)NiO(4+delta) as possible electrode candidates for electrochemical devices with solid-oxide proton-conducting electrolytes are presented.,"Functionality of Lanthanum, Neodymium, and Praseodymium Nickelates as Promising Electrode Systems for Proton-Conducting Electrolytes",10.1134/S1070427218040080
2,18103,"Single-phase materials of composition Ln(1.95)Ba(0.05)NiO(4+delta) (Ln = La, Nd, and Pr) were obtained by using the citrate-nitrate synthesis method, and their thermomechanical, electrical, and electrochemical functionality was examined with the use of the dilatometric method, four-probe dc measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively.","Functionality of Lanthanum, Neodymium, and Praseodymium Nickelates as Promising Electrode Systems for Proton-Conducting Electrolytes",10.1134/S1070427218040080
3,18103,"An integrated analysis of the data obtained shows that the highest electrical transport properties, which compare well with modern results, were reached for the Pr-containing nickelite.","Functionality of Lanthanum, Neodymium, and Praseodymium Nickelates as Promising Electrode Systems for Proton-Conducting Electrolytes",10.1134/S1070427218040080
4,18103,"At the same time, this nickelite has an increased thermal expansion coefficient, which exceeds by similar to 20% that for the electrolyte material.","Functionality of Lanthanum, Neodymium, and Praseodymium Nickelates as Promising Electrode Systems for Proton-Conducting Electrolytes",10.1134/S1070427218040080
5,18103,These characteristics can be optimized by creating composite materials based on Pr1.95Ba0.05NiO4+delta with a small fraction of the electrolyte component.,"Functionality of Lanthanum, Neodymium, and Praseodymium Nickelates as Promising Electrode Systems for Proton-Conducting Electrolytes",10.1134/S1070427218040080
