3,7803,"In the newly proposed theoretical model of nanostructured material, the most attention is paid to the small aspect ratio of structural elements as well as to some model problems of electrostatics.",Thin inclusion approach for modelling of heterogeneous conducting materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.058
4,7803,"The proposed integral equation for electric potential caused by the charge distributed over the single circular or elliptic cylindrical conductor of finite length, as a single unit of a nanostructured material, has been asymptotically simplified for the small aspect ratio and solved numerically.",Thin inclusion approach for modelling of heterogeneous conducting materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.058
5,7803,The result demonstrates that surface density changes slightly in the middle part of the thin domain and has boundary layers localized near the edges.,Thin inclusion approach for modelling of heterogeneous conducting materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.058
