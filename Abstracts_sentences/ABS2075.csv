1,2075,"A stable, easily sintered perovskite oxide BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-delta (BCZYZn) as an electrolyte for protonic ceramic mernbrane fuel cells (PCMFCs) with Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (BSZF) perovskite cathode was investigated.","Stable, easily sintered BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells with Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite cathode",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.075
2,2075,"The BCZYZn perovskite electrolyte synthesized by a modified Pechini method exhibited higher sinterability and reached 97.4% relative density at 1200 degrees C for 5 h in air, which is about 200 degrees C lower than that without Zn dopant.","Stable, easily sintered BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells with Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite cathode",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.075
3,2075,"By fabricating thin membrane BCZYZn electrolyte (about 30 mu m in thickness) on NiO-BCZYZn anode support, PCMFCs were assembled and tested by selecting stable BSZF perovskite cathode.","Stable, easily sintered BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells with Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite cathode",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.075
4,2075,"An open-circuit potential of 1.00V, a maximum power density of 236 mWcm(-2), and a low polarization resistance of the electrodes of 0.17 Omega cm(2) were achieved at 700 degrees C.","Stable, easily sintered BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells with Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite cathode",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.075
5,2075,This investigation indicated that proton conducting electrolyte BCZYZn with BSZF perovskite cathode is a promising material system for the next generation solid oxide fuel cells.,"Stable, easily sintered BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells with Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite cathode",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.075
