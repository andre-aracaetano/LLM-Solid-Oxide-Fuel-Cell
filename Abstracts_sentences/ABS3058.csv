1,3058,"We study the heat resistance and electric conductivity of the specimens of Crofer 22 APU steel, which is traditionally used for the production of interconnects of solid-oxide fuel cells, a bulk composite based on the Ti2AlC MAX phase, and a vacuum-arc coating of the Ti-Al-C system on a thin (0.5 mm) VT1-0 titanium sheet in the intact state and after long-term holding (1000 h) in air at 600 degrees.",LIGHT INTERCONNECTS FOR MEDIUM-TEMPERATURE (550-650°C) SOLID-OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1007/s11003-021-00534-1
2,3058,We study the evolution of the phase compositions of the composite and the coating in the course of long-term holding in oxidizing media and the changes in the oxidation resistance and electric conductivity observed in the course of this evolution.,LIGHT INTERCONNECTS FOR MEDIUM-TEMPERATURE (550-650°C) SOLID-OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1007/s11003-021-00534-1
3,3058,"It is shown that thin (0.5 mm) titanium interconnects with the indicated coating may serve as an efficient alternative to the interconnects made of the Crofer-type steel, which enables us to avoid the negative influence of chromium on the serviceability of solid-oxide fuel cells and significantly (by similar to 50%) decrease the weight of batteries of these cells.",LIGHT INTERCONNECTS FOR MEDIUM-TEMPERATURE (550-650°C) SOLID-OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1007/s11003-021-00534-1
