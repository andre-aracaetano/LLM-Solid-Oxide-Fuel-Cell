1,5791,Novel gamma-Al2O3 supported nickel (Ni/Al2O3) catalyst was developed as a functional layer for Ni-ScSZ cermet anode operating on methane fuel.,Methane-fueled SOFC with traditional nickel-based anode by applying Ni/Al2O3 as a dual-functional layer,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.11.014
2,5791,"Catalytic tests demonstrated Ni/Al2O3 had high and comparable activity to Ru-CeO2 and much higher activity than the Ni-ScSZ cermet anode for partial oxidation, steam and CO2 reforming of methane to syngas between 750 and 850 degrees C. By adopting Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst layer, the fuel cell demonstrated a peak power density of 382 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, more than two times that without the catalyst layer.",Methane-fueled SOFC with traditional nickel-based anode by applying Ni/Al2O3 as a dual-functional layer,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.11.014
3,5791,"The Ni/Al2O3 also functioned as a diffusion barrier layer to reduce the methane concentration within the anode; consequently, the operation stability was also greatly improved without coke deposition.",Methane-fueled SOFC with traditional nickel-based anode by applying Ni/Al2O3 as a dual-functional layer,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.11.014
