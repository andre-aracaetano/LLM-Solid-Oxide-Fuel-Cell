2,6690,"It is shown that when humid (3% water) hydrogen is supplied to the anode and air is supplied to the cathode, the maximum values of cell's power density are 1.05 and 0.75 W/cm(2) at 900 and 800 degrees C, respectively.","Single SOFC with Supporting Ni-YSZ Anode, Bilayer YSZ/GDC Film Electrolyte, and La2NiO4+δ Cathode",10.1134/S1023193518060101
3,6690,"After the introduction of praseodymium oxide and ceria into the cathode and the anode, respectively, the power density is ca.","Single SOFC with Supporting Ni-YSZ Anode, Bilayer YSZ/GDC Film Electrolyte, and La2NiO4+δ Cathode",10.1134/S1023193518060101

7,6690,The analysis of impedance spectra by the distribution of relaxation times shows that such behavior is associated with the gas-diffusion resistance of the SOFC anode.,"Single SOFC with Supporting Ni-YSZ Anode, Bilayer YSZ/GDC Film Electrolyte, and La2NiO4+δ Cathode",10.1134/S1023193518060101
8,6690,The latter is explained by the low porosity of the anode and the high rate of fuel consumption.,"Single SOFC with Supporting Ni-YSZ Anode, Bilayer YSZ/GDC Film Electrolyte, and La2NiO4+δ Cathode",10.1134/S1023193518060101
