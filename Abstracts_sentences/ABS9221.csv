2,9221,"Thus, it is an excellent catalyst for CO2 dry reforming of CH4.",High-performance direct carbon dioxide-methane solid oxide fuel cell with a structure-engineered double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229199
3,9221,"To use CH4 directly in solid oxide fuel cells, Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.10O1.95 (GDC) anode-supported cells are fabricated with and without a layer of LSCrN@Ni-20 wt% GDC on top of the anode, which are defined as double anode supported cell (DASC) and conventional anode supported cell (CASC), respectively.",High-performance direct carbon dioxide-methane solid oxide fuel cell with a structure-engineered double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229199
4,9221,"They are investigated comparatively by X-ray diffraction, thermal expansion, thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemical performance measurement in H-2 and 50%CO2-50%CH4 fuels.",High-performance direct carbon dioxide-methane solid oxide fuel cell with a structure-engineered double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229199
5,9221,"Both CASC and DASC demonstrate similarly high performance with H-2 fuel, the maximum power density is 856 and 822 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, respectively.",High-performance direct carbon dioxide-methane solid oxide fuel cell with a structure-engineered double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229199
6,9221,"When 50%CO2-50%CH4 is used, DASC outperforms CASC significantly, showing a maximum power density of 758 mW cm(-2) and an on-cell CH4 conversion of 85.5% at 750 degrees C. Also, DASC demonstrates a stable performance, and the cell voltage and CH4 conversion remain unchanged at 0.65 V and 84% without detectable carbon formation in the anode, while those of CASC decrease monotonously from the beginning with observable carbon formation during a test of 36 h under 400 mA cm(-2) at 750 degrees C.",High-performance direct carbon dioxide-methane solid oxide fuel cell with a structure-engineered double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229199
