2,7398,This paper investigates the integration of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with biomass gasification for the production of power and heat (combined heat and power (CHP) system).,Modelling system efficiencies and costs of two biomass-fuelled SOFC systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.004
3,7398,A steady-state model was developed in the gPROMS modelling tool to investigate the integrated system.,Modelling system efficiencies and costs of two biomass-fuelled SOFC systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.004
4,7398,"The system was modelled for two different options, a cold process involving gas cleaning at a reduced temperature and a hot process involving gas cleaning at a high temperature.",Modelling system efficiencies and costs of two biomass-fuelled SOFC systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.004
5,7398,"For each option, the model was used to determine the system efficiency and prospective costs.",Modelling system efficiencies and costs of two biomass-fuelled SOFC systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.004
6,7398,"The electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency for the hot process were found to be 23 and 60% and for the cold process the efficiencies were 21 and 34%, respectively.",Modelling system efficiencies and costs of two biomass-fuelled SOFC systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.004
7,7398,Superior heat management in the gas cleaning stage of the hot process results in its higher system efficiency.,Modelling system efficiencies and costs of two biomass-fuelled SOFC systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.004
