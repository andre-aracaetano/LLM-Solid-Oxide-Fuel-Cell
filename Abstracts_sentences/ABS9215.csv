5,9215,"The area-specific resistances of the SCTy cathodes on the LSGM electrolyte gradually increase from 0.084 Omega cm(2) at y = 0.05 to 0.091 Omega cm(2) at y = 0.20 with increasing Ti content at 750 degrees C. Single-cells that used SCTy cathodes with y = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 on a 300 mu m-thick LSGM electrolyte achieve peak power densities of 793, 608, 525, and 425 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, respectively.",SrCo1-yTiyO3-δ as potential cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.04.025
