2,7487,"Here we report a novel proton conductor derived from Li13.9Sr0.1Zn(GeO4)(4) (LSZG), demonstrating the highest protonic conductivity (0.034 S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C) among all known proton conducting ceramics, which is much higher than those of several well-known oxygen ion conducting electrolytes (e.g., similar to 0.009 and 0.018 S cm(-1), respectively, for zirconia- and ceria-based oxide electrolyte at 600 degrees C).",Promising Proton Conductor for Intermediate-Temperature Fuel Cells: Li13.9Sr0.1Zn(GeO4)4,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b03471
3,7487,"Interestingly, after fully replacing the mobile Li+ ions by H+ through proper ion exchange, the H+ conductivity increases from 0.034 to 0.048 S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C. A simple but effective ab initio molecular dynamics simulation study suggests a unique H+/Li+ transport mechanism: the proton in LSZG moves freely in the Li+ interstitial space within the 3D Li+ transport network (i.e., 4c and 4a sites, as the occupancies of the Li1 and Li2 sites are 55% and 16%, respectively).",Promising Proton Conductor for Intermediate-Temperature Fuel Cells: Li13.9Sr0.1Zn(GeO4)4,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b03471
4,7487,"In particular, a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based on an LSZG electrolyte (similar to 40 mu m thick) demonstrates high open circuit voltage (similar to 1.1 V) and good peak power density (377 mW cm(-2)) at 600 degrees",Promising Proton Conductor for Intermediate-Temperature Fuel Cells: Li13.9Sr0.1Zn(GeO4)4,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b03471

7,7487,"The new transport mechanism and excellent proton conductivity suggest that the LSZG represents an important family of electrolyte materials, which may be used as a proton-conducting membrane for intermediate-temperature SOFCs and hydrogen production or separation.",Promising Proton Conductor for Intermediate-Temperature Fuel Cells: Li13.9Sr0.1Zn(GeO4)4,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b03471
