1,18259,The volatility of borate species from glasses developed for solid oxide fuel cell seals was studied using thermodynamic calculations and compared with experimental results.,Borate volatility from SOFC sealing glasses,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02479.x
2,18259,"Vapor pressure diagrams were used to identify the most volatile compounds under a range of expected operational conditions, e.g. oxidizing and reducing atmospheres with water vapor, at temperatures in the range of 700 degrees-1000 degrees C.",Borate volatility from SOFC sealing glasses,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02479.x
3,18259,"The species with the highest vapor pressures were BO2(g) under dry conditions and B3H3O6(g) under wet, reducing conditions.",Borate volatility from SOFC sealing glasses,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02479.x
4,18259,The depletion of boron from glass surfaces to depths beyond 100 nm was characterized using Auger electron spectroscopy depth profile analysis.,Borate volatility from SOFC sealing glasses,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02479.x
