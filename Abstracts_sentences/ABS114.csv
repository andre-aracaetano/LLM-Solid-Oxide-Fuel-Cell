3,114,"The as-synthesized material was used as symmetrical electrodes, anode and cathode, for the SDC-LiNaCO3 (LNSDC) electrolyte based low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LTSOFCs), achieving a maximum power density of 132 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C. Besides, a single-component fuel cell device was also demonstrated using a mixture of as-prepared LNCZO and ionic conductor LNSDC, and a corresponding peak power output of 155 mW cm(-2) was obtained, suggesting that the hierarchically porous product has high prospective in the single-component fuel cell.",Synthesis of hierarchically porous LiNiCuZn-oxide and its electrochemical performance for low-temperature fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.087
