5,708,"In this regard, three most common types of channel design alterations (changing the width-to-height ratio of rectangular cross-section, changing the cross-sectional shape of the channel, and tapering the channel cross-section toward the channel outlet) are considered.",The impact of gas flow channel design on dynamic performance of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2023.124924
6,708,"The results reveal that decreasing the channel width-to-height ratio, replacing the rectangular cross-section with a triangular one, and converting the straight channel into a tapered one, reduce the power response time by up to 54.2%, 7.1%, and 41.4%, respectively, depending on the operating conditions.",The impact of gas flow channel design on dynamic performance of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2023.124924
7,708,It is also observed that channel tapering is the only channel design alteration that improves both steady and unsteady operations.,The impact of gas flow channel design on dynamic performance of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2023.124924
