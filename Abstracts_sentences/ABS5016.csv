4,5016,The results show that the YSZ layer of the gas permeability comparable to that of fully sintered one can be formed through plasma spraying followed by impregnation densification.,Performance of YSZ electrolyte layer deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying for cermet-supported tubular SOFC,10.1016/j.vacuum.2003.12.096
5,5016,The test cell yielded an OCV of 1.04V and a maximum output power density of 101 mW/cm(2) at 930degreesC. Those results show that the combination of plasma spraying with post-impregnation is a feasible process to fabricate YSZ electrolyte layer used in SOFC.,Performance of YSZ electrolyte layer deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying for cermet-supported tubular SOFC,10.1016/j.vacuum.2003.12.096
