1,16829,"We describe a series of experiments to learn how to produce flat LaSrMnO3/YSZ/NiO-YSZ multilayer packages typically used for solid oxide fuel cells, in a single cosintering cycle, by applying a load during cosintering using sintering arches.",Sintering arches for cosintering camber-free SOFC multilayers,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.02176.x
2,16829,We demonstrate that the key step is to apply the load gradually after the multilayer components are stronger and at their minimum viscosity of similar to 6 GPa.s during sintering.,Sintering arches for cosintering camber-free SOFC multilayers,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.02176.x
3,16829,"Alumina sintering arches, which support an alumina loading plate above the multilayer laminate, were designed to yield slowly at the intermediate stage of cosintering and thus apply the loading plate to the multilayer package.",Sintering arches for cosintering camber-free SOFC multilayers,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.02176.x
