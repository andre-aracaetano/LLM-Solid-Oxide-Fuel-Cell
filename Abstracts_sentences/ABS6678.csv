4,6678,The reaction of methane with the permeated oxygen proceeds at a remarkably fast rate.,Partial oxidation of methane in a Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92-La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-δ hollow fiber membrane reactor targeting solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.06.042
5,6678,"Methane throughput conversion over 90% is attained at 950 degrees C at a high methane feed rate of 14.7 cm(3) CH4 min(-1) cm(-2) membrane surface and oxygen permeation rate 7.9 cm(3) min(-1) cm(-2); the effluent from the reactor is composed mainly of H-2 (53.5%) and CO (35.7%), revealing that the dominating reaction occurring in the reactor is partial oxidation of the methane (POM).",Partial oxidation of methane in a Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92-La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-δ hollow fiber membrane reactor targeting solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.06.042
