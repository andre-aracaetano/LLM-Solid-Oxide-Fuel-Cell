1,20719,"A novel family of metal oxides with a chemical formula of Sr2Ce1-xPrxO4 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1) was developed as mixed oxide ion and electronic conductors for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Thermochemistry of Sr2Ce1-xPrxO4 (x=0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1): Variable-Temperature and -Atmosphere in-situ and ex-situ Powder X-ray Diffraction Studies and Their Physical Properties",10.1021/ic301071x
2,20719,"All of the investigated samples were synthesized by the ceramic method at 1000 degrees C in air and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).","Thermochemistry of Sr2Ce1-xPrxO4 (x=0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1): Variable-Temperature and -Atmosphere in-situ and ex-situ Powder X-ray Diffraction Studies and Their Physical Properties",10.1021/ic301071x
3,20719,Ex-situ PXRD reveals that the Sr2PbO4-type Sr2CeO4 decomposes readily into a mixture of perovskite-type SrCeO3 and rock-salt-type SrO at 1400 degrees C in air.,"Thermochemistry of Sr2Ce1-xPrxO4 (x=0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1): Variable-Temperature and -Atmosphere in-situ and ex-situ Powder X-ray Diffraction Studies and Their Physical Properties",10.1021/ic301071x
4,20719,"Surprisingly, the decomposed products are converted back to the original Sr2PbO4-type Sr2CeO4 phase at 800 degrees C in air, as confirmed by in-situ PXRD.","Thermochemistry of Sr2Ce1-xPrxO4 (x=0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1): Variable-Temperature and -Atmosphere in-situ and ex-situ Powder X-ray Diffraction Studies and Their Physical Properties",10.1021/ic301071x
5,20719,"Thermal decomposition is highly suppressed in Sr2Ce1-xPrxO4 compounds for Pr > 0, suggesting that Pr improves the thermal stability of the compounds.","Thermochemistry of Sr2Ce1-xPrxO4 (x=0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1): Variable-Temperature and -Atmosphere in-situ and ex-situ Powder X-ray Diffraction Studies and Their Physical Properties",10.1021/ic301071x
6,20719,Rietveld analysis of PXRD and SAED supported that both Pr and Ce ions are located on the 2a site in Pbam (space group no. 55).,"Thermochemistry of Sr2Ce1-xPrxO4 (x=0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1): Variable-Temperature and -Atmosphere in-situ and ex-situ Powder X-ray Diffraction Studies and Their Physical Properties",10.1021/ic301071x
7,20719,"The electrical transport mechanism could be correlated to the reduction of Pr and/or Ce ions and subsequent loss of oxide ions at elevated temperatures, as shown by TGA and in-situ PXRD.","Thermochemistry of Sr2Ce1-xPrxO4 (x=0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1): Variable-Temperature and -Atmosphere in-situ and ex-situ Powder X-ray Diffraction Studies and Their Physical Properties",10.1021/ic301071x
