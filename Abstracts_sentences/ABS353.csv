6,353,Our analysis indicates that the most promising pathway to making integrated gasification fuel cell technologies cost-competitive against other forms of low-carbon electricity is co-deployment of solid oxide fuel cell technologies in integrated gasification fuel cell cycle and distributed energy applications to expand the scale of production to a level that benefits both areas.,Prospects for cost-competitive integrated gasification fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116753
7,353,"Other avenues based on system optimization or improvements in fuel cell performance or degradation through materials development can help, but cannot by themselves deliver cost-competitive electricity absent an order of magnitude reduction in the cost of solid oxide fuel cell components.",Prospects for cost-competitive integrated gasification fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116753
