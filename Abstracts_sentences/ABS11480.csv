1,11480,"The combined impact of carbon type (anthracite coal, bituminous coal and pine charcoal) and in situ, catalystaided, carbon gasification process on the electrochemical performance of a Direct Carbon Fuel Cell (DCFC) is explored.",The combined impact of carbon type and catalyst-aided gasification process on the performance of a Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.01.026
2,11480,The effect of operation temperature (700-800 degrees C) and catalyst (Co/CeO2) infusion to carbon feedstock under CO2 atmosphere at the anode chamber is systematically investigated in a cell of the type: Carbon + CO2 vertical bar Cu-CeO2/YSZ/Ag vertical bar Air.,The combined impact of carbon type and catalyst-aided gasification process on the performance of a Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.01.026
3,11480,"All fuel samples were characterized, in terms of chemical composition, crystallite structure (XRD), pore structure (BET), surface morphology (SEM), particle size distribution (PSD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in order to obtain a close relationship between the carbon characteristics and the DCFC performance.",The combined impact of carbon type and catalyst-aided gasification process on the performance of a Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.01.026
4,11480,"The results reveal that in the absence of catalyst, the optimum performance is obtained for the charcoal sample (P-max similar to 12 mW/cm(2)), due to its high volatile matter, oxygen content, porosity and carbon disorder as well as its low amount of impurities.",The combined impact of carbon type and catalyst-aided gasification process on the performance of a Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.01.026
5,11480,"Catalyst infusion to carbon feedstock results in a considerable increase in the achieved cell power density up to 225%, which is more pronounced for the less reactive coals and low temperatures.",The combined impact of carbon type and catalyst-aided gasification process on the performance of a Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.01.026
6,11480,"The enhanced performance obtained by infusing Co/CeO2 catalyst into carbon is ascribed to the positive effect of catalyst on the in situ carbon gasification, through the reverse Boudouard reaction (C + CO2 -> 2CO), and the subsequent faster diffusion and electro-oxidation of formed CO at the anodic three-phase boundary.",The combined impact of carbon type and catalyst-aided gasification process on the performance of a Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.01.026
