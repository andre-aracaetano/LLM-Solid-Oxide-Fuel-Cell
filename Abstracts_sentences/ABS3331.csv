1,3331,The porous cermet of Yb-doped BaZrO3 and nickel (BZYb-Ni) for anode-supported protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) was fabricated by compression molding following the liquid condensation process (LCP).,Pore structure improvement in cermet for anode-supported protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.020
2,3331,The gas permeability of BZYb-Ni produced by LCP (BZYb-Ni-LCP) was greater than that of BZYb-Ni produced by a conventional drying method (BZYb-Ni-CDM) although their porosities were similar.,Pore structure improvement in cermet for anode-supported protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.020
3,3331,"The greater permeability of BZYb-Ni-LCP than that of BZYb-Ni-CDM is consistent with more efficient structures for gas flow; a smaller specific surface area, and a larger critical diameter for pores in BZYb-Ni-LCP than those for pores in BZYb-Ni-CDM.",Pore structure improvement in cermet for anode-supported protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.09.020
