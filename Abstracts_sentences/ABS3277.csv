1,3277,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an all-solid-state chemical power generation device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy in an efficient and environmentally friendly way in medium- and high-temperature environments.,Effects of a cooling channel on the creep damage and failure probability of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.3389/fmats.2023.1238559
2,3277,"However, the thermal stresses and creep damage are inevitably generated at high temperatures, which easily leads to mechanical failure or failure of the whole SOFC stack.",Effects of a cooling channel on the creep damage and failure probability of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.3389/fmats.2023.1238559
3,3277,Reducing the thermal stress generated by the uneven temperature distribution inside the SOFC stack has become a key problem to be solved urgently.,Effects of a cooling channel on the creep damage and failure probability of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.3389/fmats.2023.1238559
4,3277,"In this paper, the thermal stress, creep damage, and failure behavior under their working conditions were analyzed by the finite element method.",Effects of a cooling channel on the creep damage and failure probability of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.3389/fmats.2023.1238559
5,3277,"Then, the cooling channel was proposed to reduce the thermal stress and creep damage.",Effects of a cooling channel on the creep damage and failure probability of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.3389/fmats.2023.1238559
6,3277,The results show that adding the cooling channel to SOFC stack can reduce the creep damage and failure probability.,Effects of a cooling channel on the creep damage and failure probability of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.3389/fmats.2023.1238559
7,3277,"The lower the cooling temperature, the better the cooling effect, and the lower the creep damage and failure probability.",Effects of a cooling channel on the creep damage and failure probability of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.3389/fmats.2023.1238559
