3,4729,"On the one hand, the nickel oxidation quickly arises above 250 degrees C at the anode and usually leads to cells cracks; on the other hand, very fast cooling of the SOFC stack down to 250 degrees C could lead to the thermal shock breakage as a consequence.",SOFC's Anode Protection by Bias Current Application: First Experimental Results on a Short Stack,10.1002/fuce.201600213
4,4729,"Recently, reverse bias current application has been proposed to protect the anode from re-oxidation.",SOFC's Anode Protection by Bias Current Application: First Experimental Results on a Short Stack,10.1002/fuce.201600213
