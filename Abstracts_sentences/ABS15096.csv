1,15096,The improvement of the mechanical properties of novel structured electrolytes with triangular cut off geometry in the active region is presented by filleting the tips of triangles.,Novel electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved mechanical properties,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.103
2,15096,The effect of fillet radius on the bending strength of the yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte was investigated with a commercial finite element code implementing the calculated Weibull stress through the experimental stress strain curve determined via tensile tests.,Novel electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved mechanical properties,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.103
3,15096,The model was verified with the experimental three point bending test results for the electrolyte with unfilleted triangular cut off patterns.,Novel electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved mechanical properties,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.103
4,15096,Ten different fillet radii ranging from 0.05 mm to 0.5 mm were considered in the simulations.,Novel electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved mechanical properties,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.103
5,15096,The fracture displacement was found to increase with increasing fillet radius as expected.,Novel electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved mechanical properties,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.103
6,15096,"Since the electrolyte with fillet radius of 0.5 mm was found to show the highest flexural strength, single cell based on this electrolyte was fabricated and the cell performance was measured.",Novel electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved mechanical properties,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.103
7,15096,It was found that the strength of the novel electrolyte with partly reduced thickness can be increased by 26.2% with sacrificing only 10.2% decrease in the performance.,Novel electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved mechanical properties,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.103
8,15096,"Since the final cell still showed 22.2% higher peak performance than the standard electrolyte supported cell, 10.2% decrease in the cell performance compared to the cell having unfilleted triangular cut off patterns is acceptable.",Novel electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved mechanical properties,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.103
