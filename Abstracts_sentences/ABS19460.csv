4,19460,"In the ex-periments, NiO is found at the Ni-YSZ interfaces in the active layer in both tested fuel cells and electrolyzer cells, despite that the nominal oxygen partial pressure at the hydrogen electrode is well below the thermodynamic threshold for Ni oxidation.","Oxidation of nickel in solid oxide cells during electrochemical operation: Experimental evidence, theoretical analysis, and an alternative hypothesis on the nickel migration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.232991
5,19460,"Due to the volume expansion during Ni oxidation and the outward diffusion nature of NiO growth, Ni oxidation and reduction of NiO back to Ni can cause Ni relocation.","Oxidation of nickel in solid oxide cells during electrochemical operation: Experimental evidence, theoretical analysis, and an alternative hypothesis on the nickel migration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.232991
6,19460,"Thermodynamic analysis shows that the oxygen partial pressure near the Ni-electrolyte interface can be significantly higher than the hydrogen electrode under polarization, which can cause Ni oxidation and concentration increase of the gaseous Ni(OH)2, and the latter accelerates the transport of Ni.","Oxidation of nickel in solid oxide cells during electrochemical operation: Experimental evidence, theoretical analysis, and an alternative hypothesis on the nickel migration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.232991
7,19460,"As such, a new hypothesis for Ni migration in solid oxide cells is proposed in which the interfacial oxidation of Ni plays an essential role.","Oxidation of nickel in solid oxide cells during electrochemical operation: Experimental evidence, theoretical analysis, and an alternative hypothesis on the nickel migration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.232991
