1,6326,"This work adopts solvothermal synthesis to fabricate PtNi nanoparticles as thin film cathodes with superior resistance against thermally driven agglomeration for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) operating at 450 oC. Metal-based porous electrodes are common choices for thin film LT-SOFCs, but pure metals with high density nanoscale porosities are vulnerable to thermal agglomeration, which imposes challenges to maintaining high performance with long-term stability.",Solvothermal Synthesis of PtNi Nanoparticle Thin Film Cathode with Superior Thermal Stability for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00576-7
2,6326,"Typical Pt-based thin film cathodes are previously reported to sustain a record high 600 oC of thermal annealing with acceptable morphological stability, but the temperature is still too low for practical LT-SOFC application.",Solvothermal Synthesis of PtNi Nanoparticle Thin Film Cathode with Superior Thermal Stability for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00576-7
3,6326,"In this work, the solvothermal synthesized PtNi nanoparticle thin films show superior thermal stability, sustaining 10 h of annealing at 800 oC without significant agglomeration observed.",Solvothermal Synthesis of PtNi Nanoparticle Thin Film Cathode with Superior Thermal Stability for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00576-7
4,6326,"By controlling the length of synthesis time, the particle sizes and Pt loading ratio can be varied.",Solvothermal Synthesis of PtNi Nanoparticle Thin Film Cathode with Superior Thermal Stability for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00576-7
5,6326,The cost-effective solvothermal synthesis process for the fabrication of PtNi thin film cathode is a promising way for LT-SOFC manufacturing in scale as it involves no vacuum process like typical sputtering.,Solvothermal Synthesis of PtNi Nanoparticle Thin Film Cathode with Superior Thermal Stability for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00576-7
