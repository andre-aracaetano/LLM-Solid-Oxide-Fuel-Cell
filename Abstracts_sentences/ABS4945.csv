2,4945,"According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD), all samples present single perovskite structures and scanning electron microscope (SEM) results indicate that all samples possess uniform porous structures.","Synthesis and characterization of Sr2Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5-xNbxO6-δ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15) cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s11581-017-2203-x
3,4945,"Additionally, the electrode conductivity is improved by doping Nb on the B' site of SFNi0.1M. From the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results, the ratios of Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mo6+/Mo5+ vary with the Nb content, which leads to the conductivity change of SFNi0.1MNbx materials.","Synthesis and characterization of Sr2Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5-xNbxO6-δ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15) cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s11581-017-2203-x
4,4945,"For all the samples, SFNi0.1MNb0.05 exhibits the best electrochemical performance with the lowest polarization resistance of 0.11 Omega cm(2) and the highest power density of 1260 mW cm(-2) 800 degrees C in humidified H-2.","Synthesis and characterization of Sr2Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5-xNbxO6-δ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15) cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s11581-017-2203-x
5,4945,The results indicate that SFNi0.1MNbx is a promising type of candidate cathode for solid oxide fuel cells.,"Synthesis and characterization of Sr2Fe1.4Ni0.1Mo0.5-xNbxO6-δ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15) cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s11581-017-2203-x
