1,6050,The work is a case study of a cruise ship supplied by liquefied natural gas (LNG) and equipped with a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,A Case Study of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Plant on Board a Cruise Ship,10.1007/s11804-021-00217-y
2,6050,It is supposed that a 20 MW SOFC plant is installed on-board to supply hotel loads and assisting three dual-fuel (DF) diesel/LNG generator sets.,A Case Study of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Plant on Board a Cruise Ship,10.1007/s11804-021-00217-y
3,6050,LNG consumption and emissions are estimated both for the SOFC plant and DF generator sets.,A Case Study of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Plant on Board a Cruise Ship,10.1007/s11804-021-00217-y
4,6050,"It results that the use of LNG-SOFC plant in comparison to DF generator sets allows to limit significantly the SOx, CO, NOx, PM emissions and to reduce the emission of CO2 by about 11%.",A Case Study of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Plant on Board a Cruise Ship,10.1007/s11804-021-00217-y
5,6050,"A prediction of the weight and volume of the SOFC plant is conducted and a preliminary modification of the general arrangement of the cruise ship is suggested, according to the latest international rules.",A Case Study of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Plant on Board a Cruise Ship,10.1007/s11804-021-00217-y
6,6050,"It results that the SOFC plant is heavier and occupies more volume on board than a DF gen-set; nevertheless, these features do not affect the floating and the stability of the cruise ship.",A Case Study of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Plant on Board a Cruise Ship,10.1007/s11804-021-00217-y
