2,4822,"In this study, three PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5 double perovskites with different dopings of La, Pr, Sm, Gd, Nd, Y elements in A-site, high-entropy oxides (HEOs) cathodes are successfully prepared by EDTA-citrate combustion method and used as potential cathodes for SOFC at intermediate temperature.",Novel high entropy double pervoskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172102
3,4822,Three HEOs cathodes all form single phase double perovskite structure and match chemically well with Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta(GDC) electrolyte.,Novel high entropy double pervoskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172102
4,4822,"Linear thermal expansion coefficient of (La0.2Pr0.2Sm0.2Gd0.2Nd0.2) Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5(LPSGNBSCF) at 200-1000 degrees C range is found to be moderate, 18.39 x 10-6 K-1.",Novel high entropy double pervoskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172102
5,4822,Typical anode supported SOFC with LPSGNBSCF cathode exhibits an excellent output performance of 1000 mW cm-2 with a lower polarization resistance of 0.3 omega cm2 at 800 degrees C. These results might suggest that LPSGNBSCF can be a potential excellent cathode for SOFC.,Novel high entropy double pervoskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172102
