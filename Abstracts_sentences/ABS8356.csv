2,8356,"In the first case, a straight Ni wire was inserted within the hole of the cell before the electrochemical testing, and in the second case, a coil integrated-current collector within the anode layer was already arranged for electrical connections during cell processing.",Comparative Performance Analysis of Anode-Supported Micro-Tubular SOFCs with Different Current-Collection Architectures,10.1002/fuce.201300010
3,8356,The current produced in each case was collected from double terminal and the performance of the cells was estimated by electrochemical I-V characterization.,Comparative Performance Analysis of Anode-Supported Micro-Tubular SOFCs with Different Current-Collection Architectures,10.1002/fuce.201300010
4,8356,"The maximum power outputs generated in the cells with the integrated-current collector and the common current-collection architectures were of approximate to 200 and approximate to 55mWcm(-2), respectively at 800 degrees C under a wet H-2 fuel flow.",Comparative Performance Analysis of Anode-Supported Micro-Tubular SOFCs with Different Current-Collection Architectures,10.1002/fuce.201300010
