1,3519,Ni impregnated 430L anodes used for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells are prepared and evaluated.,Evaluation of Ni and Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ (SDC) impregnated 430L anodes for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.05.087
2,3519,The effects of catalysts loadings and heat treatment temperatures on the anode polarization resistances are investigated.,Evaluation of Ni and Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ (SDC) impregnated 430L anodes for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.05.087
3,3519,The stabilities of the Ni impregnated 430L anodes are also measured and increasing the calcination temperature can enable a much more stable anode performance.,Evaluation of Ni and Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ (SDC) impregnated 430L anodes for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.05.087
4,3519,"Furthermore, by applying the Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) impregnated 430L composite anode, a low polarization resistance of 0.12 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C is obtained.",Evaluation of Ni and Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ (SDC) impregnated 430L anodes for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.05.087
5,3519,The 1200 h durability test shows that the polarization resistance of the composite anode increases from 0.12 Omega cm(2) to 0.3 Omega cm(2) during the initial 500 h while no degradation is found during the subsequent measurement.,Evaluation of Ni and Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ (SDC) impregnated 430L anodes for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.05.087
