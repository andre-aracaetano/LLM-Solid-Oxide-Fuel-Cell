1,3512,"Y-doped BaZrO3 (BZY) electrolyte films are successfully fabricated by utilizing the driving force from the anode substrate, aiming to circumvent the refractory nature of BZY materials.",Proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Y-doped BaZrO3 electrolyte,10.1016/j.elecom.2017.05.006
2,3512,"The BZY electrolyte film on the high shrinkage anode becomes dense after sintering even though no sintering aid is added, while the BZY electrolyte remains porous on the conventional anode substrate after the same treatment.",Proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Y-doped BaZrO3 electrolyte,10.1016/j.elecom.2017.05.006
3,3512,"The resulting BZY electrolyte shows a high conductivity of 4.5 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C, which is 2 to 20 times higher than that for most of BZY electrolyte films in previous reports.",Proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Y-doped BaZrO3 electrolyte,10.1016/j.elecom.2017.05.006
4,3512,"In addition, the fuel cell with this BZY electrolyte generates a high power output of 267 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C. These results suggest the strategy presented in this study provides a promising way to prepare BZY electrolyte films for fuel cell applications.",Proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Y-doped BaZrO3 electrolyte,10.1016/j.elecom.2017.05.006
