3,11800,Casting and annealing of completely transparent and amorphous glasses within this system has been possible only at an optimum BaO content of 25 mol% without any La2O3 and Al2O3.,Effect of BaO addition on magnesium lanthanum alumino borosilicate-based glass-ceramic sealant for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.10.006
4,11800,"On further optimization of the developed glasses in terms of different borosilicate ratios, one of the developed compositions having MgO and BaO content of 22 and 25 mol% respectively, with a glass former ratio of 3 (SiO2:B2O3) has been found to be quite promising in terms of its mechanical property, excellent joining, minimum chemical interaction and lowest leak-rate with the metallic interconnect such as Crofer22APU, and thus fulfills the major requirements for SOFC sealing application.",Effect of BaO addition on magnesium lanthanum alumino borosilicate-based glass-ceramic sealant for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.10.006
