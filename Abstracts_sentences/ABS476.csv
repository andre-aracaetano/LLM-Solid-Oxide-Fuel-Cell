1,476,We report the effect of a catalytic layer on a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOK) anode surface on the fuel cell performance.,Application of catalytic layer on solid oxide fuel cell anode surface,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.11.016
2,476,A Ru/CeO2 catalytic layer has been applied on the anode surface and tested in the operating temperature of 650 and 700 degrees C. It has shown that application of the catalytic layer on the anode surface improves the cell performance especially at high fuel utilization condition.,Application of catalytic layer on solid oxide fuel cell anode surface,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.11.016
3,476,The energy efficiency at 0.7 V operating voltage has reached over 40% (WV) below 700 degrees C operating temperature in flowing 20% H-2-Ar fuel at the power density of over 0.5W cm(-2).,Application of catalytic layer on solid oxide fuel cell anode surface,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.11.016
