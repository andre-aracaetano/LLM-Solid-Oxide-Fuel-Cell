3,17923,Three adsorbents of different nature were tested for octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) removal and silica gel (SG) proved to be the most efficient.,Adsorption of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane on silica gel for biogas purification,10.1016/j.fuel.2014.06.058
4,17923,It was shown that SG adsorption capacity is in the order of 250 mg(D4)/gSG and the adsorbent bed height has little influence on this adsorption capacity.,Adsorption of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane on silica gel for biogas purification,10.1016/j.fuel.2014.06.058
