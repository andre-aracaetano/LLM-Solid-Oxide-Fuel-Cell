1,4778,"Here, Sm1-xCaxBaCo2O5+delta (x = 0-0.4; SCBC) oxygen-deficient perovskites were synthesized by a sol-gel method and studied as potential novel cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Effect of calcium doping on Sm1-xCaxBaCo2O5+δ cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.138830
2,4778,"As an effective doping strategy, partial substitution of Ca for Sm in SmBaCo2O5+delta could reduce the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and improve the conductivity and catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).",Effect of calcium doping on Sm1-xCaxBaCo2O5+δ cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.138830
3,4778,The x = 0-0.2 samples obtained after sintering at 1100 degrees C crystallized in an orthorhombic structure with the space group Pmmm and had good chemical compatibility with CeO2-based electrolytes at 1000 degrees C for 10 h. The TECs of the SCBC samples decreased from 20.2 x 10(-6) K-1 (x = 0) to 17.7 x 10(-6) K-1 (x = 0.2).,Effect of calcium doping on Sm1-xCaxBaCo2O5+δ cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.138830
4,4778,"The area-specific resistances (ASRs) of the x = 0-0.4 cathodes were 0.163, 0.114, 0.075, and 0.090 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Additionally, the x = 0.2 cathode showed good electrochemical stability in a CO2 -containing atmosphere.",Effect of calcium doping on Sm1-xCaxBaCo2O5+δ cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.138830
