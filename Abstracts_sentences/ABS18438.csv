1,18438,"This work focuses on the evolution of the morphology and structure of La2NiO4 (namely, LNO) coatings deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering (RMS) with subsequent annealing processes.",Morphological Evolution of La2NiO4 Coatings Synthesized by Reactive Magnetron Sputtering (RMS) at High Pressure as Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC),10.3390/coatings13061113
2,18438,"The LNO coatings start to crystallize at 600 & DEG;C, and the LNO with K2NiF4 structure was formed at 700 & DEG;C. A small amount of La3Ni2O7 appeared in the La2NiO4 coatings at 1100 & DEG;C. Interestingly, the LNO coatings realize the transformation from dense to different porous morphologies due to the annealing process.",Morphological Evolution of La2NiO4 Coatings Synthesized by Reactive Magnetron Sputtering (RMS) at High Pressure as Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC),10.3390/coatings13061113
3,18438,The LNO coating with abundant pores was formed after annealing treatment at 1000 & DEG;C for 2 h. This porous morphology can be stably maintained after short-term thermal stability experiments at 750 & DEG;C for 120 h.,Morphological Evolution of La2NiO4 Coatings Synthesized by Reactive Magnetron Sputtering (RMS) at High Pressure as Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC),10.3390/coatings13061113
4,18438,The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement of the LNO/YSZ/LNO symmetrical half-cells shows that the LNO cathode coating after annealing at 1000 & DEG;C for 2 h exhibits lower polarization resistance (R-pol) and activation energy.,Morphological Evolution of La2NiO4 Coatings Synthesized by Reactive Magnetron Sputtering (RMS) at High Pressure as Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC),10.3390/coatings13061113
