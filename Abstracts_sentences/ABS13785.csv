4,13785,"The conductivity of LSCFSc cathode material decreases with the Sc3+ doping, and the conductivity of LSCFSc0.08 cathode sample is still greater than 100 S/cm in the temperature range of 300-800 degrees C. XPS results show that Sc3+ doping increases the content of adsorbed oxygen (O-Ads) on the surface of LSCFSc cathode material, and the R-ASR of polarization surface of LSCFSc0.08 cathode material measured at 800 degrees C is 0.026 ohm center dot cm(2), which is about 87.7% lower than R-ASR of LSCF cathode material, which significantly improves the adsorption/dissociation ability of LSCFSc cathode material to oxygen, and enhances the catalytic activity of oxygen.",Crystal Structure and Electrochemical Performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8-xScxO3-δ Cathode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
