4,7035,This feature allows the model to reproduce the dependence of electrode thickness and oxygen partial pressure on polarization resistance in the range 600-850 degrees C.,Morphological and electrochemical modeling of SOFC composite cathodes with distributed porosity,10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.034
5,7035,"It is found that for cathodes made of strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), the exchange current, which represents the kinetic constant of the oxygen reduction reaction, follows an Arrhenius behavior with respect to the temperature and it is dependent on the square root of the oxygen partial pressure.",Morphological and electrochemical modeling of SOFC composite cathodes with distributed porosity,10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.034
