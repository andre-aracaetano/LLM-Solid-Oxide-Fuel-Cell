1,9858,"We describe the preparation, electrochemical and structural properties of the thin film Y-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ), of interest for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) at an operating temperature of 800 degreesC. Thin films of YSZ were prepared by reactive sputtering deposition of Zr-Y targets in Ar-O-2 mixture atmospheres.",Electrical and microstructural investigations of cermet anode/YSZ thin film systems,10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00131-5
2,9858,"The thickness of the YSZ film, deposited onto the porous NiO-YSZ substrates, is approximately 8 mum.",Electrical and microstructural investigations of cermet anode/YSZ thin film systems,10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00131-5
3,9858,The microstructure of the YSZ film was investigated using scanning electron microscope.,Electrical and microstructural investigations of cermet anode/YSZ thin film systems,10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00131-5
4,9858,The electrochemical properties of a thin film cell Ag/NiO-YSZ/YSZ/Ag were studied using impedance spectroscopy.,Electrical and microstructural investigations of cermet anode/YSZ thin film systems,10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00131-5
5,9858,The electrolyte and electrode (substrate) resistances were measured under different atmospheres as a function of temperature.,Electrical and microstructural investigations of cermet anode/YSZ thin film systems,10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00131-5
6,9858,Above 600 degreesC the ohmic resistance of the cermet electrode (substrate) is comparable to the ionic resistance of the solid electrolyte.,Electrical and microstructural investigations of cermet anode/YSZ thin film systems,10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00131-5
