5,12794,"We identify two classes of particles: those transferring more current than average, which show 10-40% more particle-particle contacts, and those producing more current than average, characterized by similar to 2.5 times larger three-phase boundary length per unit volume.",A novel approach for the quantification of inhomogeneous 3D current distribution in fuel cell electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.029
6,12794,"These two classes of particles are mutually exclusive, which implies that up to the 30% of the electrode volume within the functional layer is underutilized.",A novel approach for the quantification of inhomogeneous 3D current distribution in fuel cell electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.029
