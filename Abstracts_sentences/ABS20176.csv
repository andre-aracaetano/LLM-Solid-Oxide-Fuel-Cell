1,20176,"This paper reports on medium term tests of anode-supported five-cell short stacks, as well as on some separate anode development.","Ageing of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell stacks including thermal cycling, and expansion behaviour of MgO-NiO anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.006
2,20176,"Two stacks were operated under steady-state conditions: one with unprotected metal interconnects, H-2 fuel and 0.35 A cm(-2) (40% fuel utilisation) polarisation current showed an average cell voltage degradation of 56 mV per 1000 h for 2750 h; one with coated metal interconnects, synthetic reformate fuel and 0.5 A cm(-2) (60% fuel utilisation) polarisation current showed an averaged cell voltage degradation slope of 6.6 mV per 1000 h for 800 h before a power cut prematurely interrupted the test.","Ageing of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell stacks including thermal cycling, and expansion behaviour of MgO-NiO anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.006
3,20176,"A third stack was subjected to 13 complete thermal cycles over 1000 h, average cell voltage degradation was evaluated to -2 mV per cycle for operation at 0.3 A cm(-2), open circuit voltage (OCV) remained stable, whereas area specific resistance (ASR) increase amounted on average to 0.008 Omega cm(2) per cycle.","Ageing of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell stacks including thermal cycling, and expansion behaviour of MgO-NiO anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.006
4,20176,"To improve anode reoxidation tolerance, MgO addition was considered.","Ageing of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell stacks including thermal cycling, and expansion behaviour of MgO-NiO anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.006
5,20176,"(Mg, Ni)O solid solutions were synthesized from MgO and NiO powders at 1500 degrees C for 2 h in air.","Ageing of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell stacks including thermal cycling, and expansion behaviour of MgO-NiO anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.006
6,20176,"Samples were reduced at 1000 degrees C in 4 vol% H-2 in N-2, and their expansion behaviour was observed.","Ageing of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell stacks including thermal cycling, and expansion behaviour of MgO-NiO anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.006
7,20176,"XRD and SEM/EDX analysis suggested that the expansion was caused by the segregation of Ni particles between (Mg, Ni)O grains.","Ageing of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell stacks including thermal cycling, and expansion behaviour of MgO-NiO anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.006
