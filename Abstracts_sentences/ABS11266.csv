1,11266,The effect of nickel oxide addition on the sintering behavior and electrical properties of BaZr(0.1)Ce(0.7)Y(0.1)Yb(0.1)O(3-delta) (BZCYYb) as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells was systematically studied.,Enhanced sinterability of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ by addition of nickel oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.047
2,11266,Results suggest that the addition of a small amount (similar to 1 wt%) of NiO to BZCYYb greatly promoted densification achieving similar to 96% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1350 degrees C in air for 3 h (reducing the sintering 'temperature by similar to 200 degrees C).,Enhanced sinterability of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ by addition of nickel oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.047
3,11266,"Further, a sample sintered at 1450 degrees C for 3 h showed high open circuit voltages (OCVs) when used as the electrolyte membrane to separate the two electrodes under typical SOFC operating conditions, indicating that the electrical conductivity of the electrical conductivity of the BZCYYb was not adversely affected by the addition of similar to 1 wt% NiO.
