1,10639,"Protective Cu-Ni-Mn-O spinel coatings on UNS430 solid oxide fuel cells interconnects were formed by oxidizing electroplated nickel, copper, and manganese in air at 800 degrees C. Nickel prevented delamination and buckling damage of the coatings.",Nickel substituted CuMn2O4 spinel coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.075
2,10639,Substituting copper with nickel up to 40% in CuMn2O4 spinel decreased conductivity slightly from similar to 110 to similar to 95 S/cm at 800 degrees C. XRD showed Cu0.77Ni0.45Mn1.78O4 exhibited predominantly spinel phase,Nickel substituted CuMn2O4 spinel coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.075
