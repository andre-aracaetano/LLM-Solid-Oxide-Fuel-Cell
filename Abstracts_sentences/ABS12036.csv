1,12036,An entire active region of an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell was structurally analyzed by X-ray computed nano-tomography using full-field transmission X-ray microscopy (NANO-TXM).,Three-dimensional reconstruction and analysis of an entire solid oxide fuel cell by full-field transmission X-ray microscopy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.060
2,12036,"A total three-dimensional volume of similar to 38,500 mu m(3) was imaged, from which Ni-YSZ anode functional layer (similar to 3650 mu m(3)) and LSM-YSZ cathode functional layer (similar to 4100 mu m(3)) volumes were reconstructed.",Three-dimensional reconstruction and analysis of an entire solid oxide fuel cell by full-field transmission X-ray microscopy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.060
