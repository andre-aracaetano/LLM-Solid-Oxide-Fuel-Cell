1,1898,"The kinetics of steam reforming of methane was determined on a Ni-YSZ anode, which we refer to as anode 'A' and on a Ni-YSZ anode modified by the addition of a basic compound, which we refer to as anode 'B'.",Kinetics of internal steam reforming of methane on Ni/YSZ-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0920-5861(00)00494-6
2,1898,A salient feature of our work is that the data were collected on 50 mum thick anodes screen-printed on 110 mum thick YSZ electrolytes and the experiments were carried out in a fuel cell configuration.,Kinetics of internal steam reforming of methane on Ni/YSZ-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0920-5861(00)00494-6
3,1898,Orders in methane and steam were both higher on the modified Ni-YSZ anode.,Kinetics of internal steam reforming of methane on Ni/YSZ-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0920-5861(00)00494-6
4,1898,Activation energy was also higher on this anode suggesting different nature of sites in the two anodes.,Kinetics of internal steam reforming of methane on Ni/YSZ-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0920-5861(00)00494-6
5,1898,In the present study we have attempted to generate kinetic data at steam/carbon ratios which are economically attractive for fuel cell operation.,Kinetics of internal steam reforming of methane on Ni/YSZ-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0920-5861(00)00494-6
