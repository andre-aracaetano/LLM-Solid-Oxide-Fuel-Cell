1,10019,The fabrication and electrochemical activity of a type of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode is described in this paper.,Gd0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ:: A novel type of SOFC cathode,10.1149/1.2743140
2,10019,In search of new cathodes a Gd0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta compound was synthesized using the glycine-nitrate method.,Gd0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ:: A novel type of SOFC cathode,10.1149/1.2743140
3,10019,"It turned out that this was a two-phase compound consisting of two perovskite phases, a cubic and an orthorhombic phase, as shown by Rietveld refinements.",Gd0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ:: A novel type of SOFC cathode,10.1149/1.2743140
4,10019,These two phases were synthesized and a cone-shaped electrode study was undertaken.,Gd0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ:: A novel type of SOFC cathode,10.1149/1.2743140
5,10019,"It was shown that the composite cathode had an electrochemical activity superior to that of the two single-phase perovskites, indicating that the unique microstructure of this type of cathode is essential for achieving high electrochemical activity toward the reduction of oxygen in a SOFC.",Gd0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ:: A novel type of SOFC cathode,10.1149/1.2743140
