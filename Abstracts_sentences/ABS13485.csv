4,13485,"Commercial anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (Ni/YSZ composite anodes, YSZ electrolytes) were exposed to a synthetic coal syngas mixture (H(2), H(2)O, CO, and CO(2)) at a constant current and their performance evaluated periodically with electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, and polarization curves).",In situ Van der Pauw measurements of the Ni/YSZ anode during exposure to syngas with phosphine contaminant,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.071

11,13485,"Based on these observations, the effect of 10ppm phosphine impurity (or its reaction products with coal syngas) is assigned to the loss of performance of the Ni/YSZ active layer next to the electrolyte, and not to any changes in the thick Ni/YSZ support layer.",In situ Van der Pauw measurements of the Ni/YSZ anode during exposure to syngas with phosphine contaminant,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.071
