2,20490,"Their physico-chemical properties were evaluated by structural (XRD), transport (electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient), and high temperature oxygen nonstoichiometry measurements (TG, delta).","Physico-chemical properties of Ln0.5A0.5Co0.5Fe0.5O3-δ (Ln: La, Sm; A: Sr, Ba) cathode materials and their performance in electrolyte-supported Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.063
3,20490,"A distorted perovskite structure was observed for all of the samples, varying with A-site average radius of cations and tolerance factor t. TG measurements, which were performed in air and in reducing atmosphere allowed to determine the initial, as well as the high temperature dependence of the oxygen nonstoichiometry delta for all materials.","Physico-chemical properties of Ln0.5A0.5Co0.5Fe0.5O3-δ (Ln: La, Sm; A: Sr, Ba) cathode materials and their performance in electrolyte-supported Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.063
4,20490,At high temperatures the electrical conductivity of the measured samples showed a characteristic maximum and corresponding increase of the Seebeck coefficient.,"Physico-chemical properties of Ln0.5A0.5Co0.5Fe0.5O3-δ (Ln: La, Sm; A: Sr, Ba) cathode materials and their performance in electrolyte-supported Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.063
5,20490,Both effects can be interpreted as a result of a formation of the oxygen vacancies.,"Physico-chemical properties of Ln0.5A0.5Co0.5Fe0.5O3-δ (Ln: La, Sm; A: Sr, Ba) cathode materials and their performance in electrolyte-supported Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.063
6,20490,"Apart from Sm0.5Ba0.5Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta composition, all other materials possess very high electrical conductivity at high temperatures, well exceeding 100 S cm(-1).","Physico-chemical properties of Ln0.5A0.5Co0.5Fe0.5O3-δ (Ln: La, Sm; A: Sr, Ba) cathode materials and their performance in electrolyte-supported Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.063
