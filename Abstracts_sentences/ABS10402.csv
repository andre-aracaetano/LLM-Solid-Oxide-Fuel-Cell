2,10402,"The overpotential was greatly decreased by loading only a small amount of Ru microcrystals onto the mixed conducting oxide, samaria-doped ceria (SDC), anode layer in both synthetic gas and wet hydrogen atmospheres.",High-performance electrode for medium-temperature operating solid oxide fuel cells - Polarization property of ceria-based anode with highly dispersed ruthenium catalysts in (H-2+CO2+H2O) gas,10.1149/1.1836703
3,10402,It was found that the Ru-SDC anode exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activities at an optimum oxygen partial pressure in the fuel gas due to high conductivities of both electrons and oxide ions in the SDC.,High-performance electrode for medium-temperature operating solid oxide fuel cells - Polarization property of ceria-based anode with highly dispersed ruthenium catalysts in (H-2+CO2+H2O) gas,10.1149/1.1836703
4,10402,"The maximum current density on the Ru-SDC anode exceeded 1 A/cm(2) at all the operating temperatures between 800 and 1000 degrees C at the potential of -0.9 V vs. air reference electrode, when 0.1 mg/cm(2) of Ru micro-catalysts were loaded on the SDC surface and the appropriate fuel gas was used.",High-performance electrode for medium-temperature operating solid oxide fuel cells - Polarization property of ceria-based anode with highly dispersed ruthenium catalysts in (H-2+CO2+H2O) gas,10.1149/1.1836703
