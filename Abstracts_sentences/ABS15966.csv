1,15966,The impact of a nanostructured Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) anode on low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC) performance is investigated.,Impact of nanostructured anode on low-temperature performance of thin-film-based anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.055
2,15966,"By modifying processing techniques for the anode support, anode-supported SOFCs based on thin-film (similar to 1 mu m) electrolytes (TF-SOFCs) with and without the nanostructured Ni-YSZ (grain size similar to 100 nm) anode are fabricated and a direct comparison of the TF-SOFCs to reveal the role of the nanostructured anode at low temperature is made.",Impact of nanostructured anode on low-temperature performance of thin-film-based anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.055
3,15966,"The cell performance of the nanostructured Ni-YSZ anode significantly increases as compared to that of the cell without it, especially at low temperatures (500 degrees C).",Impact of nanostructured anode on low-temperature performance of thin-film-based anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.055
4,15966,The electrochemical analyses confirm that increasing the triple-phase boundary (TPB) density near the electrolyte and anode interface by the particle-size reduction of the anode increases the number of sites available for charge transfer.,Impact of nanostructured anode on low-temperature performance of thin-film-based anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.055
5,15966,"Thus, the nanostructured anode not only secures the structural integrity of the thin-film components over it, it is also essential for lowering the operating temperature of the TF-SOFC.",Impact of nanostructured anode on low-temperature performance of thin-film-based anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.055
6,15966,"Although it is widely considered that the cathode is the main factor that determines the performance of LT-SOFCs, this study directly proves that anode performance also significantly affects the low-temperature performance.",Impact of nanostructured anode on low-temperature performance of thin-film-based anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.055
