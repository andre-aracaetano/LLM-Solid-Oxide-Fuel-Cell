2,4501,The method advocates using an improved design of a newly defined cat and mouse optimizer to find unknown parameters with the minimum sum of squared error (SSE) between experimental data and the results obtained from our constructed model.,System identification of solid oxide fuel cell models using improved version of cat and mouse optimizer,10.1080/15567036.2023.2186539
3,4501,"The technique is then applied to a studied case, and sensitivity evaluation based on pressure and temperature changes is used for its authentication.",System identification of solid oxide fuel cell models using improved version of cat and mouse optimizer,10.1080/15567036.2023.2186539
4,4501,The method is then put in comparison with several other latest techniques to show its better effectiveness to deliver the highest confirmation with the experimental data.,System identification of solid oxide fuel cell models using improved version of cat and mouse optimizer,10.1080/15567036.2023.2186539
5,4501,"Sensitivity analysis showed that during temperature variation in 562.71 degrees C, 650.81 degrees C, 697.79 degrees C, 747.87 degrees C, and 780.80 degrees C, the proposed method provides the minimum SSE, which are 9.53e-3, 6.95e-3, 5.53e-3, 5.08e-4, and 4.29e-4, respectively.",System identification of solid oxide fuel cell models using improved version of cat and mouse optimizer,10.1080/15567036.2023.2186539
6,4501,"Also, pressure variations from 1 atm to 5 atm by the proposed method, with 4.05e-3, 3.37e-3, 2.76e-3, 1.95e-3, and 1.62e-3, respectively, provides the minimum SSE.",System identification of solid oxide fuel cell models using improved version of cat and mouse optimizer,10.1080/15567036.2023.2186539
