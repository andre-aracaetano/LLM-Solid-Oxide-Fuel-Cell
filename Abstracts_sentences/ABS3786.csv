2,3786,A laboratory-sized Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC)-based tri-layer cell of NiO-SDC/SDC/GBCF was tested under intermediate-temperature conditions of 550-650 degrees C with humidified H-2 (similar to 3% H2O) as a fuel and the static ambient air as oxidant.,Layered perovskite GdBaCoFeO5+x as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.02.031
3,3786,"A maximal power density of 746 mW cm(-2) was achieved at 650 C. The interfacial polarization resistance was as low as 0.42, 0.18 and 0.11 Omega cm(2) at 550, 600 and 650 degrees C, respectively.",Layered perovskite GdBaCoFeO5+x as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.02.031
