1,15868,Natural gas appears to be a fuel of great interest for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems.,Modeling of a solid oxide fuel cell fueled by methane: Analysis of carbon deposition,10.1115/1.2759504
2,15868,"It mainly consists of methane, which can be converted into hydrogen by direct internal reforming (DIR) within the SOFC anode.",Modeling of a solid oxide fuel cell fueled by methane: Analysis of carbon deposition,10.1115/1.2759504
3,15868,However a major limitation to DIR is carbon formation within the ceramic layers at intermediate temperatures.,Modeling of a solid oxide fuel cell fueled by methane: Analysis of carbon deposition,10.1115/1.2759504
4,15868,This paper proposes a model solution using the CFD-ACE software package to simulate the behavior of a tubular SOFC,Modeling of a solid oxide fuel cell fueled by methane: Analysis of carbon deposition,10.1115/1.2759504
5,15868,A detailed thermodynamic analysis is carried out to predict the boundary of carbon formation for SOFCs fueled by methane.,Modeling of a solid oxide fuel cell fueled by methane: Analysis of carbon deposition,10.1115/1.2759504
6,15868,Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations that take into account Boudouard and methane cracking reactions allow us to investigate the occurrence of carbon formation.,Modeling of a solid oxide fuel cell fueled by methane: Analysis of carbon deposition,10.1115/1.2759504
7,15868,"This possibility is discussed from the values of driving forces for carbon deposition defined as alpha= P-CO2/(KBPCO2) and beta P-H2(2)/(KCPCH4), from the equilibrium constants K-B and K-C of the Boudouard and cracking reactions, and from the partial pressure Pi of species i. Simulations allow the calculation of the distributions of partial pressures for all the gas species (CH4, H-2, CO, CO2, and H2O), current densities, and potentials of both electronic and ionic phases within the anode part (i.e., gas channel and Cermet anode).",Modeling of a solid oxide fuel cell fueled by methane: Analysis of carbon deposition,10.1115/1.2759504
8,15868,"Finally, a mapping of alpha and beta values enables us to predict the predominant zones where carbon formation is favorable (alpha or beta< 1) or unfavorable (alpha or 1) according to the calculation based on thermodynamic equilibrium.",Modeling of a solid oxide fuel cell fueled by methane: Analysis of carbon deposition,10.1115/1.2759504
9,15868,"With regard to the values of these different coefficients, we can say that a carbon formation can be supposed for temperature less than 800 degrees C and for ratios X-H2O/X-CH4 smaller than 1.",Modeling of a solid oxide fuel cell fueled by methane: Analysis of carbon deposition,10.1115/1.2759504
