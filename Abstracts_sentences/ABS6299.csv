2,6299,"There is a strong incentive to reduce the operating temperature in solid oxide fuel cells, from 800 degrees C to 500 degrees C.",Synthesis and Electrical Behavior of Sodium Doped Monoclinic SrSiO3,10.48084/etasr.5893
3,6299,"The use of low-cost Na+ instead of K+ as dopant in monoclinic SrSiO3 offers a wider solid solution range (0.1< 0.5) in Sr1-xNaxSiO3-delta and obtains an oxide ion conductivity of 10(-2) Scm(-1) at 600 degrees C, reducing the temperature of a smooth transition to full impairment of mobile oxide ions.",Synthesis and Electrical Behavior of Sodium Doped Monoclinic SrSiO3,10.48084/etasr.5893
4,6299,"For electrochemical characterization, the flat surfaces of the pellets were pasted with silver (Ag) paste and then sintered at 1200 degrees C for 24 hours.",Synthesis and Electrical Behavior of Sodium Doped Monoclinic SrSiO3,10.48084/etasr.5893

6,6299,"Crystallization of Na2Si2O5 from glass was obtained in single-step calcination at 850 degrees C after synthesis in an acetone medium, resulting in the highest conductivity.",Synthesis and Electrical Behavior of Sodium Doped Monoclinic SrSiO3,10.48084/etasr.5893
7,6299,"Although double calcination reduced conductivity, it improved thermal stability.",Synthesis and Electrical Behavior of Sodium Doped Monoclinic SrSiO3,10.48084/etasr.5893
8,6299,"Due to its low activation energy and lack of crystallization of other silicates, this material showed maximum conductivity after long-standing maturity at 600 degrees C. Ethanol was used in place of acetone for powder assimilation and double calcination was also performed.",Synthesis and Electrical Behavior of Sodium Doped Monoclinic SrSiO3,10.48084/etasr.5893
