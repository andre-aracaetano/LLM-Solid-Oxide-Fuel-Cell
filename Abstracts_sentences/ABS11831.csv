1,11831,We report a correlation between the microstructure of the anode electrode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and its electrochemical performance for a tubular design.,Impact of Anode Microstructure on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1126/science.1176404
2,11831,It was shown that the electrochemical performance of the cell was extensively improved when the size of constituent particles was reduced so as to yield a highly porous microstructure.,Impact of Anode Microstructure on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1126/science.1176404
3,11831,"The SOFC had a power density of greater than 1 watt per square centimeter at an operating temperature as low as 600 degrees C with a conventional zirconia-based electrolyte, a nickel cermet anode, and a lanthanum ferrite perovskite cathode material.",Impact of Anode Microstructure on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1126/science.1176404
4,11831,The effect of the hydrogen fuel flow rate (linear velocity) was also examined for the optimization of operating conditions.,Impact of Anode Microstructure on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1126/science.1176404
5,11831,Higher linear fuel velocity led to better cell performance for the cell with higher anode porosity.,Impact of Anode Microstructure on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1126/science.1176404
6,11831,A zirconia-based cell could be used for a low-temperature SOFC system under 600 degrees C just by optimizing the microstructure of the anode electrode and operating conditions.,Impact of Anode Microstructure on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1126/science.1176404
