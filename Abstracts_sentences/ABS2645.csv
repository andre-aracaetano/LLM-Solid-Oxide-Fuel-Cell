1,2645,Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on complex-perovskite structured Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-delta (BCN18) proton-conducting electrolyte membranes have been successfully fabricated by a novel two-step co-sintering method.,Two-step co-sintering method to fabricate anode-supported Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-δ proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.009
2,2645,"BCN18 has been reported to have excellent chemical stability against H2O and CO2, but is relatively difficult to densify.",Two-step co-sintering method to fabricate anode-supported Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-δ proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.009
3,2645,"In this study, dense BCN18 electrolyte membranes with fine grain size have been obtained by a novel two-step co-sintering method at a relatively low sintering temperature of 1,300 degrees C, compared to the typical high sintering temperature of 1,550 degrees C. Furthermore, the Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta anode obtained by the novel two-step co-sintering method was composed of small particles with high porosity which is advantageous for electrode performance.",Two-step co-sintering method to fabricate anode-supported Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-δ proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.009
