2,1531,"Thick film layers, printed and fired on yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, exhibit good characteristics, i.e. a porous microstructure, a temperature expansion coefficient of 11.9 X 10(-6)/K, and low, temperature independent, sheet resistivity.",Characterisation of LaNi1-xCoxO3 as a possible SOFC cathode material,10.1016/0167-2738(95)00224-3
