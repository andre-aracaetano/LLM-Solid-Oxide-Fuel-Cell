1,7980,Microtubular anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (lt-SOFC) were created with a metallic coil embedded in the anode to act as current collector.,Effect of the Current Collector on Performance of Anode-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4029875
2,7980,The electrochemical performance was experimentally examined by comparing the power density (PD) of lt-SOFC with embedded coils of different turns per unit length and composition (nickel and palladium).,Effect of the Current Collector on Performance of Anode-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4029875
3,7980,It is shown that an increase in the turns per unit length results in a proportional current density increase and in a quadratic increment of PD.,Effect of the Current Collector on Performance of Anode-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4029875
4,7980,Additional performance improvement is found for the cell with palladium current collector due to the higher catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation.,Effect of the Current Collector on Performance of Anode-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4029875
