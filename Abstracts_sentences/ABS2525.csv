2,2525,Carbon concentration in ALD-YSZ films was controlled by changing Y2O3 ratio in YSZ super cycle.,Effects of carbon contaminations on Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 thin film electrolyte prepared by atomic layer deposition for thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cirp.2016.04.079
3,2525,"To examine electrochemical characteristics of ALD-YSZ films, nano-porous templates based thin film solid oxide fuel cells (TF-SOFCs) were fabricated with ALD-YSZ thin film electrolyte and examined at 500 degrees C. Open circuit voltages (OCVs) of TF-SOFCs with ALD-YSZ were clearly dependent on carbon contaminations.",Effects of carbon contaminations on Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 thin film electrolyte prepared by atomic layer deposition for thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cirp.2016.04.079
4,2525,"High carbon concentration caused leakage current through internal short circuit, and then, OCVs of TF-SOFCs were decreased.",Effects of carbon contaminations on Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 thin film electrolyte prepared by atomic layer deposition for thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cirp.2016.04.079
