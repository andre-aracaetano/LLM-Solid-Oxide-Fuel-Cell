1,20230,"Ferritic stainless steels are being considered as potential interconnect materials for SOFCs, in part because of their low cost relative to alternatives.","Yttrium, cobalt and yttrium/cobalt oxide coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.052
2,20230,"These materials are, however, susceptible to degradation over time.","Yttrium, cobalt and yttrium/cobalt oxide coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.052
3,20230,"A primary source of degradation is an increase in the area specific resistance (ASR), which is due to the formation of poorly conducting oxides (Mn-Cr spinel and Cr2O3) on the surface.","Yttrium, cobalt and yttrium/cobalt oxide coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.052
4,20230,"In this work, the influence of Y, Co and Y/Co oxide coatings on the oxidation behaviour of a ferritic stainless steel (16-18 wt% Cr) has been investigated.","Yttrium, cobalt and yttrium/cobalt oxide coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.052
5,20230,"Samples were oxidized in air for up to 500 h at temperatures ranging from 700 to 800 degrees C. Coated and uncoated samples were characterized, before and after heat treatment, using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and four-point probe resistance measurements.","Yttrium, cobalt and yttrium/cobalt oxide coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.052
6,20230,Surface morphology investigations of coated and uncoated stainless steels showed differences for Y and Co in terms of oxide formation.,"Yttrium, cobalt and yttrium/cobalt oxide coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.052
7,20230,"In all cases, Cr-Mn spinel and Cr2O3 were the two main surface oxides; however, the morphology of the spinel phase was dependent on the type of coating.","Yttrium, cobalt and yttrium/cobalt oxide coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.052
8,20230,"The lowest resistances were obtained for the Y/Co-coated samples, which had ASR values up to seven times lower than corresponding uncoated ferritic stainless steels.","Yttrium, cobalt and yttrium/cobalt oxide coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.052
