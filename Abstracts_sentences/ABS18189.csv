1,18189,High-resolution core-level and valence band x-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements were performed on La1-xSrxMnO3 perovskite oxide powders synthesized for applications in solid-oxide fuel cells by high-temperature solid-state reaction (x = 0.3 and 0.19) and by room-temperature mechanical activation of the precursors (x = 0.3).,Core-level and valence band photoemission study of La1-xSrxMnO3 perovskite oxide powders synthesized by mechanically and thermally activated solid-state reaction,10.1088/0953-8984/11/16/018
2,18189,"A structure in the valence band at about 1 eV below the Fermi level was clearly observed and assigned to the emission from the Mn 3d-derived e(g)(1)up arrow states, thereby allowing the extraction of information about correlation effects in this type of material.",Core-level and valence band photoemission study of La1-xSrxMnO3 perovskite oxide powders synthesized by mechanically and thermally activated solid-state reaction,10.1088/0953-8984/11/16/018
3,18189,Both the core-level and valence band spectral features were found to be independent of the choice of synthesis route.,Core-level and valence band photoemission study of La1-xSrxMnO3 perovskite oxide powders synthesized by mechanically and thermally activated solid-state reaction,10.1088/0953-8984/11/16/018
4,18189,"This finding indicates that mechanical activation, due to its lower synthesis temperature, can represent a valid alternative method of synthesis allowing a better control of the microstructure.",Core-level and valence band photoemission study of La1-xSrxMnO3 perovskite oxide powders synthesized by mechanically and thermally activated solid-state reaction,10.1088/0953-8984/11/16/018
