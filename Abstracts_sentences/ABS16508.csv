9,16508,"Results show that it is possible to modify the electrochemical properties of the DBSCF-x system by changing the composition, but much more work even including optimization of layer thickness and microstructure will be needed to reduce the ASR to the level of the state-of-art-electrodes and thereby better utilize the potential of the DBSCF-x system.",Complex Perovskite system Dy0.5-xBaxSr0.5Co0.80Fe0.20O3-δ: As cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1111/ijac.13061
