1,18808,Nickel/alumina catalyst promoted by Li2O and La2O3 was prepared via glycine nitrate process (GNP) for the first time.,Nickel catalyst prepared via glycine nitrate process for partial oxidation of methane to syngas,10.1016/j.catcom.2007.12.009
2,18808,"The catalyst was characterized by BET specific surface area measurement, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), H-2 temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and catalytic performance measurements for partial oxidation of methane, comparison between the catalysts with the same composition while prepared via different methods and initial catalyst stability were also investigated.",Nickel catalyst prepared via glycine nitrate process for partial oxidation of methane to syngas,10.1016/j.catcom.2007.12.009
3,18808,The results indicated that there was a strong interaction between the NiO and Al2O3 phase in the catalyst prepared via GNP.,Nickel catalyst prepared via glycine nitrate process for partial oxidation of methane to syngas,10.1016/j.catcom.2007.12.009
