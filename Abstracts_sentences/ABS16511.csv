1,16511,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are one of the most promising clean energy sources to be developed.,Highly enhanced electrical properties of lanthanum-silicate-oxide-based SOFC electrolytes with co-doped tin and bismuth in La9.33-xBixSi6-ySnyO26,10.1039/d1ra07223d
2,16511,"However, the operating temperature of SOFCs is currently still very high, ranging between 1073 and 1273 K. Reducing the operating temperature of SOFCs to intermediate temperatures in between 773 and 1073 K without decreasing the conductivity value is a challenging research topic and has received much attention from researchers.",Highly enhanced electrical properties of lanthanum-silicate-oxide-based SOFC electrolytes with co-doped tin and bismuth in La9.33-xBixSi6-ySnyO26,10.1039/d1ra07223d
