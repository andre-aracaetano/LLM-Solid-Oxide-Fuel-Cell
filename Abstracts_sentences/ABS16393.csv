5,16393,"To evaluate the oxidation behavior, isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests were used at 800 degrees C. Area specific resistances (ASR) of uncoated and coated samples were also compared as a function of time during oxidation at 800 degrees C. Chemical composition and surface morphology of the samples were examined before and after oxidation by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD).",Oxidation and electrical behavior of AISI 430 steel coated with Ni-P-TiO2-ZrO2composite for SOFC interconnect application,10.1007/s10854-020-04267-w
6,16393,"In isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests, coated samples showed lower weight gain due to the formation of Ni2P2O7, Ni3P2O8, and NiFe(2)O(4)spinel.",Oxidation and electrical behavior of AISI 430 steel coated with Ni-P-TiO2-ZrO2composite for SOFC interconnect application,10.1007/s10854-020-04267-w
