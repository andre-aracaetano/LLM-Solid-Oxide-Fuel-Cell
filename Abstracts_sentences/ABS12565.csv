1,12565,"Micro-tubular solid oxide electrolysers for electrochemical CO2 reduction of the form Ni-YSZ vertical bar YSZ vertical bar YSZ-LSM vertical bar LSM have been fabricated using a two-step method: dual layer co-extrusion phase inversion to produce electrode-supported vertical bar electrolyte precursors and subsequent coating with the outer electrode, whereby each step was followed by (co-)sintering.",CO2 splitting into CO and O2 in micro-tubular solid oxide electrolysers,10.1039/c4ra08967g
2,12565,The microstructures and physical properties of the fibres were characterized and the electrochemical performance of the fabricated electrolysers determined.,CO2 splitting into CO and O2 in micro-tubular solid oxide electrolysers,10.1039/c4ra08967g
