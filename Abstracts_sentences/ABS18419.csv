2,18419,"This nonstoichiometry is considered to have a relation to electrode activity as it affects oxygen activation and/or oxide ion sink sites, etc.",Effect of oxygen nonstoichiometry on electrode activity of La1-xAxMnO3±δ cathode,10.1149/1.1344524
3,18419,"However, its relation to cathode activity has nor yet been elucidated, mainly because of the lack of detailed data on oxygen nonstoichiometry.",Effect of oxygen nonstoichiometry on electrode activity of La1-xAxMnO3±δ cathode,10.1149/1.1344524
4,18419,"In this paper, we report the relation between oxygen nonstoichiometry and cathode activity based on measurements of the oxygen nonstoichiometry and complex-impedance of the system Ar, O-2/porous La(1-x)A(x)MnO(3+/-delta) (A = Sr, Ca)/YSZ, with p(O2) in the range of 1-10(5) Pa and temperature at 973-1273 K. When the nonstoichiometric oxygen content, 3+/-delta, increases, the electrode activity decreases and vice versa.",Effect of oxygen nonstoichiometry on electrode activity of La1-xAxMnO3±δ cathode,10.1149/1.1344524
