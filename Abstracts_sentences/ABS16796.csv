1,16796,"Based on a cogeneration plant scheme of a factory producing sugar and alcohol with a cane milling capacity of 300 t/h, this paper intends to model and analyze 6 scenarios.",Thermodynamic limits for the production of ethanol and electricity from sugarcane,
2,16796,"These cover cases that go from ethanol production maximization by using bagasse hydrolysis, passing through conventional distilleries and sugar mills with high parameter steam cogeneration and bagasse gasification, to schemes that have electricity as their only product (combined cycles with gas turbines and solid oxide fuel cells).",Thermodynamic limits for the production of ethanol and electricity from sugarcane,
3,16796,The concept of productivity function for electricity generation and ethanol production from sugarcane is introduced.,Thermodynamic limits for the production of ethanol and electricity from sugarcane,
4,16796,The greatest values for the productivity function are reached in the cases when ethanol production is maximized.,Thermodynamic limits for the production of ethanol and electricity from sugarcane,
