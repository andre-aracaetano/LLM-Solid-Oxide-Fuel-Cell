3,8894,The novel model of this paper is the second part of the model created on the SOFC to investigate the polarization on the electrodes and electrolyte.,Solid oxide fuel cell cathode diffusion polarization: materials and exergy study,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113865
4,8894,"The model is divided into a number of units axially; for each unit, the thermal equations and the continuity equations of the electrochemical reactions are progressively solved with an iterative approach.",Solid oxide fuel cell cathode diffusion polarization: materials and exergy study,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113865
5,8894,The partial differential equations for mass and energy transfer through the cathode were spatially discretized using the finite differences method (FDM).,Solid oxide fuel cell cathode diffusion polarization: materials and exergy study,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113865
6,8894,"The results shows that in order to maintain the peak exergy efficiency of the SOFCs in applied application environments, it is suggested to have the SOFC air cathode porosity between 0.35 and 0.38, the cathode pore mean radius in the range of 0.00015 to 0.0002 cm, the cathode material tortuosity of 2.9, the SOFC functional temperature between 850 degrees C and 950 degrees C, the thickness of the air electrode between 0.01 and 0.02 cm, and have the operating pressure in the range of 3 and 5 bar.",Solid oxide fuel cell cathode diffusion polarization: materials and exergy study,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113865
