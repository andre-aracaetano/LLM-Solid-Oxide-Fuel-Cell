1,15196,"SmCoO3 is a promising perovskite material for the next generation of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), but its potential application is directly linked to, and dependent on, the presence of dopant ions.","Computational study of the mixed B-site perovskite SmBxCo1-xO3-d (B = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) for next generation solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1039/c9cp00995g
2,15196,Doping on the Co-site is suggested to improve the catalytic and electronic properties of this cathode material.,"Computational study of the mixed B-site perovskite SmBxCo1-xO3-d (B = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) for next generation solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1039/c9cp00995g
3,15196,"Fe, Mn, Ni, and Cu have been proposed as possible dopants and experimental studies have investigated and confirmed the potential of these materials.","Computational study of the mixed B-site perovskite SmBxCo1-xO3-d (B = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) for next generation solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1039/c9cp00995g
4,15196,"Here we present a systematic DFT+ U study focused on the changes in electronic, magnetic, and physical properties with B-site doping of SmCoO3 to allow cathode optimization.","Computational study of the mixed B-site perovskite SmBxCo1-xO3-d (B = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) for next generation solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1039/c9cp00995g
5,15196,"It is shown that doping generally leads to distortion in the system, thereby inducing different electron occupations of the Co d-orbitals, altering the electronic and magnetic structure.","Computational study of the mixed B-site perovskite SmBxCo1-xO3-d (B = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) for next generation solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1039/c9cp00995g
6,15196,"From these calculations, the 0 K electronic conductivity (sigma(e)) was obtained, with SmMnxCo1-xO3 having the highest sigma(e), and SmFexCo1-xO3 the lowest sigma(e), in agreement with experiment.","Computational study of the mixed B-site perovskite SmBxCo1-xO3-d (B = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) for next generation solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1039/c9cp00995g
7,15196,"We have also investigated the impact of dopant species and concentration on the oxygen vacancy formation energy (E-f), which is related to the ionic conductivity (sigma(O)).","Computational study of the mixed B-site perovskite SmBxCo1-xO3-d (B = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) for next generation solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1039/c9cp00995g
8,15196,We found that the E-f values are lowered only when SmCoO3 is doped with Cu or Ni.,"Computational study of the mixed B-site perovskite SmBxCo1-xO3-d (B = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) for next generation solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1039/c9cp00995g
9,15196,"Finally, thermal expansion coefficients were calculated, with Mn-doping showing the largest decrease at low x and at x = 0.75.","Computational study of the mixed B-site perovskite SmBxCo1-xO3-d (B = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) for next generation solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1039/c9cp00995g
10,15196,"Combining these results, it is clear that Mn-doping in the range x = 0.125-0.25 would imbue SmCoO3 with the most favorable properties for IT-SOFC cathode applications.","Computational study of the mixed B-site perovskite SmBxCo1-xO3-d (B = Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) for next generation solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1039/c9cp00995g
