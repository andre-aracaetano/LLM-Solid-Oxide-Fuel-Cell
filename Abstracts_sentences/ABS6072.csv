3,6072,"These unique YCF-GDC fibers exhibit a uniform diameter of 300 nm, and the GDC particles are attached to the YCF fiber cores.",Electrospun Core-Shell Fibers for High-Efficient Composite Cathode-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c02953
4,6072,"The electrochemical performance demonstrates a relatively low area-specific resistance of 0.66 Omega.cm(2) at 550 degrees C in air, which is much lower than 1.56 Omega.cm(2) of pure YCF fiber cathode.",Electrospun Core-Shell Fibers for High-Efficient Composite Cathode-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c02953
5,6072,"Moreover, the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis results indicate that the introduction of GDC nanoparticles and the core-shell structure greatly facilitate oxygen-ion conduction and charge transfer processes, and the oxygen incorporation process plays a major role in the total polarization resistance.",Electrospun Core-Shell Fibers for High-Efficient Composite Cathode-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c02953
6,6072,The NiO-GDCIGDCIfibrous YCF-GDC fuel cell shows a maximum power density of 426.5 mW.cm(-1) at 550 degrees C. These results display that the core-shell fiber-structured YCF- GDC composite oxide is a promising candidate of highly active cathode for IT-SOFCs.,Electrospun Core-Shell Fibers for High-Efficient Composite Cathode-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c02953
