1,17532,The mixed conductive perovskite La1-xCaxFeO3-delta (LCF) exhibits high oxygen permeability.,"Chemical stability and oxygen transport properties of La1-xCaxFe1-yByO3-δ (with B = Co, Ni, Mg) perovskite membranes",10.1557/s43578-021-00212-7
2,17532,"For further improvement of the oxygen permeability as well as the chemical stability, this study investigates the impact of the doping elements on the perovskite B-site.","Chemical stability and oxygen transport properties of La1-xCaxFe1-yByO3-δ (with B = Co, Ni, Mg) perovskite membranes",10.1557/s43578-021-00212-7
3,17532,The cobalt (Co) doping of the LCF improved both the oxygen diffusion and the oxygen surface exchange.,"Chemical stability and oxygen transport properties of La1-xCaxFe1-yByO3-δ (with B = Co, Ni, Mg) perovskite membranes",10.1557/s43578-021-00212-7
4,17532,"However, the oxygen semi-permeation flux of the Co-doped LCF sample was not stable at high temperatures under the high oxygen partial pressure difference (air/argon).","Chemical stability and oxygen transport properties of La1-xCaxFe1-yByO3-δ (with B = Co, Ni, Mg) perovskite membranes",10.1557/s43578-021-00212-7
5,17532,"The magnesium (Mg) doping in the B-site significantly improved the chemical stability of the LCF membranes, with the oxygen semi-permeation performances close to those obtained with the Co-doped LCF membranes.","Chemical stability and oxygen transport properties of La1-xCaxFe1-yByO3-δ (with B = Co, Ni, Mg) perovskite membranes",10.1557/s43578-021-00212-7
6,17532,"Thus, the Mg-doped LCF presented the best compromise between chemical stability and oxygen semi-permeation performance, which is applicable to the oxygen transport membranes or the cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells.","Chemical stability and oxygen transport properties of La1-xCaxFe1-yByO3-δ (with B = Co, Ni, Mg) perovskite membranes",10.1557/s43578-021-00212-7
