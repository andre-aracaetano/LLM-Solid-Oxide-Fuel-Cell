2,16083,"[lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF)/gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC)] composite cathode is successfully demonstrated with conventional powder processing using nanocomposite particles, grown via a colloidal-processing-based bottom-up approach, as starting material.",Highly accelerated oxygen reduction reaction kinetics in colloidal-processing-derived nanostructured lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite/gadolinium-doped ceria composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.01.032
3,16083,The cathode/electrolyte interface adheres well at a relatively low temperature of 900 degrees C because of the promoted surface diffusion of constituent elements by the higher surface energy of the nano-sized particles.,Highly accelerated oxygen reduction reaction kinetics in colloidal-processing-derived nanostructured lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite/gadolinium-doped ceria composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.01.032
4,16083,"By contrast, successful fabrication of a nanostructured porous cathode composed of uniformly distributing LSCF and GDC grains with a diameter of 50-70 nm strongly supports the prevented grain growth and pore closure by the co-existing hetero-phases in the composite particles acting as bulk diffusion barrier of each other's constituents during sintering.",Highly accelerated oxygen reduction reaction kinetics in colloidal-processing-derived nanostructured lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite/gadolinium-doped ceria composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.01.032
5,16083,"The nanocomposite cathode exhibits quite low area-specific polarization resistances for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of 0.127, 0.054, 0.032, 0.015 and 0.009 Omega cm(2) at 600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 degrees C, respectively.",Highly accelerated oxygen reduction reaction kinetics in colloidal-processing-derived nanostructured lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite/gadolinium-doped ceria composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.01.032
6,16083,These are significantly lower than those reported in the literature.,Highly accelerated oxygen reduction reaction kinetics in colloidal-processing-derived nanostructured lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite/gadolinium-doped ceria composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.01.032
7,16083,"The highly accelerated ORR kinetics contribute directly to the very high power densities of the anode-supported cells of 0.40, 0.77, 1.40, 2.32, and 3.29 W cm(-2) at 600, 650, 700, 750, and 800 degrees C, respectively, with a cell voltage at 0.7 V.",Highly accelerated oxygen reduction reaction kinetics in colloidal-processing-derived nanostructured lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite/gadolinium-doped ceria composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.01.032
