1,8700,"(La0.8Sr0.2)(0.9)MnO3-delta-Y0.15Zr0.85O1.93 (LSM-YSZ) nanocomposite layer is infiltrated into three different scaffolds of ion-conductive YSZ, ionic and electronic conductive LSM-YSZ composite and insulating Al2O3 and used as cathode for anode supported cells.","Electrochemical behaviors of infiltrated (La, Sr) MnO3 and Y2O3-ZrO2 nanocomposite layer",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.050
2,8700,"The cell performance and impedance spectra analysis reveal that the LSM-YSZ nanocomposite layer shows considerable high ORR activity using its own electronic and ionic conducting network, however, the electrochemical performance seems to be constrained by its limited ionic and electronic conductivity.","Electrochemical behaviors of infiltrated (La, Sr) MnO3 and Y2O3-ZrO2 nanocomposite layer",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.050
3,8700,The construction of ionic conducting path using YSZ scaffold is more effective for raising electrochemical performance than the construction of both electronic and ionic conducting paths using LSM-YSZ composite scaffold.,"Electrochemical behaviors of infiltrated (La, Sr) MnO3 and Y2O3-ZrO2 nanocomposite layer",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.050
