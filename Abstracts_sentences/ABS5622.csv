2,5622,The submicrometer SOFCs were made of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) or YSZ/gadolinium-doped ceria composites electrolyte and 80 nm porous Pt as cathode and anode.,High-performance ultrathin solid oxide fuel cells for low-temperature operation,10.1149/1.2372592
3,5622,"The peak power densities were 200 and 400 mW/cm(2) at 350 and 400 degrees C, respectively.",High-performance ultrathin solid oxide fuel cells for low-temperature operation,10.1149/1.2372592
4,5622,The high power densities achieved are not only due to the reduction of electrolyte thickness but also to the high charge-transfer reaction rates at the interfaces between the nanoporous electrodes (cathode and/or anode) and the nanocrystalline thin electrolyte.,High-performance ultrathin solid oxide fuel cells for low-temperature operation,10.1149/1.2372592
