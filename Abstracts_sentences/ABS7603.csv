6,7603,"Good peak power densities of 0.477 (with H2 fuel) and 0.420 W cm2 (with CH4 fuel) at open-circuit voltages (OCV) of 0.89 and 0.80 V are achieved at the operating temperature of 800 C. These lower OCVs than the theoretical OCV value, confirm the porous structure of the YSZ electrolyte.",A multiscale-architecture solid oxide fuel cell fabricated by electrophoretic deposition technique,10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.154654
