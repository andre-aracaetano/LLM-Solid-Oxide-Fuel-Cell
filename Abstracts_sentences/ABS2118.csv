1,2118,"The effect of the type (semolina, starch, and ashless filter paper) and amount (5 and 10 wt %) of pore-forming agents on the structure of supporting Ni-cermet anodes and characteristics of solid-oxide fuel cells on their basis has been studied.",Pore-Forming Agents for the Supporting Ni-Based SOFC Anode,10.1134/S1023193518060150
2,2118,It has been found that the use of paper fibers as the pore-forming agent doubles the open porosity of the anode as compared with equal amounts of semolina or starch.,Pore-Forming Agents for the Supporting Ni-Based SOFC Anode,10.1134/S1023193518060150
3,2118,"It has been shown that the long cylindrical pores formed by fibers allow fast transport of gases through the anode bulk, which has a positive effect on the fuel cell characteristics.",Pore-Forming Agents for the Supporting Ni-Based SOFC Anode,10.1134/S1023193518060150
