2,10378,"Focusing on a laboratory-size SOFC system, a reformer fault is investigated both experimentally and through a model; comparison between experimental and modeling results is presented and discussed.","Reformer faults in SOFC systems: Experimental and modeling analysis, and simulated fault maps",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.063
3,10378,"The results show that some types of reformer faults can be dangerous, because they can give rise to local thermal gradients as large as 10-20.10(2) K/m or more in the SOFC stack.","Reformer faults in SOFC systems: Experimental and modeling analysis, and simulated fault maps",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.063
4,10378,Simulation results show that SOFC stacks employing metallic interconnects are expected to withstand faults of larger magnitude than SOFC stacks employing ceramic interconnects.,"Reformer faults in SOFC systems: Experimental and modeling analysis, and simulated fault maps",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.063
