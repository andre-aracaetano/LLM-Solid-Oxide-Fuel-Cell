1,8333,Dynamic behavior of the segmented-in-series tubular solid oxide fuel cell upon discharge was investigated.,Dynamic Behavior of Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell upon Discharge,10.1149/2.099203jes
2,8333,"The cell performance decreased initially at 900 degrees C, accompanied by the increase of ohmic resistance.",Dynamic Behavior of Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell upon Discharge,10.1149/2.099203jes
3,8333,"Lower partial pressure of oxygen in the cathode resulted in a more severe decrease, whereas the gas displacement in the anode compartment did not induce such behavior.",Dynamic Behavior of Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell upon Discharge,10.1149/2.099203jes
4,8333,"As the current was cut off, the ohmic resistance rapidly recovered toward the starting value before current load.",Dynamic Behavior of Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell upon Discharge,10.1149/2.099203jes
5,8333,The possible origin for this increase-recovery behavior of the ohmic resistance has been discussed based on the evaluation of oxygen partial pressure at the cathode/electrolyte interface and element interdiffusion between cathode and electrolyte.,Dynamic Behavior of Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell upon Discharge,10.1149/2.099203jes
