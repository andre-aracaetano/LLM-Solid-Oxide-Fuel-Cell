1,618,A detailed computational model of a direct-flame solid oxide fuel cell (DFFC) is presented.,"Modeling, simulation and optimization of a no-chamber solid oxide fuel cell operated with a flat-flame burner",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.030
2,618,The DFFC is based on a fuel-rich methane-air flame stabilized on a flat-flame burner and coupled to a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,"Modeling, simulation and optimization of a no-chamber solid oxide fuel cell operated with a flat-flame burner",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.030
3,618,"The model consists of an elementary kinetic description of the premixed methane-air flame, a stagnation-point flow description of the coupled heat and mass transport within the gas phase, an elementary kinetic description of the electrochemistry, as well as heat, mass and charge transport within the SOFC.","Modeling, simulation and optimization of a no-chamber solid oxide fuel cell operated with a flat-flame burner",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.030
4,618,"Simulated current-voltage characteristics show excellent agreement with experimental data published earlier (Kronemayer et al., 2007","Modeling, simulation and optimization of a no-chamber solid oxide fuel cell operated with a flat-flame burner",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.030
