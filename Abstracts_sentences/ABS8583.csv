1,8583,"In this study, fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by cold sintering process (CSP) of electrolyte and anode layers was studied for the first time.",Cold Sintering of Anode-Supported 8YSZ/NiO-8YSZ Bilayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02483
2,8583,A crack-free thin layer of 8YSZ electrolyte supported by a porous NiO-8YSZ anode was obtained by using the cold sintering process at 200 degrees C and 450 MPa uniaxial pressure for 1 h which then was post sintered at 1225 degrees C in conventional furnaces.,Cold Sintering of Anode-Supported 8YSZ/NiO-8YSZ Bilayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02483
3,8583,"Despite the much lower post-sintering temperatures as compared to the conventional ones at about 1400 degrees C, a continuous electrolyte/anode interface that was free of any defects such as delamination was achieved.",Cold Sintering of Anode-Supported 8YSZ/NiO-8YSZ Bilayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02483
4,8583,Monolithic electrolyte prepared under identical conditions reached 95% of its theoretical density.,Cold Sintering of Anode-Supported 8YSZ/NiO-8YSZ Bilayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02483
5,8583,Utilization of the cold sintering process resulted in limited grain growth in the anode which enhanced long triple-phase boundary densities.,Cold Sintering of Anode-Supported 8YSZ/NiO-8YSZ Bilayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02483
6,8583,"SOFCs constructed from cold-sintered 8YSZ/NiO-8YSZ bilayers exhibited open-circuit potentials of 0.90-0.85 V at 700-800 degrees C, confirming a fairly dense 8YSZ electrolyte.",Cold Sintering of Anode-Supported 8YSZ/NiO-8YSZ Bilayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02483
7,8583,"The highest power density achieved at 800 degrees C was 158 mW/cm(2), which most likely would have the potential to be improved significantly upon further decreasing the anode thickness.",Cold Sintering of Anode-Supported 8YSZ/NiO-8YSZ Bilayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c02483
