3,16147,"Here we show that Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3-8 (STF-Ru) exsolution anodes provide both catalytic reforming activity and electrochemical activity with steam/ethanol (S/E) mixtures at 3:1 and 2:1 M ratio between 700 and 800 degrees C. Electrolytesupported scandia stabilized zirconia SOFCs with STF-Ru anodes and Sr0.95Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-8 (STF) cathodes are reasonably stable in the 3:1 S/E mixture over 20 h at 800 degrees C, with maximum power density of 195 mW/cm2 and 140 mW/cm2 at 0.7 V. Deactivation instead occurs with the 2:1 S/E mixture.",Catalytic and electrocatalytic performance of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3-8 for applications in solid oxide fuel cells supplied with ethanol steam reforming mixtures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232215

5,16147,"Ethanol steam reforming experiments in a fixed bed powder reactor reveal that, above 650 degrees C, gas phase reactions convert ethanol to CO, hydrogen, acetaldehyde and ethylene, while STF-Ru catalyzes steam reforming.",Catalytic and electrocatalytic performance of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3-8 for applications in solid oxide fuel cells supplied with ethanol steam reforming mixtures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232215
6,16147,"Thermogravimetric and Raman characterizations show that a moderate amount of carbon is deposited on the STF-Ru surface, which is more amorphous than the disruptive carbon which degrades Ni-YSZ.",Catalytic and electrocatalytic performance of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3-8 for applications in solid oxide fuel cells supplied with ethanol steam reforming mixtures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232215
