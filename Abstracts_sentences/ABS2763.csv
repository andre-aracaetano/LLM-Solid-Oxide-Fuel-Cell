1,2763,"This work aims to analyse the behaviour of cermet electrodes as a function of their composition, i.e. the ratio between ionic and electronic conducting particles, This is an important parameter to be considered to obtain maximum performance from this type of electrode, which is currently under study for application in oxygen sensors and solid oxide fuel cells.",Effect of composition on the performance of cermet electrodes. Experimental and theoretical approach,10.1016/S0013-4686(01)00830-1
2,2763,"Experimental results of overall electrode resistance, including both ohmic and activation polarisation effects, have been obtained through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements of Pt/YSZ electrodes in air.",Effect of composition on the performance of cermet electrodes. Experimental and theoretical approach,10.1016/S0013-4686(01)00830-1
3,2763,The results compare favourably with the theoretical predictions for several compositions above the percolation threshold of the electronic conductor.,Effect of composition on the performance of cermet electrodes. Experimental and theoretical approach,10.1016/S0013-4686(01)00830-1
4,2763,"For this reason, the model is a useful tool for the design of optimised cermet electrodes; in particular, the experimental data show that maximum performance is attained for compositions very close to the percolation threshold of the electronic conductor, and this is in very good agreement with the modelling results.",Effect of composition on the performance of cermet electrodes.
