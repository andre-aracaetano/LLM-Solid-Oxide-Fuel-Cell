1,6123,Zr and Y co-doped perovskite BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-delta (BCFZY0.1) was recently developed as a promising new cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs).,"Zr and Y co-doped perovskite as a stable, high performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells operating below 500 °C",10.1039/c6ee01915c
2,6123,"Here, it is applied for the first time as a cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).","Zr and Y co-doped perovskite as a stable, high performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells operating below 500 °C",10.1039/c6ee01915c
3,6123,"It exhibits large lattice parameters, high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, exceptional low-temperature performance, long-term stability, and excellent chemical compatability with ceria-based SOFC electrolytes.","Zr and Y co-doped perovskite as a stable, high performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells operating below 500 °C",10.1039/c6ee01915c
4,6123,"When BCFZY0.1 is used as the cathode in Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (GDC20)-based SOFCs, it enables a peak power density of 0.97 W cm(-2) at 500 degrees C with 2500 hours stable performance and complete recoverability without any degradation after more than 80 fast thermal ramping cycles.","Zr and Y co-doped perovskite as a stable, high performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells operating below 500 °C",10.1039/c6ee01915c
5,6123,"Even at 350 degrees C, peak power density reaches 0.13 W cm(-2).","Zr and Y co-doped perovskite as a stable, high performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells operating below 500 °C",10.1039/c6ee01915c
