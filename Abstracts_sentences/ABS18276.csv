1,18276,"As a clean, efficient, and promising energy conversion device, solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), which can achieve transformation from electricity to chemical fuels, has captured worldwide attention.",Micro-/Nanohoneycomb Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell Anodes with Ultralarge Current Tolerance,10.1002/aenm.201802203
2,18276,"A novel biomimetic honeycomb SOEC anode with super low tortuosity factor (approximate to 1), ground-breaking porosity (approximate to 75%), and high structural strength, has been successfully fabricated by freeze casting and infiltrating.",Micro-/Nanohoneycomb Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell Anodes with Ultralarge Current Tolerance,10.1002/aenm.201802203
3,18276,"This honeycomb anode demonstrates ultralow polarization resistance (0.0094 omega cm(2), lower than any existing anodes reported so far) and high durability for hours at a large current density of 2.0 A cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. These unique advantages are derived from the effective release of oxygen through the yttria-stabilized zirconia honeycomb skeletons, and the exposure of active areas along the inner pore of the honeycomb structure after infiltrating La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 +/-delta.",Micro-/Nanohoneycomb Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell Anodes with Ultralarge Current Tolerance,10.1002/aenm.201802203
4,18276,"Such a honeycomb electrode combines high electrical, chemical, and thermal stability under high temperatures and large current densities, demonstrating the feasibility of biomimetic structures for use in large-scale and highly efficient energy conversion systems.",Micro-/Nanohoneycomb Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell Anodes with Ultralarge Current Tolerance,10.1002/aenm.201802203
