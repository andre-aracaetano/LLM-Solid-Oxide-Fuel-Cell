3,20012,This loss of electrochemical activity has been extensively studied in the past and an accumulation of strontium at the LSC surface has been shown to be responsible for most of the degradation effects.,The Chemical Evolution of the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Surface Under SOFC Operating Conditions and Its Implications for Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Activity,10.1007/s11244-018-1068-1
4,20012,The present study sheds further light onto LSC surface changes also occurring under SOFC operating conditions.,The Chemical Evolution of the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Surface Under SOFC Operating Conditions and Its Implications for Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Activity,10.1007/s11244-018-1068-1
5,20012,"In-situ near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were conducted at temperatures between 400 and 790 degrees C. Simultaneously, electrochemical impedance measurements were performed to characterise the catalytic activity of the LSC electrode surface for O-2 reduction.",The Chemical Evolution of the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Surface Under SOFC Operating Conditions and Its Implications for Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Activity,10.1007/s11244-018-1068-1
6,20012,This combination allowed a correlation of the loss in electro-catalytic activity with the appearance of an additional La-containing Sr-oxide species at the LSC surface.,The Chemical Evolution of the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Surface Under SOFC Operating Conditions and Its Implications for Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Activity,10.1007/s11244-018-1068-1
7,20012,"This additional Sr-oxide species preferentially covers electrochemically active Co sites at the surface, and thus very effectively decreases the oxygen exchange performance of LSC.",The Chemical Evolution of the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Surface Under SOFC Operating Conditions and Its Implications for Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Activity,10.1007/s11244-018-1068-1
8,20012,"Formation of precipitates, in contrast, was found to play a less important role for the electrochemical degradation of LSC.",The Chemical Evolution of the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Surface Under SOFC Operating Conditions and Its Implications for Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Activity,10.1007/s11244-018-1068-1
