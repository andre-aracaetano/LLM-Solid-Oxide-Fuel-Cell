1,10422,"A proton-conductive BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-delta (BCYO) thin-film, one of the candidates for the electrolyte of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), was deposited on (111) Pt/TiO2/SiO2/(100) Si substrate by the RF magnetron sputtering method.",Fabrication of highly (110)-oriented BaCeO3-based proton-conductive oxide thin films by RF magnetron sputtering method,10.7567/JJAP.55.02BC19
2,10422,"The sputtering conditions, i.e., deposition temperature, pressure, and sputtering gases, were examined to improve the crystallinity of the films.",Fabrication of highly (110)-oriented BaCeO3-based proton-conductive oxide thin films by RF magnetron sputtering method,10.7567/JJAP.55.02BC19
3,10422,The BCYO films deposited at more than 500 degrees C were well crystallized and showed only 110 diffraction.,Fabrication of highly (110)-oriented BaCeO3-based proton-conductive oxide thin films by RF magnetron sputtering method,10.7567/JJAP.55.02BC19
4,10422,The addition of O-2 into the sputtering gas causes adverse results of lower crystallinity and lower deposition rates.,Fabrication of highly (110)-oriented BaCeO3-based proton-conductive oxide thin films by RF magnetron sputtering method,10.7567/JJAP.55.02BC19
5,10422,A wide-range XRD reciprocal space mapping also revealed that the (110)-oriented BCYO films can be obtained on (111) Pt/TiO2/SiO2/(100) Si substrates without the need to use any buffer layers.,Fabrication of highly (110)-oriented BaCeO3-based proton-conductive oxide thin films by RF magnetron sputtering method,10.7567/JJAP.55.02BC19
6,10422,We consider that this BCYO film possibly shows high proton conductivity and may be a suitable material for the SOFC electrolyte because of its high crystallinity.,Fabrication of highly (110)-oriented BaCeO3-based proton-conductive oxide thin films by RF magnetron sputtering method,10.7567/JJAP.55.02BC19
