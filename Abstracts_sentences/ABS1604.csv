2,1604,In this work a numerical solid oxide fuel cell model is developed and validated with the experimental data given in the literature.,"Non-uniform, multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system design for small system size and high efficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.037
3,1604,"Numerical analyses are performed and the solid oxide fuel cell operation is simulated for the conventional single stack, uniform multi-stack and non-uniform multi-stack systems.","Non-uniform, multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system design for small system size and high efficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.037
4,1604,Results show that the fuel utilization and therefore the efficiency of the system increases significantly for the multi-stack designs.,"Non-uniform, multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system design for small system size and high efficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.037
5,1604,"Moreover, for the non-uniform multi-stack design the system size also decreases significantly.","Non-uniform, multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system design for small system size and high efficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.037
6,1604,"For the same operating conditions the efficiency and cell number values of the single stack, uniform multi-stack and non-uniform multi-stack designs are calculated as 9%/124 cells, 46%/256 cells and 46%/126 cells respectively.","Non-uniform, multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system design for small system size and high efficiency",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.037
