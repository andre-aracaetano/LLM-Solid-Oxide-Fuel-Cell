2,6798,"In this regard, four different types of carbons, i.e. bituminous coal (BC), demineralised bituminous coal (DBC), anthracite coal (AC) and pine charcoal (PCC), are employed as fuels in a SOFC of the type: carbon (carbonate)|Cu-CeO2/YSZ/Ag|Air.",Effect of carbon type on the performance of a direct or hybrid carbon solid oxide fuel cell,10.1039/c4ra01022a
3,6798,"The results reveal that in the absence of carbonates (DCFC configuration) the optimum performance, in terms of maximum power density (Pmax), is obtained for the charcoal sample, which demonstrated a power output of similar to 12 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, compared to 3.4 and 4.6 mW cm(-2) with the anthracite and bituminous samples, respectively.",Effect of carbon type on the performance of a direct or hybrid carbon solid oxide fuel cell,10.1039/c4ra01022a
4,6798,Demineralization treatment of bituminous coal is found to improve the DCFC performance resulting in a maximum power density of 5.5 mW cm(-2).,Effect of carbon type on the performance of a direct or hybrid carbon solid oxide fuel cell,10.1039/c4ra01022a
5,6798,"A similar trend in terms of maximum power density, i.e., PCC > DBC > BC > AC, is obtained in the hybrid carbon fuel cell (HCFC) employing a eutectic mixture of lithium and potassium carbonates (62 mol% Li2CO3 + 38 mol% K2CO3) in the anode compartment at a carbon/carbonate weight ratio of 4 : 1.",Effect of carbon type on the performance of a direct or hybrid carbon solid oxide fuel cell,10.1039/c4ra01022a
6,6798,"An enhancement of up to 185% in the maximum power density is achieved by admixing molten carbonates with carbon feedstock, with its extent being dependent on carbon type and temperature.",Effect of carbon type on the performance of a direct or hybrid carbon solid oxide fuel cell,10.1039/c4ra01022a
