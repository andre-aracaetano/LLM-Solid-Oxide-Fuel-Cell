1,13378,In this study the performance of CeO2 and Rh supported on CeO2 as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) was investigated.,Ceria-based anodes for the direct oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1021/la00012a040
2,13378,Experiments were conducted using a model SOFC consisting of an electrolyte disk of yttria-stabilized zirconia with thin films of samaria-doped ceria as both the anode and cathode.,Ceria-based anodes for the direct oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1021/la00012a040
3,13378,"The current-voltage characteristics of the cell were measured for H-2, CO, and CH4 fuels as a function of the thickness of the CeO2 anode and the Rh loading.",Ceria-based anodes for the direct oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1021/la00012a040
4,13378,"For H-2 as the fuel, it was found that the cell performance was largely independent of the anode design, suggesting that, for this fuel, reaction on the anode was not limiting.",Ceria-based anodes for the direct oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1021/la00012a040
5,13378,"In contrast, for CH4, it was observed that the maximum current density produced by the cell was highly dependent on both the CeO2 film thickness and the Rh loading.",Ceria-based anodes for the direct oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1021/la00012a040
6,13378,This suggests that for CH4 the catalytic properties of the anode are important for good performance.,Ceria-based anodes for the direct oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1021/la00012a040
7,13378,"Since during the CH4 experiments only negligible amounts of H2O were produced (the fractional conversion was maintained below 10(-5)), this study also demonstrated that it is possible to oxidize CH4 electrochemically in a SOFC without prior steam reforming.",Ceria-based anodes for the direct oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1021/la00012a040
8,13378,The implications of these results to the design of practical SOFCs are discussed.,Ceria-based anodes for the direct oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1021/la00012a040
