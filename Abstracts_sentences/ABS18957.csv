1,18957,The Cr2AlC ternary carbide is excellent in chemical and oxidation resistances as well as mechanical properties at high temperatures.,Synthesis of a Cr2AlC-Ti2AlC ternary carbide,
2,18957,Therefore it satisfies most requirements for as an interconnector Material in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Synthesis of a Cr2AlC-Ti2AlC ternary carbide,
3,18957,"However, its thermal expansion coefficient is higher than those of the anode and cathode so that a high thermal stress is generated unavoidably between them during heating and cooling SOFCs.",Synthesis of a Cr2AlC-Ti2AlC ternary carbide,
4,18957,Thus we attempted to reduce the thermal expansion coefficient through a solid solution with Ti2AlC which has a lower thermal expansion coefficient.,Synthesis of a Cr2AlC-Ti2AlC ternary carbide,
5,18957,"Dense and single phase (Cr1-xTix)(2)AlC solid solutions with a relative density of 99.5% or more were synthesized by hot pressing a mixture of CrCx, Ti2C, Al powders at 1250 degrees C for 4 h.",Synthesis of a Cr2AlC-Ti2AlC ternary carbide,
6,18957,The limitation of Ti substitution was found to be less than 20 mol%.,Synthesis of a Cr2AlC-Ti2AlC ternary carbide,
7,18957,"When Ti substitution exceeded this limit, unreacted Ti2C, Cr7C3, and Cr3C2 remained as second phases.",Synthesis of a Cr2AlC-Ti2AlC ternary carbide,
8,18957,The grain size decreased with Ti substitution.,Synthesis of a Cr2AlC-Ti2AlC ternary carbide,
9,18957,"With 5 mol% Ti substitution, the thermal expansion coefficient could be lowered by 5% compared with the case without substitution in the temperature range of 700-800 degrees C.",Synthesis of a Cr2AlC-Ti2AlC ternary carbide,
