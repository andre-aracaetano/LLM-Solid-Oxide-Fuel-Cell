3,7743,"d (Ln = La, Pr, Nd) cathodes below 600 degrees C is significantly enhanced through the exsolution of highly active nanoparticles driven by applying a negative voltage of 2 V for 150 s. Pr0.2Ba0.8Co0.7Fe0.3O3-delta (PBCF) cathode exhibits an area-specific resistance of similar to 0.119 Omega cm(2) at 550 degrees C, approximately 1/3 of that for the pristine cathode (similar to 0.389 Omega cm(2)).",Manipulation of rare earth on voltage-driven in-situ exsolution process of perovskite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cej.2022.136934
