1,4310,"The perovskite La(Ni0.6Fe0.4)O-3 (LNF) is a candidate material for the electrochemically active cathode layer, the cathode current collecting layer, and/or the interconnect protective coating in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) operated at 600-800 degrees C. Since these operating temperatures enable the use of relatively cheap interconnect materials such as chromia-forming ferritic stainless steel, investigation of the chemical stability of LNF in the presence of chromium species is of importance.","La(Ni,Fe)O3 Stability in the Presence of Chromia-A Solid-State Reactivity Study",10.1149/1.3519369
2,4310,This study demonstrates that LNF is chemically unstable at 800 degrees C when it is in direct contact with Cr2O3.,"La(Ni,Fe)O3 Stability in the Presence of Chromia-A Solid-State Reactivity Study",10.1149/1.3519369
3,4310,"It has been observed that Cr enters the perovskite phase, replacing first Ni and then Fe, already after 200 h. At 600 degrees C, however, only minor reaction products were detected after 1000 h exposure to Cr2O3.","La(Ni,Fe)O3 Stability in the Presence of Chromia-A Solid-State Reactivity Study",10.1149/1.3519369
4,4310,"Although this is a promising result, long-term testing under fuel cell operating conditions at 600 degrees C is needed to prove that LNF is a viable IT-SOFC material.","La(Ni,Fe)O3 Stability in the Presence of Chromia-A Solid-State Reactivity Study",10.1149/1.3519369
