1,3657,A challenge in the operation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with hydrocarbon fuels is carbon deposition on the nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) anode.,Investigation of carbon formation on Ni/YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cell from CO disproportionation reaction,10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2017.11.014
2,3657,This paper investigated the carbon formation on Ni/YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) due to CO disproportionation reaction.,Investigation of carbon formation on Ni/YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cell from CO disproportionation reaction,10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2017.11.014
3,3657,The steady-state rates of carbon formation under different CO/CO2 gas compositions were measured at temperature range from 600 degrees C to 800 degrees C. Experimental results showed that the steady-state rate of carbon formation caused by CO disproportionation reaction cannot solely be expressed with temperature or CO/CO2 gas ratios.,Investigation of carbon formation on Ni/YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cell from CO disproportionation reaction,10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2017.11.014
4,3657,"A kinetic model divides the CO disproportionation reaction into several stepwise reactions, among which one of the stepwise reactions, namely, the C-O bond cleavage reaction, is considered as the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction.",Investigation of carbon formation on Ni/YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cell from CO disproportionation reaction,10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2017.11.014
5,3657,This kinetic model fits very well with the experimental results.,Investigation of carbon formation on Ni/YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cell from CO disproportionation reaction,10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2017.11.014
6,3657,"Based on the kinetic model and experimental data, a steady-state rate equation of carbon formation in the process of CO disproportionation reaction was derived at the temperature from 600 degrees C to 800 degrees C on Ni/YSZ anode of SOFCs.",Investigation of carbon formation on Ni/YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cell from CO disproportionation reaction,10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2017.11.014
