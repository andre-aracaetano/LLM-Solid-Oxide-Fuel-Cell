5,19733,The first is that La(0.9)Sr(0.1)Ga(0.8)Mg(0.2)O(2.85) reacted with other components such as alumina tubes or Pyrex glass sealant in the test cell.,Compatibility of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 as the electrolyte for SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00071-X
6,19733,"The second is a significant depletion of B-site ions, especially Ga ion, from the surface outside the effective electrode area in La(0.9)Sr(0.1)Ga(0.8)Mg(0.2)O(2.85), and the surface morphology was changed from dense to porous.",Compatibility of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 as the electrolyte for SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00071-X
7,19733,"Because Ga monovalent compounds, such as Ga(2)O, have high vapor pressures in the reducing atmosphere around p(O(2)) = 10(-24) atm, the Ga depletion can be ascribed to the vaporization of the Ga component.",Compatibility of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 as the electrolyte for SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00071-X
