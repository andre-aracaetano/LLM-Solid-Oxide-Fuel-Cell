1,1121,Single cells with doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte material were constructed and tested from 600 to 800 degrees C. Both ceria and the electrolyte material were mixed with NiO powder respectively to form composite anodes.,Fuel cells with doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02441-X
2,1121,Doped lanthanum cobaltite was used exclusively as the cathode material.,Fuel cells with doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02441-X
3,1121,"While high power density from the solid oxide fuel cells at 800 degrees C was achieved, our results clearly indicate that anode overpotential is the dominant factor in the power loss of the cells.",Fuel cells with doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02441-X
4,1121,Better anode materials and anode processing methods need to be found to fully utilize the high ionic conductivity of the doped lanthanum gallate and achieve higher power density at 800 degrees C from solid oxide fuel cells.,Fuel cells with doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02441-X
