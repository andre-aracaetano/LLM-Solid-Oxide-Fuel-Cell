1,19717,"A novel family of metal oxides of chemical formula Ba2Ca(1-x -y)M(x+z)Nb(1-z+ y)O6-delta (M = Mn, Fe and Co) was developed as mixed ion and electronic conductors (MIECs) for application in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Effect of substitution of B-sites by Mn, Fe and Co in double perovskite-type Ba3CaNb2O9 on structure and electrical properties",10.1039/c3ra44429e
2,19717,"Investigated samples were synthesized by a ceramic method at 1400 degrees C in air and characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), dilatometry, chemical titration and electrochemical ac impedance spectroscopy (EIS).","Effect of substitution of B-sites by Mn, Fe and Co in double perovskite-type Ba3CaNb2O9 on structure and electrical properties",10.1039/c3ra44429e
3,19717,"The Rietveld analysis of PXRD and SAED support the formation of ordered double perovskite-type structure with space group Fm3m and chemical stability in 5000 ppm H2S/H-2 at 600 degrees C. Iodometric titration shows the valences of Mn and Co were 2+ and 3+, while Fe shows 3+ and 4+ states.","Effect of substitution of B-sites by Mn, Fe and Co in double perovskite-type Ba3CaNb2O9 on structure and electrical properties",10.1039/c3ra44429e
