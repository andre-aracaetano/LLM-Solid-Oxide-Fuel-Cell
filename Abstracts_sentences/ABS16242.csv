2,16242,"To evaluate that, binary co-dopant combinations with Yb3+-Sc3+ have been opted (SegI), followed by the addition of ternary co-dopant in the later part (Seg-II).",Ternary co-doped ytterbium-scandium stabilized zirconia electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116507
3,16242,The crystallographic data suggests that all the compositions consist of cubic or tetragonal symmetry of zirconia without any other phases.,Ternary co-doped ytterbium-scandium stabilized zirconia electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116507
4,16242,"Moreover, the highly dense morphology and clear grain boundaries suggest the absence of segregation of impurities.",Ternary co-doped ytterbium-scandium stabilized zirconia electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116507
5,16242,"Later on, the electrical conductivity of 0.087 S/cm with a degradation of 5.4% in 150 h at 800 degrees C in air was obtained for x = 0.08 in (Sc2O3)(x)(Yb2O3)(0.1-x) (ZrO2)(0.9).",Ternary co-doped ytterbium-scandium stabilized zirconia electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116507
6,16242,"This huge degradation has been suppressed in the Seg-II of this work, by adding various ternary co-dopant with a chemical formula of (M)(0.005)(Sc2O3)(0.08)(Yb2O3)(0.02) (ZrO2)(0.895), Where M = MgO, In2O3, Sm2O3, CaO.",Ternary co-doped ytterbium-scandium stabilized zirconia electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116507
7,16242,"Among various ternary co-dopants, the presence of In3+ shows the lowest degradation of 3% in 270 h with a remarkable conductivity of 0.08 S/cm at 800 degrees C in air.",Ternary co-doped ytterbium-scandium stabilized zirconia electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116507
8,16242,This suppression of aging without affecting much the conductivity and absence of any pO(2) dependency shows the potential of ternary co-doped (In-2Yb8SSZ) stabilized zirconia to be used as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) applications.,Ternary co-doped ytterbium-scandium stabilized zirconia electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116507
