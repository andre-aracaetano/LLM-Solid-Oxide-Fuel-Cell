1,14919,"Ceres Power Ltd. has developed a novel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) concept based upon depositing a thick film positive-electrolyte-negative (PEN) structure on a porous stainless steel substrate, and using gadolinia-doped ceria (CGO) as the electrolyte material.","Modelling of cells, stacks and systems based around metal-supported planar IT-SOFC cells with CGO electrolytes operating at 500-600°C",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.067
2,14919,"This approach allows the temperature of operation to be reduced to below 600 degrees C, well below the conventional SOFC operating temperature.","Modelling of cells, stacks and systems based around metal-supported planar IT-SOFC cells with CGO electrolytes operating at 500-600°C",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.067
3,14919,"Historically, the use of CGO as an electrolyte material has been viewed as impractical because of its poor stability in reducing atmospheres at elevated temperatures, leading to electronic conductivity, which effectively short-circuits the cell leading to a loss of efficiency.","Modelling of cells, stacks and systems based around metal-supported planar IT-SOFC cells with CGO electrolytes operating at 500-600°C",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.067

5,14919,The parameters of this model are set to give the best possible fit to experimental data.,"Modelling of cells, stacks and systems based around metal-supported planar IT-SOFC cells with CGO electrolytes operating at 500-600°C",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.067
6,14919,"This cell model is then incorporated into a model of a 2.5 kW(e) stack, and the stack model into a natural gas fuelled combined heat and power (CHP) system model.","Modelling of cells, stacks and systems based around metal-supported planar IT-SOFC cells with CGO electrolytes operating at 500-600°C",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.067
