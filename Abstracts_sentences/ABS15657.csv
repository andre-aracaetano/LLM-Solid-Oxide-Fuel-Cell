1,15657,A phase inversion-based dual-layer co-extrusion approach was advanced to fabricate micro-channel array structured micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFCs).,Fabrication and Characterization of High Performance Intermediate Temperature Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271609jes
2,15657,"The inner graphite layer was used as a sacrificial layer to eliminate the middle sponge-like layer and inner surface dense skin layer, which were normally formed using the single layer extrusion method.",Fabrication and Characterization of High Performance Intermediate Temperature Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271609jes
3,15657,"As a result, themicro-channel array generated in the outer layer was a more open structure and facile fuel/gas diffusion was obtained.",Fabrication and Characterization of High Performance Intermediate Temperature Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271609jes
4,15657,The fuel/gas permeability of such an anode substrate Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (Ni-SDC) was similar to 9 times that of an anode substrate fabricated using the phase inversion-based single layer extrusion method.,Fabrication and Characterization of High Performance Intermediate Temperature Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271609jes
5,15657,"The open circuit voltages (OCVs) of the corresponding cell Ni-SDC/SDC/PrBaCo2O5+delta were 0.89 V-0.85 V at 500-600 degrees C, much higher than those of other SDC electrolyte based MT-SOFCs.",Fabrication and Characterization of High Performance Intermediate Temperature Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271609jes
6,15657,"The peak power density of the cell was similar to 1484 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, approximately 1.5 times that of a similar cell with an anode substrate fabricated from the single layer extrusion method.",Fabrication and Characterization of High Performance Intermediate Temperature Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271609jes
7,15657,This is also the highest performance among the SOFCs with the same material system in open literature.,Fabrication and Characterization of High Performance Intermediate Temperature Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271609jes
8,15657,The fuel utilization rate was also significantly improved in different degrees depending on the supplied inlet fuel flow rates.,Fabrication and Characterization of High Performance Intermediate Temperature Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1271609jes
