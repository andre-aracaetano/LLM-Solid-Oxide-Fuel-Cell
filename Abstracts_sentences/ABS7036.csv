2,7036,A novel simulation approach accounting for state-of-the-art understanding of degradation mechanisms in the context of an operating SOFC system has been developed.,The Effects of Dynamic Dispatch on the Degradation and Lifetime of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1149/2.032111jes
3,7036,Investigative tools simulating lifetime degradation have been applied to a physical SOFC system model designed and controlled to allow dynamic dispatch.,The Effects of Dynamic Dispatch on the Degradation and Lifetime of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1149/2.032111jes
4,7036,"The system was operated in two modes (a) constant power output mode, and (b) diurnal dynamic dispatch mode.",The Effects of Dynamic Dispatch on the Degradation and Lifetime of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1149/2.032111jes
5,7036,Results show that on a time basis the dynamically dispatched SOFC system proved more durable and degraded less than a system operated at constant full-power output.,The Effects of Dynamic Dispatch on the Degradation and Lifetime of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1149/2.032111jes
6,7036,"The net energy production over the stack lifetime was roughly equivalent between the two modes (1.5 to 2 kWh cm(-2)), with the dynamically dispatched fuel cell operating longer, degrading less and producing more power during highly valued peak demand periods.",The Effects of Dynamic Dispatch on the Degradation and Lifetime of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1149/2.032111jes
