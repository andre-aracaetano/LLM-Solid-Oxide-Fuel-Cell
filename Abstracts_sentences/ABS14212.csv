5,14212,"Without a ceria interlayer, maximum power density (P-max) of 547 mW cm(-2) is achieved at 800 degrees C with wet H-2 (3% H2O) as fuel and ambient air as oxidant in the single cell with the configuration of Sr2Fe4/3M2/3O6 vertical bar La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3 (LSGM)vertical bar La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF).",Sr2Fe4/3Mo2/3O6 as anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.036
6,14212,The P-max even increases to 595 mW cm(-2) when the cell is operated at a constant current load at 800 degrees C for additional 15 h. This anode material also shows carbon resistance and sulfur tolerance.,Sr2Fe4/3Mo2/3O6 as anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.036
7,14212,The P-max is about 130 mWcm(-2) in wet CH4 (3% H2O) and 472 mW cm(-2) in H-2 With 100ppm H2S. The cell performance can be effectively recovered after changing the fuel gas back to H-2.,Sr2Fe4/3Mo2/3O6 as anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.036
