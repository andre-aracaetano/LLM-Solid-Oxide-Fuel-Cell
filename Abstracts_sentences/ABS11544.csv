3,11544,The cell exhibits a peak power density of 1.3 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and excellent stability with no degradation during polarization at 500 mA cm-2 and 750 degrees C for 175 h. Microscopic and spectroscopic analysis show that the electrochemical polarization promotes the formation of electrode/electrolyte interface in operando and exsolution of Pd/PdO nanoparticles.,"Nb and Pd co-doped La0.57Sr0.38Co0.19Fe0.665Nb0.095Pd0.05O3-δ as a stable, high performance electrode for barrier-layer-free Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.12.066
4,11544,"The Nb doping in the B-site of LSCF significantly reduces the Sr surface segregation, enhancing the stability of the cathode, while the exsoluted PdJPdO nanoparticles increases the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction.","Nb and Pd co-doped La0.57Sr0.38Co0.19Fe0.665Nb0.095Pd0.05O3-δ as a stable, high performance electrode for barrier-layer-free Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.12.066
