4,10775,This paper presents the latest results concerning performance improvement through variations of the processing route and the microstructure Of La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) and La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-type SOFCs.,"Performance improvement of (La, Sr)MnO3 and (La, Sr) x (Co, Fe)O3-type anode-supported SOFCs",10.1115/1.2205359
5,10775,"In the case of the LSM-type single cells, the following aspects relating to the electrochemical performance were investigated in more detail: (1) production of the anode substrate by tape casting versus warm pressing; (2) deposition of the anode functional layer (AFL) and electrolyte by screen printing versus vacuum slip casting; (3) use of noncalcined and non-ground YSZ for applying the cathode functional layer (CFL); and (4) sintering temperature of the CFL and cathode current collector layer (CCCL).","Performance improvement of (La, Sr)MnO3 and (La, Sr) x (Co, Fe)O3-type anode-supported SOFCs",10.1115/1.2205359
6,10775,"In the case of LSCF-type cells, a systematic approach was initiated for optimizing the Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (CGO) diffusion barrier layer: (1) deposition techniques of the CGO layer and (2) sintering temperature of the screen-printed CGO layer Results have shown that certain modifications of the processing route led to a slightly lower electrochemical performance, whereas others did not affect the performance at all.","Performance improvement of (La, Sr)MnO3 and (La, Sr) x (Co, Fe)O3-type anode-supported SOFCs",10.1115/1.2205359
7,10775,"Regarding LSCF-type SOFCs, a slight improvement of the performance was achieved by optimizing the sintering temperature of the CGO layer.","Performance improvement of (La, Sr)MnO3 and (La, Sr) x (Co, Fe)O3-type anode-supported SOFCs",10.1115/1.2205359
