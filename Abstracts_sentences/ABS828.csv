1,828,"A microtubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with an anode functional layer (AFL) consisting of NiO-Sc stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) between the electrolyte (ScSZ) and the anode (NiO-Y stabilized zirconia) has been fabricated and evaluated at low fuel supplement condition of H(2), 6 mL min(-1) per electrode area of 1 cm(2), in order to discuss the effect of the AFL on the fuel cell energy efficiency.",Effect of anode functional layer on energy efficiency of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.06.011
2,828,"The effect of the AFL has clearly seen in the improvement of the power density as well as fuel utilization, resulting in the improvement of the energy efficiency.",Effect of anode functional layer on energy efficiency of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.06.011
3,828,"The performance of the cell simply improves from 0.27 to 0.45 W cm(-2), and 0.35 to 0.52 W cm(-2) when the anode functional layer is introduced, and the energy efficiency reached 41 and 47% (LHV) at 650 and 700 degrees C, respectively using diluted hydrogen as a fuel.",Effect of anode functional layer on energy efficiency of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.06.011
