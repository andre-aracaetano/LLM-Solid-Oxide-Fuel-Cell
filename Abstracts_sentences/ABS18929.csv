1,18929,The sintering behavior of Ni/Y2O3-ZrO2 (YSZ) cermet electrode coating on 3 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte was studied under moist and dry hydrogen atmosphere at 1000degreesC for up to 2000 h.,Sintering behavior of Ni/Y2O3-ZrO2 cermet electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1025936317472
2,18929,"The sintering behavior of Ni/YSZ cermet electrodes was dominated by the agglomeration and grain growth of Ni particles in the cermets, which was critically related to the content of Ni and YSZ phases in the cermet.",Sintering behavior of Ni/Y2O3-ZrO2 cermet electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1025936317472
