1,20712,"Crystals of (ZrO2)(1-x)(Sc2O3)(x) solid solutions with x=0.035, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.11 have been grown for the first time using the directional crystallization technique.","Melt growth, structure and properties of (ZrO2)1-x(Sc2O3)x solid solution crystals (x=0.035-0.11)",10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.03.004
2,20712,"Analysis of the scandium distribution along the crystal showed that the composition of all specimens is homogeneous, and the Sc2O3 concentration is almost identical to its content in the charge.","Melt growth, structure and properties of (ZrO2)1-x(Sc2O3)x solid solution crystals (x=0.035-0.11)",10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.03.004
3,20712,"All specimens exhibit a little decline in the scandium concentration along the crystal, this indicating that the effective distribution coefficient Sc is slightly greater than 1.","Melt growth, structure and properties of (ZrO2)1-x(Sc2O3)x solid solution crystals (x=0.035-0.11)",10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.03.004
4,20712,"The structure of as-grown crystals has been studied as a function of the Sc2O3 stabilising oxide concentration by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy.","Melt growth, structure and properties of (ZrO2)1-x(Sc2O3)x solid solution crystals (x=0.035-0.11)",10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.03.004
5,20712,"Crystals containing 3.5 mol% Sc2O3 are a mixture of the monoclinic and tetragonal phases, the crystals containing 6 mol% Sc2O3 have a tetragonal structure, those with 9 mol% Sc2O3 have the tetragonal phase with inclusions of the rhombohedral one and the specimens with 11 mol% Sc2O3 represent the rhombohedral phase with inclusions of the cubic phase.","Melt growth, structure and properties of (ZrO2)1-x(Sc2O3)x solid solution crystals (x=0.035-0.11)",10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.03.004

7,20712,"The conductivity of the scandia stabilized crystals, in spite of their inhomogeneity, presence of stresses and low fracture toughness, is comparable with that of the yttria stabilized zirconia crystals.","Melt growth, structure and properties of (ZrO2)1-x(Sc2O3)x solid solution crystals (x=0.035-0.11)",10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.03.004
