3,16778,High-temperature XRD measurement demonstrates that the codoping of Ce and Y can stabilize the cubic perovskite of BFCY in investigated temperature range from room temperature to 900 degrees C. BFCY material exhibits a moderate average thermal expansion coefficient of 22.08 x 10(-6) K-1 smaller than cobalt-based cathode and good chemical compatibility with BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY) electrolyte after the calcining treatment at 1000 degrees C. XPS analysis indicates the existence of Ce3+/4+ and Fe3+/4+ ions and abundant oxygen vacancies in BFCY powder surface.,Study on Ce and Y co-doped BaFeO3-δ cubic perovskite as free-cobalt cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.188
