1,1737,A considerable interest has been shown in the application of doped ceria (CeO2) compounds for intermediate (300-500 degrees C) temperature operation of solid oxide fuel cells.,Design of nanostructured ceria-based solid electrolytes for development of IT-SOFC,10.1007/s10008-007-0444-8
2,1737,"The microdomains with ordered structure of oxygen vacancy were observed in the microstructure of the M-doped CeO2-sintered bodies (where M: Gd, Y, and Dy).",Design of nanostructured ceria-based solid electrolytes for development of IT-SOFC,10.1007/s10008-007-0444-8
3,1737,We have previously shown that the conductivity of doped CeO2-sintered bodies was lower when the sintered body contained large microdomains within grains.,Design of nanostructured ceria-based solid electrolytes for development of IT-SOFC,10.1007/s10008-007-0444-8
4,1737,"As a consequence of this observation, we have examined the grain size dependence and dopant content on conductivity in specimens where we adjust the microdomain size and a degree of oxygen vacancy ordering in the microdomains by controlling the microstructure.",Design of nanostructured ceria-based solid electrolytes for development of IT-SOFC,10.1007/s10008-007-0444-8
5,1737,The microdomain size control in Dy-doped CeO2 specimens was obtained by combining pulsed electric current sintering and conventional sintering.,Design of nanostructured ceria-based solid electrolytes for development of IT-SOFC,10.1007/s10008-007-0444-8
6,1737,"Using these techniques, we were able to improve the conductivity in Dy-doped CeO2 specimens to a point where it became comparable to that of the more conventional Gd-doped CeO2 specimens.",Design of nanostructured ceria-based solid electrolytes for development of IT-SOFC,10.1007/s10008-007-0444-8
7,1737,"It is concluded that by combining ultimate high-resolution analysis of these nanostructures with the adjusting processing route design, it is possible to further develop these materials in CeO2-doped fuel cell application.",Design of nanostructured ceria-based solid electrolytes for development of IT-SOFC,10.1007/s10008-007-0444-8
