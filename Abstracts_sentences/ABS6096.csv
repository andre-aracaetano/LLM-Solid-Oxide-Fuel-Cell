1,6096,Template-assisted fabrication based on polystyrene (PS) colloidal crystals has been used to prepare three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3-DOM) thin films of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ).,Template-assisted fabrication of macroporous thin films for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/b915882k
2,6096,This material has direct application in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Template-assisted fabrication of macroporous thin films for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/b915882k
3,6096,"High quality 3-DOM thin films were successfully fabricated, and the microstructures of both the polystyrene opal and the thus-prepared YSZ thin film were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",Template-assisted fabrication of macroporous thin films for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/b915882k
4,6096,"Remarkably although a large shrinkage of the thin film was observed, the YSZ domains still retained adherence to the substrate.",Template-assisted fabrication of macroporous thin films for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/b915882k
5,6096,A new mechanism for shrinkage is proposed and discussed.,Template-assisted fabrication of macroporous thin films for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/b915882k
