3,12581,"The electrode polarization resistance of a 1.8 mg cm(-2) BSCF-impregnated LSM cathode is 0.18 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, which is similar to 12 times lower than that of pure LSM.","Nanostructured (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Impregnated (La,Sr)MnO3 Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/1.3428366
4,12581,"A single cell with an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte film and the nanostructured BSCF/LSM cathode exhibits maximum power densities of 1.21 and 0.32 W cm(-2) at 800 and 650 degrees C, respectively.","Nanostructured (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Impregnated (La,Sr)MnO3 Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/1.3428366
5,12581,The atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies of the electrode/electrolyte interface before and after polarization indicate that the impregnation of BSCF extends the three-phase boundary area for the oxygen reduction reaction from the electrode/electrolyte interface to the electrode bulk.,"Nanostructured (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Impregnated (La,Sr)MnO3 Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/1.3428366
6,12581,The formation of a second phase was also observed by AFM for the BSCF-impregnated LSM after being heat-treated at 800 degrees C though its phase could not be identified due to the extremely small amount of the second phase particles on the YSZ electrolyte surface.,"Nanostructured (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Impregnated (La,Sr)MnO3 Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/1.3428366
