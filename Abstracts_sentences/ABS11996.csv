1,11996,"This paper reports the development of a coating approach that simultaneously achieves the advantages of conductive (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel coatings and of rare earth (RE) surface treatment on ferritic stainless steels for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) interconnect applications.","Ce-modified (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1149/1.2929066
2,11996,"This approach involves the modification of (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 spinel coatings through addition of a RE element to the spinel composition.","Ce-modified (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1149/1.2929066
3,11996,"In particular, Ce-modified spinel coatings (Ce0.05Mn1.475Co1.475O4) behaved similarly to unmodified Mn1.5Co1.5O4 spinel coatings by acting as a Cr-outward and O-inward diffusion barrier, thus improving the surface stability and electrical performance of ferritic stainless steel.","Ce-modified (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1149/1.2929066
4,11996,"In addition, the RE addition appeared to alter the scale growth behavior beneath the coating, so that alloy samples with the Ce-modified spinel coating exhibited a more adherent scale/metal interface compared to samples with the unmodified spinel coating.","Ce-modified (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1149/1.2929066
5,11996,"As a result, it is anticipated that compared to unmodified spinel coatings, the RE-modified coatings may lead to improved structural stability and electrical performance for ferritic stainless steel-based SOFC interconnects.","Ce-modified (Mn,Co)3O4 spinel coatings on ferritic stainless steels for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1149/1.2929066
