1,10621,A samaria-doped ceria (SDC)-NiO composite powder produced by spray pyrolysis (SP) was employed as the anode material for medium-temperature (800 degrees C) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,High-performance Ni-SDC cermet anode for solid oxide fuel cells at medium operating temperature,
2,10621,Ni-SDC cermet electrodes were prepared with the expectation that their mixed conducting nature would enhance the electrode reaction rate and improve the operation efficiency of the SOFC.,High-performance Ni-SDC cermet anode for solid oxide fuel cells at medium operating temperature,

4,10621,The anodic polarization was strongly influenced by the microstructure of the anode.,High-performance Ni-SDC cermet anode for solid oxide fuel cells at medium operating temperature,
5,10621,"The lowest anode polarization of the samples sintered at 1300 degrees C for a current density of 200 mA/cm(2) was about 30 mV. This high performance seems to be due to the microstructure, in which Ni particles form a skeleton with well-connected SDC particles finely distributed over the Ni particle surfaces.",High-performance Ni-SDC cermet anode for solid oxide fuel cells at medium operating temperature,
