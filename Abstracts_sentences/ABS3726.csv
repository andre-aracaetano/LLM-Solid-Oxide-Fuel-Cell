3,3726,The sealing process was optimized for the most promising composition and joined Crofer22APU/glass-ceramic sealant/YSZ samples were morphologically characterized and tested for 300 h in humidified hydrogen atmosphere at the fuel cell operating temperature of 800 degrees C.,New glass and glass-ceramic sealants for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2009.09.033
4,3726,The study showed that the use of the glass-ceramic was successful in joining the YSZ ceramic electrolyte to the Crofer22APU metallic interconnect and in preventing severe corrosion effects at the Crofer22APU/glass-ceramic interface after static treatments in humidified hydrogen at 800 degrees C for 300 h.
