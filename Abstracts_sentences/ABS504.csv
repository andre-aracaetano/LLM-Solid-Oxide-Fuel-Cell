2,504,The previous studies mostly investigated the performance of ethanol-fuelled fuel cells based on a thermodynamic analysis and neglected the presence of actual losses encountered in a real SOFC operation.,Performance of an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with direct-internal reforming of ethanol,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.07.006
3,504,"Therefore, the real performance of an anode-supported SOFC with direct-internal reforming operation is investigated here using a one-dimensional isothermal model coupled with a detailed electrochemical model for computing ohmic, activation, and concentration overpotentials.",Performance of an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with direct-internal reforming of ethanol,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.07.006
4,504,"Effects of design and operating parameters, i.e., anode thickness, temperature, pressure, and degree of ethanol pre-reforming, on fuel cell performance are analyzed.",Performance of an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with direct-internal reforming of ethanol,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.07.006
5,504,"The simulation results show that when SOFC is operated at the standard conditions (V = 0.65 V, T = 1023 K, and P = 1 atm), the average power density of 0.51 W cm(-2) is obtained and the activation overpotentials represent a major loss in the fuel cell, followed by the ohmic and concentration losses.",Performance of an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with direct-internal reforming of ethanol,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.07.006
6,504,An increase in the thickness of anode decreases fuel cell efficiency due to increased anode concentration overpotential.,Performance of an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with direct-internal reforming of ethanol,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.07.006
7,504,"The performance of the anode-supported SOFC fuelled by ethanol can be improved by either increasing temperature, pressure, degree of pre-reforming of ethanol, and steam to ethanol molar ratio or decreasing the anode thickness and fuel flow rate at inlet.",Performance of an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with direct-internal reforming of ethanol,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.07.006
8,504,It is suggested that the anode thickness and operating conditions should be carefully determined to optimize fuel cell efficiency and fuel utilization.,Performance of an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with direct-internal reforming of ethanol,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.07.006
