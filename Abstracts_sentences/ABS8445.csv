1,8445,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on a thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte membrane supported by a nickel-based anode often suffers from undesirable reaction/diffusion between the Ni anode and the LSGM during high-temperature co-firing.,High-performance solid oxide fuel cells based on a thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte membrane supported by a nickel-based anode of unique architecture,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.10.008
2,8445,"In this study, a high performance intermediate-temperature SOFC is fabricated by depositing thin LSGM electrolyte membranes on a LSGM backbone of unique architecture coated with nano-sized Ni and Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (GDC) particles via a combination of freeze-drying tape-casting, slurry drop-coating, and solution infiltration.",High-performance solid oxide fuel cells based on a thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte membrane supported by a nickel-based anode of unique architecture,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.10.008
3,8445,"The thickness of the dense LSGM electrolyte membranes is similar to 30 mu m while the undesirable reaction/diffusion between Ni and LSGM are effectively hindered because of the relatively low firing temperature, as confirmed by XRD analysis.",High-performance solid oxide fuel cells based on a thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte membrane supported by a nickel-based anode of unique architecture,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.10.008
