4,14335,"Based on the measurement data, we analyzed the ratio of ionic current density to electronic current density in the temperature range of 550-900 degrees C. Assuming that the area-specific resistance of the electrolyte and the external current density were 0.383 Omega cm(2) and 0.25 A cm(-2), respectively, the leakage current densities caused by the minority carriers were calculated to be 5.4% and 9.7% of the external current density at 550 degrees C and 600 degrees C, respectively.",Physicochemical properties of proton-conductive Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1AYb0.1)O3-δ solid electrolyte in terms of electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.265
