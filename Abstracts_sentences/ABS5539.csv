3,5539,"These anodes were adherent to the electrolyte when reduced in H-2 but were found to be unstable during operation in dry methanol, leading to delamination of the anode from the electrolyte.",Methanol as a direct fuel in intermediate temperature (500-600 °C) solid oxide fuel cells with copper based anodes,10.1016/j.ces.2005.05.030
4,5539,"CeO2 impregnated Cu electrodes were found to be resistant to delamination, act as methanol decomposition catalysts and displayed reasonable performance when running on dry methanol, with no sign of coke formation.",Methanol as a direct fuel in intermediate temperature (500-600 °C) solid oxide fuel cells with copper based anodes,10.1016/j.ces.2005.05.030
5,5539,"However, these anodes undergo sintering when operating at 600 degrees C, leading to loss of methanol decomposition catalytic activity and an increase in the area specific resistance for hydrogen electrooxidation.",Methanol as a direct fuel in intermediate temperature (500-600 °C) solid oxide fuel cells with copper based anodes,10.1016/j.ces.2005.05.030
