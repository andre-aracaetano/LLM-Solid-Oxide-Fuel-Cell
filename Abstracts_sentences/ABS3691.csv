1,3691,"Anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with Cu-CeO2-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode, YSZ electrolyte film, and silver cathode were fabricated.",A verification of the reaction mechanism of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-012-1866-5
2,3691,"The cells were tested with 5 wt% Fe-loaded activated carbon and dry CO, respectively, and their performances were compared to verify the reaction mechanism of direct carbon SOFCs (DC-SOFCs).",A verification of the reaction mechanism of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-012-1866-5
3,3691,"The corresponding current-voltage curves and impedance characteristics of the cells operating on these two different fuels were found to be almost the same at high temperatures, demonstrating the presumed mechanism that the anode reaction of a DC-SOFC is the electrochemical oxidation of CO, just as in a SOFC operated directly on CO.",A verification of the reaction mechanism of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-012-1866-5
4,3691,Some experimental evidences including the difference in open circuit voltage at different temperatures and the operating stability of the cells were analyzed in detail.,A verification of the reaction mechanism of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-012-1866-5
