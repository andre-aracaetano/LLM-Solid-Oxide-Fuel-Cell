1,12931,Epitaxial zirconia and ceria thin films have been of interest recently as components of solid oxide fuel cells and other devices as well as means to study interfacial and strain effects on ion motion.,Fabrication of epitaxial zirconia and ceria thin films with arbitrary dopant and host atom composition,10.1016/j.tsf.2012.09.013
2,12931,These films are typically fabricated by one of a variety of physical vapor deposition methods.,Fabrication of epitaxial zirconia and ceria thin films with arbitrary dopant and host atom composition,10.1016/j.tsf.2012.09.013
3,12931,One difficulty in these studies is that the film composition is fixed by the composition of a ceramic or metal alloy target.,Fabrication of epitaxial zirconia and ceria thin films with arbitrary dopant and host atom composition,10.1016/j.tsf.2012.09.013

5,12931,"Reactive co-sputtering was performed using pure elemental targets of Zr, Ce, Y, and Gd onto (100) MgO substrates.",Fabrication of epitaxial zirconia and ceria thin films with arbitrary dopant and host atom composition,10.1016/j.tsf.2012.09.013
6,12931,"The use of metal targets allowed for high purity and, by varying the relative sputtering powers and deposition time, the composition and thickness of single or multi-layer thin films was controlled.",Fabrication of epitaxial zirconia and ceria thin films with arbitrary dopant and host atom composition,10.1016/j.tsf.2012.09.013
7,12931,"X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy showed that yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) films deposited on (100) MgO substrates at a substrate temperature of 400 degrees C were epitaxially grown along the (100) direction, while gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) films had no epitaxial relationship.",Fabrication of epitaxial zirconia and ceria thin films with arbitrary dopant and host atom composition,10.1016/j.tsf.2012.09.013
8,12931,"Still, it was found that a YSZ film could be used as a buffer layer on the MgO substrates to enable epitaxial growth of the GDC film in the (100) orientation.",Fabrication of epitaxial zirconia and ceria thin films with arbitrary dopant and host atom composition,10.1016/j.tsf.2012.09.013
