1,9378,A series of LaSr1-xBixGa3O7+0.5x (0 <= x <= 0.4) materials have been synthesized by a traditional solid state reaction method.,High oxide ion conductivity in the Bi3+ doped melilite LaSrGa3O7,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.12.363
2,9378,"The Bi3+ ions enter the lattice of LaSrGa3O7 and occupy the La/Sr sites, which is validated by Rietveld refinement and Energy Dispersion Spectrum (EDS) analysis, introducing interstitial oxide ions into the structure.",High oxide ion conductivity in the Bi3+ doped melilite LaSrGa3O7,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.12.363
3,9378,"The formation energy of this interstitial defect calculated by density functional theory (DFT) is -2.21 eV, consistent with the high solid solubility of Bi3+ in LaSrGa3O7 from experimental data.",High oxide ion conductivity in the Bi3+ doped melilite LaSrGa3O7,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.12.363
4,9378,"The substitution of Bi3+ ions for Sr2+ ions can significantly enhance the oxide ion conductivity, e.g. 1.62 x 10(-2) Scm(-1) at 800 degrees C for x = 0.4, making these materials promising for practical application in SOFCs and oxygen separation membrane.",High oxide ion conductivity in the Bi3+ doped melilite LaSrGa3O7,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.12.363
