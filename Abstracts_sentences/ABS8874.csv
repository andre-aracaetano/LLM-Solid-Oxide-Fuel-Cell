2,8874,Gastightness is one of the most important properties of the interconnect in a planar-type SOFC.,Hydrogen permeation through Fe-16Cr alloy interconnect in atmosphere simulating SOFC at 1073 K,10.1149/1.1767349
3,8874,"Hydrogen permeation in an iron-chromium alloy was measured in an atmosphere simulating an SOFC at 1073 K. Hydrogen permeability of the oxide scale, which was mainly composed of Cr2O3, was estimated by comparison between experimental results and calculation.",Hydrogen permeation through Fe-16Cr alloy interconnect in atmosphere simulating SOFC at 1073 K,10.1149/1.1767349
4,8874,"The result was approximately 1.3 x 10(-13) mol m(-1) s(-1) Pa-1/2 at 1073 K, which is about four orders of magnitude lower than that of iron.",Hydrogen permeation through Fe-16Cr alloy interconnect in atmosphere simulating SOFC at 1073 K,10.1149/1.1767349
5,8874,"This study revealed quantitatively that the oxide layer, mainly consisting of Cr2O3, that formed on the alloy suppressed hydrogen permeation.",Hydrogen permeation through Fe-16Cr alloy interconnect in atmosphere simulating SOFC at 1073 K,10.1149/1.1767349
