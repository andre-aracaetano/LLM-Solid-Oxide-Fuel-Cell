1,11379,"After 10,000 h solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack operation, the Cr-poisoning situation in (La0.6Sr0.4) (Co0.2Fe0.8)O-3 (LSCF)-based cathode material is depicted in this work.","Cr-poisoning in (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 cathodes after 10,000 h SOFC stack testing",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.045
2,11379,"Systematic Cr profiling by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), from post-operation samples taken at different locations within the air flow field, reveals Cr accumulation in electrochemically active cathode regions, although the major amount of Cr is trapped in inactive surface-proximal cathode regions; the 20 m LSCF current collector does not fully impede the Cr access to the functional cathode.","Cr-poisoning in (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 cathodes after 10,000 h SOFC stack testing",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.045
3,11379,"The distribution of Cr within the flow field reports on the severity of the sources and causes for Cr contamination: 1) Cr preferentially accumulates at sealing-proximal locations; this is explained by fuel-leakage through the sealing with subsequent water vapor generation in the cathode compartment, aggravating local Cr-poisoning via the Cr-oxyhydroxide vapor species; 2) high Cr amounts at air inlet regions point to system components located upstream of the cell to contribute to local Cr contamination; 3) the remaining main part of the cell experiences low Cr-poisoning; the protective solution to prevent Cr evaporation from the metallic interconnects thus appears to be adequate.","Cr-poisoning in (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 cathodes after 10,000 h SOFC stack testing",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.045
4,11379,"The detected low overall amounts of Cr contamination, partially correlated to the observed low performance degradation, encouragingly indicate 40,000 h operation, a prerequisite for stationary SOFC application, to be in reach for LSCF-based stacks.","Cr-poisoning in (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 cathodes after 10,000 h SOFC stack testing",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.045
