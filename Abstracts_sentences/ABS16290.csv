1,16290,"The excellent performance, recently reported in the literature, of a solid-state oxygen concentration cell equipped with an alkali carbonate-based electrode has been interpreted in accordance with the proposition that the carbonate is an alkali-ion conductor.",Molten Alkali Carbonate as an Effective Oxygen Electrode for a Solid Oxide Electrolyte Galvanic Cell,10.1149/2.0091407jss
2,16290,This interpretation is the consequence of all facts known about the electrochemical behavior of solid and liquid alkali carbonates.,Molten Alkali Carbonate as an Effective Oxygen Electrode for a Solid Oxide Electrolyte Galvanic Cell,10.1149/2.0091407jss
3,16290,"The new view allows to refrain from postulating fast-diffusing peroxycarbonate ions as prerequisite for the function of the electrode and, thus, is much more realistic considering the bulkiness and voluminousness, of the peroxycarbonate ion in comparison with an alkali ion.",Molten Alkali Carbonate as an Effective Oxygen Electrode for a Solid Oxide Electrolyte Galvanic Cell,10.1149/2.0091407jss
