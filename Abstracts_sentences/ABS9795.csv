1,9795,"The oxidation of methane has been studied by sequential flow reaction experiments over M-8YSZ and M-CeO2/8YSZ (M=Ni, Cu, Co, Ag) catalysts as a function of CH4/O-2 from 773 to 1073 K. Over Ni-8YSZ and Ni-CeO2/8YSZ, methane pyrolysis is dominant leading to surface carbon formation at temperatures of 873 K and above.","Methane oxidation over M-8YSZ and M-CeO2/8YSZ (M = Ni, Cu, Co, Ag) catalysts",10.1007/s10562-005-9185-4
2,9795,"While the addition of ceria to Ni-8YSZ to produce Ni-CeO2/8YSZ does not significantly affect the reaction kinetics, the activity of Cu-CeO2/8YSZ, Co-CeO2/8YSZ, and Ag-CeO2/8YSZ are higher than their M-8YSZ counterparts.","Methane oxidation over M-8YSZ and M-CeO2/8YSZ (M = Ni, Cu, Co, Ag) catalysts",10.1007/s10562-005-9185-4
3,9795,The activity of Co-CeO2/8YSZ at high temperatures (973 K and above) is higher than Ni-8YSZ with selectivity towards partial methane oxidation and CO formation.,"Methane oxidation over M-8YSZ and M-CeO2/8YSZ (M = Ni, Cu, Co, Ag) catalysts",10.1007/s10562-005-9185-4
4,9795,"Considering Ni-based catalysts are prone to deactivation due to surface carbon accumulation, Co-CeO2/8YSZ, Cu-CeO2/8YSZ, and Ag-CeO2/8YSZ are possible alternative anode cermets for direct hydrocarbon oxidation solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC).","Methane oxidation over M-8YSZ and M-CeO2/8YSZ (M = Ni, Cu, Co, Ag) catalysts",10.1007/s10562-005-9185-4
