3,3192,"Xray diffraction (XRD) and conductivity measurement show that CO2 has no detrimental effects on BCFN electrode at 600 degrees C. However, the reaction between BCFN and CO2 will occur because of surface oxygen loss of BCFN at 800 degrees C. Most importantly, the electrochemical impedance spectrum results show that BCFN electrode contaminated by CO2 can be recovered by purging air again.",Mechanism analysis of CO2 corrosion on Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.11.095
