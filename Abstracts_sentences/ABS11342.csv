2,11342,BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-$ (BZCYYb) displays both good proton conduc-tivity and stability among all of the barium zirconate-cerate oxides such as BaZr0.1Ce0.7-Y0.2O3-$ (BZCY) with proton conducting.,High-performance solid oxide fuel cell based on iron and tantalum co-doped BaCoO3-8 perovskite-type cathode and BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-8 electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.030
3,11342,"In this study, an Fe and Ta co-doped perovskite-type oxide with the composition of BaCo0.7Fe0.2Ta0.1O3-$ (BCFT) is synthesized by the solid state reaction (SSR) method and studied as a high-performance cathode for H-SOFCs operated between 650 and 800 & DEG;C. The BCFT is chemically compatible with BZCYYb elec-trolyte, even co-sintering at 1000 & DEG;C for 10 h. The activating energy (Ea) of electrical con-ductivity for the BCFT sample is only 0.038 eV.",High-performance solid oxide fuel cell based on iron and tantalum co-doped BaCoO3-8 perovskite-type cathode and BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-8 electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.030

6,11342,"The peak power density (PPD) of the anode -supported H-SOFC using BCFT is 1.65 W cm-2 and the Rp is 0.01 U cm2 at 800 & DEG;C. There-fore, the BCFT is a promising cathode for H-SOFCs based on BZCYYb electrolyte.",High-performance solid oxide fuel cell based on iron and tantalum co-doped BaCoO3-8 perovskite-type cathode and BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-8 electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.030
