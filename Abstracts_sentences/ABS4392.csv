2,4392,"Model cells with a dense cathode interlayer demonstrated a compressive stress of -100s MPa at room temperature, and the results were comparable to those from X-ray diffraction.",Application of in-situ Raman scattering spectroscopy for stress condition measurement in solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.16275
3,4392,"Model cells with a porous interlayer showed complex stress conditions that deviated from in-plane stress due to their porosity, and the model cell was confirmed not to be suitable for this method.",Application of in-situ Raman scattering spectroscopy for stress condition measurement in solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.16275
4,4392,"At high temperatures, compressive stress was found to decrease as temperature increased and was almost neutral at the operating temperatures of the fuel cell, with good replication.",Application of in-situ Raman scattering spectroscopy for stress condition measurement in solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.16275
