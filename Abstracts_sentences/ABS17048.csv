1,17048,Sulfur poisoning behavior of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3- (LSCF6428) cathode was investigated at T=1073K (800 degrees C) under 0.1ppm of SO2-air mixture gas; the amount of supplied SO2 was controlled by changing the flow rate.,Evaluation of Sulfur Dioxide Poisoning for LSCF Cathodes,10.1002/fuce.201200172
2,17048,Two stages of the performance degradation were found: a rapid degradation at the early stage and a subsequent monotonic degradation.,Evaluation of Sulfur Dioxide Poisoning for LSCF Cathodes,10.1002/fuce.201200172
3,17048,The elemental distributions of SrSO4 showed a strong correlation between the electrochemically active sites and SrSO4 reaction sites in the vicinity of the LSCF6428/10GDC interfaces.,Evaluation of Sulfur Dioxide Poisoning for LSCF Cathodes,10.1002/fuce.201200172
4,17048,"Considerations were made to attribute the first and the second stages of performance degradation to the SO2 adsorption and the SrSO4 formation, respectively.",Evaluation of Sulfur Dioxide Poisoning for LSCF Cathodes,10.1002/fuce.201200172
5,17048,The SO2 adsorption mechanism was discussed in terms of the high concentration of oxide ion vacancies in the electrochemically active region under the cathodic polarization condition.,Evaluation of Sulfur Dioxide Poisoning for LSCF Cathodes,10.1002/fuce.201200172
