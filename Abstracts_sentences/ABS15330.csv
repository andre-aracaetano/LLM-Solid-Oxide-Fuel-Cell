3,15330,The model accurately captures the Gerischer-like frequency dependence and the oxygen partial pressure dependence of the impedance of symmetric cathode cells.,Heterogeneous electrocatalysis in porous cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.120

5,15330,"As in classical catalysis, the electrocatalytic activity is controlled by an effective Thiele modulus, which is the ratio of the surface diffusion length (mean distance from an adsorption site to the triple phase boundary) to the surface boundary layer length (square root of surface diffusivity divided by the adsorption rate constant).",Heterogeneous electrocatalysis in porous cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.120
6,15330,"The Thiele modulus must be larger than one in order to maintain high surface coverage of reaction intermediates, but care must be taken in order to guarantee a sufficient triple phase boundary density.",Heterogeneous electrocatalysis in porous cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.120
