2,2683,"XRD results show that the phases of Y doped BaZrO3 and Y and Zn co-doped BaCeO3 were identified for the composite electrolytes calcined at 1000 degrees C for 3 h. After sintering at 1350 degrees C for 5 h, only one phase is observed by XRD, which suggests the formation of BaZrO3-BaCeO3 solid solution.","Synthesis, microstructure and electrical properties of BaZr0.9Y0.1O3-δ:BaCe0.86Y0.1Zn0.04O3-δ proton conductors",10.1016/j.mseb.2015.03.001
