1,20808,A novel conducting ceramics Sm0.9Sr0.1Al0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (SSAM9155) was prepared by the organic gel method combined with a solid state sintering technique.,Preparation and Electrical Properties of a New Type of Conducting Ceramics Sm0.9Sr0.1Al0.5Mn0.5O3-δ,
2,20808,"The thermal decomposition and phase inversion processes of the gel precursors, crystal structure, phase stability against reduction and microscopic morphology of the sinters were studied by using TG/DTA, FTIR, XRD and SEM.",Preparation and Electrical Properties of a New Type of Conducting Ceramics Sm0.9Sr0.1Al0.5Mn0.5O3-δ,
3,20808,"The electrical conductivities of sintered ceramics in both air and H-2 were measured by the direct current four-wire method, and the electronic transport mechanism in this conducting ceramic was investigated.",Preparation and Electrical Properties of a New Type of Conducting Ceramics Sm0.9Sr0.1Al0.5Mn0.5O3-δ,
4,20808,"The experimental results show that the well-crystallized nanopowders with tetragonal perovskite structure can be obtained by calcining the gel precursors at 900 degrees C for 5 h. The electrical conductivity of SSAM9155 ceramics is dominated by P-type electronic conduction and increases with temperature, indicating that the mechanism of electronic transport is the hopping of p-type small polaron.",Preparation and Electrical Properties of a New Type of Conducting Ceramics Sm0.9Sr0.1Al0.5Mn0.5O3-δ,
5,20808,"With increasing calcination temperature and prolonging soaking time, both the electrical conductivity and relative density of SSAM9155 ceramics become larger initially and then decrease.",Preparation and Electrical Properties of a New Type of Conducting Ceramics Sm0.9Sr0.1Al0.5Mn0.5O3-δ,
6,20808,The sample sintered at 1600 degrees C for 10 h has the highest relative density of 98% with electrical conductivity reaching 8.21 S.cm(-1) in air and 1.26 S.cm(-1) in H-2 at 850 degrees C.,Preparation and Electrical Properties of a New Type of Conducting Ceramics Sm0.9Sr0.1Al0.5Mn0.5O3-δ,
7,20808,"The apparent activation energies for SSAM9155 in air and H-2 were calculated to be 0.265 and 0.465 eV, respectively.",Preparation and Electrical Properties of a New Type of Conducting Ceramics Sm0.9Sr0.1Al0.5Mn0.5O3-δ,
