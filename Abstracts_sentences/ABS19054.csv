1,19054,"In the present study the long-term behaviour of two ferritic steels, Crofer 22 APU and Crofer 22H, in contact with a Ni-mesh during exposure in simulated anode gas, Ar-4%H-2-2%H2O, at 700 and 800 degrees C for exposure times up to 3000 h was investigated.",Long-term behaviour of solid oxide fuel cell interconnect materials in contact with Ni-mesh during exposure in simulated anode gas at 700 and 800 °C,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.189
2,19054,Ni diffusion from the Ni-mesh into the steel resulted in the formation of an austenitic zone whereas diffusion of iron and chromium from the steel into the Ni-mesh resulted in the formation of chromia base oxides In the Ni-mesh.,Long-term behaviour of solid oxide fuel cell interconnect materials in contact with Ni-mesh during exposure in simulated anode gas at 700 and 800 °C,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.189
3,19054,"Depending on the chemical composition of the steel, the temperature and the exposure time, interdiffusion processes between ferritic steel and Ni-mesh also resulted in sigma-phase formation at the austenite-ferrite interface and in Laves-phase dissolution in the austenitic zone.",Long-term behaviour of solid oxide fuel cell interconnect materials in contact with Ni-mesh during exposure in simulated anode gas at 700 and 800 °C,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.189
