1,20469,"Apatite-type rare earth based oxides, such as R-doped lanthanum oxides of general formula La-9.33(RO4)(6)O-2 with R = Ge, Si, exhibit high ionic conductivity and low activation energy at moderate temperatures, when compared to the yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte making them potential materials to be used in the range 500-700 degrees C, for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",On the influence of silica type on the structural integrity of dense La9.33Si2Ge4O26 electrolytes for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.12.024
2,20469,"In this study, dense oxyapatite-based La9.33Si2Ge4O26 electrolytes have been successfully prepared either by electrical sintering at 1400 degrees C or microwave hybrid sintering at 1350 degrees C for 1 h from La2O3, SiO2 and GeO2 powders dry milled at 350 rpm for 15 h in a planetary ball mill.",On the influence of silica type on the structural integrity of dense La9.33Si2Ge4O26 electrolytes for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.12.024
3,20469,The densification behaviour of the apatite-type phase synthesized by mechanical alloying was found to be dependent on the grade of SiO2 used: either pre-milled quartz powder or amorphous nanosized fumed silica.,On the influence of silica type on the structural integrity of dense La9.33Si2Ge4O26 electrolytes for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.12.024
4,20469,"The influence of the silica type on the La9.33Si2Ge4O26 integrity was assessed by dynamic Young's modulus, microhardcness and indentation fracture toughness measurements.",On the influence of silica type on the structural integrity of dense La9.33Si2Ge4O26 electrolytes for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.12.024
5,20469,A good correlation between the degree of densification (as observed by SEM/EDS) and the resulting mechanical properties could be established.,On the influence of silica type on the structural integrity of dense La9.33Si2Ge4O26 electrolytes for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.12.024
6,20469,"Pre-milling of quartz powder has favoured higher densification rates to be attained suggesting that both Fe content, resulting from the dry milling (as determined by PIXE analyses) and crystallinity of SiO2 do promote densification of these electrolytes thereby improving their structural integrity.",On the influence of silica type on the structural integrity of dense La9.33Si2Ge4O26 electrolytes for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.12.024
