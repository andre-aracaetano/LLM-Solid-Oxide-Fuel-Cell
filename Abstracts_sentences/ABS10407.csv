1,10407,"Compared with type-2 fuzzy sets, the secondary membership degree of interval type-3 fuzzy sets is an interval rather than crisp value, which makes interval type-3 fuzzy sets can obtain more degree of freedoms.",An interval type-3 fuzzy PID control system design and its application in solid oxide fuel cells power plant,10.3233/JIFS-231460
2,10407,This article studies an interval type-3 fuzzy PID controller based on interval type-3 fuzz sets.,An interval type-3 fuzzy PID control system design and its application in solid oxide fuel cells power plant,10.3233/JIFS-231460
3,10407,"The framework of interval type-3 fuzzy PID controller is identical with type-2 fuzzy PID controller, but it contains more adjustment controller parameters and its type reduction procedure is more complex.",An interval type-3 fuzzy PID control system design and its application in solid oxide fuel cells power plant,10.3233/JIFS-231460
4,10407,"In this paper, type reduction of interval type-3 fuzzy sets is derived from general type-2 fuzzy sets represented by alpha-plane and a direct NT type reduction algorithm is applied.",An interval type-3 fuzzy PID control system design and its application in solid oxide fuel cells power plant,10.3233/JIFS-231460
5,10407,"The control effects of interval type-3 fuzzy PID controller are firstly tested by 2 nonlinear plants, the simulation results show that interval type-3 fuzzy PID controller has better control performance indexes than PID controller, type-1 fuzzy PID controller, interval type-2 fuzzy PID controller and general type-2 fuzzy PID controller.",An interval type-3 fuzzy PID control system design and its application in solid oxide fuel cells power plant,10.3233/JIFS-231460
