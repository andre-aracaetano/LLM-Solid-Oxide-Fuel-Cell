6,15955,"The bulk resistance (R-o) and the electrode polarization resistance (R-p) at open circuit voltages (OCV) at 750 degrees C are 9.06 Omega cm(2) and 10.57 Omega cm(2), respectively.",Synthesis and characterization of a Sr0.95Y0.05TiO3-δ-based hydrogen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1039/c4ra11973h
7,15955,"The R-o values have a small amount of changes with small slopes both in the SOFC (-0.29 Omega cm(2) V-1) and SOEC mode (0.5 Omega cm(2) V-1), whereas the Rp values decrease all the time with the increasing voltages at both the SOFC (-2.59 Omega cm(2) V-1) and SOEC mode (-9.65 Omega cm(2) V-1), indicating that the electrical conductivity and electro-catalytic property of the SYT-based hydrogen electrode can be improved under the SOEC mode.",Synthesis and characterization of a Sr0.95Y0.05TiO3-δ-based hydrogen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1039/c4ra11973h
