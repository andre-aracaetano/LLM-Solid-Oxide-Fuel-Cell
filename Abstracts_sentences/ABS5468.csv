3,5468,"The results suggest that the migration of protons to TPBs and the surface diffusion of O-ad(-) might be the limiting reactions for SSC-BCS composite cathodes in wet atmosphere, while the oxygen ions transferring into electrolyte, the reducing of O-ad to O-ad(-), and surad face diffusion of O-ad(-) might be the limiting reactions for SSC-BCS composite cathode in dry atmosphere.",Cathode reaction models and performance analysis of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-BaCe0.8Sm0.2O3-δ composite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells with proton conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.053
