1,20083,"Ruddlesden-popper (La, Sr)FeO4+delta perovskite oxide with excellent redox stability shows insufficient electrochemical catalytic activity for CO2 reduction because of low conductivity and oxygen vacancy concentration.","Robust Ni-doped Ruddlesden-popper (La,Sr)Fe1-xNixO4-δ oxide as solid oxide cells fuel electrode for CO2 electrolysis",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.054
2,20083,"In this work, Ni modified (La, Sr)Fe1-xNixO4+delta cathode was developed to improve the conductivity and catalytic activity for CO2 electrolysis.","Robust Ni-doped Ruddlesden-popper (La,Sr)Fe1-xNixO4-δ oxide as solid oxide cells fuel electrode for CO2 electrolysis",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.054
3,20083,"The introduction of the Ni element significantly increases the conductivity of (La, Sr)FeO4+delta perovskite oxide in both air and 50%CO2/CO due to the increasing charge carrier's concentration.","Robust Ni-doped Ruddlesden-popper (La,Sr)Fe1-xNixO4-δ oxide as solid oxide cells fuel electrode for CO2 electrolysis",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.054
4,20083,"Furthermore, the symmetric cell with (La, Sr)Fe0.9Ni0.1O4+delta (RPLSFNi0.1) electrode exhibits the lowest polarization resistance in 50%CO2/CO, suggesting that the RPLSFNi0.1 electrode has the best catalytic activity for CO2 electrolysis.","Robust Ni-doped Ruddlesden-popper (La,Sr)Fe1-xNixO4-δ oxide as solid oxide cells fuel electrode for CO2 electrolysis",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.054
5,20083,"Moreover, the addition of Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) in RPLSFNi0.1 electrode further enhances the electrochemical performance, and the current density of -1170 mA cm(-2) is obtained at 850 degrees C and 1.5 V.","Robust Ni-doped Ruddlesden-popper (La,Sr)Fe1-xNixO4-δ oxide as solid oxide cells fuel electrode for CO2 electrolysis",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.054
6,20083,"In addition, the electrolysis cell exhibits excellent reversible cycling operating stability between 0.6 V at fuel cell mode and 1.2 V at electrolysis mode, indicating that RPLSFNi0.1 is a robust cathode material for solid oxide cells (SOCs) fuel electrode.","Robust Ni-doped Ruddlesden-popper (La,Sr)Fe1-xNixO4-δ oxide as solid oxide cells fuel electrode for CO2 electrolysis",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.054
