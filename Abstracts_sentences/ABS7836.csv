6,7836,"The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the investigated glass-ceramics varied between (9.06-10.14) x 10(-6) K-1 after heat treatment at SOFC operating temperature for a duration varying between 1 h and 200 h. Further, low electrical conductivity, good joining behavior and negligible reactivity with metallic interconnects (Crofer22 APU and Sanergy HT) in air indicate that the investigated glass-ceramics are suitable candidates for further experimentation as sealants in SOFC.",Stable glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cells: Influence of Bi2O3 doping,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.04.106
