3,14155,Doping with >= 2 mol% CaO results in a decrease in apparent grain-boundary resistivity at 300 degrees C from 746.7 k Omega cm to 2.8-3.5 k Omega cm.,Effect of CaO concentration on enhancement of grain-boundary conduction in gadolinia-doped ceria,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.041
4,14155,The total resistivity exhibits a minimum at 2 mol% CaO. Further increase in CaO concentration to 10 mol% results in an increase in grain-interior resistivity from 3.1 to 40 k Omega cm.,Effect of CaO concentration on enhancement of grain-boundary conduction in gadolinia-doped ceria,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.041
