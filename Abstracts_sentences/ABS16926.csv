1,16926,The authors used differential scanning calorimetry and high temperature oxide melt calorimetry to investigate the interface energies in various multilayer systems.,Synthesis and calorimetric studies of oxide multilayer systems: Solid oxide fuel cell cathode and electrolyte materials,10.1116/1.3420396
2,16926,"For yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/Al2O3 multilayers, the presence of interfaces is shown to affect the temperature and the enthalpy of crystallization; and therefore these interfaces play an important role in phase stability.",Synthesis and calorimetric studies of oxide multilayer systems: Solid oxide fuel cell cathode and electrolyte materials,10.1116/1.3420396
3,16926,"From the thermal analysis results, it can be concluded that in YSZ/Al2O3 multilayers, the Al2O3 crystallization temperature increases and the enthalpy becomes less exothermic compared to the values for single alumina films.",Synthesis and calorimetric studies of oxide multilayer systems: Solid oxide fuel cell cathode and electrolyte materials,10.1116/1.3420396
4,16926,It is also shown that crystalline perovskite films of La(Sr)MnO3 can be deposited on NaCl substrates and can be collected from the substrate after the deposition which makes them suitable for high temperature calorimetry.,Synthesis and calorimetric studies of oxide multilayer systems: Solid oxide fuel cell cathode and electrolyte materials,10.1116/1.3420396
