1,6144,A fabrication technology has been developed for a novel high-performance solid oxide fuel cells with honeycomb structure via the extrusion of a cathode-honeycomb monolith and subsequent channel surface coating with electrolyte/anode bilayers.,A Slurry Injection Method for the Fabrication of Multiple Microchannel SOFCs,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.02981.x
2,6144,A novel coating technique for the preparation of dense electrolyte films on the channel surfaces in cathode honeycomb supports is reported.,A Slurry Injection Method for the Fabrication of Multiple Microchannel SOFCs,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.02981.x
3,6144,"When the dipping method is used, the high viscous resistance of the electrolyte slurry inhibited slurry penetration into the microchannels, which resulted in insufficient channel surface coating.",A Slurry Injection Method for the Fabrication of Multiple Microchannel SOFCs,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.02981.x
4,6144,"By contrast, the newly developed channel coating technique, i.e. the slurry injection method, allowed the slurry to be injected into the honeycomb channels without the formation of any coating defects.",A Slurry Injection Method for the Fabrication of Multiple Microchannel SOFCs,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.02981.x
