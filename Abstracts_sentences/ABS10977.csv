1,10977,BaCO3 nanoparticles were infiltrated into a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3- (LSCF) electrode as a synergistic catalyst to enhance the performance of proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs).,Effect of Infiltration of Barium Carbonate Nanoparticles on the Electrochemical Performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11837-018-3098-3
2,10977,Electrochemical impedance analysis showed that the polarization resistance was dramatically reduced by nearly 75% from 1.123cm(2) to 0.293cm(2) at 700 degrees C after infiltration of BaCO3 nanoparticles.,Effect of Infiltration of Barium Carbonate Nanoparticles on the Electrochemical Performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11837-018-3098-3
3,10977,"The chemical stability between the BaCO3 and LSCF electrode was investigated by running a long-term 300-h test, during which the polarization resistance exhibited only minor degradation (2.22-2.20cm(2)).",Effect of Infiltration of Barium Carbonate Nanoparticles on the Electrochemical Performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11837-018-3098-3
4,10977,"In addition, single cells with infiltrated LSCF electrode and BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3- (BCZYYb) electrolyte yielded a maximum power density of 404mWcm(-2) at 700 degrees C, much higher than cells with a bare LSCF electrode (268mWcm(-2) at 700 degrees C).",Effect of Infiltration of Barium Carbonate Nanoparticles on the Electrochemical Performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11837-018-3098-3
5,10977,BaCO3 demonstrated promising performance enhancements of LSCF electrodes for H-SOFCs and warrants further development.,Effect of Infiltration of Barium Carbonate Nanoparticles on the Electrochemical Performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11837-018-3098-3
