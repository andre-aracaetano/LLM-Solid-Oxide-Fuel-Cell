2,19885,The effect of anodic polarization current passage on the electrode behavior and microstructure of the LSM- and GDC-impregnated LSM anodes is investigated under low and high currents at 800 degrees C.,"Development of (Gd,Ce)O2-Impregnated (La,Sr)MnO3 Anodes of High Temperature Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells",10.1149/1.3481436
3,19885,The results show that the electrocatalytic activity of the freshly prepared LSM is enhanced by the anodic polarization due to the reduction of LSM agglomerates and shrinkage of LSM particles under oxidation conditions at low polarization currents.,"Development of (Gd,Ce)O2-Impregnated (La,Sr)MnO3 Anodes of High Temperature Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells",10.1149/1.3481436
4,19885,"However, high polarization current leads to the delamination at the interface, resulting in a significant increase in electrode polarization and ohmic resistances for the oxygen oxidation reaction.","Development of (Gd,Ce)O2-Impregnated (La,Sr)MnO3 Anodes of High Temperature Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells",10.1149/1.3481436
