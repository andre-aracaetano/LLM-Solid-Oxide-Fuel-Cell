1,17046,The oxidation kinetics and electrical properties of oxide scales thermally grown on the surface of a commercial ferritic alloy have been investigated on the un-oxidized and pre-oxidized alloys as functions of temperature and time under oxidizing atmospheres with four different electrodes.,Characterization of iron-based alloy interconnects for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00329-X
2,17046,"Oxidation kinetic studies with the un-oxidized alloys show a nearly parabolic dependence on time of oxide-scale growth rate, but a significantly increased growth rate with a coating of LSCo (La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta) compared to those without and with the coatings of LSM (La0.85Sr0.15MnO3) +",Characterization of iron-based alloy interconnects for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00329-X

4,17046,Short-term resistance measurements in stagnant air as a function of temperature with pre-oxidized alloys indicate that the oxide scale has a semiconducting transport property.,Characterization of iron-based alloy interconnects for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00329-X
5,17046,"The overall activation energy includes a term from small-polaron hopping inside the oxide scale Delta H-m and terms Delta H-i and Delta H-j from charge transfers at the electrode/oxide-scale and alloy/oxide-scale interfaces, respectively.",Characterization of iron-based alloy interconnects for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00329-X
6,17046,"For the LSCo electrode, long-term resistance measurements as a function of time with un-oxidized alloys reveal a secondary oxidation mechanism related to the formation of an insulating spinel phase in addition to a primary oxidation mechanism associated with the formation of Cr2O3.",Characterization of iron-based alloy interconnects for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00329-X
7,17046,"SEM observations show that oxidation of the un-oxidized alloy in the presence of an oxide electrode results in considerable interdiffusion of Cr and the electrode cations, especially Co, across the interfaces.",Characterization of iron-based alloy interconnects for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00329-X
8,17046,"Since the ASR values of the oxide scale measured with oxide electrodes quickly approach the permitted limit of a practical SOFC, highly recommended for prevention of a secondary electrochemical oxidation of iron-based alloy interconnects is (1) the use of an oxide coating having purely electronic conductivity and/or (2) prior-to-use conditioning of the alloys via pre-oxidation.",Characterization of iron-based alloy interconnects for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00329-X
