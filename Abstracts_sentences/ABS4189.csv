1,4189,A series of ceramic glazes based on the SiO2-CaO-B2O3-Al2O3 system as sealant for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (ITSOFC) were investigated.,SiO2-CaO-B2O3-Al2O3 ceramic glaze as sealant for planar ITSOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.10.005
2,4189,"Different ratios of B2O3/SiO2 and Al2O3/CaO were investigated to control softening process, phase separation, and crystallization.",SiO2-CaO-B2O3-Al2O3 ceramic glaze as sealant for planar ITSOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.10.005
3,4189,"When B2O3/SiO2 ratio was in the range of 0.14-0.27, the glazes showed good wetting and bonding behavior with both 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) electrolyte and stainless steel interconnect which could satisfy the sealing demand at 850 degreesC. And the dimension stability can be kept for over 100h by introducing ceramic felt and controlling the glazes viscosity in the range of 10(4) to 10(6) Pas.",SiO2-CaO-B2O3-Al2O3 ceramic glaze as sealant for planar ITSOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.10.005
4,4189,"By means of controlling Al2O3/CaO ratio in the range of 0.4-0.68, phase separation and crystallization were restrained effectively.",SiO2-CaO-B2O3-Al2O3 ceramic glaze as sealant for planar ITSOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.10.005
5,4189,"After holding at 850degreesC for 100 h, non-crystalline network in the glazes could be found, and a suitable viscous flow could well relax thermal stress.",SiO2-CaO-B2O3-Al2O3 ceramic glaze as sealant for planar ITSOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.10.005
