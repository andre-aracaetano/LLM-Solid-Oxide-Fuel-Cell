1,13634,A stable suspension has been obtained by disbursing Mn1.5Co1.5O4 (MCO) particles (100-300 nm in diameter) in ethanol using a ball milling process.,Aerosol sprayed Mn1.5Co1.5O4 protective coatings for metallic interconnect of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.096
2,13634,The suspension is used for deposition of a uniform MCO coating (5-8 mu m thick) on a steel (T441) substrate preheated to 200 degrees C by aerosol spraying.,Aerosol sprayed Mn1.5Co1.5O4 protective coatings for metallic interconnect of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.096
3,13634,"It is found that the grain size of spinel crystals in the MCO coatings ranges from 100 nm to 1 Am, and remains uniform and stable when exposed to air at 800 degrees C for 1000 h. However, a Cr-rich oxide scale of approximately 0.75 mu m thick appears between the MCO coating and the T441 substrate during the exposure.",Aerosol sprayed Mn1.5Co1.5O4 protective coatings for metallic interconnect of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.096
4,13634,"In contrast, a bare T441 sample (without the MCO coating) is oxidized significantly more under the same exposure, forming an oxide scale of 4 mu m thick.",Aerosol sprayed Mn1.5Co1.5O4 protective coatings for metallic interconnect of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.096
5,13634,The result indicates that the spinel coating had effectively improved the oxidation resistance of T441 by inhibiting the transport of Cr.,Aerosol sprayed Mn1.5Co1.5O4 protective coatings for metallic interconnect of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.096
6,13634,"Besides, the results also suggest that aerosol spraying is a simple and cost-effective method for deposition of thin and dense protective coating.",Aerosol sprayed Mn1.5Co1.5O4 protective coatings for metallic interconnect of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.096
