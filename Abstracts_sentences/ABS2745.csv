1,2745,Functionally graded solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes have been prepared from mixtures of strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) and gadolinia-doped ceria (CGO) using slurry spraying techniques.,Functionally graded composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01035-7
2,2745,Similar samples were also prepared from mixtures of LSM and ytriia-stabilised zirconia (YSZ).,Functionally graded composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01035-7
3,2745,A current collector comprising a mixture of LSM and strontium-doped lanthanum cobaltite (LSCO) was then applied to both cathode types.,Functionally graded composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01035-7
4,2745,Samples were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).,Functionally graded composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01035-7
5,2745,Characterisation using EIS techniques showed that cathodes incorporating CGO into the structure gave improved performance over those fabricated using YSZ.,Functionally graded composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01035-7
6,2745,"These performance gains were most noticeable as the temperature was decreased towards 700 degreesC, and were maintained during the testing of three cell membrane electrode assemblies fabricated to the Rolls-Royce design.",Functionally graded composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01035-7
