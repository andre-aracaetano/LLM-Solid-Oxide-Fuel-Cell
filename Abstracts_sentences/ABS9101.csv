1,9101,Heterogeneous catalysis studies were conducted on two crushed solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes in fixed-bed reactors.,Biogas Catalytic Reforming Studies on Nickel-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1002/fuce.201500179
2,9101,"The baseline anode was Ni/ScYSZ (Ni/scandia and yttria stabilized zirconia), the other was Ni/ScYSZ modified with Pd/doped ceria (Ni/ScYSZ/Pd-CGO).",Biogas Catalytic Reforming Studies on Nickel-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1002/fuce.201500179
3,9101,Three main types of experiments were performed to study catalytic activity and effect of sulfur poisoning: (i) CH4 and CO2 dissociation; (ii) biogas (60% CH4 and 40% CO2) temperature-programmed reactions (TPRxn); and (iii) steady-state biogas reforming reactions followed by postmortem catalyst characterization by temperature-programmed oxidation and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry.,Biogas Catalytic Reforming Studies on Nickel-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1002/fuce.201500179
4,9101,Results showed that Ni/ScYSZ/Pd-CGO was more active for catalytic dissociation of CH4 at 750 degrees C and subsequent reactivity of deposited carbonaceous species.,Biogas Catalytic Reforming Studies on Nickel-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1002/fuce.201500179
5,9101,Sulfur deactivated most catalytic reactions except CO2 dissociation at 750 degrees C.,Biogas Catalytic Reforming Studies on Nickel-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1002/fuce.201500179
6,9101,The presence of Pd-CGO helped to mitigate sulfur deactivation effect; e.g. lowering the onset temperature (up to 190 degrees C) for CH4 conversion during temperature-programmed reactions.,Biogas Catalytic Reforming Studies on Nickel-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1002/fuce.201500179
7,9101,Both Ni/ScYSZ and Ni/ScYSZ/Pd-CGO anode catalysts were more active for dry reforming of biogas than they were for steam reforming.,Biogas Catalytic Reforming Studies on Nickel-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1002/fuce.201500179
8,9101,Deactivation of reforming activity by sulfur was much more severe under steam reforming conditions than dry reforming; a result of greater sulfur retention on the catalyst surface during steam reforming.,Biogas Catalytic Reforming Studies on Nickel-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1002/fuce.201500179
