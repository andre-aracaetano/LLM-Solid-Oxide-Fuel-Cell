1,8429,This paper presents a comparative exergy study of the performance of various gas turbine power generation plants and a high temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC).,Exergy analysis of a combined fuel cell and Gas Turbine Power Plant with intercooling and reheating,10.1504/IJEX.2010.031241
2,8429,"The overall system is analysed and its exergy efficiency and exergy destruction are obtained, as well as individual models of each component.",Exergy analysis of a combined fuel cell and Gas Turbine Power Plant with intercooling and reheating,10.1504/IJEX.2010.031241
3,8429,The results for selected operating conditions are compared against past literature data.,Exergy analysis of a combined fuel cell and Gas Turbine Power Plant with intercooling and reheating,10.1504/IJEX.2010.031241
4,8429,"Comparisons are presented in terms of thermal and exergy efficiencies, net power and exergy destruction rate, vs. the compression ratio and Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT).",Exergy analysis of a combined fuel cell and Gas Turbine Power Plant with intercooling and reheating,10.1504/IJEX.2010.031241
5,8429,It is found that integrating a conventional GT plant with an SOFC can nearly double the efficiency of the cycle.,Exergy analysis of a combined fuel cell and Gas Turbine Power Plant with intercooling and reheating,10.1504/IJEX.2010.031241
