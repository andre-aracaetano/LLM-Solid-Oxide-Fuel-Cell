2,8520,Developing and designing suitable anode materials for DC-SOFC is substantial scientific challenge.,La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite electrodes as anodes in LaGaO3-based direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11771-022-5045-2
3,8520,"Herein we investigated the use of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (LSCM-GDC) composite electrodes as anodes for La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta electrolyte-based DC-SOFCs, with Camellia oleifera shell char as the carbon fuel The LSCM-GDC-anode DC-SOFC delivered a maximum power density of 221 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C and it significantly improved to 425 mW/cm(2) after Ni nanoparticles were introduced into the LSCM-GDC anode through wet impregnation The microstructures of the prepared anodes were characterized, and the stability of the anode in a DC-SOFC and the influence of catalytic activity on open circuit voltage were studied The above results indicate that LSCM-GDC anode is promising to be applied in DC-SOFCs.",La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite electrodes as anodes in LaGaO3-based direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11771-022-5045-2
