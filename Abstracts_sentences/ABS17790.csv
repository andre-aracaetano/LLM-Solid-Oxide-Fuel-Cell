1,17790,A Pd doped perovskite La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.9Ni0.05Pd0.05O3 (LSCNP) was investigated as a candidate for a metal-free anode material of solid oxide fuel cell.,La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.9Ni0.05Pd0.05O3 Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.08we167
2,17790,The deposition and the solid dissolution by reduction and oxidation treatment were observed by FE-SEM and the change of crystal structure was observed by XRD.,La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.9Ni0.05Pd0.05O3 Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.08we167
3,17790,The performance of anode prepared by mixing LSCNP and Sm doped ceria (SDC) was measured using H-2 and dry CH4 as fuel.,La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.9Ni0.05Pd0.05O3 Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.08we167
