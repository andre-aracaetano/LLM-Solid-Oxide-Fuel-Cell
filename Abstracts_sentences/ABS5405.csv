1,5405,"Ni/NiFe 2 coatings with different thickness of Ni were deposited on 50-h pre -oxidized SUS 430 steel by magnetron sputtering for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) interconnects application, which were subsequently exposed to 800 degrees C air for durations of up to 5040 h. Ni/NiFe 2 coating was thermally converted to an oxide structure comprising inner NiO layer and outer NiFe 2 O 4 spinel layer.",The performance of NiO/NiFe2O4 coated pre-oxidized SUS 430 interconnect with different NiO thickness for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.04.311
