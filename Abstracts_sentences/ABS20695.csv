3,20695,"Herein, we report new hexagonal perovskite-related oxides Ba3W1+xV1-xO8.5+x/2 (x = -0.1, -0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.75).",Improved Oxide Ion Conductivity of Hexagonal Perovskite-Related Oxides Ba3W1+xV1-xO8.5+x/2,10.3390/inorganics11060238
4,20695,The bulk conductivity of Ba3W1.6V0.4O8.8 was found to be 21 times higher than that of the mother material Ba3WVO8.5,Improved Oxide Ion Conductivity of Hexagonal Perovskite-Related Oxides Ba3W1+xV1-xO8.5+x/2,10.3390/inorganics11060238
5,20695,at 500 & DEG;C. Maximum entropy method (MEM) neutron scattering length density (NSLD) analyses of neutron diffraction data at 800 & DEG;C experimentally visualized the oxide ion diffusion pathways through the octahedral O2 and tetrahedral O3 sites in intrinsically oxygen-deficient layers.,Improved Oxide Ion Conductivity of Hexagonal Perovskite-Related Oxides Ba3W1+xV1-xO8.5+x/2,10.3390/inorganics11060238
6,20695,"By increasing the excess W content x in Ba3W1+xV1-xO8.5+x/2, the excess oxygen content x/2 increases, which leads to more oxygen atoms at the O2 and O3 oxygen sites, a higher minimum NSLD on the O2-O3 path, and a higher level of conductivity.",Improved Oxide Ion Conductivity of Hexagonal Perovskite-Related Oxides Ba3W1+xV1-xO8.5+x/2,10.3390/inorganics11060238
7,20695,"Another reason for the increased conductivity of Ba3W1.6V0.4O8.8 is the lower activation energy for oxide ion conduction, which can be ascribed to the longer (W/V)-O2 and (W/V)-O3 distances due to the substitution of V atoms with large-sized W species.",Improved Oxide Ion Conductivity of Hexagonal Perovskite-Related Oxides Ba3W1+xV1-xO8.5+x/2,10.3390/inorganics11060238
