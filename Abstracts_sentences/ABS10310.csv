1,10310,NiO-SDCC composites consisting of NiO mixed with Sm-doped ceria (SDC) and carbonates (Li2CO3 and Na2CO3) were sintered at different temperatures and reduced at 550 degrees C.,"Processing of composites based on NiO, samarium-doped ceria and carbonates (NiO-SDCC) as anode support for solid oxide fuel cells",10.2298/PAC1703206M
2,10310,The influence of reduction on structure of the NiO-SDCC anode support for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was investigated.,"Processing of composites based on NiO, samarium-doped ceria and carbonates (NiO-SDCC) as anode support for solid oxide fuel cells",10.2298/PAC1703206M
3,10310,"Raman spectra of the NiO-SDCC samples sintered at 500, 600 and 700 degrees C showed that after reducing at 550 degrees C NiO was reduced to Ni.","Processing of composites based on NiO, samarium-doped ceria and carbonates (NiO-SDCC) as anode support for solid oxide fuel cells",10.2298/PAC1703206M
4,10310,"In addition, SDC and carbonates (Li2CO3 and Na2CO3) did not undergo chemical transformation after reduction and were still detected in the samples.","Processing of composites based on NiO, samarium-doped ceria and carbonates (NiO-SDCC) as anode support for solid oxide fuel cells",10.2298/PAC1703206M
5,10310,"However, no Raman modes of carbonates were identified in the NiO-SDCC pellet sintered at 1000 degrees C and reduced at 550 degrees C.","Processing of composites based on NiO, samarium-doped ceria and carbonates (NiO-SDCC) as anode support for solid oxide fuel cells",10.2298/PAC1703206M
6,10310,It is suspected that carbonates were decomposed at high sintering temperature and eliminated due to the reaction between the CO32- and hydrogen ions during reduction in humidified gases at 550 degrees C.,"Processing of composites based on NiO, samarium-doped ceria and carbonates (NiO-SDCC) as anode support for solid oxide fuel cells",10.2298/PAC1703206M
7,10310,The carbonate decomposition increased porosity in the Ni-SDCC pellets and consequently caused formation of brittle and fragile structure unappropriated for SOFC application.,"Processing of composites based on NiO, samarium-doped ceria and carbonates (NiO-SDCC) as anode support for solid oxide fuel cells",10.2298/PAC1703206M
8,10310,Because of that composite NiO-SDC samples without carbonates were also analysed to determine the factors affecting the crack formation.,"Processing of composites based on NiO, samarium-doped ceria and carbonates (NiO-SDCC) as anode support for solid oxide fuel cells",10.2298/PAC1703206M
9,10310,"In addition, it was shown that the different reduction temperatures also influenced the microstructure and porosity of the pellets.","Processing of composites based on NiO, samarium-doped ceria and carbonates (NiO-SDCC) as anode support for solid oxide fuel cells",10.2298/PAC1703206M
10,10310,"Thus, it was observed that Ni-SDC pellet reduced at 800 degrees C has higher electrical conductivity of well-connected microstructures and sufficient porosity than the pellet reduced at 550 degrees C.","Processing of composites based on NiO, samarium-doped ceria and carbonates (NiO-SDCC) as anode support for solid oxide fuel cells",10.2298/PAC1703206M
