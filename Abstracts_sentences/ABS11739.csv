3,11739,"One possible solution to the durability problems is to reduce the amount of Ni in the anode, although decreased Ni amount in turn reduces conductivity and electrochemical activity of the anode.",Low Ni-Containing Cermet Anodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Size-Controlled Samarium-Doped Ceria Particles,10.1149/2.0431912jes
4,11739,"In this study, Ni-SDC ( samarium-doped ceria) cermet anodes were prepared with different SDC particle sizes and Ni contents, and it was investigated how particle size ratio of the SDC and Ni affected the performance at low Ni contents.",Low Ni-Containing Cermet Anodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Size-Controlled Samarium-Doped Ceria Particles,10.1149/2.0431912jes
5,11739,"AC impedance analyses revealed that ohmic resistance was the primary factor affecting the current-voltage characteristics in the tested system, and it was found that large SDC particles were effective in reducing the ohmic resistance even with low Ni contents.",Low Ni-Containing Cermet Anodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Size-Controlled Samarium-Doped Ceria Particles,10.1149/2.0431912jes
6,11739,"The behavior of measured ohmic resistances of the anodes was well described by percolation theory, indicating that the electrical conductivity of the anodes was governed by the formation of connected Ni clusters.",Low Ni-Containing Cermet Anodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Size-Controlled Samarium-Doped Ceria Particles,10.1149/2.0431912jes
