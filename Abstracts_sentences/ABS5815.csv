1,5815,This article presents a numerical framework for the computation of the effective transport properties of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) porous electrodes from three-dimensional (3D) constructions of the microstructure.,Effective transport properties of the porous electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1177/2041296710394266
2,5815,Realistic models of the 3D microstructure of porous electrodes are first constructed from measured parameters such as porosity and particle size distribution.,Effective transport properties of the porous electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1177/2041296710394266
3,5815,Then each phase in the model geometries is tessellated with a computational grid.,Effective transport properties of the porous electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1177/2041296710394266
4,5815,"Three different types of grids are considered: Cartesian, octree, and body-fitted/cut-cell with successive levels of surface refinement.",Effective transport properties of the porous electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1177/2041296710394266
5,5815,"Finally, a finite volume method is used to compute the effective transport properties in the three phases (pore, electron, and ion) of the electrode.",Effective transport properties of the porous electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1177/2041296710394266
6,5815,"To validate the numerical approach, results obtained with the finite volume method are compared to those calculated with a random walk simulation for the case of a body-centred cubic lattice of spheres.",Effective transport properties of the porous electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1177/2041296710394266
7,5815,"Then, the influence of the sample size is investigated for random geometries with monosized particle distributions.",Effective transport properties of the porous electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1177/2041296710394266
8,5815,"Finally, effective transport properties are calculated for model geometries with polydisperse particle size distributions similar to those observed in actual SOFC electrodes.",Effective transport properties of the porous electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1177/2041296710394266
