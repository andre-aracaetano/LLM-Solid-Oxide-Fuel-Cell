1,9620,"In this work, we deposited by pulsed laser deposition nanometric layers of proton conducting calcium-doped lanthanum niobate (La0.995Ca0.005NbO4) on nickel substrates in order to fabricate model structures of the electrolyte-anode interface present in potential proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells (PC-SOFC).",XPS characterisation of the interface between anode and electrolyte in a proton conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/sia.3383
2,9620,"Characterisation by XPS of in situ reduced samples indicates the absence of chemical reaction between lanthanum niobate and nickel, confirming their reciprocal chemical stability.",XPS characterisation of the interface between anode and electrolyte in a proton conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/sia.3383
3,9620,A peak shift to higher binding energies is observed for the elements of the electrolyte material after exposure to reducing atmosphere for several hours at a typical operating temperature for PC-SOFC.,XPS characterisation of the interface between anode and electrolyte in a proton conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/sia.3383
4,9620,This shift is attributed to the formation of a space charge layer in the oxide at the interface with metallic nickel.,XPS characterisation of the interface between anode and electrolyte in a proton conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/sia.3383
