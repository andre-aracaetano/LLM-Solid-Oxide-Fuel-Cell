5,6911,"The GdSmZr2O7-40 wt.% (Li0.52Na0.48)(2)CO3 composite sintered at 600 degrees C for 1 h has a high conductivity of 0.54 S cm(-1) at a temperature of 600 degrees C. From the Arrhenius curve of the composite, the activation energy has different temperature behaviors around the knee region of 480 degrees C, where the slope changes and separates the intrinsic oxygen vacancy conduction dominated region from the 'superionic highway' region.",Preparation and characterization of GdSmZr2O7-(Li0.52Na0.48)2CO3 composite electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.06.171
