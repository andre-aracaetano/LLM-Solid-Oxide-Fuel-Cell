1,7796,A La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-8-CeO2 (LSFM-CeO2) composite was prepared by impregnating CeO2 into porous La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-8 perovskite and was used as an anode material for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-8-CeO2 anode catalyst for Co-Producing electricity and ethylene from ethane in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.05.121
2,7796,"The maximum power densities of the BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-8 (BZCY) electrolyte-supported single cell with LSFM-CeO2 as the anode reached 291 mW cm-2 and 190 mW cm-2 in hydrogen and ethane fuel at 750 degrees C, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of a single cell with only LSFM as the anode.",La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-8-CeO2 anode catalyst for Co-Producing electricity and ethylene from ethane in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.05.121
