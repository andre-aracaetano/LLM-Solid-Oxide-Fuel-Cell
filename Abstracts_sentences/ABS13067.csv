4,13067,"Compared with Y0.08Sr0.92TiO3-delta, the electrical conductivities of Y0.08Sr0.92CoxTi1-xO3-delta decrease obviously with increasing Co-doping amount at 25-1000 degrees C, while the ionic conductivities increase significantly at 500-1000 degrees C. The addition of Co can increase the oxygen vacancy concentration and enlarge the saddle point critical radius r(c), both of them should be responsible for the remarkably enhanced ionic conductivity of Y0.08Sr0.92CoxTi1-xO3-delta.",Synthesis and electrical properties of Co-doped Y0.08Sr0.92TiO3-δ as a potential SOFC anode,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.12.097
