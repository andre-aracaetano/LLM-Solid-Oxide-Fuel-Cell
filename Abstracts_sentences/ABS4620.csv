3,4620,The leakage rates are obviously reduced with temperature increased.,Effect of YSZ addition on the performance of glass-ceramic seals for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.023
4,4620,"The seal containing 20 wt% YSZ exhibits excellent gas tightness and thermal cycle stability, obtaining the leakage rate of 0.005 sccm cm(-2) under input gas pressure of 6.8 kPa at 750 degrees C. Stable leakage rates can be maintained after ten thermal cycles, implying that YSZ addition suppresses crack propagation of the seals.",Effect of YSZ addition on the performance of glass-ceramic seals for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.023
