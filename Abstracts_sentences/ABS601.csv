1,601,"In the world energy scene in recent years, there has been a tendency towards electric power generation through an integration of alternatives sources.",Power unit SOFC-MTG model in Electromagnetic Transient Software PSCAD,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.119
2,601,"In this context, fuel cells are considered a new type of generating unit that has the ability to generate electrical power through direct conversion of fuels.",Power unit SOFC-MTG model in Electromagnetic Transient Software PSCAD,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.119
3,601,"In the case of stationary electric power generation, the solid oxide fuel cell is interesting, since it can be powered directly by natural gas, and has a high efficiency when compared to thermal machines; yet their exhaust gases have a temperature and pressure suitable for insertion in gas microturbines, which increases the system's efficiency.",Power unit SOFC-MTG model in Electromagnetic Transient Software PSCAD,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.119
4,601,This study looks at the modeling of the solid oxide fuel cell and gas microturbine as well as the performance analysis from simulations in Electromagnetic Transient Software (PSCAD/EMTDC).,Power unit SOFC-MTG model in Electromagnetic Transient Software PSCAD,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.119
