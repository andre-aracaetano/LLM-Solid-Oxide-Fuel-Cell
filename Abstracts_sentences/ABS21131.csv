2,21131,"In this capacity, oxygen transport through the material is pivotal.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
3,21131,"Here, we explore whether oxygen transport is influenced (desirably increased) compared with transport within the bulk parent material by traversing to the nanoscale.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
4,21131,"In particular, atomistic models for ceria nanocrystals, including perfect: CeO2; reduced: CeO1.95 and doped: Rh0.1Ce0.9O1.95, have been generated.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
5,21131,The nanocrystals were about 8 nm in diameter and each comprised about 16 000 atoms.,"Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
6,21131,"Oxygen transport can also be influenced, sometimes profoundly, by microstructural features such as dislocations and grain-boundaries.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
7,21131,"However, these are difficult to generate within an atomistic model using, for example, symmetry operations.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
8,21131,"Accordingly, we crystallised the nanocrystals from an amorphous precursor, which facilitated the evolution of a variety of microstructures including: twin-boundaries and more general grain-boundaries and grain-junctions, dislocations and epitaxy, isolated and associated point defects.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
9,21131,"The shapes of the nanocrystals are in accord with HRTEM data and comprise octahedral morphologies with {111} surfaces, truncated by (dipolar) {100} surfaces together with a complex array of steps, edges and corners.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
10,21131,"Oxygen transport data was then calculated using these models and compared with data calculated previously for CeO1.97/YSZ thin films and the (bulk) parent material, CeO1.97.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
11,21131,Oxygen transport was calculated to increase in the order: CeO2 nanocrystal < (reduced) CeO1.95 nanocrystal E Rh0.1Ce0.9O1.95 nanocrystal < CeO1.97/YSZ thin film < (reduced) CeO1.97 (bulk) parent material; the mechanism was determined to be primarily vacancy driven.,"Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
12,21131,Our. ndings indicate that reducing one-(thin film) or especially three- (nanocrystal) dimensions to the nanoscale may prove deleterious to oxygen transport.,"Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
13,21131,"Conversely, we observed dynamic evolution and annihilation of surface vacancies via surface oxygens migrating to the bulk of the nanocrystal; the vacancies left are then filled by other oxygens moving to the surface.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
14,21131,"Coupled with previous simulation studies, in which we calculated that oxygen extraction from the surface of a ceria nanocrystal was energetically easier compared with the bulk surface, our calculations predict that ceria nanocrystals would facilitate effective oxidative catalysis.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
15,21131,"This study describes framework simulation procedures, which can be used in partnership with experiment, to explore transport in nanocrystalline ionic systems, which include complex microstructures.","Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
16,21131,Such data can provide predictions for experiment or help reduce the number of experiments required.,"Oxygen transport in unreduced, reduced and Rh(III)-doped CeO2 nanocrystals",10.1039/b601521b
