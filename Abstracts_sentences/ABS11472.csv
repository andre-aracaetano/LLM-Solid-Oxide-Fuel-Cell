1,11472,The deposition of an amorphous La-Cr-O thin film on a stainless steel was done by radio frequency magnetron sputtering to obtain a protective coating on the metallic interconnect for solid oxide fuel cells.,Nano-structured self-assembled LaCrO3 thin film deposited by RF-magnetron sputtering on a stainless steel interconnect material,10.1016/j.compositesb.2003.08.004
2,11472,"The deposited film was amorphous, but underwent two-phase transformations to the perovskite structure as a result of annealing at 700 degreesC for 1 h. The first transformation was from amorphous to the monoclinic LaCrO4 monazite type compound.",Nano-structured self-assembled LaCrO3 thin film deposited by RF-magnetron sputtering on a stainless steel interconnect material,10.1016/j.compositesb.2003.08.004
3,11472,The second transformation was from LaCrO4 to orthorhombic LaCrO3 perovskite.,Nano-structured self-assembled LaCrO3 thin film deposited by RF-magnetron sputtering on a stainless steel interconnect material,10.1016/j.compositesb.2003.08.004
4,11472,As a result of the phase transformation nano-structured self-assembled dendritic structure was formed with the desired perovskite phase.,Nano-structured self-assembled LaCrO3 thin film deposited by RF-magnetron sputtering on a stainless steel interconnect material,10.1016/j.compositesb.2003.08.004
5,11472,"The structural characterization of the film was done by X-ray diffraction, phase shift microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and micro-Raman spectroscopy.",Nano-structured self-assembled LaCrO3 thin film deposited by RF-magnetron sputtering on a stainless steel interconnect material,10.1016/j.compositesb.2003.08.004
