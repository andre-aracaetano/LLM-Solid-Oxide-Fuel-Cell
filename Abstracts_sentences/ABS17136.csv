2,17136,The effects of the added amount as well as the sintering temperature on the microstructure and electrical properties of the 3Y-TZP/Al2O3 composites were investigated.,Microstructure and electrical conductivity of 3Y-TZP/Al2O3 composites,
3,17136,The alumina addition was found to affect the microstructure of the 3Y-TZP samples obtained after sintering at 1400 or 1500 degrees C only to a slight extent.,Microstructure and electrical conductivity of 3Y-TZP/Al2O3 composites,
4,17136,"The lowest values of the blocking factor, which represents the contribution of grain boundary resistivity to the total resistivity of a polycrystal, were observed for the 3Y-TZP with Al2O3 additions of 0.25 or 0.5 mol% at measurement temperatures of 550 and 600 degrees C.",Microstructure and electrical conductivity of 3Y-TZP/Al2O3 composites,
