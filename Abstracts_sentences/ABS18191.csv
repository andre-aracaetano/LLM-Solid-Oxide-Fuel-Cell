1,18191,"The chemical and structural stability of two commercial multicomponent silicate glasses (SCN and G6) in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was investigated after exposure times of up to 40,000 h in air at 800 degrees C. With exposure time, interfacial layers develop at the SCN-YSZ and G6-YSZ interfaces, which were characterized in detail using both quantitative chemical analysis and atomic-resolution imaging.","Evolution of the structure and chemical composition of the interface between multi-component silicate glasses and yttria-stabilized zirconia after 40,000 h exposure in air at 800 째C",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.11.013
