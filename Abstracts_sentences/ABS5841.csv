1,5841,Enhancing the density of catalytic sites is crucial for improving the performance of energy conversion devices.,Enhancing Charge Transfer Kinetics by Nanoscale Catalytic Cermet Interlayer,10.1021/am3019788
2,5841,This work demonstrates the kinetic role of 2 nm thin YSZ/Pt cermet layers on enhancing the oxygen reduction kinetics for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Enhancing Charge Transfer Kinetics by Nanoscale Catalytic Cermet Interlayer,10.1021/am3019788
3,5841,Cermet layers were deposited between the porous Pt cathode and the dense YSZ electrolyte wafer using atomic layer deposition (ALD).,Enhancing Charge Transfer Kinetics by Nanoscale Catalytic Cermet Interlayer,10.1021/am3019788
4,5841,Not only the catalytic role of the cermet layer itself but the mixing effect in the cermet was explored.,Enhancing Charge Transfer Kinetics by Nanoscale Catalytic Cermet Interlayer,10.1021/am3019788
5,5841,"For cells with unmixed and fully mixed cermet interlayers, the maximum power density was enhanced by a factor of 1.5 and 1.8 at 400 degrees C, and by 2.3 and 2.7 at 450 degrees C, respectively, when compared to control cells with no cermet interlayer.",Enhancing Charge Transfer Kinetics by Nanoscale Catalytic Cermet Interlayer,10.1021/am3019788
6,5841,The observed enhancement in cell performance is believed to be due to the increased triple phase boundary (TPB) density in the cermet interlayer.,Enhancing Charge Transfer Kinetics by Nanoscale Catalytic Cermet Interlayer,10.1021/am3019788
7,5841,"We also believe that the sustained kinetics for the fully mixed cermet layer sample stems from better thermal stability of Pt islands separated by the ALD YSZ matrix, which helped to maintain the high-density TPBs even at elevated temperature.",Enhancing Charge Transfer Kinetics by Nanoscale Catalytic Cermet Interlayer,10.1021/am3019788
