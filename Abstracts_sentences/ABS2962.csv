3,2962,The fuel required by the SOFC system is produced inside the energy generator box from an integrated biomass gasification system.,CFD model for tubular SOFC directly fed by biomass,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.147
4,2962,"This study stems from the European DB-SOFC project, that proposed the exploitation of the abundant biomasses deriving from agricultural residues for energetic purposes (as from olive oil and wine production).",CFD model for tubular SOFC directly fed by biomass,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.147
5,2962,"In this study, the main processes have been simulated to find a possible configuration to obtain a power value of 200 W. 25 cells were used in the model to produce the required power.",CFD model for tubular SOFC directly fed by biomass,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.147
6,2962,"The results showed that at 0.7 Vit is possible to achieve 12.3 W, when the biomass gasification was integrated into the SOFC box, while it was possible to achieve 9.6 W when the system was fed by externally produced syngas.",CFD model for tubular SOFC directly fed by biomass,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.147
