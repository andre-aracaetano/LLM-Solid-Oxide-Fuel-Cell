1,9806,"In this paper, methodology to estimate GHG emissions from electricity generation sector using Iran as an example was first explained.","Greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel-fired power plants: current status and reduction potentials, case study of Iran and Canada",10.1504/IJGW.2010.033719
2,9806,Then different scenarios to reduce GHG emissions were evaluated for two countries: Canada and Iran.,"Greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel-fired power plants: current status and reduction potentials, case study of Iran and Canada",10.1504/IJGW.2010.033719
3,9806,The results demonstrated that there were great potentials for GHG emission reduction in both countries.,"Greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel-fired power plants: current status and reduction potentials, case study of Iran and Canada",10.1504/IJGW.2010.033719
4,9806,"These potentials were evaluated by introducing eight different scenarios, including power stations' fuel switching to natural gas, replacement of existing power plants with natural gas combined cycle, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC), Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), hybrid SOFC, and SOFC-IGCC hybrid power stations, and installation of CO2 capture systems.","Greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel-fired power plants: current status and reduction potentials, case study of Iran and Canada",10.1504/IJGW.2010.033719
