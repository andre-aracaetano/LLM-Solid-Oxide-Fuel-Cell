2,17870,"Several noble metal alloy-SSZ cermet cathodes were prepared by mixing Pt, Pd, Rh and/or Ag and their alloy powders with SSZ powder using a high-energy ball mill in vacuum and pasting the cermet onto yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte.",Noble metal alloy-Zr(Sc)O2 cermet cathode for reduced-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00972-9

4,17870,The results suggest that this Pt-Ag/SSZ cermet cathode has enough activity not only at 973 K but also at 873 K.,Noble metal alloy-Zr(Sc)O2 cermet cathode for reduced-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00972-9
5,17870,"This high activity can be obtained by selecting a suitable alloy composition, ball milling a proper ratio of SSZ/noble metal mixture in vacuum and controlling the cathode thickness and the sintering temperature.",Noble metal alloy-Zr(Sc)O2 cermet cathode for reduced-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00972-9
6,17870,"By replacing the metallic component of cermet from Pt to Pt-Ag alloy (50 wt.% Pt), the quantity of Pt in cermet can be reduced to 19 from 40 Mg/cm(2) in addition to the improvement of activity from 6.7 S/cm(2) at 973 K to 12 S/cm(2) of sigma (E) at 973 K.",Noble metal alloy-Zr(Sc)O2 cermet cathode for reduced-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00972-9

9,17870,The E-a also depends on the SSZ/Pt-Ag ratio.,Noble metal alloy-Zr(Sc)O2 cermet cathode for reduced-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00972-9
10,17870,This cathode showed two optima of sigma (E) versus the SSZ/Pt-Ag ratio and a remarkable dependence on cathode thickness.,Noble metal alloy-Zr(Sc)O2 cermet cathode for reduced-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00972-9
11,17870,It was considered that the first optimum is based on two-dimensional reaction sites on YSZ electrolyte and the second optimum originates from three-dimensional expansion of reaction sites into the cermet cathode layer.,Noble metal alloy-Zr(Sc)O2 cermet cathode for reduced-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00972-9
