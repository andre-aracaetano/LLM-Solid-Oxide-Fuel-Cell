5,16581,Regeneration of Pr2-xNdxNiO4+delta from the decomposed species was observed as an abrupt mass loss in TG curves for x = 0.0-0.5 at a higher temperature; this could be regarded as the approximate equilibrium temperature for the decomposition reaction.,Evaluation of stability of Pr2-xNdxNiO4+δ by thermogravimetry under various oxygen partial pressures,10.1007/s10973-019-09190-9
