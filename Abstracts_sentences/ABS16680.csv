1,16680,"Dense, homogeneous and crack-free thin films (0.2-2 mum in thickness) of (ZrO2)0.84(YO1.5)0.16 (YSZ) were deposited on porous or dense substrates, at temperatures not exceeding 600-degrees-C, using a solution-deposition technique.",SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF YSZ THIN-FILM ELECTROLYTES,10.1016/0167-2738(94)90293-3
2,16680,The structural evolution and microstructure of the deposited films were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).,SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF YSZ THIN-FILM ELECTROLYTES,10.1016/0167-2738(94)90293-3
3,16680,Raman spectroscopy revealed the presence of fine-grain cubic YSZ at annealing temperatures as low as 600-degrees-C. Grain growth occurred at higher temperatures as detected by atomic force microscopy (AFM).,SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF YSZ THIN-FILM ELECTROLYTES,10.1016/0167-2738(94)90293-3
4,16680,ac impedance spectroscopy was used to study the electrical characteristics of the YSZ films as a function of temperature.,SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF YSZ THIN-FILM ELECTROLYTES,10.1016/0167-2738(94)90293-3
5,16680,"The ionic conductivity and activation energy of the deposited film are similar to YSZ bulk material, but no grain-boundary effect was observed in the film.",SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF YSZ THIN-FILM ELECTROLYTES,10.1016/0167-2738(94)90293-3
6,16680,The deposited films may be considered for electrolyte application in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF YSZ THIN-FILM ELECTROLYTES,10.1016/0167-2738(94)90293-3
