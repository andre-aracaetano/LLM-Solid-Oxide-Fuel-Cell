1,16405,A quasi-2D model was proposed and made available for numerical studies on the performance of a single tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) under practical operating conditions.,Numerical modeling and performance study of a tubular SOFC,10.1149/1.1647569
2,16405,"The model takes account of the air and fuel flow velocity fields, ohmic and thermodynamic heat generation, convective heat-transfer, mass transfer of participating chemical species including the electrochemical processes, and the electric potential and electric current in the electrodes and electrolyte.",Numerical modeling and performance study of a tubular SOFC,10.1149/1.1647569
3,16405,Numerical computation was carried out to test the proposed model for a single unit cell having a specific geometry being operated at a few different thermal and composition conditions for the inlet fuel and air flows.,Numerical modeling and performance study of a tubular SOFC,10.1149/1.1647569
4,16405,Obtained numerical results show that the quasi-two-dimensional approximation adopted in the model to mitigate the computational cost effectively can work reasonably well.,Numerical modeling and performance study of a tubular SOFC,10.1149/1.1647569
5,16405,"At low electric current density, the cell terminal voltage was overpredicted.",Numerical modeling and performance study of a tubular SOFC,10.1149/1.1647569
6,16405,"In order to improve the model on this point, the simple treatment adopted for the activation and concentration polarization in the model must be replaced by a more sophisticated approach in future studies.",Numerical modeling and performance study of a tubular SOFC,10.1149/1.1647569
7,16405,"Discussions were further given concerning the obtained results for the overall cell performance and the detailed features of the velocity, thermal, and mass-transfer fields in the cell in addition to the local electrochemical characteristics.",Numerical modeling and performance study of a tubular SOFC,10.1149/1.1647569
8,16405,It is suggested that the air flow convective heat-transfer is important as a cooling means and that overpotential due to concentration polarization is more serious for the cathode side than for the anode side.,Numerical modeling and performance study of a tubular SOFC,10.1149/1.1647569
9,16405,All the presented results including the electricity conversion efficiency were observed to agree reasonably well with the popularly accepted cell performance.,Numerical modeling and performance study of a tubular SOFC,10.1149/1.1647569
