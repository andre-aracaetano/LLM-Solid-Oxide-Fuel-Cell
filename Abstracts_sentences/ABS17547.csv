2,17547,The distribution and average radius of oxygen vacancies by co-doping divalent and trivalent cations were calculated from a hard-sphere model.,Ionic conductivity investigation in samarium and strontium co-doped ceria system,10.1088/0031-8949/2007/T129/067
3,17547,"Experimental results exhibit that the best conductivity for Ce0.78Sm0.2Sr0.02O1.88 (0.061 S cm(-1)) specimen is twice that of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (0.0371 S cm(-1)) at 800 degrees C. A decrease of 50 degrees C in the working temperature of SDC was developed by modifying the dopant concentration, average binding energy and ionic radius of the dopant.",Ionic conductivity investigation in samarium and strontium co-doped ceria system,10.1088/0031-8949/2007/T129/067
