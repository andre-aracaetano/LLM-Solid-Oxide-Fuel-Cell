1,6906,Cost-effective cathodes that actively catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are one of the major challenges for the technological advancement of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).,"Nanointegrated, High-Performing Cobalt-Free Bismuth-Based Composite Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/acsami.8b08911
2,6906,"In particular, cobalt has been an essential element in electrocatalysts for efficiently catalyzing the ORR; nevertheless, the cost, safety, and stability issues of cobalt in cathode materials remain a severe drawback for SOFC development.","Nanointegrated, High-Performing Cobalt-Free Bismuth-Based Composite Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/acsami.8b08911
3,6906,"Here, we demonstrated that by appropriate nanoengineering, we can overcome the inherent electrocatalytic advantages of cobalt-based cathodes to achieve comparable performance with a cobalt-free electrocatalyst on a bismuth-based fast oxygen ion-conducting scaffold that simultaneously enhances the performance and stability of LT-SOFCs.","Nanointegrated, High-Performing Cobalt-Free Bismuth-Based Composite Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/acsami.8b08911
4,6906,"Consequently, the peak power density of the SOFCs reaches 1.2 W/cm(2) at 600 degrees C, highest performance of a cobalt-free-based cathode that has been ever reported.","Nanointegrated, High-Performing Cobalt-Free Bismuth-Based Composite Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/acsami.8b08911
5,6906,"In addition, by the surface-protecting effect of covered nanoelectrocatalysts, the evaporation of highly volatile bismuth is greatly suppressed, resulting in an 80% improvement in performance durability, the best among all reported bismuth-based fuel cells.","Nanointegrated, High-Performing Cobalt-Free Bismuth-Based Composite Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/acsami.8b08911
