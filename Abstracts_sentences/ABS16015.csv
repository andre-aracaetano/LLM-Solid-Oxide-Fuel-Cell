1,16015,Uranium cations were immobilized in the proton-conducting oxide BaCe0.8Y0.2O3 (BCY) by partially replacing Ce with U. Uranium cations can be incorporated into the BCY lattice to form the new BaCe0.7Y0.2U0.1O3 (BCUY) compound.,Tailoring BaCe0.8Y0.2O3 proton-conducting oxide with U ions for an enhanced stability,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.321

3,16015,"The first-principles calculations reveal that the doping of U elevates the energy barrier for the interaction between BCUY and CO2, which is the reason for the improved chemical stability.",Tailoring BaCe0.8Y0.2O3 proton-conducting oxide with U ions for an enhanced stability,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.321
4,16015,"Despite the improved chemical stability, U-doping inhibits the grain growth for the BaCeO3 proton-conducting oxide, making the grain size of the sintered BCUY reach only 0.5 mu m, which is approximately one-tenth of that for BCY sintered at the same temperature.",Tailoring BaCe0.8Y0.2O3 proton-conducting oxide with U ions for an enhanced stability,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.321

6,16015,"The H-SOFC using a BCUY electrolyte reaches a peak power density of 237 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, which is lower than that for BCY cells, but comparable to that using other proton-conducting electrolytes.",Tailoring BaCe0.8Y0.2O3 proton-conducting oxide with U ions for an enhanced stability,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.321
7,16015,"The current study demonstrates that U cations can be immobilized in BCY proton-conducting oxide, and that U-doping improves the stability of the material at the cost of reducing the sinterability, and thus conductivity.",Tailoring BaCe0.8Y0.2O3 proton-conducting oxide with U ions for an enhanced stability,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.321
