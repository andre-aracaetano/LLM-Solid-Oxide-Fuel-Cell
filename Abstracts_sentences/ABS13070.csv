5,13070,Effective stack and manifold seals have been developed.,SOFCo planar solid oxide fuel cell,
6,13070,Cell performance has been improved and relatively low non-cell contributions to stack resistance have been achieved.,SOFCo planar solid oxide fuel cell,
7,13070,Stack development has been facilitated through the implementation of two key test methods: (1) a 10-cm single-cell test to bridge the gap in performance data obtained from button cell tests (used for cell R&D) and stack tests; and (2) a novel instrumented short stack (< 5 cells) that allows for effective isolation of individual contributions to stack resistance.,SOFCo planar solid oxide fuel cell,
8,13070,"As a result of progress made to date, a clear pathway for improving stack performance has been established, thereby budding confidence that commercial stack performance targets will be reached.",SOFCo planar solid oxide fuel cell,
