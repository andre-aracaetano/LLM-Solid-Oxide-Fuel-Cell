1,1292,A solid oxide fuel cell's performance is largely determined by the ionic-conducting electrolyte.,Advanced Fuel Cell Based on Perovskite La-SrTiO3 Semiconductor as the Electrolyte with Superoxide-Ion Conduction,10.1021/acsami.8b10087
2,1292,"A novel approach is presented for using the semiconductor perovskite La0.25Sr0.75TiO3 (LST) as the electrolyte by creating surface superionic conduction, and the authors show that the LST electrolyte can deliver superior power density, 908.2 mW cm(-2) at just 550 degrees C.",Advanced Fuel Cell Based on Perovskite La-SrTiO3 Semiconductor as the Electrolyte with Superoxide-Ion Conduction,10.1021/acsami.8b10087
3,1292,"The prepared LST materials formed a heterostructure, including an insulating core and a superionic conducting surface layer.",Advanced Fuel Cell Based on Perovskite La-SrTiO3 Semiconductor as the Electrolyte with Superoxide-Ion Conduction,10.1021/acsami.8b10087
4,1292,The rapid ion transport along the surfaces or grain boundaries was identified as the primary means of oxygen ion conduction.,Advanced Fuel Cell Based on Perovskite La-SrTiO3 Semiconductor as the Electrolyte with Superoxide-Ion Conduction,10.1021/acsami.8b10087
5,1292,"The fuel cell-induced phase transition was observed from the insulating LST to a super O2- conductivity of 0.221 S cm(-1) at 550 degrees C, leading to excellent current and power outputs.",Advanced Fuel Cell Based on Perovskite La-SrTiO3 Semiconductor as the Electrolyte with Superoxide-Ion Conduction,10.1021/acsami.8b10087
