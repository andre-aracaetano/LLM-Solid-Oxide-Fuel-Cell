1,1724,Mn and Fe co-doped CeO2-delta (denoted as CMF) film was prepared with pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method and the obtained CMF dense film was studied as anode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,"Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense film deposited on LaGaO3 electrolyte for dense anode of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.115
2,1724,The deposited CMF film showed much higher electrical conductivity than that of CMF disk in various oxygen partial pressures.,"Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense film deposited on LaGaO3 electrolyte for dense anode of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.115
3,1724,"Furthermore, the CMF thin film improved power density of LSGM-supported solid oxide fuel cell with decreasing internal resistance.","Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense film deposited on LaGaO3 electrolyte for dense anode of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.115
4,1724,"The cell using bi-layer anode, which was consisted of thin film and powder-CMF, exhibited 3 times larger power density than that of the cell using only CMF powder anode.","Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense film deposited on LaGaO3 electrolyte for dense anode of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.115
5,1724,"Moreover, the cell using only CMF thin film anode showed fairly large power density (131 mW/cm(2)) despite of narrow active surface area.","Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense film deposited on LaGaO3 electrolyte for dense anode of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.115
6,1724,"Therefore, the bi-layer anode consisted of thin and dense CMF film and porous powder is active anode for solid oxide fuel cell.","Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense film deposited on LaGaO3 electrolyte for dense anode of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.115
