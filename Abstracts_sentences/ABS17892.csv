3,17892,The COG voltage power losses were due to internal resistance and electrode polarization.,Lower temperature electrolytic reduction of CO2 to O2 and CO with high-conductivity solid oxide bilayer electrolytes,10.1149/1.1943592
4,17892,Higher temperatures resulted in higher oxygen generation rates due to reduced cell resistance.,Lower temperature electrolytic reduction of CO2 to O2 and CO with high-conductivity solid oxide bilayer electrolytes,10.1149/1.1943592
5,17892,"However, lowering the COG operating temperature is very important and the bilayer COGs showed promise for operation below 700 degrees C, thus reducing the required power consumption, expanding ancillary material selection, decreasing fabrication cost, and potentially extending mission time.",Lower temperature electrolytic reduction of CO2 to O2 and CO with high-conductivity solid oxide bilayer electrolytes,10.1149/1.1943592
