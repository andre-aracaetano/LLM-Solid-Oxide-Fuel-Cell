5,11061,The open circuit voltages of the cells all reached above 1.10 V at the testing temperatures.,Effect of co-sintering temperature on the performance of SOFC with YSZ electrolyte thin films fabricated by dip-coating method,10.1007/s10008-009-0832-3
6,11061,"The testing results proved that both the anode performance and the electrolyte conductivity sintered at 1,300 A degrees C were superior to those sintered at 1,400 or 1,500 A degrees C. Investigation on the cell voltage drop under operation condition revealed, that the sintering temperature has more significant effect on the performance of the electrodes than on the electrolyte.",Effect of co-sintering temperature on the performance of SOFC with YSZ electrolyte thin films fabricated by dip-coating method,10.1007/s10008-009-0832-3
