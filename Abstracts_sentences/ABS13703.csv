1,13703,"Solid oxide cell electrodes need to display a wide range of combined properties, for example, electronic and ionic conductivities, catalytic activity, chemical compatibility with other parts, thermal expansion match, phase stability, and tolerance to foreign species/contaminants.","Surface decorations to abrupt change performance, robustness, and stability of electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1111/jace.18529
2,13703,It is extremely challenging for a single material to meet all these features required.,"Surface decorations to abrupt change performance, robustness, and stability of electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1111/jace.18529
3,13703,Surface decoration is a remarkably adaptive strategy to provide needed features to the electrodes by introducing functioning materials through various target-guided methods.,"Surface decorations to abrupt change performance, robustness, and stability of electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1111/jace.18529
4,13703,"This review provides an overview of typical and novel techniques to create surface decoration on the electrodes to abruptly improve the drawbacks of the electrodes of solid oxide cells, including performance enhancement, stability of long-term operation, and tolerance to poisoning foreign species.","Surface decorations to abrupt change performance, robustness, and stability of electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1111/jace.18529
5,13703,"It starts with the introduction of surface decoration experimental procedure, proceeds to crucial characterization methods that are particularly effective in identifying the properties of the surface coating, continues with target-oriented practice in terms of surface decoration materials choice and microstructure manipulation, and ends with the explorations of functioning mechanisms for the resultant behavior.","Surface decorations to abrupt change performance, robustness, and stability of electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1111/jace.18529
6,13703,"With hope, the review will spark more novel utilizations of surface decoration practice to promote the technical status of the solid oxide cells for widespread commercialization in the future.","Surface decorations to abrupt change performance, robustness, and stability of electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1111/jace.18529
