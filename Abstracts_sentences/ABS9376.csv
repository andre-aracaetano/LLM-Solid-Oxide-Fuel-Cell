1,9376,A novel route to fabricate nanofiber-derived low-Ni-content anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is presented.,Preparation of fibrous Ni-coated-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.038
2,9376,Uniform YSZ nanofibers were first synthesized by electrospinning of 8YSZ dispersion; the fiber surfaces were then electrolessly plated with a layer of Ni after sintering of the electrospun fibers.,Preparation of fibrous Ni-coated-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.038
3,9376,The Ni-YSZ nanofibers were slurry coated as the anode onto a commercial half cell that was subsequently tested.,Preparation of fibrous Ni-coated-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.038
4,9376,"The deposited anode was found to have a Ni loading of 30 wt%, a value well below the conventional percolation threshold.",Preparation of fibrous Ni-coated-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.038
5,9376,"A second cell with the same Ni content in the anode, prepared by conventional ball-milling of individual powders, was also fabricated and tested.",Preparation of fibrous Ni-coated-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.038
6,9376,"We found that the peak power density for the cell with the fiber-derived anode is twice of that with the powder-derived anode, which was attributed to the former's larger TPB sites.",Preparation of fibrous Ni-coated-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.038
