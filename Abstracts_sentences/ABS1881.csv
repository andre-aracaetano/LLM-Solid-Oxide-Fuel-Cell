3,1881,"YSZ/glass/aluminized SS441 sandwich seals were held at 800 degrees C in air for up to 1000 h, and the interfaces were analyzed using analytical scanning electron microscopy (ASEM).",Interfacial interactions between an alkali-free borosilicate viscous sealing glass and aluminized ferritic stainless steel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.018
4,1881,Interfacial reactions were also characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of heat-treated mixtures of glass and alumina powders.,Interfacial interactions between an alkali-free borosilicate viscous sealing glass and aluminized ferritic stainless steel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.018
5,1881,The results show that the glass reacted with aluminum from the steel to form BaAl2Si2O8 crystals at the glass/metal interface and that the aluminum concentration in the aluminized steel was significantly depleted with time.,Interfacial interactions between an alkali-free borosilicate viscous sealing glass and aluminized ferritic stainless steel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.018
