1,2668,"For clean utilization of coal, enhanced gasification by in situ CO2 capture has the advantage that hydrogen production efficiency is increased while no energy is required for CO2 separation.",Enhanced coal gasification heated by unmixed combustion integrated with an hybrid system of SOFC/GT,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.06.031
2,2668,"The unmixed fuel process uses a sorbent material as CO2 carrier and consists of three coupled reactors: a coal gasifier where CO2 is captured generating a H-2-rich gas that can be utilized in fuel cells, a sorbent regenerator where CO2 is released by sorbent calcination and it is ready for capture and a reactor to oxidize the oxygen transfer material which produces a high temperature/pressure vitiated air.",Enhanced coal gasification heated by unmixed combustion integrated with an hybrid system of SOFC/GT,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.06.031
