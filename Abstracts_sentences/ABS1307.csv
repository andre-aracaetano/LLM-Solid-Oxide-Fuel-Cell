1,1307,NiO-coated YSZ composite powders were synthesized through the co-precipitation method.,Preparation and properties of NIO-Coated YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
2,1307,A coverage of NiO crystals was coated on the YSZ surface and then NiO-YSZ anode powders for solid oxide fuel cells (SOPFC) were obtained after calcined at 600 degrees C and milled in ethanol.,Preparation and properties of NIO-Coated YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
3,1307,"The samples were sintered at 1400 degrees C for 4 h. The anode made from NiO/YSZ composite powder, which has a high homogeneity and plenty of contact sites between Ni and YSZ, which made a great contribution to the improvement of electrical conductivity through SEM and conductivity analysis.",Preparation and properties of NIO-Coated YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
