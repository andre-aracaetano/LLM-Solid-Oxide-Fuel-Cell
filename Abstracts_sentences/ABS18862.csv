1,18862,"For planar SOFCs the seal is a critical component, potential fracture in the seal needs to be investigated in order to enhance the reliability or the seal, A model based on the classical beam bending theory and the fracture theory of ceramic materials has been developed for predicting the crack extension in the seal.",Modeling of cracking of the glass-based seals for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.053
2,18862,The model reveals that the resistance of the seal to cracking on cooling is mainly affected by two factors: the seal thickness and the CTE mismatch.,Modeling of cracking of the glass-based seals for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.053
3,18862,"Furthermore, a cracking diagram is established to reveal the effects of the seal thickness and CTE mismatch on the crack extension behavior.",Modeling of cracking of the glass-based seals for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.053
4,18862,"It shows that the 'no cracking' area increases with decreasing seal thickness, and larger CTE mismatch requires a thinner seal to avoid cracking.",Modeling of cracking of the glass-based seals for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.053
5,18862,The model and the cracking diagram are experimentally validated through monitoring the leakage rate of a glass-sealed chamber.,Modeling of cracking of the glass-based seals for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.053
