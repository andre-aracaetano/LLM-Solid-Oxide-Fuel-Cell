1,19143,"Ceria (CeO2) is widely used in reduction and oxidation processes such as catalysis, solid-oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers, and thermochemical redox processes.","Re-Evaluating CeO2 Expansion Upon Reduction: Noncounterpoised Forces, Not Ionic Radius Effects, Are the Cause",10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b12373
2,19143,"Counter intuitively, as ceria reduces and oxidizes, it expands and contracts, respectively.","Re-Evaluating CeO2 Expansion Upon Reduction: Noncounterpoised Forces, Not Ionic Radius Effects, Are the Cause",10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b12373
3,19143,This has been attributed to the larger ionic radius of Ce3+ as compared with Ce4+.,"Re-Evaluating CeO2 Expansion Upon Reduction: Noncounterpoised Forces, Not Ionic Radius Effects, Are the Cause",10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b12373
4,19143,"However, electronic structure calculations (DFT+U) detailed herein show that this is incorrect.","Re-Evaluating CeO2 Expansion Upon Reduction: Noncounterpoised Forces, Not Ionic Radius Effects, Are the Cause",10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b12373
5,19143,"While the presence of Ce+3 cations causes local expansion of their coordinating O anions, the expansion is compensated by the contraction of the O-Ce bonds in the second coordination shell.","Re-Evaluating CeO2 Expansion Upon Reduction: Noncounterpoised Forces, Not Ionic Radius Effects, Are the Cause",10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b12373
6,19143,This results in only negligible changes in the Ce sublattice (Ce3+ Ce4+ distances of 3.90 angstrom rather than a 3.89 angstrom Ce4+-Ce4+ distance in oxidized ceria).,"Re-Evaluating CeO2 Expansion Upon Reduction: Noncounterpoised Forces, Not Ionic Radius Effects, Are the Cause",10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b12373
7,19143,"The severing of Ce-O bonds upon the formation of an O vacancy results in noncounterpoised forces acting on the vacancy neighboring Ce cations, which relax toward the 0 anion opposite vacancy, thereby expanding ceria (Ce-vac(4+)-Ce-vac(4+) distance of 4.14 angstrom).","Re-Evaluating CeO2 Expansion Upon Reduction: Noncounterpoised Forces, Not Ionic Radius Effects, Are the Cause",10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b12373
8,19143,"The relaxation of Ce+4 cations away from the vacancy rather than toward the vacancy, as is found in other materials, arises because ceria reduction results in the population f orbitals rather than d-O p antibonds.","Re-Evaluating CeO2 Expansion Upon Reduction: Noncounterpoised Forces, Not Ionic Radius Effects, Are the Cause",10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b12373
9,19143,"The corrected explanation for ceria expansion presented here will enable better design of ceria-based systems and modifications to ceria, such as doping, that will improve its performance.","Re-Evaluating CeO2 Expansion Upon Reduction: Noncounterpoised Forces, Not Ionic Radius Effects, Are the Cause",10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b12373
