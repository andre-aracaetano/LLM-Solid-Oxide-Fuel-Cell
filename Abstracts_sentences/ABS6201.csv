3,6201,"For direct-ammonia SOFCs (DA-SOFCs), the development of anode catalysts that have efficient catalytic activity for both NH3 decomposition and H-2 oxidation reactions is of great significance.",A High-Performance and Durable Direct-Ammonia Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Nano La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.7Ni0.2Mo0.1O3-δ-Decorated Doped Ceria Electrode,10.3390/nano14080673
4,6201,"Herein, we develop a Mo-doped La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-delta (La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.7Ni0.2Mo0.1O3-delta, LSFNM) material, and explore its potential as a symmetrical electrode for DA-SOFCs.",A High-Performance and Durable Direct-Ammonia Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Nano La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.7Ni0.2Mo0.1O3-δ-Decorated Doped Ceria Electrode,10.3390/nano14080673
5,6201,"After reduction, the main cubic perovskite phase of LSFNM remained unchanged, but some FeNi3 alloy nanoparticles and a small amount of SrLaFeO4 oxide phase were generated.",A High-Performance and Durable Direct-Ammonia Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Nano La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.7Ni0.2Mo0.1O3-δ-Decorated Doped Ceria Electrode,10.3390/nano14080673
6,6201,"Such reduced LSFNM exhibits excellent catalytic activity for ammonia decomposition due to the presence of FeNi3 alloy nanoparticles, ensuring that it can be used as an anode for DA-SOFCs.",A High-Performance and Durable Direct-Ammonia Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Nano La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.7Ni0.2Mo0.1O3-δ-Decorated Doped Ceria Electrode,10.3390/nano14080673
7,6201,"In addition, LSFNM shows high oxygen reduction reactivity, indicating that it can also be a cathode for DA-SOFCs.",A High-Performance and Durable Direct-Ammonia Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Nano La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.7Ni0.2Mo0.1O3-δ-Decorated Doped Ceria Electrode,10.3390/nano14080673
8,6201,"Consequently, a direct-ammonia symmetrical SOFC (DA-SSOFC) with the LSFNM-infiltrated doped ceria (LSFNM-SDCi) electrode delivers a superior peak power density (PPD) of 487 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C when NH3 fuel is utilised.",A High-Performance and Durable Direct-Ammonia Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Nano La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.7Ni0.2Mo0.1O3-δ-Decorated Doped Ceria Electrode,10.3390/nano14080673
9,6201,"More importantly, because Mo doping greatly enhances the reduction stability of the material, the DA-SSOFC with the LSFN-MSDCi electrode exhibits strong operational stability without significant degradation for over 400 h at 700 degrees C.",A High-Performance and Durable Direct-Ammonia Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Nano La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.7Ni0.2Mo0.1O3-δ-Decorated Doped Ceria Electrode,10.3390/nano14080673
