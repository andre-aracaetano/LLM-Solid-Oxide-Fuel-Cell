2,5175,A suitable amount of iodine was added to ethanol to charge the spinel powder with a high zeta potential value.,Electrophoretic deposition and low-temperature densification of Cu1.35Mn1.65O4 spinel for an interconnect protective coating in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.259
3,5175,"Stainless steel substrates were immersed in a slurry, and a DC voltage in the range of 20-60 V was applied for 30-120 s. Because a low-temperature densification of the coated film is crucial for minimizing Cr out-diffusion from the stainless steel substrate, the coated spinel was decomposed into Cu and MnO by applying a heat treatment at 800 degrees C in a 5% H-2/95% N-2 atmosphere.",Electrophoretic deposition and low-temperature densification of Cu1.35Mn1.65O4 spinel for an interconnect protective coating in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.259
