2,2267,"Initial dual operation mode analyses revealed a strong influence of the carrier gas flow on the fuel cell degradation rate, showing a higher degradation rate when low fuel utilization (FU) conditions were employed under low total flow conditions.",Towards a high fuel utilization and low degradation of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.106
3,2267,These experiments evidenced that a suitable fuel-to-carrier gas ratio must be satisfied in order to avoid mass transport limitations.,Towards a high fuel utilization and low degradation of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.106
4,2267,"A decrease of this relation, accomplished in this case by an increase in the amount of gas carrier flow (high total flow conditions), allowed to reduce the degradation rate even at high fuel utilization conditions (80%), breaking the limitations traditionally observed for this technology.",Towards a high fuel utilization and low degradation of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.106
