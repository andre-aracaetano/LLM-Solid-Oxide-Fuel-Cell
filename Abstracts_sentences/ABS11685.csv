2,11685,Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells were tested under cycling current load in order to determine the durability and possibly identify degradation mechanisms.,Durability Study of SOFCs Under Cycling Current Load Conditions,10.1002/fuce.200900013
3,11685,"At 750 degrees C and a cycling between zero and 0.75 A cm(-2), the cell voltage degradation rate was similar to tests with the corresponding high constant current density.",Durability Study of SOFCs Under Cycling Current Load Conditions,10.1002/fuce.200900013
4,11685,"However, by analyzing the impedance spectra it was found that anode degradation was becoming more important when going from constant to cycling conditions.",Durability Study of SOFCs Under Cycling Current Load Conditions,10.1002/fuce.200900013
5,11685,"Running the cycling load tests at 850 degrees C, the cells degraded similarly as under the corresponding constant current load whereas, in some cases, cells failed mechanically after a few hundred hours.",Durability Study of SOFCs Under Cycling Current Load Conditions,10.1002/fuce.200900013
6,11685,These cells did not experience severe additional degradation due to the cycling of the current density until the point of failure.,Durability Study of SOFCs Under Cycling Current Load Conditions,10.1002/fuce.200900013
7,11685,The mechanical failure could be avoided if the cells were sealed to an interconnect rather than directly to an alumina test house.,Durability Study of SOFCs Under Cycling Current Load Conditions,10.1002/fuce.200900013
