2,10034,Here we discuss two strategies for achieving such improvements in Ni-YSZ supported SOFCs - electrolyte thickness reduction and cathode infiltration.,Boosting solid oxide fuel cell performance via electrolyte thickness reduction and cathode infiltration,10.1039/d0ta04280c
3,10034,"Microstructural and electrochemical results are presented showing the effect of reducing YSZ/GDC electrolyte thickness from 8 to 2.5 mu m, and the effect of PrO(x)infiltration into the LSCF-GDC cathode.",Boosting solid oxide fuel cell performance via electrolyte thickness reduction and cathode infiltration,10.1039/d0ta04280c
4,10034,"Both of these measures are effective, particularly at lower temperatures, leading to an increase in the maximum power density at 650 degrees C from 0.4 to 0.95 W cm(-2), for example.",Boosting solid oxide fuel cell performance via electrolyte thickness reduction and cathode infiltration,10.1039/d0ta04280c
5,10034,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy utilizing subtractive analysis shows that PrO(x)enhances the cathode charge transfer process.,Boosting solid oxide fuel cell performance via electrolyte thickness reduction and cathode infiltration,10.1039/d0ta04280c
6,10034,Reducing the electrolyte thickness reduces not only the cell ohmic resistance but also the electrode polarization resistance.,Boosting solid oxide fuel cell performance via electrolyte thickness reduction and cathode infiltration,10.1039/d0ta04280c
7,10034,The latter effect appears to be an artifact associated with a slight increase in the steam partial pressure at the anode due to minor gas leakage across the thinner electrolyte.,Boosting solid oxide fuel cell performance via electrolyte thickness reduction and cathode infiltration,10.1039/d0ta04280c
