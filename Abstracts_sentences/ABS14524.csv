3,14524,"The major finding from this research indicated that under a preferred condition, the major reactions occurred in ZEC system can perform with maintaining the high equilibrium rate of conversion.",Chemical kinetics-based analysis for utilities of ZEC power generation system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.06.042
4,14524,"in the light of higher fractions converted by the hydro-gasification process, the reaction temperature in the gasification vessel should be controlled lower than 1100 K and the pressure a little higher than 60 atm in the practical operation, The temperatures for Reformers A and B should be kept under 1100 K and the pressure in Reformer B should be lower than that in Reformer A, which is almost the same as the SOFC in order to drive the CO2 absorption reaction.",Chemical kinetics-based analysis for utilities of ZEC power generation system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.06.042
5,14524,"The reaction temperature should be kept lower than 1500 K and the pressure higher than 3 arm, preferably higher than 10 atm for higher power generation by the electrochemical process in the fuel cell.",Chemical kinetics-based analysis for utilities of ZEC power generation system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.06.042
