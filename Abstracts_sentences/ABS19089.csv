3,19089,This study examined different synthesis conditions for producing larger amounts of high quality YSZ and NiO/YSZ electrodes using the templating technique and the effects of these on microstructure.,The effects of templating synthesis procedures on the microstructure of Yttria Stabilised Zirconia (YSZ) and NiO/YSZ templated thin films,10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.10.009
4,19089,"The study revealed that as the quantity of the polystyrene (PS) spheres for the template is increased the microstructure quality is reduced, due to increasing difficulty in homogeneous permeation of the template.",The effects of templating synthesis procedures on the microstructure of Yttria Stabilised Zirconia (YSZ) and NiO/YSZ templated thin films,10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.10.009
5,19089,"Thus the optimisation of the ratio of PS spheres to powder is of great importance and in this study was found to be around 2:1, however the addition of NiO has additional effects on the microstructure.",The effects of templating synthesis procedures on the microstructure of Yttria Stabilised Zirconia (YSZ) and NiO/YSZ templated thin films,10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.10.009
