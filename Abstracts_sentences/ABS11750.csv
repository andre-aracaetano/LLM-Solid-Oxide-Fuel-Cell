1,11750,"The performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) was evaluated in synthetic coal gas containing HCl in the temperature range 650-850 degrees C. Exposure to up to 800 ppm HCl resulted in reversible poisoning of the Ni/zirconia anode by chlorine species adsorption, the magnitude of which decreased with increased temperature.",Reversible poisoning of nickel/zirconia solid oxide fuel cell anodes by hydrogen chloride in coal gas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.006
2,11750,"Performance losses increased with the concentration of HCl to 100 ppm, above which losses were insensitive to HCl concentration.",Reversible poisoning of nickel/zirconia solid oxide fuel cell anodes by hydrogen chloride in coal gas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.006
3,11750,"Neither cell potential, nor current density had any effect on the extent of poisoning.",Reversible poisoning of nickel/zirconia solid oxide fuel cell anodes by hydrogen chloride in coal gas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.006
4,11750,No evidence was found for long-term degradation that can be attributed to HCl exposure.,Reversible poisoning of nickel/zirconia solid oxide fuel cell anodes by hydrogen chloride in coal gas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.006
