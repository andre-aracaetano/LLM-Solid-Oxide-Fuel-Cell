1,7649,Sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and poor CO2-tolerance has been the long-standing limitations for the application of alkaline earth metal oxide cathode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Enhancing oxygen reduction activity and CO2-tolerance of A-site-deficient BaCo0.7Fe0.3O3-δ cathode by surface-decoration with Pr6O11 particles,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.08.147
2,7649,Here we report this situation can be ameliorated with a composite cathode based on Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.3O3-delta (B90CF) by surface-decorated Pr6O11 (PO) particles.,Enhancing oxygen reduction activity and CO2-tolerance of A-site-deficient BaCo0.7Fe0.3O3-δ cathode by surface-decoration with Pr6O11 particles,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.08.147
3,7649,"A halved polarization resistance is obtained by B90CF-15PO (PO of 15 wt%) cathode (0.033 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C) compared to blank B90CF, suggesting boosted oxygen reduction reaction activity owing to the accelerated oxygen surface exchange kinetics introduced by PO particles.",Enhancing oxygen reduction activity and CO2-tolerance of A-site-deficient BaCo0.7Fe0.3O3-δ cathode by surface-decoration with Pr6O11 particles,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.08.147
4,7649,"PO protective layer also brings up desirable CO2-tolerance for B90CF cathode due to the more stable fluorite cubic structure of PO and higher acidity of Pr3+/Pr4+ than Ba2+, which ensures the stable operation of cells.",Enhancing oxygen reduction activity and CO2-tolerance of A-site-deficient BaCo0.7Fe0.3O3-δ cathode by surface-decoration with Pr6O11 particles,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.08.147
