1,16126,"The electrolysis of CO2 has been examined in a solid oxide electrolyzer (SOE) using a ceramic electrode based on La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 (LSCM), infiltrated into a yttria-stabilized zirconia scaffold together with 0.5 wt % Pd supported on 5 wt % Ce0.48Zr0.48Y0.04O2.",Efficient reduction of CO2 in a solid oxide electrolyzer,10.1149/1.2943664
2,16126,An SOE with this electrode exhibited a total cell impedance of 0.36 Omega cm(2) at 1073 K for operation in CO-CO2 mixtures.,Efficient reduction of CO2 in a solid oxide electrolyzer,10.1149/1.2943664
3,16126,"An additional benefit is that the CO-CO2 electrode was shown to be redox stable, with LSCM exhibiting good conductivity in both oxidizing and reducing environments, so that the cell can operate in pure CO2.",Efficient reduction of CO2 in a solid oxide electrolyzer,10.1149/1.2943664
