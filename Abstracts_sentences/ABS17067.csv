1,17067,"Solid oxide fuels cells (SOFCs) are promising devices for versatile and efficient power generation with fuel flexibility, but viability ability is contingent upon understanding chemical and material processes to improve their performance and durability.",High-Temperature Chemistry in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: In Situ Optical Studies,10.1021/jz3012047
2,17067,Newly developed in situ optical methods provide new insight into how carbon deposition varies with different hydrocarbon and alcohol fuels and depends on operating conditions.,High-Temperature Chemistry in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: In Situ Optical Studies,10.1021/jz3012047
3,17067,"Some findings, such as heavier hydrocarbon fuels forming more carbon than lighter fuels, are expected, but other discoveries are surprising.",High-Temperature Chemistry in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: In Situ Optical Studies,10.1021/jz3012047
4,17067,"For example, methanol shows a greater tendency to form carbon deposits than methane at temperatures below 800 degrees C, and kinetically controlled steam reforming with ethanol at high temperatures (similar to 800 degrees C) is less detrimental to SOFC performance than operating the device with dry methanol as the fuel.",High-Temperature Chemistry in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: In Situ Optical Studies,10.1021/jz3012047
5,17067,In situ optical techniques will continue to provide the chemical information and mechanistic insight that is critical for SOFCs to become a viable energy conversion technology.,High-Temperature Chemistry in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: In Situ Optical Studies,10.1021/jz3012047
