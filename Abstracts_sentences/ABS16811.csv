1,16811,The effects on anodic performance of adding Fe to Ni were studied and it was found that anodic overpotential can be greatly decreased and the maximum power density is much improved by Fe addition.,Effects of Fe addition on the surface reaction of the anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2010.08.022
2,16811,The maximum power density increases to over 0.8 W cm(-2) when 0.5 mm thick LaGaO(3)-based oxide plate is used as the electrolyte.,Effects of Fe addition on the surface reaction of the anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2010.08.022
3,16811,Impedance analysis suggests that the improved activity of Ni Fe alloy can be assigned to the improved charge exchange rate and also the increase in reaction sites.,Effects of Fe addition on the surface reaction of the anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2010.08.022
