1,13600,"A thin layer of a vertically aligned nanocomposite (VAN) structure is deposited between the electrolyte, Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO), and the thin-film cathode layer, La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (LSCO), of a thin-film solid-oxide fuel cell (TFSOFC).",Vertically Aligned Nanocomposite Thin Films as a Cathode/Electrolyte Interface Layer for Thin-Film Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.200901338
2,13600,The self-assembled VAN nanostructure contains highly ordered alternating vertical columns of CGO and LSCO formed through a one-step thin-film deposition process that uses pulsed laser deposition.,Vertically Aligned Nanocomposite Thin Films as a Cathode/Electrolyte Interface Layer for Thin-Film Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.200901338
3,13600,The VAN structure significantly improves the overall performance of the TFSOFC by increasing the interfacial area between the electrolyte and cathode.,Vertically Aligned Nanocomposite Thin Films as a Cathode/Electrolyte Interface Layer for Thin-Film Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.200901338
