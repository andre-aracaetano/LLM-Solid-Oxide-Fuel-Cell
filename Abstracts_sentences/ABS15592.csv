1,15592,"A yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin film on an La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 porous cathode substrate was prepared, using electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to fabricate a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).",Preparation of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films on strontium-doped LaMnO3 cathode substrates via electrophoretic deposition for solid oxide fuel cells,
2,15592,"The electrical conductivity of an La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 substrate is satisfactorily high at room temperature; therefore, YSZ powder could be deposited electrophoretically onto an La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 substrate without any extra surface treatment, such as a metal coating.",Preparation of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films on strontium-doped LaMnO3 cathode substrates via electrophoretic deposition for solid oxide fuel cells,
3,15592,"Successive repetition of EPD and sintering was required to obtain a film without gas leakage, because of the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the YSZ and the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 substrate.",Preparation of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films on strontium-doped LaMnO3 cathode substrates via electrophoretic deposition for solid oxide fuel cells,
4,15592,"On the other hand, the electromotive force of the oxygen concentration in the cell that used YSZ film prepared via EPD increased and attained the theoretical value when the number of deposition acid calcination cycles was increased.",Preparation of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films on strontium-doped LaMnO3 cathode substrates via electrophoretic deposition for solid oxide fuel cells,
5,15592,Six or more successive repetitions were required to obtain a YSZ film without gas leakage.,Preparation of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films on strontium-doped LaMnO3 cathode substrates via electrophoretic deposition for solid oxide fuel cells,
6,15592,"A planar-type SOFC was fabricated, using nickel as the anode and YSZ film (similar to 10 pm thick) that had been deposited onto the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 substrate as the electrolyte and cathode, The cell exhibited an open circuit voltage of 1.0 V and a maximum power density of 1.5 W/cm(2), Thus, the EPD method could be used as a colloidal process to prepare YSZ thin-film electrolytes for SOFCs.",Preparation of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films on strontium-doped LaMnO3 cathode substrates via electrophoretic deposition for solid oxide fuel cells,
