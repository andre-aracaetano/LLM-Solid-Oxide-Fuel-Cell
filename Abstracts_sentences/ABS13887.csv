1,13887,"The cobalt-free layered perovskite oxides Sm1-xLaxBaFe2O5+delta (x = 0-0.5) (SLBFx, for short) have been systematically investigated to evaluate the feasibility of using them as cathodes for intermediatetemperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Layered perovskite Sm1-xLaxBaFe2O5+δ as cobalt-free cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1039/c5ra09762b

3,13887,powders with an orthorhombic structure were synthesized by the EDTA-glycine combustion method and were observed to be compatible with LSGM and SDC electrolytes below 1250 degrees C.,Layered perovskite Sm1-xLaxBaFe2O5+δ as cobalt-free cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1039/c5ra09762b
4,13887,"The electrical conductivities of the SLBFx samples significantly increased with the substitution of La for Sm, with the highest conductivity of 37.8 S cm(-1) obtained for the SLBF0.5 sample at 600 degrees C. Of the La-doped SmBaFe2O5+delta series samples, SLBF0.2 displayed the lowest thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and the minimum electrode polarization resistance, with values of 16.51 x 10(-6) K-1 in the 50-800 degrees C range and 0.24 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C, respectively.",Layered perovskite Sm1-xLaxBaFe2O5+δ as cobalt-free cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1039/c5ra09762b
