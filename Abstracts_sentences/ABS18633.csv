1,18633,"Cu-free and Cu-doped LSM system, La0 center dot 8Sr0 center dot 2Mn1 -aEuro parts per thousand x Cu (x) O3 -aEuro parts per thousand delta (x = 0, 0 center dot 2), with perovskite structure were prepared using an EDTA combined citrate process and the effects of Cu ion at B-site were investigated.","Mn valence state and electrode performance of perovskite-type cathode La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-x CuxO3-δ (x=0, 0.2) for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s12034-013-0586-5
2,18633,"Electrical conductivity and polarization resistance of the Cu-doped LSM were 210 S center dot cm (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) at 750 A degrees C, and 2 center dot 54 Omega center dot cm(2) at 800 A degrees C, respectively which were better than those of the Cu-free LSM.","Mn valence state and electrode performance of perovskite-type cathode La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-x CuxO3-δ (x=0, 0.2) for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s12034-013-0586-5
3,18633,This indicated that the electrode performance of LSM was improved by the addition of Cu.,"Mn valence state and electrode performance of perovskite-type cathode La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-x CuxO3-δ (x=0, 0.2) for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s12034-013-0586-5
4,18633,The oxidation state of Mn ions increased with addition of Cu.,"Mn valence state and electrode performance of perovskite-type cathode La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-x CuxO3-δ (x=0, 0.2) for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s12034-013-0586-5
5,18633,The increase in the oxidation state of Mn ions was due to the formation of Mn4 + ions and oxygen vacancies.,"Mn valence state and electrode performance of perovskite-type cathode La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-x CuxO3-δ (x=0, 0.2) for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s12034-013-0586-5
6,18633,The addition of Cu ions to LSM systems could lead to enhanced electrode performance for oxygen reduction reactions originating from the change in valence of Mn ions.,"Mn valence state and electrode performance of perovskite-type cathode La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-x CuxO3-δ (x=0, 0.2) for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s12034-013-0586-5
