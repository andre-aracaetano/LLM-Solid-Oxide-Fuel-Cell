6,12347,This diffusion limitation is most likely due to either low oxide ion conduction of the anode or due to a reaction layer formed during sintering of the anode onto the electrolyte at the relatively high temperatures of above 1250 degreesC. Reactivity tests between YSZ electrolyte material and the Sr0.2Ba0.4Ti0.2Nb0.8O3 anode up to 1300 degreesC showed the formation of t-ZrO2.,Tetragonal tungsten bronze type phases (Sr1-xBax)0.6Ti0.2Nb0.8O3-δ:: Material characterisation and performance as SOFC anodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00432-X
