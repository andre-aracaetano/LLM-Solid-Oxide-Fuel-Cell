2,16836,"at% W was electroplated on type 430 stainless steel (Fe-16 mass% Cr), and it was subjected to high-temperature oxidation at 800 degrees C in Air-3 vol% H2O atmosphere for 1000 h. A five-layered oxide of Co3O4, FeCo2O4, CoWO4, (Co,Fe,Cr)(3)O-4, and Cr2O3 formed within 1 h, and the structure retained up to 1000 h. The outward diffusion of Cr3+ was effectively prevented by the CoWO4 layer.",High temperature oxidation of Co-W electroplated type 430 stainless steel for the interconnect of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.corsci.2018.02.026
3,16836,"In the oxide, Co and W exist as divalent and hexavalent ions respectively, and there is no trivalent cation sites or trivalent cation vacancy through which Cr3+ diffuses.",High temperature oxidation of Co-W electroplated type 430 stainless steel for the interconnect of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.corsci.2018.02.026
