2,13054,This study investigates the potential of 10Sc1CeSZ material for the electrolyte and anode layers for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC) in an anode-supported cell (ASC) geometry.,Five-layer reverse tape casting of IT-SOFC,10.1111/ijac.13911
3,13054,"In order to use La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8 Oxide (LSCF) cathode material, a Gd0.2Ce0.8 Oxide (GDC) barrier layer is needed; however, thermal expansion coefficient mismatch results in delamination of the GDC from the electrolyte during high temperature sintering when fabricated by conventional tape casting procedures.",Five-layer reverse tape casting of IT-SOFC,10.1111/ijac.13911
4,13054,"For the first time, ASCs have been manufactured by a five-layer tape casting technique; barrier layer, novel composite layer, electrolyte, anode functional layer, and anode substrate.",Five-layer reverse tape casting of IT-SOFC,10.1111/ijac.13911
5,13054,Ni-ScCeSZ composite cells were tested between 650 and 800 degrees C in H-2:N-2 fuel (85% H-2) on the anode and air on the cathode to yield a maximum power density of .46 W/cm(2).,Five-layer reverse tape casting of IT-SOFC,10.1111/ijac.13911
6,13054,These results demonstrate the feasibility of this new five-layer tape casting technique to produce IT-SOFC.,Five-layer reverse tape casting of IT-SOFC,10.1111/ijac.13911
