1,14456,Polarization characteristics of Pt-(Sc0.10Ce0.01)Zr0.89O2 (SSZ) cermet cathodes were studied in order to develop new cathodes for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Pt-cermet cathode for reduced temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00973-0
2,14456,Several Pt-SSZ cermet electrodes were prepared by mixing Pt and SSZ powders using a high-energy ball mill.,Pt-cermet cathode for reduced temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00973-0
3,14456,"A Pt-SSZ cermet cathode on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte achieved high cathodic activity; the cathode interfacial conductivity reached as high as 6.7 S/cm(2) at 973 K and 0.8 S/cm(2) at 873 K. These results suggest that this Pt-SSZ cermet cathode has enough capability at 973 K, but is still not satisfactory at 873 K.",Pt-cermet cathode for reduced temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00973-0

5,14456,These electrodes showed two optima of interfacial conductivity vs. SSZ/Pt ratio and remarkable dependence on cathode thickness.,Pt-cermet cathode for reduced temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00973-0
6,14456,It was considered that the first optimum is based on two-dimensional reaction sites on YSZ electrolyte surface and the second one originates from three-dimensional expansion of reaction sites into the cermet cathode.,Pt-cermet cathode for reduced temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00973-0
