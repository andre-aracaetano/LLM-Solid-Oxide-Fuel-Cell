1,2917,This study reports the performance and durability of a protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) in an ammonia fuel injection environment.,High-Performance Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells Using a Pd Inter-Catalyst,10.1002/smll.202208149
2,2917,The low ammonia decomposition rate in PCFCs with lower operating temperatures is improved relative to that of solid oxide fuel cells by treatment with a catalyst.,High-Performance Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells Using a Pd Inter-Catalyst,10.1002/smll.202208149
3,2917,"By treating the anode of the PCFCs with a palladium (Pd) catalyst at 500 degrees C under ammonia fuel injection, the performance (peak power density of 340 mW cm(-2) at 500 degrees C) is approximately two-fold higher than that of the bare sample not treated with Pd.",High-Performance Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells Using a Pd Inter-Catalyst,10.1002/smll.202208149
4,2917,"Pd catalysts are deposited through an atomic layer deposition post-treatment process on the anode surface, in which nickel oxide (NiO) and BaZr0.2Ce0.6Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) are mixed, and Pd can penetrate the anode surface and porous interior.",High-Performance Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells Using a Pd Inter-Catalyst,10.1002/smll.202208149
5,2917,"Impedance analysis confirmed that Pd increased the current collection and significantly reduced the polarization resistance, particularly in the low-temperature region (approximate to 500 degrees C), thereby improving the performance.",High-Performance Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells Using a Pd Inter-Catalyst,10.1002/smll.202208149
6,2917,"Furthermore, stability tests showed that superior durability is achieved compared with that of the bare sample.",High-Performance Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells Using a Pd Inter-Catalyst,10.1002/smll.202208149
7,2917,"Based on these results, the method presented herein is expected to represent a promising solution for securing high-performance and stable PCFCs based on ammonia injection.",High-Performance Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells Using a Pd Inter-Catalyst,10.1002/smll.202208149
