2,2164,The damage testing method was applied to ceria electrolyte-supported single cells.,Tracking the onset of damage mechanism in ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells under simulated operating conditions,
3,2164,"The damage process was shown to involve vertical cracking and delamination in the cathode, and vertical cracking in the electrolyte, and the fracture damage was most likely due to chemical expansion-induced stresses.",Tracking the onset of damage mechanism in ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells under simulated operating conditions,
4,2164,It was demonstrated that the AE method enabled us to detect the above-mentioned damage process and to determine the condition for the onset of the damage in the single cell.,Tracking the onset of damage mechanism in ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells under simulated operating conditions,
