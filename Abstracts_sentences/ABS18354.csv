1,18354,This article reports on in situ macroscopic scale imaging of NiO-YSZ (YSZ is yttria-stabilized zirconia) reduction under applied stress - a phase transition taking place in solid oxide electrochemical cells in a reducing atmosphere of a hydrogen/nitrogen mixture and at operation temperatures of up to 1073 K. This process is critical for the performance and lifetime of the cells.,In situ time-of-flight neutron imaging of NiO-YSZ anode support reduction under influence of stress,10.1107/S1600576716012668
2,18354,Energy-resolved neutron imaging was applied to observe the phase transition directly with time and spatial resolution.,In situ time-of-flight neutron imaging of NiO-YSZ anode support reduction under influence of stress,10.1107/S1600576716012668
3,18354,Two different approaches are presented for using this imaging technique for the investigation of chemical and physical processes requiring controlled atmosphere and elevated temperature.,In situ time-of-flight neutron imaging of NiO-YSZ anode support reduction under influence of stress,10.1107/S1600576716012668
4,18354,"The first type of measurement is based on alternating stages of short-term partial chemical reaction and longer neutron image acquisition, and the second type is a real in situ neutron imaging experiment.",In situ time-of-flight neutron imaging of NiO-YSZ anode support reduction under influence of stress,10.1107/S1600576716012668
5,18354,"Results of applying energy-resolved neutron imaging with both approaches to the NiO-YSZ reduction investigation indicate enhancement of the reduction rate due to applied stress, which is consistent with the results of the authors' previous research.",In situ time-of-flight neutron imaging of NiO-YSZ anode support reduction under influence of stress,10.1107/S1600576716012668
