1,18324,The evolution of the microstructure and the composition of Ni-Co coatings used for protecting the current collectors of stainless steel Crofer 22 APU from oxidation is studied in the operation mode of the anode chamber of a solid-oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC).,Diffusion Coatings Nickel-Cobalt for Protecting the Current Collectors of Crofer 22 APU Steel Used in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cells,10.1134/S1023193524030108
2,18324,It is shown that the interdiffusion of steel and coating components and the redox reactions that proceed under the coating in the SOEC operation mode block the chromium diffusion to the current collector surface.,Diffusion Coatings Nickel-Cobalt for Protecting the Current Collectors of Crofer 22 APU Steel Used in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cells,10.1134/S1023193524030108
3,18324,"The exploitation of the anodic chamber in the air atmosphere changes the Ni-Cr metal composition of the protective coating to a mixture of highly conductive oxides (Fe,Ni,Co)(3)O-4 and (Ni,Co)O, thus changing the form of the time dependence of the surface resistivity of the junction current collector/anode.",Diffusion Coatings Nickel-Cobalt for Protecting the Current Collectors of Crofer 22 APU Steel Used in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cells,10.1134/S1023193524030108
4,18324,"At the same time, the 7000 h tests revealed sufficiently low values, viz., similar to 17 m Omega cm(2), which means that these coatings can be used for the anti-oxidation protection of the stainless-steel current collectors in SOECs.",Diffusion Coatings Nickel-Cobalt for Protecting the Current Collectors of Crofer 22 APU Steel Used in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cells,10.1134/S1023193524030108
