1,12050,"In order to develop a cost effective route to fabricate solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with a proton conductive electrolyte, BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-delta (BCNO) powder was prepared by the modified Pechini method and a suspension of BCNO powder was then deposited as a thin layer by a spray process onto a NiO-BCNO anode.",An ammonia fuelled SOFC with a BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-δ thin electrolyte prepared with a suspension spray,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.059
2,12050,"A bi-layer with very dense BCNO electrolyte was obtained by co-sintering at 1400 degrees C for 5 h. With La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (LSCO) as the cathode, single cells were assembled and tested with NH3 and H-2 as fuels and static air as the oxidant.",An ammonia fuelled SOFC with a BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-δ thin electrolyte prepared with a suspension spray,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.059
3,12050,"For a commercial liquid ammonia fuel at 700 degrees C, the OCV and the peak power density of a cell with a 20 mu m thick BCNO electrolyte were 0.950 V and 315 mW/cm(2), respectively.",An ammonia fuelled SOFC with a BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-δ thin electrolyte prepared with a suspension spray,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.059
4,12050,"With H-2 fuel as a comparison, the values are correspondingly 0.951 V and 335 mw/cm(2).",An ammonia fuelled SOFC with a BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3-δ thin electrolyte prepared with a suspension spray,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.059
