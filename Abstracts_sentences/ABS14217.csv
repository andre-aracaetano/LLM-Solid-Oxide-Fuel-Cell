1,14217,The chromium deposition process at (La(0.6)Sr(0.4-x)Ba(x))(Co(0.2)Fe(0.8))O(3) (LSBCF) (0 <= x <= 0.4) cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has been investigated in the presence of an Fe-Cr metallic interconnect at 900 degrees C. Chromium deposition depends strongly on the composition of LSBCF cathodes as x varies from 0 to 0.4.,Chromium deposition and poisoning on (La0.6Sr0.4-xBax) (Co0.2Fe0.8)O3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2969914

4,14217,The LSBCF electrodes show similar electrocatalytic activities toward the O(2) reduction reaction in the absence of Fe-Cr interconnect and at early stages in the presence of Fe-Cr interconnect.,Chromium deposition and poisoning on (La0.6Sr0.4-xBax) (Co0.2Fe0.8)O3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2969914
5,14217,"The results clearly show that the significant differences in the Cr deposition are closely related to the Sr and Ba content and are not related to the electrochemical activities of the LSBCF cathodes, indicating that Cr deposition on the LSBCF cathode is not controlled by an electrochemical reduction process of gaseous chromium species.",Chromium deposition and poisoning on (La0.6Sr0.4-xBax) (Co0.2Fe0.8)O3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2969914
