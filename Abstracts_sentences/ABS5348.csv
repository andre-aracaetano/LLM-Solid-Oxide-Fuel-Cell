2,5348,The 20 mol% ESB-incorporated YSZ composite (20ESB-YSZ) achieves the high density (>97%) at the low sintering temperature of 800 degrees C.,High performance zirconia-bismuth oxide nanocomposite electrolytes for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.090
3,5348,The microstructural analysis of 20ESB-YSZ reveals the characteristic nanocomposite structure of the highly percolated ESB phase at the YSZ grain boundaries (a few similar to nm thick).,High performance zirconia-bismuth oxide nanocomposite electrolytes for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.090
4,5348,The ionic conductivity of 20ESB-YSZ is increased by 5 times compared to that of the conventional YSZ due to the fast oxygen ion transport along the ESB phase.,High performance zirconia-bismuth oxide nanocomposite electrolytes for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.090
5,5348,"Moreover, this high conductivity is maintained up to 580 h, indicating high stability of the ESB-YSZ nanocomposite.",High performance zirconia-bismuth oxide nanocomposite electrolytes for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.090
6,5348,"In addition, the oxygen reduction reaction at the composite electrolyte/cathode interface is effectively enhanced (similar to 70%) at the temperature below 650 degrees C, mainly due to the fast dissociative oxygen adsorption on the ESB surface as well as the rapid oxygen ion incorporation into the ESB lattice.",High performance zirconia-bismuth oxide nanocomposite electrolytes for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.090
7,5348,"Thus, we believe this ESB-YSZ nanocomposite is a promising electrolyte for high performance solid oxide fuel cells at reduced temperatures.",High performance zirconia-bismuth oxide nanocomposite electrolytes for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.090
