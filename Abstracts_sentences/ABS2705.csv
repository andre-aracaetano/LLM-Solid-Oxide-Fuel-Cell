2,2705,"Although the oxide ion conductivity of Dy2O3 is negligible compared to that of doped ceria (DCO), Ni-Dy2O3 cermet anodes have displayed very high performance comparable to that of the commonly used Ni-SDC cermet anode.",Electro-catalytic activity of Dy2O3 as a solid oxide fuel cell anode material,10.1016/j.elecom.2010.12.011
3,2705,"Temperature programmed reduction study suggests that the catalytic activity of the Ni-Dy2O3 cermet might be originated from the hydrogen adsorption ability on the Dy2O3 surface, promoting hydrogen spillover process, and consequently enhancing the electrochemical oxidation of the fuel.",Electro-catalytic activity of Dy2O3 as a solid oxide fuel cell anode material,10.1016/j.elecom.2010.12.011
4,2705,"Further, the electrochemical catalytic activity of Au-based cermet anode confirms that hydrogen adsorption capability is as important as oxygen-ion conductivity for the ceramic component in a cermet anode.",Electro-catalytic activity of Dy2O3 as a solid oxide fuel cell anode material,10.1016/j.elecom.2010.12.011
