1,13387,"When solid oxide fuel cell, system starts operation, anode cermets will reduce to nickel anode for use; during the reduction, the mechanical properties of the anode will be changed due to the NiO to the Ni phase transformation.",Mechanical Properties of SOFC Bilayer Structure before and after Reduction,
2,13387,"In this paper, the mechanical properties of bilayer structure of SOFC before and after reduction were characterized by indentation approach, the indentation tests were performed on the surface of cross section, the received anode and electrolyte before and after reduction, respectively.",Mechanical Properties of SOFC Bilayer Structure before and after Reduction,
3,13387,"Due to the NiO to Ni phase transformation, the hardness after reduction from section surface is about 100 MPa, much smaller than 309 MPa before reduction; the interesting facts are that, for the reduction sample, the hardness in the received surface of anode is 200 MPa, which is about two times larger than that from section surface.",Mechanical Properties of SOFC Bilayer Structure before and after Reduction,
4,13387,"The hardness data and the SEM proved that there is hard layer in the received surface in reduced anode; It is also found that reduction causes decrease of the hardness of electrolyte layer, which may be aroused due to the softening of the anode support layer or the decrease of residual stress in YSZ layer after reduction.",Mechanical Properties of SOFC Bilayer Structure before and after Reduction,
