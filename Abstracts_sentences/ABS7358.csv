1,7358,Methane catalytic abilities are considered to be an important and direct form of experimental evidence for evaluating the efficacy of mixed oxide-ion/electron conductors (MIEC) as anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with CH4 as the fuel gas.,A highly active CH4 catalyst correlated with solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1039/d0ta10672k
2,7358,"Therefore, a direct link between the quantifiable methane-conversion abilities and CH4-based SOFC electrochemical performance is urgently needed.",A highly active CH4 catalyst correlated with solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1039/d0ta10672k
3,7358,"Here, H-2-reduced Sr2ZnMoO6 (R-SZMO) as an anode example exhibits excellent catalytic abilities and tolerance to coking when using CH4 as the fuel gas, which is dominated by the formation of intrinsic anion-Frenkel defect pairs.",A highly active CH4 catalyst correlated with solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1039/d0ta10672k
4,7358,DFT calculations reveal that the efficient electron transfer process and optimal selectivity towards CH4 conversion are both on the R-SZMO (110) surface.,A highly active CH4 catalyst correlated with solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1039/d0ta10672k
5,7358,"Therefore, applying high CH4 activity R-SZMO as the anode catalyst gives excellent anti-carbon deposition performance, high power output, and long-term stability for SOFCs with CH4 as the fuel gas.",A highly active CH4 catalyst correlated with solid oxide fuel cell anode performance,10.1039/d0ta10672k
