7,20696,"<= x <= 7 with the mayenite phase, and therefore, the rigidity of the framework cations and the width of the windows between cages are not key factors for oxide-ion conductivity in mayenite Ca12Al14O33-based materials, and changing the free oxygen content through aliovalent cation substitution may be the right direction.","Phase Evolution, Electrical Properties, and Conduction Mechanism of Ca12Al14-xGaxO33 (0 ≤ x ≤ 14) Ceramics Synthesized by a Glass Crystallization Method",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03344
8,20696,"For compositions with a pure melilite-like orthorhombic phase, the conductivities also mirrored each other and are all slightly higher than those of the mayenite phases.","Phase Evolution, Electrical Properties, and Conduction Mechanism of Ca12Al14-xGaxO33 (0 ≤ x ≤ 14) Ceramics Synthesized by a Glass Crystallization Method",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03344
