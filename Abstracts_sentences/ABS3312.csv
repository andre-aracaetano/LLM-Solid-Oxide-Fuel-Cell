2,3312,The crystal structure of BaxCe0.8Y0.2O3-alpha was determined by XRD analysis.,Performance of the solid oxide fuel cell based on BaxCe0.8Y0.2O3-α,
3,3312,The protonic and oxide-ionic conductions in BaxCe0.8Y0.2O3-alpha were studied by using hydrogen and oxygen concentration cell method.,Performance of the solid oxide fuel cell based on BaxCe0.8Y0.2O3-α,
4,3312,The results indicated that BaxCe0.8Y0.2O3-alpha sinters were a single phase of orthorhombic perovskite; the protonic conduction in the samples and the maximum short-circuit current density from the fuel cells based on BaxCe0.8Y0.2O3-alpha increased with increasing Ba content in the samples; the oxideionic conduction was hardly affected by Ba content in the sample.,Performance of the solid oxide fuel cell based on BaxCe0.8Y0.2O3-α,
