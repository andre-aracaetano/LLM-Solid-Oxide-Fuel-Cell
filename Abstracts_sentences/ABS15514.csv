2,15514,Model cells consisting of porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathodes were implemented on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes with dense Gd-doped ceria (GDC) interlayers and tested in an open-circuit voltage condition at 800 degrees C for 300 h in air to elucidate the degradation at the cathode-interlayer interfaces.,Elucidating the Degradation Mechanism at the Cathode-Interlayer Interfaces of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0941816jes
3,15514,The GDC films were prepared on poly-YSZ and single-crystal YSZ(100) electrolytes by pulsed laser deposition to generate dense and well-defined barrier microstructures namely granular polycrystalline (poly-GDC) and grain boundary-free single crystalline (sc-GDC) interlayers.,Elucidating the Degradation Mechanism at the Cathode-Interlayer Interfaces of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0941816jes
