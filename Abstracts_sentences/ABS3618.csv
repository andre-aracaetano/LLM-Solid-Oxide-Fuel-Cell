1,3618,Direct utilization of methane fuels in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is a key technology to realize the immediate inclusion of such high-efficiency fuel cells into the current electricity generation infrastructure.,Nanofiber Composites as Highly Active and Robust Anodes for Direct-Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsnano.2c04927
2,3618,"However, the broad commercialization of direct-methane fueled SOFCs is critically hindered by the inadequate electrode activity and their poor longevity, which primarily stems from the carbon build-up issues.",Nanofiber Composites as Highly Active and Robust Anodes for Direct-Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsnano.2c04927
3,3618,"To make the technology more competitive, a novel electrode structure that can dramatically improve the tolerance against coking is essential.",Nanofiber Composites as Highly Active and Robust Anodes for Direct-Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsnano.2c04927
4,3618,"Herein, we present highly active and robust core -shell nanofiber anodes, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3@ Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (LSCM@SDC), directly obtained with a single-nozzle electrospinning process through the use of two immiscible polymers.",Nanofiber Composites as Highly Active and Robust Anodes for Direct-Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsnano.2c04927
5,3618,The intimate coverage of SDC on LSCM not only increases the active reaction sites but also promotes resistance toward carbon deposition and thermal aggregation.,Nanofiber Composites as Highly Active and Robust Anodes for Direct-Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsnano.2c04927
6,3618,"As such, the electrode polarization resistance obtained with LSCM@SDC NFs is among the lowest value ever reported with LSCM derivatives (similar to 0.11 Omega cm(2) in wet H-2 at 800 degrees C).",Nanofiber Composites as Highly Active and Robust Anodes for Direct-Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsnano.2c04927
7,3618,"The facile fabrication process of such complex heterostructures developed in this work is attractive for the design of not only SOFC electrodes but also other solid-state devices such as electrolysis cells, membrane reformers, and protonic cells.",Nanofiber Composites as Highly Active and Robust Anodes for Direct-Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsnano.2c04927
