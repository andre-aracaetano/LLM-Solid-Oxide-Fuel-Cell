1,16596,"The effects of intrinsic cation disorder and electron-deficient substitution for La1-xSrxCo0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM, x = 0, 0.5, and 0.75) on oxygen vacancy formation, and their influence on the electrochemical properties, were revealed through a combination of computer simulation and experimental study.","Synergistic Effects of Intrinsic Cation Disorder and Electron-Deficient Substitution on Ion and Electron Conductivity in La1-xSrxCo0.5Mn0.5O3-δ (x=0, 0.5, and 0.75)",10.1021/ic502989c
2,16596,"First-principles calculations were first performed and found that the tendency of the oxygen vacancy formation energy was Mn3+-O*-Mn4+ < Co2+-O*-Co3+ < Co2+-O*-Mn4+, meaning that antisite defects not only facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancy but introduce the mixed-valent transition-metal pairs for high electrical conductivity.","Synergistic Effects of Intrinsic Cation Disorder and Electron-Deficient Substitution on Ion and Electron Conductivity in La1-xSrxCo0.5Mn0.5O3-δ (x=0, 0.5, and 0.75)",10.1021/ic502989c
3,16596,"Detailed partial density of states (PDOS) analysis for Mn on Co sites (Mn-Co) and Co on Mn sites (Co-Mn) indicate that Co2+ is prone to being Co3+ while Mn4+ is prone to being Mn3+ when they are on antisites, respectively.","Synergistic Effects of Intrinsic Cation Disorder and Electron-Deficient Substitution on Ion and Electron Conductivity in La1-xSrxCo0.5Mn0.5O3-δ (x=0, 0.5, and 0.75)",10.1021/ic502989c
4,16596,"Also it was found that the holes introduced by Sr tend to enter the Co sublattice for x = 0.5 and then the O sublattice when x = 0.75, which further promotes oxygen vacancy formation, and these results are confirmed by both the calculated PDOS results and charge-density difference.","Synergistic Effects of Intrinsic Cation Disorder and Electron-Deficient Substitution on Ion and Electron Conductivity in La1-xSrxCo0.5Mn0.5O3-δ (x=0, 0.5, and 0.75)",10.1021/ic502989c
