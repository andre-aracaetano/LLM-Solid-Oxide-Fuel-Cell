1,11401,The BaCe0 center dot 4Zr0 center dot 4Y0 center dot 2O3 (BCZY) was modified with the NiO sintering aid and prepared by a microwave sintering (MVS) method as the electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs).,Microwave sintering coupled with sintering aids for proton-conducting oxide membranes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.085
2,11401,"The incorporation of NiO into the BCZY lattice improves the sinterability of the material, leading to the increase of the shrinkage from 3% to 26% after the high-temperature sintering.",Microwave sintering coupled with sintering aids for proton-conducting oxide membranes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.085
3,11401,The dense BaCe0 center dot 4Zr0 center dot 4Y0 center dot 15Ni0 center dot 05O3 (BCZYN) pellet can be obtained after sintering at 1500.,Microwave sintering coupled with sintering aids for proton-conducting oxide membranes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.085

5,11401,"By further using the MVS method, the BCZYN can be densified at 1300 degrees C, which is 200 degrees C lower than conventional sintering.",Microwave sintering coupled with sintering aids for proton-conducting oxide membranes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.085
6,11401,"Furthermore, the microwave-sintered BCZYN has a higher conductivity than the conventionally sintered one due to the larger grain size.",Microwave sintering coupled with sintering aids for proton-conducting oxide membranes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.085
7,11401,"Using the MVS method in the H-SOFCs fabrication, the high porosity of the anode substrate can be retained.",Microwave sintering coupled with sintering aids for proton-conducting oxide membranes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.085
8,11401,"In contrast, the cell prepared by the conventional sintering (CS) method has a relatively dense anode, which is detrimental to gas fuel transportation.",Microwave sintering coupled with sintering aids for proton-conducting oxide membranes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.085
9,11401,"As a result, the microwave sintered cell exhibits an output of 1010 mW cm 2 at 700 degrees C, which is significantly larger than that for the conventionally sintered cell, being 535 mW cm(-2) at the same testing condition, suggesting the advantage of using the MVS method for the fuel cell fabrication.",Microwave sintering coupled with sintering aids for proton-conducting oxide membranes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.085
