1,11696,"In this study, the impact of various infiltrates on the kinetics and rate-limiting step of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is examined with LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-delta (LNF) as the cathode backbone of a solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).",Effect of Surface-Specific Treatment by Infiltration into LaNi6Fe4O3-δ Cathodic Backbone for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0421904jes
2,11696,"Five materials were infiltrated: LaNi1-xFexO3-delta, LaxSr1-xCoyFe1-yO3-delta (LSCF), La1-xSrxMnO3-delta (LSM), Gd1-xCexO2-delta (GDC) and Pr6O11.",Effect of Surface-Specific Treatment by Infiltration into LaNi6Fe4O3-δ Cathodic Backbone for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0421904jes
3,11696,"The dependence of electrode polarization resistance on the precursor concentration, temperature, oxygen partial pressure is presented with related discussions on ORR kinetics and rate-determining step for ORR.",Effect of Surface-Specific Treatment by Infiltration into LaNi6Fe4O3-δ Cathodic Backbone for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0421904jes
4,11696,"A one-step infiltration of all five materials resulted in a dramatic decrease in polarization resistance (R-p) and related activation energy (E-a), which is ascribed to a significant facilitation of surface processes such as dissociative adsorption with electron transfer and diffusion of oxygen intermediates.",Effect of Surface-Specific Treatment by Infiltration into LaNi6Fe4O3-δ Cathodic Backbone for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0421904jes
5,11696,"Finally, a short-term durability test in a Cr-containing environment indicated that the LSCF-infiltrated cell is susceptible to Cr poisoning unlike the GDC- or LNF-infiltrated cells as expected but advantageous in terms of morphological stability during operation.",Effect of Surface-Specific Treatment by Infiltration into LaNi6Fe4O3-δ Cathodic Backbone for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0421904jes
