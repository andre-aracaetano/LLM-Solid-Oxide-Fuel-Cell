2,8640,"These fuel cells first internally reform the complex liquid fuel into carbon fragments and hydrogen, which are then electrochemically oxidized to produce electrical energy without external fuel processors.",Molybdenum dioxide-based anode for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.133
3,8640,The MoO2-based anode was fabricated on to an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte via combined electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) and direct painting methods.,Molybdenum dioxide-based anode for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.133
4,8640,"The cell performance was measured by directly feeding liquid fuels such as n-dodecane (i.e., a model diesel/kerosene fuel) or biodiesel (i.e., a future biomass-based liquid fuel) to the MoO2-based anode at 850 degrees C.",Molybdenum dioxide-based anode for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.133
5,8640,"The maximum initial power densities obtained from our MoO2-based SOFC were 34 mW cm(-2) and 45 mW cm(-2) using n-dodecane and biodiesel, respectively.",Molybdenum dioxide-based anode for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.133
6,8640,The initial power density of the MoO2-based SOFC was improved up to 2500 mW cm(-2) by optimizing the porosity of the MoO2-based anode.,Molybdenum dioxide-based anode for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.133
7,8640,"To test the long-term stability of the MoO2-based anode SOFC against coking, n-dodecane was continuously fed into the cell for 24 h at the open circuit voltage (OCV).",Molybdenum dioxide-based anode for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.133
8,8640,"During long-term testing, voltage-current density (V-I) plots were periodically obtained and they showed no significant changes over the operation time.",Molybdenum dioxide-based anode for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.133
9,8640,"Microstructural examination of the tested cells indicated that the MoO2-based anode displayed negligible coke formation, which explains its stability.",Molybdenum dioxide-based anode for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.133
10,8640,"On the other hand, SOFCs with conventional nickel (Ni)-based anodes under the same operating conditions showed a significant amount of coke formation on the metal surface, which led to a rapid drop in cell performance.",Molybdenum dioxide-based anode for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.133
11,8640,"Hence, the present work demonstrates that MoO2-based anodes exhibit outstanding tolerance to coke formation.",Molybdenum dioxide-based anode for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.133
