2,2657,Two different types of system configurations that depend on the carbon dioxide capture scheme (pre- and oxy-combustion captures) were examined.,Influence of gas turbine specification and integration option on the performance of integrated gasification solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine systems with CO2 capture,10.1007/s12206-013-0733-3
3,2657,Research focus was given to the effect of the gas turbine specification on the performance of the entire system.,Influence of gas turbine specification and integration option on the performance of integrated gasification solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine systems with CO2 capture,10.1007/s12206-013-0733-3
4,2657,"IG- SOFC/GT systems using two different gas turbines were analyzed, and their performances were compared.",Influence of gas turbine specification and integration option on the performance of integrated gasification solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine systems with CO2 capture,10.1007/s12206-013-0733-3
5,2657,A parametric analysis was carried out to further understand the performance comparison.,Influence of gas turbine specification and integration option on the performance of integrated gasification solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine systems with CO2 capture,10.1007/s12206-013-0733-3
6,2657,We found that the net system efficiency was not very sensitive to the turbine inlet temperature and the pressure ratio.,Influence of gas turbine specification and integration option on the performance of integrated gasification solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine systems with CO2 capture,10.1007/s12206-013-0733-3
7,2657,"As a result, similar net efficiencies were observed between the systems using two gas turbines with quite different specifications.",Influence of gas turbine specification and integration option on the performance of integrated gasification solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine systems with CO2 capture,10.1007/s12206-013-0733-3
8,2657,"In addition, a revision of the system layout was investigated and it was found that the power capacity of the system could be increased and the system efficiency could also be slightly enhanced by supplying nitrogen separated from the air separation unit to the fuel cell rather than to the gas turbine combustor.",Influence of gas turbine specification and integration option on the performance of integrated gasification solid oxide fuel cell/gas turbine systems with CO2 capture,10.1007/s12206-013-0733-3
