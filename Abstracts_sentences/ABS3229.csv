1,3229,"A new anode with a proton conductor (Barium-Cerium/Yttrium oxide (BCY): BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta) was proposed for a high-power, solid-oxide fuel cell.",Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Anodes using Proton Conductor (Barium-Cerium/Yttrium Oxide),10.1299/jtst.4.431
2,3229,"In the new anode, the proton-conducting material was included in a conventional anode made of nickel (Ni) and Gd-doped Ceria (GDC) in the ratio of GDC: BCY=0:100, 50: 50, 90: 10, 100: 0 vol.%.",Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Anodes using Proton Conductor (Barium-Cerium/Yttrium Oxide),10.1299/jtst.4.431
3,3229,"With 3% humidity hydrogen fuel, the overpotential of the BCY anode became smaller compared with that of the conventional Ni/GDC anode.",Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Anodes using Proton Conductor (Barium-Cerium/Yttrium Oxide),10.1299/jtst.4.431
4,3229,The most striking feature is that the anode with the 10%-BCY has the lowest overpotential among all anodes due to the high oxide-ion conductivity by the 90%-GDC and the reaction enhancement and/or the high hydrogen-adsorption ratio by the 10%-BCY.,Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Anodes using Proton Conductor (Barium-Cerium/Yttrium Oxide),10.1299/jtst.4.431
