6,20590,"L7S2FO3 contains 10% A-site vacancies compared to stoichiometric L8S2FO3, which has a fully occupied A site and thus some form of charge compensation is necessary in the former to maintain charge neutrality.",Characterization of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-δ and La0.7Sr0.2FeO3-δ as a function of temperature by x-ray absorption spectroscopy,10.1103/PhysRevB.73.115114

8,20590,Studies from room temperature to 850 degrees C show that Fe3+ dominates over Fe4+ in both materials with increasing dominance as the temperature is increased.,Characterization of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-δ and La0.7Sr0.2FeO3-δ as a function of temperature by x-ray absorption spectroscopy,10.1103/PhysRevB.73.115114
9,20590,"Furthermore, the temperature-dependent study revealed the La-deficiency in L7S2FO3 leads to a higher concentration of both electron holes (i.e., more Fe4+ created) and oxygen vacancies, compared to the stoichiometric L8S2FO3.",Characterization of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-δ and La0.7Sr0.2FeO3-δ as a function of temperature by x-ray absorption spectroscopy,10.1103/PhysRevB.73.115114
