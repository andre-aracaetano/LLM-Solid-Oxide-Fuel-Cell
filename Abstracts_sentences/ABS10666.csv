1,10666,Doped Bi-based oxides were investigated as potential anode materials for direct hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) at intermediate temperatures.,Bi-based oxide anodes for direct hydrocarbon SOFCs at intermediate temperatures,10.1149/1.1667791
2,10666,(Bi2O3)(0.85)(Ta2O5)(0.15) met this criterion most successfully.,Bi-based oxide anodes for direct hydrocarbon SOFCs at intermediate temperatures,10.1149/1.1667791
3,10666,"A fraction of Bi2O3 in this material was reduced to BiO and Bi metal under fuel conditions, which yielded high conductivities (<1 S cm(-1)) based on oxide ions and electrons above 500 degrees C. Carbon deposition was successfully prevented when butane was used as the fuel below 800 degrees C.",Bi-based oxide anodes for direct hydrocarbon SOFCs at intermediate temperatures,10.1149/1.1667791
4,10666,The catalytic activities for hydrocarbon oxidation were high enough to promote the complete oxidation of butane during cell operation.,Bi-based oxide anodes for direct hydrocarbon SOFCs at intermediate temperatures,10.1149/1.1667791
5,10666,"These abilities provided an enhanced anode performance with increasing temperature from 600 to 750 degrees C, and the resulting polarization resistance reached 1.4 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C.
