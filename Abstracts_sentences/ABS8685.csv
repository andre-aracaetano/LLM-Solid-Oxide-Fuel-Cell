1,8685,"In this study, intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) with a nine-layer structure are constructed via a simple method based on the cost-effective tape castingscreen printing-co-firing process with the structure composed of a NiO-based four-layer anode, a Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-$(SDC)/La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3_$ (LSGM)/SDC tri-layer electrolyte, and an La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-$ (LSCF)-based bi-layer cathode.",High-performance anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with co-fired Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ/ La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ sandwiched electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.132
2,8685,The resultant SDC (4.14 mu m)/LSGM (1.47 mu m)/SDC (4.14 mu m) tri-layer electrolyte exhibits good continuity and a highly dense structure.,High-performance anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with co-fired Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ/ La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ sandwiched electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.132
3,8685,"The Ro and Rp values of the single cell are observed to be 0.15 and 0.08 U cm2 at 800 degrees C, respectively, and the MPD of the cell is 1.08 Wcm-2.",High-performance anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with co-fired Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ/ La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ sandwiched electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.132
4,8685,The high MPD of the cell appears to be associate with the significantly lower area-specific resistance and the reasonably high OCV.,High-performance anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with co-fired Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ/ La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ sandwiched electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.132
5,8685,"Compared to those with a similar electrolyte thickness reported in prior studies, the nine-layer anode-supported IT-SOFC with a tri-layer electrolyte developed by the study demonstrates superior cell properties.",High-performance anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with co-fired Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ/ La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ sandwiched electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.132
