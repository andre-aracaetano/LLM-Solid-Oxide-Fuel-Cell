1,20619,Palladium-impregnated or infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (LSM-GDC) composites are studied as the oxygen electrodes (anodes) for the hydrogen production in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs).,"Enhanced electrochemical performance and stability of (La,Sr) MnO3-(Gd,Ce)O2 oxygen electrodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells by palladium infiltration",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.015
2,20619,The incorporation of small amount of Pd nanoparticles leads to a substantial increase in the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the LSM-GDC oxygen electrodes.,"Enhanced electrochemical performance and stability of (La,Sr) MnO3-(Gd,Ce)O2 oxygen electrodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells by palladium infiltration",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.015
3,20619,"The electrode polarization resistance (R-E) at 800 degrees C on a 0.2 mg cm(-2) Pd-infiltrated LSM-GDC electrode is 0.13 Omega cm(2), significantly smaller than 0.42 Omega cm(2) for the reaction on the pure LSM-GDC electrodes.","Enhanced electrochemical performance and stability of (La,Sr) MnO3-(Gd,Ce)O2 oxygen electrodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells by palladium infiltration",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.015
4,20619,"The overpotential loss is also substantially reduced after the Pd infiltration; at an anodic overpotential 50 mV and 800 degrees C, the current increases from 0.15 A cm(-2) for the pure LSM-GDC anode to 0.47 A cm(-2) on a 0.3 mg cm(-2) Pd-infiltrated LSM-GDC.","Enhanced electrochemical performance and stability of (La,Sr) MnO3-(Gd,Ce)O2 oxygen electrodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells by palladium infiltration",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.015
5,20619,"The infiltrated Pd nanoparticles enhance the stability of the LSM-GDC oxygen electrodes and are most effective in the promotion of the diffusion, exchange and combination processes of oxygen species on the surface of LSM-GDC particles, leading to the increase in the oxygen evolution reaction rate.","Enhanced electrochemical performance and stability of (La,Sr) MnO3-(Gd,Ce)O2 oxygen electrodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells by palladium infiltration",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.015
