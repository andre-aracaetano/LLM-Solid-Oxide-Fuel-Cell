7,17378,"The composition dependence of the electrical conductivity of La2-xNiTiO6-delta (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2), investigated by impedance spectroscopy, as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure, is successfully interpreted on the basis of the relevant charge-compensating mechanisms and associated valence states.",A- and B-Site Ordering in the A-Cation-Deficient Perovskite Series La2-xNiTiO6-δ (0 ≤ x < 0.20) and Evaluation as Potential Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm4008014
