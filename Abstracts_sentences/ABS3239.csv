1,3239,The most commonly used solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode material is a two phase nickel- and yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) cermet.,Initial testing of solutions to redox problems with anode-supported SOFC,10.1149/1.2240085
2,3239,"During typical fuel cell operation, this material remains a cermet; however, in a commercial SOFC system seal leakage, fuel supply interruption, or other situations may cause the anode to reoxidize.",Initial testing of solutions to redox problems with anode-supported SOFC,10.1149/1.2240085
3,3239,"The cyclic reduction and oxidation (redox) of nickel results in large bulk volume changes, which may have a significant effect on the integrity of interfaces within the fuel cell and thus may cause significant performance degradation.",Initial testing of solutions to redox problems with anode-supported SOFC,10.1149/1.2240085
4,3239,"Following initial study of the degradation mechanisms and redox kinetics, a number of solutions have been devised.",Initial testing of solutions to redox problems with anode-supported SOFC,10.1149/1.2240085
5,3239,These can be broadly categorized into system solutions and unit cell or materials solutions.,Initial testing of solutions to redox problems with anode-supported SOFC,10.1149/1.2240085
6,3239,"The former includes purge gas, other means to produce a reducing gas, cell reversal, and passive solutions such as hydrides, oxygen getters, and steam purging.",Initial testing of solutions to redox problems with anode-supported SOFC,10.1149/1.2240085
7,3239,"The latter includes alternative anode materials, microstructural modification of anode functional layers (AFLs), graded porosity, and composition of AFL and redox barrier layers.",Initial testing of solutions to redox problems with anode-supported SOFC,10.1149/1.2240085
8,3239,This paper discusses the pros and cons of each approach and some initial feasibility testing in short-stack repeat units.,Initial testing of solutions to redox problems with anode-supported SOFC,10.1149/1.2240085
