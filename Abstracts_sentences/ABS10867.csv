2,10867,The anode consisted of three layers: a layer of 60wt% GDC-40wt% SLT or 40wt% SSZ-60wt% SLT as a functional layer and two layers of SLT as current conducting layers.,Robust SOFC anode materials with La-doped SrTiO3 backbone structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.024
3,10867,An impregnation method has been employed to decorate nano-sized Ni and CeO2 into the ceramic anode to improve electrochemical performance and redox stability.,Robust SOFC anode materials with La-doped SrTiO3 backbone structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.024
4,10867,It was found that the catalyst impregnated ceramic anode has improved redox stability compared with the conventional Ni-SSZ cermet.,Robust SOFC anode materials with La-doped SrTiO3 backbone structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.024
5,10867,"The incorporation of the oxide catalyst, CeO2, during co-impregnation process was found to even further improve redox stability of the anode, since CeO2 particles have a lower tendency to aggregate during redox cycling.",Robust SOFC anode materials with La-doped SrTiO3 backbone structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.024
