1,17676,The effects of element migration related to cathodic current polarization on the stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathodes are investigated at 750 degrees C for 120 h. The electrochemical results show that performance activation is the characteristic of cathodic current polarization at 200 mA cm(-2) for 120 h on LSCF cathodes.,New insights into element migration on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.02.011
