1,19167,"To elucidate the reaction kinetics of CO gas at the electrodes of zirconia sensors and solid oxide fuel cells, measurements were made on the electrochemical impedance spectra and steady-state polarization current at the porous Pt/stabilized zirconia (SZ) electrodes in the CO-CO2 atmosphere at 600-1000-degrees-C. The impedance arcs were depressed semicircles, the centers of which were 45-degrees below the abscissa.","KINETICS OF THE ELECTRODE-REACTION AT THE CO-CO2, POROUS PT/STABILIZED ZIRCONIA INTERFACE",10.1016/0167-2738(92)90374-X
