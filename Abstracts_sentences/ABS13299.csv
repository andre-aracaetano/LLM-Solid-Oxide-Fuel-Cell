1,13299,"The common technology for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is based on a cermet (ceramic-metal composite) anode of nickel with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), often used as the supporting structure.",RedOx study of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.118
2,13299,One of the main limitations of this technology is the tolerance of the anode towards reduction and oxidation (RedOx) cycles.,RedOx study of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.118
3,13299,"In this study, two techniques are used to quantify the anode expansion after a RedOx cycle of the nickel at different temperatures.",RedOx study of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.118
4,13299,The first method considers the anode expansion above the electrolyte fracture limit by measuring the crack width in the electrolyte layer.,RedOx study of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.118
5,13299,"In the second method, the anode porosity is measured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image quantification.",RedOx study of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.118
6,13299,The same measurement techniques are used to quantify anode expansion after consecutive RedOx cycles at constant temperature.,RedOx study of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.118
