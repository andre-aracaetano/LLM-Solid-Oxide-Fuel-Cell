1,15871,"Sr2MgMo1 (-) xVxO6 (-) (d) (X = 0-0.2) materials with double perovskite structure were synthesized by sol-gel method, and studied for the possibility of being the anode of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with biogas as the direct fuel.",Porous Sr2MgMo1 - xVxO6 - d ceramics as anode materials for SOFCs using biogas fuel,10.1016/j.catcom.2015.04.019
2,15871,"The sample of Sr2MgMo0.95V0.05O6 (-) (d) synthesized in 5%H-2/Ar showed a conductivity higher than the samples with x> 0.05, but close to the sample without V. Besides, it showed better catalytic activity, stability, and H2S tolerance (up to 1% of H2S in the feed gas) for biogas combustion than the sample without V.",Porous Sr2MgMo1 - xVxO6 - d ceramics as anode materials for SOFCs using biogas fuel,10.1016/j.catcom.2015.04.019
