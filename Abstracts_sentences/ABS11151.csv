2,11151,STS444 and Crofer22 APU are also evaluated for comparison.,Evaluation of Nb- or Mo-alloyed ferritic stainless steel as SOFC interconnect by using button cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.028
3,11151,Each polarization element is separated by equivalent circuit analysis on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data.,Evaluation of Nb- or Mo-alloyed ferritic stainless steel as SOFC interconnect by using button cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.028
4,11151,Cr deposition on the button cell cathode is also analyzed both qualitatively by transmission electron microscope and quantitatively by inductively coupled plasma.,Evaluation of Nb- or Mo-alloyed ferritic stainless steel as SOFC interconnect by using button cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.028
5,11151,"The Nb- or Mo-alloyed ferritic stainless steel shows comparable performance with Crofer22 APU in terms of the increase rate in ohmic resistance and Cr evaporation rate, even without the addition of reactive element such as La. When the same amount of Cr is deposited on the cathode, the cathode performance deteriorates more at the high Cr evaporation rate than at the low Cr evaporation rate.",Evaluation of Nb- or Mo-alloyed ferritic stainless steel as SOFC interconnect by using button cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.028
