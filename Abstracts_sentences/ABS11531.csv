2,11531,"The proposed system combines an SOFC stack with an HCCI-type internal combustion engine; the HCCI engine replaces a conventional combustor, simultaneously bums the anode off-gas, and produces additional power.",Performance analysis of an SOFC/HCCI engine hybrid system: System simulation and thermo-economic comparison,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.171
3,11531,"To calculate the efficiency of the suggested system, each component and the overall system have been thermodynamically modeled.",Performance analysis of an SOFC/HCCI engine hybrid system: System simulation and thermo-economic comparison,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.171
4,11531,The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) has been calculated and economically assessed.,Performance analysis of an SOFC/HCCI engine hybrid system: System simulation and thermo-economic comparison,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.171
5,11531,"For quantitative comparison and evaluation, a simple SOFC system and an SOFC/GT hybrid system are designed.",Performance analysis of an SOFC/HCCI engine hybrid system: System simulation and thermo-economic comparison,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.171
6,11531,"Consequently, the proposed hybrid system shows the efficiency 59.5%, which is 7.8% and 0.9% higher efficiency than those of the SOFC simple system and the SOFC/GT hybrid system, respectively.",Performance analysis of an SOFC/HCCI engine hybrid system: System simulation and thermo-economic comparison,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.171
7,11531,"And the system exhibits the LCOE $0.23/kWh, that is 12.9% and 7.6% reduced LCOE compared with the other two reference cases.",Performance analysis of an SOFC/HCCI engine hybrid system: System simulation and thermo-economic comparison,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.171
