2,12363,"By using LaMnO3 (LMO) epitaxial thin films, we studied the effects of temperature, extended structural defects and strain on the oxygen mass transport properties of this parent compound perovskite by isotope exchange depth profiling.",Epitaxial LaMnO3 films with remarkably fast oxygen transport properties at low temperature,10.1039/d0ta12253j
3,12363,"By combining the oxygen transport measurements with a detailed structural characterization using several complementary techniques, we showed that the combination of extended defects and strain relaxation accelerates the oxygen transport across the LMO film.",Epitaxial LaMnO3 films with remarkably fast oxygen transport properties at low temperature,10.1039/d0ta12253j
4,12363,"Additionally, we demonstrated that the oxygen diffusion at 500 degrees C is extraordinary high due to the prevalence of the orthorhombic structure in the film, together with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies.",Epitaxial LaMnO3 films with remarkably fast oxygen transport properties at low temperature,10.1039/d0ta12253j
5,12363,These promising results open new perspectives for the use of LMO below its transition temperature for low temperature solid-state electrochemical applications in which oxygen diffusion is the key parameter determining the device performance.,Epitaxial LaMnO3 films with remarkably fast oxygen transport properties at low temperature,10.1039/d0ta12253j
