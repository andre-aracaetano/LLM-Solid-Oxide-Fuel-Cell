7,13686,"Apart from temperature, degradation of Ni-YSZ electrodes in SOCs is related to Ni-YSZ electrode overpotential and the local redox potential of the gas mixture inside the porous Ni-YSZ electrode.",Ni migration in solid oxide cell electrodes: Review and revised hypothesis,10.1002/fuce.202100072
