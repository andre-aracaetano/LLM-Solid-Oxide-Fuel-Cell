2,12771,This study presents comprehensive investigations of the use of humidified ammonia as the primary fuel component in high-fuel utilization conditions.,High Utilization of Humidified Ammonia and Methane in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An Experimental Study of Performance and Stability,10.1149/2.0781912jes
3,12771,"For these investigations, large planar anode- and electrolyte-supported solid oxide single cells were operated at the respective appropriate temperatures, 800 degrees C and 850 degrees C. Fueled with ammonia, both cells exhibited excellent ammonia conversion (>99.5%) in addition to excellent performance output and fuel utilization.",High Utilization of Humidified Ammonia and Methane in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An Experimental Study of Performance and Stability,10.1149/2.0781912jes
4,12771,"In 100 h stability tests performed at 80% fuel utilization, the cells exhibited stable performance, despite scanning electron microscopy analyzes revealing partial impairments to the nickel parts of both cells due to the formation and subsequent decomposition of nickel nitride.",High Utilization of Humidified Ammonia and Methane in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An Experimental Study of Performance and Stability,10.1149/2.0781912jes
5,12771,"This study also demonstrates that methane is a perfect additional fuel component for humidified ammonia streams, as steam supports the internal reforming of methane.",High Utilization of Humidified Ammonia and Methane in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An Experimental Study of Performance and Stability,10.1149/2.0781912jes
6,12771,"Alternating and direct current as well as electrochemical impedance measurements with a variety of ammonia/steam/methane/nitrogen fuel mixtures were used to evaluate the performance potential of the cells, and proved their stability over 48 h in highly polarized conditions.",High Utilization of Humidified Ammonia and Methane in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An Experimental Study of Performance and Stability,10.1149/2.0781912jes
