1,10910,"In this study, a novel multi-generation system is proposed by integrating a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-gas turbine (GT) with multi-effect desalination (MED), organic flash cycle (OFC) and polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer (PEME) for simultaneous production of electricity, fresh water and hydrogen.","Development and exergoeconomic evaluation of a SOFC-GT driven multi-generation system to supply residential demands: Electricity, fresh water and hydrogen",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.191
2,10910,A comprehensive exergoeconomic analysis and optimization are conducted to find the best design parameters considering exergy efficiency and total unit cost of products as objective functions.,"Development and exergoeconomic evaluation of a SOFC-GT driven multi-generation system to supply residential demands: Electricity, fresh water and hydrogen",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.191
3,10910,"The results show that the exergy efficiency and the total unit cost of products in the optimal condition are 59.4% and 23.6 $/GJ, respectively, which offers an increase of 2% compared to exergy efficiency of SOFC-GT system.","Development and exergoeconomic evaluation of a SOFC-GT driven multi-generation system to supply residential demands: Electricity, fresh water and hydrogen",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.191
4,10910,"Moreover, the system is capable of producing 2.5 MW of electricity by the SOFC-GT system, 5.6 m(3)/h of fresh water by MED unit, and 1.8 kg/h of hydrogen by the PEME.","Development and exergoeconomic evaluation of a SOFC-GT driven multi-generation system to supply residential demands: Electricity, fresh water and hydrogen",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.191
5,10910,"The associated cost for producing electricity, fresh water and hydrogen are 3.4 cent/kWh, 37.8 cent/m(3), and 1.7 $/kg, respectively.","Development and exergoeconomic evaluation of a SOFC-GT driven multi-generation system to supply residential demands: Electricity, fresh water and hydrogen",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.191
6,10910,A comparison between the results of the proposed system and those reported in other related papers are presented.,"Development and exergoeconomic evaluation of a SOFC-GT driven multi-generation system to supply residential demands: Electricity, fresh water and hydrogen",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.191
7,10910,"The diagram of the exergy flow is also plotted for the exact determination of the exergy flow rate in each component, and also, location and value of exergy destruction.","Development and exergoeconomic evaluation of a SOFC-GT driven multi-generation system to supply residential demands: Electricity, fresh water and hydrogen",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.191
