1,3285,A comprehensive mathematical model of the performance of the cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with syngas fuel is presented.,Optimization of the Interconnect Ribs for a Cathode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en7010295
2,3285,"The model couples the intricate interdependency between the ionic conduction, electronic conduction, gas transport, the electrochemical reaction processes in the functional layers and on the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, methane steam reforming (MSR) and the water gas shift reaction (WGSR).",Optimization of the Interconnect Ribs for a Cathode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en7010295
3,3285,The validity of the mathematical model is demonstrated by the excellent agreement between the numerical and experimental I-V curves.,Optimization of the Interconnect Ribs for a Cathode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en7010295
4,3285,The effect of anode rib width and cathode rib width on gas diffusion and cell performance is examined.,Optimization of the Interconnect Ribs for a Cathode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en7010295
5,3285,The results show conclusively that the cell performance is strongly influenced by the rib width.,Optimization of the Interconnect Ribs for a Cathode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en7010295
