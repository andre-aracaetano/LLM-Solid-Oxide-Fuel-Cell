1,10700,"Phases constituted by La2-xCuxNiO4-delta (0.01 <= x <= 0.1) of the Ruddlesden-Popper family (Lan+1NinO3n+1; n=1) were prepared and then mixed with La4Ni3O10, in a weight ratio of 50:50 wt%, in order to be used as solid oxide fuel cell cathodes.","Novel La2-xCuxNiO4±δ/La4Ni3O10-δ composite materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, IT-SOFC",10.1007/s10008-015-3047-9
2,10700,"ASR values relative to the symmetrical cells constituted by yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and the following electrodes, La1.98Cu0.02NiO4+delta + La4Ni3O10 and La1.95Cu0.05NiO4+delta + La4Ni3O10, are of 11.8 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C for both and, respectively, of 3.5 and 2.9 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C.","Novel La2-xCuxNiO4±δ/La4Ni3O10-δ composite materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, IT-SOFC",10.1007/s10008-015-3047-9
3,10700,"In the case of the second cell, the electrode material reacts with the electrolyte forming an insulating phase at the interface, contrarily to the first cell, which stability could be explained by the combination of low doping amounts of copper and the presence of La4Ni3O10 acting as a stabilizer of the material at high temperature.","Novel La2-xCuxNiO4±δ/La4Ni3O10-δ composite materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, IT-SOFC",10.1007/s10008-015-3047-9
