3,15029,"The maximum power density of the metal-supported SOFC using an unsintered BSCF cathode without a buffer layer is 0.81 W cm(-2), which is measured after 2 h of operation (97% H-2 and 3% H2O at the anode and ambient air at the cathode), and it significantly decreases to 0.63 W cm(-2) after 50h.",Effect of unsintered gadolinium-doped ceria buffer layer on performance of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells using unsintered barium strontium cobalt ferrite cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.095

6,15029,Comparable performance is obtained from the anode-supported cell when using an unsintered BSCF cathode with an unsintered GDC buffer layer (0.75W cm(-2)) and sintered GDC buffer layer (0.82W cm(-2)).,Effect of unsintered gadolinium-doped ceria buffer layer on performance of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells using unsintered barium strontium cobalt ferrite cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.095
7,15029,"When a sintered BSCF cathode is used, however, the performance increases to 1.23 W cm(-2).",Effect of unsintered gadolinium-doped ceria buffer layer on performance of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells using unsintered barium strontium cobalt ferrite cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.095
8,15029,"The adhesion between the BSCF cathode and the cell can be enhanced by an unsintered GDC buffer layer, but an increase in the layer thickness (1-6 mu m) increases the area specific resistance (ASR) of the cell, and the overly thick buffer layer causes delamination of the BSCF cathode.",Effect of unsintered gadolinium-doped ceria buffer layer on performance of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells using unsintered barium strontium cobalt ferrite cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.095
