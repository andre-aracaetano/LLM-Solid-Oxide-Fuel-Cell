10,8080,"Consequently, a fuel cell employing the HE-BCZY electrolyte operates without detectable degradation for 200 h. This study demonstrates that although the high-entropy design is seldom used for sintering aids of proton-conducting oxides, it is an intriguing and promising strategy for creating high-performance electrolyte materials with good sinterability, high conductivity, and excellent stability.",High-entropy design in sintering aids for proton-conducting electrolytes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.11.104
