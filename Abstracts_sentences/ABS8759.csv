5,8759,Electrochemical tests have shown that only cells with a non-sintered Cu-containing cathode or with a similar cathode treated with relatively low sintering temperatures can be considered for SOFC applications.,Various Lanthanum Ferrite-Based Cathode Materials With Ni and Cu Substitution for Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4001355
6,8759,"However, it was clear that the tested cells with cathodes including Cu and/or Ni showed electrochemical performance which was always lower than that of reference cells with La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta cathode.",Various Lanthanum Ferrite-Based Cathode Materials With Ni and Cu Substitution for Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4001355
7,8759,No electrochemical measurements were possible with cathodes sintered at or above 1000 degrees C. Cross-sectional analyses revealed that in all these cases the presence of Cu exhibited severe chemical interaction with the electrolyte.,Various Lanthanum Ferrite-Based Cathode Materials With Ni and Cu Substitution for Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4001355
