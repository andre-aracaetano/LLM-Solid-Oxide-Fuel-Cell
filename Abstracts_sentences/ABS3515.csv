1,3515,Metal catalysts have been employed as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells to facilitate the surface exchange rate in the intermediate temperature range (600-800 degrees C).,Encapsulation of Metal Catalysts for Stable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1007/s40684-020-00290-8
2,3515,"However, incorporated metal catalysts easily agglomerate, resulting in the loss of the reaction sites; thus, the electrochemical performance rapidly deteriorates over time.",Encapsulation of Metal Catalysts for Stable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1007/s40684-020-00290-8
3,3515,"To hinder the agglomeration of metal catalysts while maintaining the catalytic activity, we encapsulated metal catalysts with nano-particulated perovskite materials using an infiltration technique.",Encapsulation of Metal Catalysts for Stable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1007/s40684-020-00290-8
4,3515,"The encapsulation of Ag nanoparticles with nano-particulated Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) successfully prevented the agglomeration of Ag nanoparticles, maintaining the initial polarization resistance for 200 h at 650 degrees C, while the polarization resistance of the SSC electrodes with the Ag nanoparticles increased by similar to 190% after 200 h at 650 degrees C because of the thermal agglomeration of Ag nanoparticles.",Encapsulation of Metal Catalysts for Stable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1007/s40684-020-00290-8
