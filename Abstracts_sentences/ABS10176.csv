1,10176,Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with a thin him of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte were fabricated.,"A high performance, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell operating on direct alcohol",10.1149/1.1375166
2,10176,The cells were operated directly on pure methanol and on an equivolume mixture of ethanol and water over a range of temperatures.,"A high performance, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell operating on direct alcohol",10.1149/1.1375166
3,10176,Power density achieved with methanol was between 0.6 W/cm(2) at 650 degreesC and 1.3 W/cm(2) at 800 degreesC. and with ethanol + water between 0.3 W/cm(2) at 650 degreesC and 0.8 W/cm(2) at 800 degreesC. Results were compared with tests on humidified hydrogen us a fuel.,"A high performance, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell operating on direct alcohol",10.1149/1.1375166
4,10176,No carbon deposition on the Ni-YSZ anode was observed with either methanol or an equivolume solution of ethanol and water as fuels.,"A high performance, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell operating on direct alcohol",10.1149/1.1375166
5,10176,Differences in performance with different fuels were attributed to differences in anode polarization.,"A high performance, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell operating on direct alcohol",10.1149/1.1375166
