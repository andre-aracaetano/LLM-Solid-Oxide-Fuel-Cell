1,7746,"Cobalt-free provskite oxides Bi0.5Sr0.5Fe1-xNbxO3-delta (BSFNx, x = 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15) were prepared and evaluated as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",A novel family of Nb-doped Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.036
2,7746,"In particular, the effects of Nb substitution on phase evolution, thermal expansion behavior and electrochemical performance were systematically investigated.",A novel family of Nb-doped Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.036
3,7746,"The average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of BSFNx decreases from 13.3 x 10(-6) K-1 at x = 0.05 to 12.6 X 10(-6) K-1 at x = 0.15 within a temperature range of 50800 degrees C. Among the BSFNx materials, Bi0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-delta (BSFN0.10) oxide shows the best electrochemical performance.",A novel family of Nb-doped Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.036
