2,17430,Analysis by field emission transmission electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveals that the siliceous and ZnO phases are separately aggregated at the triple grain junction areas in ZnO-added specimens.,Enhanced grain-boundary conduction in polycrystalline Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 by zinc oxide doping: Scavenging of resistive impurities,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.12.084
3,17430,"This finding implies that the scavenging process does not occur via the expected formation of zinc silicates, but via a novel mechanism in which resistive siliceous phases strongly aggregate in non-wetting configurations induced by ZnO. A three-dimensional schematic is established to elucidate the role of ZnO in the CeO2-Gd2O3 system.",Enhanced grain-boundary conduction in polycrystalline Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 by zinc oxide doping: Scavenging of resistive impurities,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.12.084
