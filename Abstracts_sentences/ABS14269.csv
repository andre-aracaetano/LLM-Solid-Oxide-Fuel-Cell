4,14269,"S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C. Semiconducting behaviour was also observed in 5% H-2/Ar, albeit with a much smaller activation energy of 0.04(4) eV. Between 300 degrees C and 700 degrees C the conductivity ranged from 2.45 S cm(-1) to 2.685 cm(-1), which is approaching the magnitude required for SOFC anode materials.",Conductivity and stability of cobalt pyrovanadate,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.12.166
