1,20387,Strontium cobalt-based perovskites display high electrochemical activity but poor stability for solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs).,"Evaluation of SrCo0.8Nb0.2O3-δ, SrCo0.8Ta0.2O3-δ and SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ta0.1O3-δ as air electrode materials for solid oxide electrolysis and reversible solid oxide cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134654
2,20387,"Here, we evaluate the stability of three strontium cobalt-based materials, i.e. SrCo0.8Nb0.2O3-delta (SCN), SrCo0.8Nb0.2O3-delta (SCT) and SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ta0.1O3-delta (SCNT) as air electrodes for SOECs.","Evaluation of SrCo0.8Nb0.2O3-δ, SrCo0.8Ta0.2O3-δ and SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ta0.1O3-δ as air electrode materials for solid oxide electrolysis and reversible solid oxide cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134654
3,20387,"The electrochemical results show that the area-specific resistance (ASR) for SCN and SCNT cells decreases and then becomes almost constant whereas the ASR of the SCT cell continuously increases, during the 240 h SOEC test.","Evaluation of SrCo0.8Nb0.2O3-δ, SrCo0.8Ta0.2O3-δ and SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ta0.1O3-δ as air electrode materials for solid oxide electrolysis and reversible solid oxide cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134654
4,20387,The improved performance of SCN and SCNT cells is ascribed to the lower energy barrier required for the oxide ion movement in the presence of niobium and the less concentration of undesired phases formed during SOEC operation.,"Evaluation of SrCo0.8Nb0.2O3-δ, SrCo0.8Ta0.2O3-δ and SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ta0.1O3-δ as air electrode materials for solid oxide electrolysis and reversible solid oxide cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134654
5,20387,SCN is further tested under reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC) conditions with 16 h solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and 7 h SOEC cycles.,"Evaluation of SrCo0.8Nb0.2O3-δ, SrCo0.8Ta0.2O3-δ and SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ta0.1O3-δ as air electrode materials for solid oxide electrolysis and reversible solid oxide cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134654
6,20387,The cell presents excellent stability as its impedance increases only slightly from 0.188 to 0.193 Omega cm(2) after 114 h RSOC test.,"Evaluation of SrCo0.8Nb0.2O3-δ, SrCo0.8Ta0.2O3-δ and SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ta0.1O3-δ as air electrode materials for solid oxide electrolysis and reversible solid oxide cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134654
