1,19436,"Generally, strontium-doped lanthanum manganites (LSM) are materials connected ordinarily as cathodes in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).","Optical, electrical and magnetic properties of lanthanum strontium manganite La1-xSrxMnO3 synthesized through the citrate combustion method",10.1039/c6cp07333f
2,19436,"In this study, the structural, optical, electrical and magnetic properties of La1-xSrxMnO3 (x = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8) synthesized using an organic acid precursor strategy were investigated, based on using citric acid as a fuel.","Optical, electrical and magnetic properties of lanthanum strontium manganite La1-xSrxMnO3 synthesized through the citrate combustion method",10.1039/c6cp07333f
3,19436,"Evidently, the results disclosed that a pure single monoclinic LSM phase was obtained from the thermally treated precursors annealed at 1000 degrees C with an annealing time of 2 h. The microstructure of the formed sample relied on the Sr2+ ion content.","Optical, electrical and magnetic properties of lanthanum strontium manganite La1-xSrxMnO3 synthesized through the citrate combustion method",10.1039/c6cp07333f
4,19436,"Moreover, a good optical transparency of 45-60% in a wide range of wavelengths between 800 and 1800 nm for all samples substituted by Sr2+ ions was performed.","Optical, electrical and magnetic properties of lanthanum strontium manganite La1-xSrxMnO3 synthesized through the citrate combustion method",10.1039/c6cp07333f
5,19436,The optical band gap energy was increased from 2.09 to 2.76 eV by increasing the Sr2+ ion molar ratios.,"Optical, electrical and magnetic properties of lanthanum strontium manganite La1-xSrxMnO3 synthesized through the citrate combustion method",10.1039/c6cp07333f
6,19436,"The trend in the calculated refractive index, the high frequency dielectric constant (epsilon(alpha)) and the static dielectric constant (epsilon(0)) of all the produced samples can be linked to an increase in the Sr2+ ion concentration.","Optical, electrical and magnetic properties of lanthanum strontium manganite La1-xSrxMnO3 synthesized through the citrate combustion method",10.1039/c6cp07333f
7,19436,"Moreover, the magnetic properties were enhanced with increasing Sr2+ ion content.","Optical, electrical and magnetic properties of lanthanum strontium manganite La1-xSrxMnO3 synthesized through the citrate combustion method",10.1039/c6cp07333f
