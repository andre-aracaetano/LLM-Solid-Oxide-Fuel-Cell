1,1151,This study presents a nanofiber-derived functional anode consisting of proton-conducting SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta nanofibers and electro-catalytic Ni for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells.,Nano-fibrous SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ-Ni anode functional layer for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226863
2,1151,"Fuel cell testing with the nano fibrous SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta-Ni anode exhibits a maximum power density of 201.0 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C, which is significantly higher than those of cells with a powder-derived Ba0.8Sr0.2Ce0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-delta-Ni anode or a nano fibrous SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta anode.",Nano-fibrous SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ-Ni anode functional layer for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226863
3,1151,Its relatively lower ohmic resistance can be explained in terms of protonic and electronic highways throughout the nano-fibrous SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta-Ni anode.,Nano-fibrous SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ-Ni anode functional layer for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226863
4,1151,"The significantly lower polarization resistance elements, R-1 and R-2, further indicate that the nano-fibrous SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta-Ni anode has superior catalytic activity for the hydrogen oxidation reaction and thus generates more protons that can participate in the cathode reactions.",Nano-fibrous SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ-Ni anode functional layer for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226863
5,1151,"The results show that the performance enhancement in the fuel cell with the nano-fibrous SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta-Ni anode can be attributed to its low ohmic resistance, excellent electrode catalytic activity, and good gas transport property.",Nano-fibrous SrCe0.8Y0.2O3-δ-Ni anode functional layer for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226863
