1,20904,"In this work, we measure the oxygen kinetic properties of double perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (PBSCF), a material widely used as the air electrode in solid oxide electrochemical cells, by mass relaxation (MR) and electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) experiments.",Cross-Validation of the Remarkably High Surface Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: A Combined Thin-Film Mass Relaxation and Bulk Electrical Conductivity Relaxation Study,10.1021/acsami.3c18574
2,20904,"MR studies are carried out using thin films deposited on a gallium phosphate piezocrystal microbalance, and ECR studies are performed using a bulk bar sample with 97% theoretical density.",Cross-Validation of the Remarkably High Surface Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: A Combined Thin-Film Mass Relaxation and Bulk Electrical Conductivity Relaxation Study,10.1021/acsami.3c18574
3,20904,Measurements are performed at 600 degrees C over the temperature oxygen partial pressure range from 10(-4) to 0.21 atm.,Cross-Validation of the Remarkably High Surface Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: A Combined Thin-Film Mass Relaxation and Bulk Electrical Conductivity Relaxation Study,10.1021/acsami.3c18574
4,20904,"Despite the differences in experimental formats and surface microstructural features, the k(s) values extracted from the two methods are found to be in good agreement with one another.",Cross-Validation of the Remarkably High Surface Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: A Combined Thin-Film Mass Relaxation and Bulk Electrical Conductivity Relaxation Study,10.1021/acsami.3c18574
5,20904,"The rate constant is found to increase with oxygen partial pressure with a power law dependence, rising from 1.0 x 10(-6) cm/s at 3.2 x 10(-4) atm to 1.2 x 10(-4) cm/s at 0.24 atm, as averaged over the oxidation and reduction directions.",Cross-Validation of the Remarkably High Surface Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: A Combined Thin-Film Mass Relaxation and Bulk Electrical Conductivity Relaxation Study,10.1021/acsami.3c18574
6,20904,"The rates in the oxidation direction are observed to be slightly higher than those in the reduction direction for a given pair of pO(2) values, suggesting that the final pO(2) value controls the overall relaxation behavior.",Cross-Validation of the Remarkably High Surface Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: A Combined Thin-Film Mass Relaxation and Bulk Electrical Conductivity Relaxation Study,10.1021/acsami.3c18574
7,20904,The power law exponent describing the dependence of k(s) on pO(2) is found to be 0.74 +/- 0.01.,Cross-Validation of the Remarkably High Surface Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: A Combined Thin-Film Mass Relaxation and Bulk Electrical Conductivity Relaxation Study,10.1021/acsami.3c18574
8,20904,"The ECR study of the bulk sample reveals that even with a diffusion length of 1.8 mm, the relaxation process is largely free of diffusion limitations, indicating that PBSCF has the high bulk transport properties required for a double-phase boundary oxidation/reduction pathway.",Cross-Validation of the Remarkably High Surface Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ: A Combined Thin-Film Mass Relaxation and Bulk Electrical Conductivity Relaxation Study,10.1021/acsami.3c18574
