1,3727,A novel BaCe0.4Zr0.3 Sn0.1Y0.2O3-delta (BSY) electrolyte membrane with thickness of 20 mu m was fabricated on NiO-based anode substrate via a one-step all-solid-state method followed by a co-sintering at 1450 degrees C for 5 h. Chemical stability test demonstrated that BSY electrolyte showed adequate chemical stability against CO2 and H2O at intermediate temperature.,A novel anode supported BaCe0.4Zr0.3Sn0.1Y0.2O3-δ electrolyte membrane for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2009.06.011
