2,1989,"Its working process, however, is complicated and quite different from the traditional oxygen ionic solid oxide fuel cell (O2--SOFC) and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).",Multi-Physical and Electrochemical Coupling Model for the Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells with H+/e-/O2- Mixed Conducting Cathodes,10.3390/app12083889
3,1989,"In this paper, a multi-physical model for the PCFC with H+/e(-)/O2- mixed conducting cathode is established, in which the fuel- and oxidant-diffusing processes; electron-, oxygen ion-, and proton-conducting processes; three electrochemical reactions; and their coupling working details are carefully considered.",Multi-Physical and Electrochemical Coupling Model for the Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells with H+/e-/O2- Mixed Conducting Cathodes,10.3390/app12083889
4,1989,"Taking Ni-BZCY/BZCY/BZCY-LSCF PCFC as an example, the validation of the model is well verified by good agreements with the experiment i(op)-V-op curves at different temperatures.",Multi-Physical and Electrochemical Coupling Model for the Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells with H+/e-/O2- Mixed Conducting Cathodes,10.3390/app12083889
5,1989,The result shows that the cathodic electrochemical reactions will be concentrated to a small thickness near the electrolyte because of the greatly decreased ionic conductivity compared with the high electronic conductivity at an intermediate temperature.,Multi-Physical and Electrochemical Coupling Model for the Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells with H+/e-/O2- Mixed Conducting Cathodes,10.3390/app12083889
6,1989,O2- within the PCFC cathode is only an intermediate transform substance between the electrons and protons.,Multi-Physical and Electrochemical Coupling Model for the Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells with H+/e-/O2- Mixed Conducting Cathodes,10.3390/app12083889
7,1989,"Thus, there is a peak oxygen ion current distribution within the composite cathode of PCFC.",Multi-Physical and Electrochemical Coupling Model for the Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells with H+/e-/O2- Mixed Conducting Cathodes,10.3390/app12083889
8,1989,The cathodic oxygen reduction half reaction is found to be a key factor to dominate the total PCFC voltage loss at the intermediate temperature zone.,Multi-Physical and Electrochemical Coupling Model for the Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells with H+/e-/O2- Mixed Conducting Cathodes,10.3390/app12083889
9,1989,"The concentration polarization of anode-supported PCFC is small, due to the vapors that are generated in the cathode side instead of anode side.",Multi-Physical and Electrochemical Coupling Model for the Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells with H+/e-/O2- Mixed Conducting Cathodes,10.3390/app12083889
