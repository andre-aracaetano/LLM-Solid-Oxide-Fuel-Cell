1,15736,Nano-structured cathodes of La0.65Sr0.3Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) are fabricated by solution precursor plasma spraying (SPPS) on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes (LSCF-SPPS-YSZ).,Microstructure and Polarization Studies on Interlayer Free La0.65Sr0.3Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes Fabricated on Yttria Stabilized Zirconia by Solution Precursor Plasma Spraying,10.1002/fuce.201600119
2,15736,Phase pure LSCF is obtained at all plasma power.,Microstructure and Polarization Studies on Interlayer Free La0.65Sr0.3Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes Fabricated on Yttria Stabilized Zirconia by Solution Precursor Plasma Spraying,10.1002/fuce.201600119
3,15736,Performances of LSCF-SPPS-YSZ cathodes are compared with conventionally prepared LSCF cathodes on YSZ (LSCF-C-YSZ) and gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) (LSCF-C-GDC) electrolytes.,Microstructure and Polarization Studies on Interlayer Free La0.65Sr0.3Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes Fabricated on Yttria Stabilized Zirconia by Solution Precursor Plasma Spraying,10.1002/fuce.201600119
4,15736,High R-p is observed in the LSCF-C-YSZ (similar to 42 Ohm cm(2) at 700 degrees C) followed by LSCF-C-GDC (R-p similar to 1.5 Ohm cm(2) at 700 degrees C) cathodes.,Microstructure and Polarization Studies on Interlayer Free La0.65Sr0.3Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes Fabricated on Yttria Stabilized Zirconia by Solution Precursor Plasma Spraying,10.1002/fuce.201600119
5,15736,Performance of the LSCF-SPPS-YSZ cathodes (R-p similar to 0.1 Ohm cm(2) at 700 degrees C) is found to be even superior to the performance of LSCF-C-GDC cathodes.,Microstructure and Polarization Studies on Interlayer Free La0.65Sr0.3Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes Fabricated on Yttria Stabilized Zirconia by Solution Precursor Plasma Spraying,10.1002/fuce.201600119
6,15736,High performance in LSCF-SPPS-YSZ cathodes is attributed to its nano-structure and absence of any interfacial insulating phase which may be attributed to the low temperature at the interaction point of LSCF and YSZ and low interaction time between LSCF and YSZ during SPPS process.,Microstructure and Polarization Studies on Interlayer Free La0.65Sr0.3Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes Fabricated on Yttria Stabilized Zirconia by Solution Precursor Plasma Spraying,10.1002/fuce.201600119
7,15736,"In the time scale of 100 h, no change in the polarization resistances is observed at 750 degrees C. Based on the literature and from the present studies it can be stated that SOFC with YSZ electrolyte and LSCF-SPPS-YSZ cathode can be operated at 750 degrees C for a longer duration of time and good performance can probably be achieved.",Microstructure and Polarization Studies on Interlayer Free La0.65Sr0.3Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes Fabricated on Yttria Stabilized Zirconia by Solution Precursor Plasma Spraying,10.1002/fuce.201600119
