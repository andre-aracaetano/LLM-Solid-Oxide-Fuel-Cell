1,7714,A ID dynamic solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) model has been developed for real time applications.,A dynamic 1D model of a solid oxide fuel cell for real time simulation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.170
2,7714,The model accounts for all transport and polarization phenomena by developing a system of governing differential equations over ID control volumes.,A dynamic 1D model of a solid oxide fuel cell for real time simulation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.170
3,7714,The ID model is an improvement over existing OD real time models in that it can more accurately predict the temperature and pressure variations along the cell while maintaining real time capabilities with regards to computational time.,A dynamic 1D model of a solid oxide fuel cell for real time simulation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.170
4,7714,Several simplifications are required to maintain real time capabilities while improving the fidelity of the model.,A dynamic 1D model of a solid oxide fuel cell for real time simulation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.170
5,7714,"It was found that a I D model with 21 nodes performs each time dependent computation in 3.8 ms. Results show that activation overpotentials account for most of the total cell overpotential, and that temperature variations across this particular cell exceed 100 K.",A dynamic 1D model of a solid oxide fuel cell for real time simulation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.170
6,7714,"Depending on the gas channel configuration, the pumping power required to supply air and fuel to the cell can be in the same order of magnitude as the power produced by the fuel cell.",A dynamic 1D model of a solid oxide fuel cell for real time simulation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.170
7,7714,"It is shown that the use of fewer channels with larger cross-sectional areas, reduces the pressure drop due to wall friction, and hence reduces the required pumping power.",A dynamic 1D model of a solid oxide fuel cell for real time simulation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.170
