2,18284,interconnect materials arc stable in SOFC operating conditions To improve the sintering ability and electrical conductivity of PNCC a composite of PNCC/SDC interconnect materials was synthesized by a sol-gel auto-ignition process The XRD results indicate that FNCC is chemically stable against reaction with SDC at high temperatures Additionally SDC-doped PNa has enhanced sintering activity and electrical conductivity compared to PNCC alone For 5 wt % SDC the relative density of the sample was 95 8% after sintering at 1400 C and the electrical conductivity of the sample reached 59 6S cm(-1) in air and 4 48S cm(-1) in H-2 at 650 C Both of these values are higher than those of pure PNCC The average thermal expansion coefficient of the samples is close to that of other components of SOFCs Our results indicate that PNCC/SDC composites are promising intermediate materials for IT-SOFCs (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved,Stable and easily sintered (Pr0 5Nd0 5)0 7CaO0 3CrO3-δ/Sm0 2Ce0 8O1 9 composite interconnect materials for IT-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.073
