1,21132,Protonic ceramic cells (PCCs) hold significant promise as energy conversion devices operating at lower temperatures in comparison to traditional Solid Oxide Cells (SOCs).,A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
2,21132,"However, the widespread adoption of PCCs depends on developing innovative, high-performing, electrode materials that exhibit enhanced chemical compatibility with barium-based perovskite electrolytes.",A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
3,21132,"Here, a new cobaltite, Ba2Co9O14 (BCO), is employed for the first time as an electrocatalyst for oxygen reactions in PCCs in contact with a BaZr0.852Y0.148O3-delta (BZY15) + 4 mol% ZnO (sintering agent) electrolyte.",A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
4,21132,BCO displays electrochemical performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art oxygen electrode under wet conditions (pH2O similar to 10-2 atm).,A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
5,21132,"Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent chemical compatibility with the BZY15 electrolyte.",A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
6,21132,Thermogravimetric experiments reveal no significant oxygen loss below 800 degrees C and no noticeable proton uptake.,A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
7,21132,"Conversely, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results highlight the formation of surface oxygen vacancies and mixed valent Co3+/Co2+ states, as corroborated by bond valence sum calculations from Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction data.",A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
8,21132,"Consequently, due to the platelet-like morphology of the BCO electrode grains, and considering its poor bulk ionic conduction, the surface diffusion process becomes highly important in explaining the high-performing electrochemical behaviour.",A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
9,21132,"Moreover, the impedance spectroscopy data analysis brings to light the existence of electronic leakage within the electrolyte substrate, leading to a significant underestimation of the electrode polarisation resistance and misconception of the electrode mechanism.",A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
10,21132,"To address this issue, a data correction is applied, revealing that electrode kinetics is strongly rate-limited by oxygen diffusion on the surface of the BCO grains towards the triple-phase boundary, where proton transfer occurs, releasing water.",A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
11,21132,"In contrast, the adsorption and/or the oxygen dissociation steps are facilitated given the predominantly electronic character of the BCO material, which is suggested to originate from a small polaron hopping mechanism.",A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
12,21132,"Our results, thereby, introduce a new intergrowth series of cobaltites, which present an exciting avenue for exploration in the context of PCCs.",A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
13,21132,"The electrode mechanism of the Ba2Co9O14 cobaltite is outlined for application in protonic ceramic cells, revealing a rate-limiting surface diffusion of oxygen species.",A new layered barium cobaltite electrode for protonic ceramic cells,10.1039/d3ta06438g
