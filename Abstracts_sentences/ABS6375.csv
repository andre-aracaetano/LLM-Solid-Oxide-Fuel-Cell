5,6375,It is observed that steam addition does not have significant impact on system electrical efficiency.,"Thermodynamic evaluation of small-scale systems with biomass gasifiers, solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/GDC anodes and gas turbines",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.017
6,6375,"However, generation of additional steam using heat from gas turbine outlet decreases the thermal energy and exergy available at the system outlet thereby decreasing total system efficiency.","Thermodynamic evaluation of small-scale systems with biomass gasifiers, solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/GDC anodes and gas turbines",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.017
7,6375,"With the gas cleaning at atmospheric temperature, there is a decrease in the electrical efficiency of the order of 4-5% when compared to the efficiency of the systems working with intermediate to high gas-cleaning temperatures.","Thermodynamic evaluation of small-scale systems with biomass gasifiers, solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/GDC anodes and gas turbines",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.017
