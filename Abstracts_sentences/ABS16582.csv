5,16582,"The product is shown to exhibit (i) a perovskite-type cubic phase with a = 3.975 +/- 0.002 angstrom, Z = 1, and space group Pm3m, (ii) Fe(3+)0.5 and Fe(4+)0.3 ions, (iii) oxygen deficiency parameter xi similar to 0.45, and (iv) optical absorption at similar to 370 nm ( similar to 3.4 eV) and similar to 797 nm (similar to 1.56 eV) - arising due to charge transfer transition from O2-(2p) to Fe3+(3d) and octahedral crystal field splitting of iron t(2g) and e(g) orbitals, respectively.","Sol-gel formation, Mossbauer studies, optical absorption and impedance characteristics of Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-ξ powder",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2012.06.013
6,16582,"Moreover, the high impedance values observed below 10 kHz over a temperature range of 303-413 K have been attributed to space charge polarization; activation energy of the relaxation process being 0.2 eV. The motion of induced polarons is possibly responsible for the decrease of impedance with increase of temperature in the range 303-413 K.
