1,12041,This paper applies the Exergy Cost Theory (ECT) to a hybrid system based on a 500 kWe solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack and on a vapor-absorption refrigeration (VAR) system.,"The Exergy Costs of Electrical Power, Cooling, and Waste Heat from a Hybrid System Based on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and an Absorption Refrigeration System",10.3390/en12183476
2,12041,"To achieve this, a model comprised of chemical, electrochemical, thermodynamic, and thermoeconomic equations is developed using the software, Engineering Equation Solver (EES).","The Exergy Costs of Electrical Power, Cooling, and Waste Heat from a Hybrid System Based on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and an Absorption Refrigeration System",10.3390/en12183476
3,12041,The model is validated against previous works.,"The Exergy Costs of Electrical Power, Cooling, and Waste Heat from a Hybrid System Based on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and an Absorption Refrigeration System",10.3390/en12183476
4,12041,"This approach enables the unit exergy costs (electricity, cooling, and residues) to be computed by a productive structure defined by components, resources, products, and residues.","The Exergy Costs of Electrical Power, Cooling, and Waste Heat from a Hybrid System Based on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and an Absorption Refrigeration System",10.3390/en12183476
5,12041,"Most importantly, it allows us to know the contribution of the environment and of the residues to the unit exergy cost of the product of the components.","The Exergy Costs of Electrical Power, Cooling, and Waste Heat from a Hybrid System Based on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and an Absorption Refrigeration System",10.3390/en12183476
6,12041,"Finally, the simulation of different scenarios makes it possible to analyze the impact of stack current density, fuel use, temperature across the stack, and anode gas recirculation on the unit exergy costs of electrical power, cooling, and residues.","The Exergy Costs of Electrical Power, Cooling, and Waste Heat from a Hybrid System Based on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and an Absorption Refrigeration System",10.3390/en12183476
