1,11852,CeO2-Ni/YSZ anodes for methane direct oxidation were prepared by the vacuum mix-impregnation method.,Performance of mix-impregnated CeO2-Ni/YSZ Anodes for Direct Oxidation of Methane in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800104
2,11852,"By this method, NiO and CeO2 are obtained from nitrate decomposition and high temperature sintering is avoided, which is different from the preparation of conventional Ni-yttria-stabilised zirconia(YSZ) anodes impregnating CeO2 Into the anode can improve the cell performance, especially, when CH4 is Used as fuel The investigation indicated that CeO2-Ni/YSZ anodes calcined at higher temperature exhibited better stability than those calcined at lower temperature.",Performance of mix-impregnated CeO2-Ni/YSZ Anodes for Direct Oxidation of Methane in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800104
3,11852,"Under the testing temperature of 1,073 K, the anode calcined at 1,073 K exhibited the best performance The maximum power density of a cell with a 10 wt-%CeO2-25 wt.-%Ni anode calcined at 1,073 K reached 480 mW cm(-2) after running on CH4 for 5 h At the same time, high discharge current favoured cell operation on CH4 when Using these anodes No obvious carbon was found on the CeO2-Ni anode after testing in CH4 as revealed from SEM and corresponding linear EDS analysis.",Performance of mix-impregnated CeO2-Ni/YSZ Anodes for Direct Oxidation of Methane in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800104
4,11852,"In addition, cell performance decreased at the beginning of discharge testing which was attributed to the anode microstructure change Observed with SEM",Performance of mix-impregnated CeO2-Ni/YSZ Anodes for Direct Oxidation of Methane in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800104
