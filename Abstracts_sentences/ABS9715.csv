1,9715,The complete oxidation of methane into water and carbon dioxide on the (I 11) surface of ceria is considered within a DFT + U framework in order to gain insight into the coke-free operation of solid oxide fuel cells with ceria-containing anodes.,Methane Dissociation on the Ceria (111) Surface,10.1021/jp8039862
2,9715,"Preferred adsorption sites and energies are determined for CH, (x = 0,..., 3), H, and CO, together with transition states and kinetic barriers along the complete pathway from CH4 to H2O and CO2.",Methane Dissociation on the Ceria (111) Surface,10.1021/jp8039862
3,9715,"The results presented are in excellent agreement with existing theoretical and experimental work suggesting that ceria is more easily reduced by CO than by H-2 and offer an explanation for the apparently inconsistent observations of carbon coke formation in Ni-ceria anodes and the stable, coke-free oxidation of methane in Cu-ceria anodes.",Methane Dissociation on the Ceria (111) Surface,10.1021/jp8039862
