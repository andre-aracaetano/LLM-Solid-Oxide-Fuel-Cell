1,10005,The physical properties of the ceramic Y0.25Zr0.60Ti0.15O2-x (YZT) and Ni/YZT cermets are presented and evaluated in terms of an application as anode substrate or anode material in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Physical characterization of Y0.25Zr0.60Ti0.15O2-x and its performance as a Ni/Y0.25Zr0.60Ti0.15O2-x anode cermet in an SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.02.022
2,10005,Cermets with different Ni content were exposed at 1000 degreesC for up to 1000 It and showed a better long-term stability in terms of electrical conductivity and microstructure than cermets with yttria (8 mol%)-stabilized zirconia (Ni/8YSZ).,Physical characterization of Y0.25Zr0.60Ti0.15O2-x and its performance as a Ni/Y0.25Zr0.60Ti0.15O2-x anode cermet in an SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.02.022
3,10005,This is explained by the different bonding strength at the Ni/ceramic interface due to the Ti content.,Physical characterization of Y0.25Zr0.60Ti0.15O2-x and its performance as a Ni/Y0.25Zr0.60Ti0.15O2-x anode cermet in an SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.02.022
