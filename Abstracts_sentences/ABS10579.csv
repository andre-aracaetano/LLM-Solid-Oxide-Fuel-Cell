2,10579,"Here we report a Gd0.8Ce0.2O1.9-delta (GDC) coated La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) composite cathode material, which can significantly improve the electrochemical performance and durability of LSCF cathode.",Effects of Gd0.8Ce0.2O1.9-δ coating with different thickness on electrochemical performance and long-term stability of La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode in SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.050
3,10579,"The effects of different GDC coating thickness on the electrochemical performance and long-term working stability of LSCF cathode are investigated, and the optimal coating thickness is established.",Effects of Gd0.8Ce0.2O1.9-δ coating with different thickness on electrochemical performance and long-term stability of La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode in SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.050
4,10579,"The polarization impedance of GDC coated LSCF (LSCF@GDC) cathode with 9 nm of GDC coating is 0.08 U cm(2) at 800 degrees C, which is only one quarter of that of the raw LSCF cathode, and the degradation rate of constant current polarization with 100 mA cm(-2) is only 0.42%/100 h at 700 degrees C, which is far less than that of the raw LSCF cathode.",Effects of Gd0.8Ce0.2O1.9-δ coating with different thickness on electrochemical performance and long-term stability of La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode in SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.050
