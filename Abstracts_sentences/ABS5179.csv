1,5179,"Engineering the anion defect, especially oxygen vacancy, at the electrolyte surface is important because the concentration and distribution of defects at this surface often determine the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics and, in turn, the electrochemical performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (<700 degrees C).",Controlling oxygen defect chemistry at electrolyte surface of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230351
2,5179,"However, designing the desired defect structures is a challenging issue because the required concentration and distribution of defects strongly depend on the locations in the electrolyte with different functionalities.",Controlling oxygen defect chemistry at electrolyte surface of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230351
