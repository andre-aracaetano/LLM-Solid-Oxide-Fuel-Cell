1,13801,Reaction between La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 electrode and yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte (YSZ) was investigated at 973 K to estimate its effect on performance of a solid oxide fuel cell at reduced operation temperatures.,"Interfacial reaction and electrochemical properties of dense (La,Sr) CoO3-δ cathode on YSZ(100)",10.1016/j.jpcs.2004.06.057
2,13801,"Since La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 is a good mixed conductor of electron and oxide ion, oxygen incorporation through the bulk diffusion is fairly fast if it is compared to the surface diffusion and reaction at triple phase boundaries (TPB).","Interfacial reaction and electrochemical properties of dense (La,Sr) CoO3-δ cathode on YSZ(100)",10.1016/j.jpcs.2004.06.057
3,13801,"In order to simplify the oxygen reaction pathway, a dense electrode film of La0.6Sr0.04CoO3 was fabricated on an YSZ single crystal by pulsed laser deposition.","Interfacial reaction and electrochemical properties of dense (La,Sr) CoO3-δ cathode on YSZ(100)",10.1016/j.jpcs.2004.06.057
4,13801,Electrochemical measurements and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis were performed before and after a long-term operation test for 3800 h at 973 K. Electrochemical impedance analysis enabled us to distinguish the contribution of the electrode/electrolyte interface resistance from the total electrochemical resistance.,"Interfacial reaction and electrochemical properties of dense (La,Sr) CoO3-δ cathode on YSZ(100)",10.1016/j.jpcs.2004.06.057
