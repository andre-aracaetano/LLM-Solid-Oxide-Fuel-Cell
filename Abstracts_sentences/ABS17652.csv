2,17652,Formation enthalpies of LnCoO(3-delta) compounds were measured using high temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry.,"Energetics of lanthanide cobalt perovskites: LnCoO3-δ (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd)",10.1039/c5ta03655k
3,17652,"The formation enthalpies of LaCoO2.992, NdCoO2.985, SmCoO2.982 and GdCoO2.968 from constituent binary oxides (Ln(2)O(3), CoO) and O-2 gas are -111.87 +/- 1.36, -98.49 +/- 1.33, -91.56 +/- 1.46 and -88.16 +/- 1.45 kJ mol(-1), respectively.","Energetics of lanthanide cobalt perovskites: LnCoO3-δ (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd)",10.1039/c5ta03655k
4,17652,"Thus these perovskites become energetically less stable with decrease in ionic radius of the lanthanide (from La to Gd), which corresponds to a decreasing tolerance factor and increasing oxygen deficiency.","Energetics of lanthanide cobalt perovskites: LnCoO3-δ (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd)",10.1039/c5ta03655k
5,17652,"The thermodynamic stability of LaCoO2.992, NdCoO2.985, SmCoO2.982 and GdCoO2.968 was also assessed considering their oxygen partial pressures for decomposition, with good agreement between thermochemical and equilibrium data.","Energetics of lanthanide cobalt perovskites: LnCoO3-δ (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd)",10.1039/c5ta03655k
