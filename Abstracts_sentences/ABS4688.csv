1,4688,A deposition of yttrium stabilized zirconia layer for its use as an electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cell was performed using dip coating technique.,Deposition Via Dip Coating Technique of Dense Yttrium Stabilized Zirconia Layers,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02778.x
2,4688,Two commercially available surfactant systems were evaluated; nonionic surfactant which stabilizes only by steric repulsion and anionic surfactant which provides both steric and electrostatic repulsion.,Deposition Via Dip Coating Technique of Dense Yttrium Stabilized Zirconia Layers,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02778.x
3,4688,Dip coating process was optimized to two step deposition process.,Deposition Via Dip Coating Technique of Dense Yttrium Stabilized Zirconia Layers,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02778.x
4,4688,Uniform 1015 mu m thick yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte layer is obtained after the final sintering step at 1400 degrees C. Impedance spectroscopy measurements showed that selected phosphate ester based surfactant has negligible effect on the performance of the YSZ material as electrolyte.,Deposition Via Dip Coating Technique of Dense Yttrium Stabilized Zirconia Layers,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02778.x
