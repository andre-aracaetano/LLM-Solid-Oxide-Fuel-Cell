1,14416,Catalytic partial oxidation (CPOx) of n-butane in O-2/Ar mixtures at ratios of 1/3.76 has been investigated over Rh catalysis impregnated in gamma-Al2O3 washcoat supports coated on alpha-Al2O3 ceramic foam monoliths.,Catalytic partial oxidation of n-butane over Rh catalysts for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.cattod.2009.03.032

3,14416,Results for a C/O ratio = 1.0 and T-in = 300 degrees C indicate the n-butane conversion and H-2 and CO selectivity depend strongly upon reactor temperature and thus heat lost through the external reactor walls.,Catalytic partial oxidation of n-butane over Rh catalysts for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.cattod.2009.03.032
4,14416,"Because heat loss does not scale with flow rate, higher flow rates for catalyst contact times approaching 15 ms increase fuel conversion and syngas selectivity.",Catalytic partial oxidation of n-butane over Rh catalysts for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.cattod.2009.03.032
5,14416,"Furthermore, shortening catalyst length (from 10 to 5 mm) also reduces heat loss and increases fuel conversion and H-2 selectivity.",Catalytic partial oxidation of n-butane over Rh catalysts for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.cattod.2009.03.032

7,14416,"These results suggest that for the conditions tested, butane conversion and H-2 production occur rapidly within the first couple ofmmin the reactor, whereas CO production occurs more broadly throughout the reactor length.",Catalytic partial oxidation of n-butane over Rh catalysts for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.cattod.2009.03.032
