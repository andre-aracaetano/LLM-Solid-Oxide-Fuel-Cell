1,14397,The Laves phase strengthened ferritic steel Crofer 22 H has been proposed as construction material for interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells.,"Temperature Dependence of Laves Phase Composition in Nb, W and Si-Alloyed High Chromium Ferritic Steels for SOFC Interconnect Applications",10.1007/s11669-015-0403-5
2,14397,"The background of the present study relates to the further qualification of this steel, especially with respect to a possible optimization of amount and composition of the strengthening Laves phase precipitates.","Temperature Dependence of Laves Phase Composition in Nb, W and Si-Alloyed High Chromium Ferritic Steels for SOFC Interconnect Applications",10.1007/s11669-015-0403-5
3,14397,For this purpose the chemical composition of the Laves phase in a number of high purity model alloys as well as in Crofer 22 H equilibrated at temperatures between 700 and 1100 A degrees C was measured by EDX/WDX and atom probe tomography (APT).,"Temperature Dependence of Laves Phase Composition in Nb, W and Si-Alloyed High Chromium Ferritic Steels for SOFC Interconnect Applications",10.1007/s11669-015-0403-5
4,14397,"The obtained chemical compositions were used for a qualitative estimation of the site occupancy for Fe, Cr, Nb, W and Si in the Laves phase unit cell.","Temperature Dependence of Laves Phase Composition in Nb, W and Si-Alloyed High Chromium Ferritic Steels for SOFC Interconnect Applications",10.1007/s11669-015-0403-5
5,14397,"Additionally, the results from APT measurements indicate the important role of impurities such as e.g. titanium in the Laves phase formation.","Temperature Dependence of Laves Phase Composition in Nb, W and Si-Alloyed High Chromium Ferritic Steels for SOFC Interconnect Applications",10.1007/s11669-015-0403-5
6,14397,"Finally, the experimental results were compared with Thermocalc calculations using the database TCFE 7.","Temperature Dependence of Laves Phase Composition in Nb, W and Si-Alloyed High Chromium Ferritic Steels for SOFC Interconnect Applications",10.1007/s11669-015-0403-5
7,14397,"This revealed that within the temperature range 800-900 A degrees C a qualitative description of phases is possible, however, substantial differences existed particularly for the steel Crofer 22 H at and below 700 A degrees C and above 950 degrees C.","Temperature Dependence of Laves Phase Composition in Nb, W and Si-Alloyed High Chromium Ferritic Steels for SOFC Interconnect Applications",10.1007/s11669-015-0403-5
