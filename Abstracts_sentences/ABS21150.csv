5,21150,"Interfacial polarization resistance (R-p) is obtained from peak arcs located in the three regions: gas conversion resistance (Region I (0.01 to 0.1 Hz)), gas diffusion resistance (Region II (0.1 to 100 Hz)) and air electrode charge transfer resistance (Region III (100 to 10,000 Hz)).",Electrochemical characterization of electrolyte supported solid oxide electrolysis cell during CO2/H2O co-electrolysis,10.1007/s10008-024-05853-2
6,21150,"As the temperature increased from 700 to 850 C-o, R-p decreased from 18.15 to 3.32 Omega.cm(2) at 1.3 V for 10%CO2/3%H2O. From the Distribution of relaxation times (DRT) studies, one additional peak, P-5 (fuel gas conversion or gas-phase diffusion in the pores of the air electrode), is observed, and Region III (100 to 10,000 Hz) consists of two additional peaks: P-1 (ionic transport coupled with gas diffusion close to triple phase boundaries (TPBs)) and P-2 (fuel electrode charge transfer reaction), which were not clearly distinguished from EIS.",Electrochemical characterization of electrolyte supported solid oxide electrolysis cell during CO2/H2O co-electrolysis,10.1007/s10008-024-05853-2
