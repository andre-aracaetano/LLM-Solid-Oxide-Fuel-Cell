3,13403,Here we present reversible solid oxide cell life test results for different GDC infiltration loadings into NiYSZ electrodes in two types of fuel-electrode-supported solid oxide cells.,Effect of Gd-doped ceria infiltration into Ni-YSZ on reversible solid oxide cell operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232189
4,13403,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that GDC infiltrant lowers the initial cell area specific resistance (ASR) and limits the degradation - for example, the GDC-infiltrated electrode ASR increased by 0.1 Omega cm(2) over 1000 h of reversible operation at +/- 0.5 A cm(-2) and 800 degrees C, compared to 0.19 Omega cm(2) for non-infiltrated cells.",Effect of Gd-doped ceria infiltration into Ni-YSZ on reversible solid oxide cell operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232189
5,13403,"Cell voltage degradation rates were reduced by infiltration during operation at a current density of +/- 0.5 A cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, and during at 700 degrees C at +/- 0.75 A cm(-2) .",Effect of Gd-doped ceria infiltration into Ni-YSZ on reversible solid oxide cell operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232189
