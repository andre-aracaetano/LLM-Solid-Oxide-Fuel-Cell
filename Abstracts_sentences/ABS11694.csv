2,11694,"Therefore, extended lifetime tests are essential for learning about the long-term behavior and various degradation mechanisms and to foster ideas about accelerated stack testing.",Long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells and preliminary findings on accelerated testing,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.01.074
3,11694,"The Forschungszentrum Julich has been gradually extending the testing time, resulting in successful short-stack operating times of between 20,000 and 40,000 h. This work highlights the results of these long-term tests and compares the observations for different material combinations, operating temperatures of 700 and 800 degrees C, including different fuel utilizations and gas compositions.",Long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells and preliminary findings on accelerated testing,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.01.074
