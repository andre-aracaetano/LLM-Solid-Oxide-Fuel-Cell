3,16845,"It has a remarkable stability on thermal oxidation and provides a remarkable electrical conductivity of 4 S cm(-1) at 1000 degrees C, while conventional carbon-based materials, including commercial CNTs, cannot maintain electrical properties because of oxidation below 400 degrees C. Thus, the novel atmospheric CO2-based chemical vapor decomposition route can contribute to the applications of carbon-based material in high-temperature oxidation conditions such as a solid oxide fuel cell.",Electrically Conductive Oxidation-Resistant Boron-Coated Carbon Nanotubes Derived from Atmospheric CO2 for Use at High Temperature,10.1021/acsanm.0c01909
