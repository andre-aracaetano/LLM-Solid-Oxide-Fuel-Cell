2,15948,"The fundamental properties for conventional NiO-YSZ anode supports - such as porosity, shrinkage, electrical conductivity and mechanical strength - were measured as a function of the proportion of NiO and YSZ (coarse and fine powders).",Optimization of Ni-zirconia based anode support for robust and high-performance 5 x 5 cm2 sized SOFC via tape-casting/co-firing technique and nano-structured anode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.12.077
3,15948,"Electrical conductivity, shrinkage, porosity, strength were found to be 1200 S/cm, 22%, 45% and 55 MPa, respectively, for a composition of NiO:YSZ (60:40 wt%) and coarse:fine YSZ (50:50 wt%).",Optimization of Ni-zirconia based anode support for robust and high-performance 5 x 5 cm2 sized SOFC via tape-casting/co-firing technique and nano-structured anode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.12.077
