1,5164,This paper describes the development and application of a novel computational fluid dynamics model which allows the investigation of large solid oxide fuel cell stacks in practical computation times.,Comprehensive computational fluid dynamics model of solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.103
2,5164,"Comparisons with a previously verified model match quantitatively to within 3% difference for all parameters of a benchmark case and solve within 1.5% the computation time for parallel flows of air and fuel in a cell, verifying the present model as a practical option in stack design.",Comprehensive computational fluid dynamics model of solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.103
3,5164,The model is used to demonstrate that the distribution of flow rates to each cell in a 100 cell stack significantly affects the temperature distribution and overall electrochemical performance.,Comprehensive computational fluid dynamics model of solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.103
4,5164,"In a further analysis, it is quantitatively demonstrated that it would be misleading to attempt to predict performance or optimise manifold designs based on a model with uncoupled transport and electrochemistry.",Comprehensive computational fluid dynamics model of solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.103
