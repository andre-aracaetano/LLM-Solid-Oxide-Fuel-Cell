1,15252,La-doped ceria (Ce0.6La0.4O1.8 [LDC]) has been reported to be an effective buffer layer material for preventing the chemical reaction between Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3 (LSGM) electrolyte and Ni-based anode during sintering.,Preparation of LaGaO3 thin film for intermediate temperature SOFC by screen printing method (I),10.1007/s11581-012-0684-1
2,15252,"However, it seems difficult to achieve a high power density on the cell using LDC buffer layer because of its low sintering and electrical conducting properties.",Preparation of LaGaO3 thin film for intermediate temperature SOFC by screen printing method (I),10.1007/s11581-012-0684-1
3,15252,"In this study, effects of various sintering additives such as MgO, SrO, In2O3, Ga2O3, ZrO2, and LSGM oxide powders were studied for improving sintering density and electrical conductivity of LDC.",Preparation of LaGaO3 thin film for intermediate temperature SOFC by screen printing method (I),10.1007/s11581-012-0684-1
