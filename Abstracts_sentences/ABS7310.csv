1,7310,The insufficient oxygen reduction reaction activity of cathode materials is one of the main obstacles to decreasing the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,A Zn-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Perovskite Cathode with Enhanced ORR Catalytic Activity for SOFCs,10.3390/catal10020235
2,7310,"Here, we report a Zn-doped perovskite oxide Ba0.5Sr0.5(Co0.8Fe0.2)(0.96)Zn0.04O3-delta (BSCFZ) as the SOFC cathode, which exhibits much higher electrocatalytical activity than Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).",A Zn-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Perovskite Cathode with Enhanced ORR Catalytic Activity for SOFCs,10.3390/catal10020235
3,7310,"The BSCFZ cathode exhibited a polarization resistance of only 0.23 and 0.03 Omega.cm(2) on a symmetrical cell at 600 and 750 degrees C, respectively.",A Zn-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Perovskite Cathode with Enhanced ORR Catalytic Activity for SOFCs,10.3390/catal10020235
4,7310,"The corresponding maximum power density of 0.58 Omega.cm(-2) was obtained in the yittria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based anode-supported single cell at 750 degrees C, an increase by 35% in comparison to the BSCF cathode.",A Zn-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Perovskite Cathode with Enhanced ORR Catalytic Activity for SOFCs,10.3390/catal10020235
5,7310,"The enhanced performance can be attributed to a better balance of oxygen vacancies, surface electron transfer and ionic mobility as promoted by the low valence Zn2+ doping.",A Zn-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Perovskite Cathode with Enhanced ORR Catalytic Activity for SOFCs,10.3390/catal10020235
6,7310,This work proves that Zn-doping is a highly effective strategy to further enhance the ORR electrocatalytic activity of state-of-the-art Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta cathode material for intermediate temperature SOFCs.,A Zn-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Perovskite Cathode with Enhanced ORR Catalytic Activity for SOFCs,10.3390/catal10020235
