4,4477,"In their work, the flux ratio of species is calculated by Graham's law and contradictorily the equimolar counter transport is used for isobaric assumption.","Modeling mass transfer in solid oxide fuel cell anode: I.

6,4477,"The dusty gas model combined with the 'Stoich' flux-ratio approach, i.e. the species flux is dictated by its stoichiometry of the electrochemical reaction, is validated to make the best performance.","Modeling mass transfer in solid oxide fuel cell anode: I. Comparison between Fickian, Stefan-Maxwell and dusty-gas models",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.01.099
7,4477,"And all models by the 'Graham' flux-ratio approach, i.e. the flux of species satisfies Graham's law, underestimate the concentration overpotential when the molecular weights of species are quite different.","Modeling mass transfer in solid oxide fuel cell anode: I.
