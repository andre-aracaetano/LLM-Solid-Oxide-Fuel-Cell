3,14069,"Scanning electron microscope examinations revealed that deposition temperature and electric field strength had profound influence on resultant microstructure, while composition of the precursor solution had little effect.",Deposition of Ni-CGO composite anodes by electrostatic assisted ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method,10.1016/j.materresbull.2006.11.031
4,14069,"A highly porous cauliflower structure ideal for solid oxide fuel cell anode performance was obtained with a deposition temperature of 450 degrees C under an electric field introduced by an applied voltage of 12 kV. Films obtained with a lower deposition temperature of 250 degrees C or a higher applied voltage of 15 kV resulted in denser films with low porosity, while lower applied voltages of 7 or 5 kV resulted in thinner or discontinuous films due to the insufficient electrostatic attraction on the aerosol droplets.",Deposition of Ni-CGO composite anodes by electrostatic assisted ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method,10.1016/j.materresbull.2006.11.031
5,14069,"As revealed by AC impedance measurement, the area specific resistances of the Ni-CGO anode with porous cauliflower structure were rather low and a value of 0.09 ohm cm(2) at 550 degrees C was obtained.",Deposition of Ni-CGO composite anodes by electrostatic assisted ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method,10.1016/j.materresbull.2006.11.031
