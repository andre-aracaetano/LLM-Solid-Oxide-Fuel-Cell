2,11969,"However, the technology is currently facing some major issues such as coking and oxidation of anode during operation.",Methane internal steam reforming in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.128
3,11969,"Here we report a low temperature sinterable catalyst, Ce0.77Ni0.2Mn0.03O2-delta (CNMnO), applied on top of Ni-YSZ to perform the steam reforming reaction.",Methane internal steam reforming in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.128
4,11969,"A single cell with CNMnO/Ni-YSZ/YSZ/GDC/LSC configuration produces a peak power density of 492 mW cm(-2) in wet hydrogen and 371 mW cm(-2) in wet methane, at 600 degrees C.",Methane internal steam reforming in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.128
5,11969,The cell also shows exceptional durability against Ni oxidation when tested in wet methane under 0.2 A cm(-2) for 100 h. The improved performance and durability of the catalyst layer has been attributed to the nanosized precipitated Ni and Mn particles distributed on the surface of individual CNMnO particles.,Methane internal steam reforming in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.02.128
