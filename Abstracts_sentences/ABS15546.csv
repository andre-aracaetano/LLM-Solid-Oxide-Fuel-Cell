1,15546,The thermochemical stability of lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) processed between 1000 degrees C-1200 degrees C via the in situ carbon templating method was studied.,The Impact of Sintering Atmosphere and Temperature on the Phase Evolution of High Surface Area LSCF Prepared by In Situ Carbon Templating,10.1149/1945-7111/abf062
2,15546,"This method generates high surface area ceramics at traditional solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) sintering temperatures by generating a carbon template in situ and subsequently removing the template by oxidation at 700 degrees C. Argon processed samples produced an amorphous carbon template, whereas nitrogen tended to form graphitic carbon.",The Impact of Sintering Atmosphere and Temperature on the Phase Evolution of High Surface Area LSCF Prepared by In Situ Carbon Templating,10.1149/1945-7111/abf062
3,15546,"Prior to the oxidation step, nitrogen samples comprised larger La2O3 crystallites (22-40 nm) compared to argon (9-17 nm).",The Impact of Sintering Atmosphere and Temperature on the Phase Evolution of High Surface Area LSCF Prepared by In Situ Carbon Templating,10.1149/1945-7111/abf062
4,15546,"Upon oxidation, argon samples resulted in a pure LSCF phase with surface areas in the 21-29 m(2)g(-1) range, whereas nitrogen samples contained significant impurities.",The Impact of Sintering Atmosphere and Temperature on the Phase Evolution of High Surface Area LSCF Prepared by In Situ Carbon Templating,10.1149/1945-7111/abf062
5,15546,This demonstrates that the size of La2O3 crystallites formed during inert processing limited the ability to produce a pure LSCF phase.,The Impact of Sintering Atmosphere and Temperature on the Phase Evolution of High Surface Area LSCF Prepared by In Situ Carbon Templating,10.1149/1945-7111/abf062
