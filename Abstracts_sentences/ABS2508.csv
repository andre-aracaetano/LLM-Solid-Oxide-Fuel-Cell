1,2508,One of the critical issues in designing and fabricating high-performance planar solid oxide fuel cell (pSOFC) stacks is the ability to hermetically seal adjacent metal and ceramic components.,Rupture testing as a tool for developing planar solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1361/10599490419306
2,2508,"In our pSOFC development program, we have designed a testing technique that allows us to screen through the numerous variables involved in developing glass seals.",Rupture testing as a tool for developing planar solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1361/10599490419306
3,2508,"Using this test for example, we have found that the composition of the metal component plays an important role in the strength of the seal.",Rupture testing as a tool for developing planar solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1361/10599490419306
4,2508,"Microstructural analysis of as-sealed specimens revealed that an interfacial reaction zone forms during joining, and it appears that the thickness and composition of this layer are the dominant parameters that control joint strength.",Rupture testing as a tool for developing planar solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1361/10599490419306
5,2508,In this paper the details of the seal test are reported.,Rupture testing as a tool for developing planar solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1361/10599490419306
6,2508,The results have proven particularly significant in the development of the next-generation stack design.,Rupture testing as a tool for developing planar solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1361/10599490419306
7,2508,Supporting microstructural and chemical analyses collected on the test specimens are also presented and used to interpret the seal test results in an effort to identify the necessary steps toward improving glass pSOFC seals.,Rupture testing as a tool for developing planar solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1361/10599490419306
