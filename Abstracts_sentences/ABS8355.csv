1,8355,"Dense and translucent BaZrxCe0.8-xY0.2O3-delta (x = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7) proton conductors were firstly and successfully prepared by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) at a temperature of 1350 degrees C without sintering aids' addition.","Dense and translucent BaZrxCe0.8-xY0.2O3-δ (x=0.5, 0.6, 0.7) proton conductors prepared by spark plasma sintering",10.1016/j.scriptamat.2015.06.006
2,8355,"XRD, SEM and EDS were applied to determine the phase purity, morphology and element composition of prepared pellets, respectively.","Dense and translucent BaZrxCe0.8-xY0.2O3-δ (x=0.5, 0.6, 0.7) proton conductors prepared by spark plasma sintering",10.1016/j.scriptamat.2015.06.006
3,8355,"Moreover, the sintering behaviors of these proton conductors were monitored and analyzed through the on-line sintering curves.","Dense and translucent BaZrxCe0.8-xY0.2O3-δ (x=0.5, 0.6, 0.7) proton conductors prepared by spark plasma sintering",10.1016/j.scriptamat.2015.06.006
4,8355,The obtained results indicate that a lowered sintering temperature (<1400 degrees C) and a fast cooling rate (>= 200 degrees C/min) represent two key parameters to prepare dense Ce-containing BaZrO3-BaCeO3 based proton conductors.,"Dense and translucent BaZrxCe0.8-xY0.2O3-δ (x=0.5, 0.6, 0.7) proton conductors prepared by spark plasma sintering",10.1016/j.scriptamat.2015.06.006
