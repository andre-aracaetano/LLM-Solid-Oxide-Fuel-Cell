1,19149,"The contribution comprises the investigation of the microstructure and residual stresses in thermally sprayed Mn1.0Co1.9Fe0.1O4.0 (MCF) protective coatings for interconnectors of SOFC stacks, deposited on ferritic steel Crofer 22 APU via atmospheric plasma spraying (APS).",Phase Transformation-Induced Changes in Microstructure and Residual Stresses in Thermally Sprayed MnCoFeO4 Protective Coatings,10.1007/s11666-020-00997-9
2,19149,The coatings are designated to prevent Cr evaporation during high operation temperature of the SOFCs.,Phase Transformation-Induced Changes in Microstructure and Residual Stresses in Thermally Sprayed MnCoFeO4 Protective Coatings,10.1007/s11666-020-00997-9
3,19149,"The local microstructure, pore distributions and pore shapes, phase fractions, micro-hardness, Youngs' modulus and residual stresses through the coating thickness were characterized in as-sprayed state and compared with longtime (10-100 h) heat-treated samples (700 and 850 degrees C).",Phase Transformation-Induced Changes in Microstructure and Residual Stresses in Thermally Sprayed MnCoFeO4 Protective Coatings,10.1007/s11666-020-00997-9
4,19149,"The results show that the long-term thermal aging treatment causes a successive high sintering of the coatings characterized by a reduction in pore density, by phase transformation from the metastable rock salt structure that gradually transformed to a spinel structure and by a slight relaxation of the process-induced tensile residual stresses in the coating.",Phase Transformation-Induced Changes in Microstructure and Residual Stresses in Thermally Sprayed MnCoFeO4 Protective Coatings,10.1007/s11666-020-00997-9
