1,9713,Infiltrated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3.delta (LSCF) sintered porous powder cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells have been investigated by synchrotron ultra-small angle x-ray scattering (USAXS).,"Synchrotron X-ray studies of model SOFC cathodes, part II: Porous powder cathodes",10.1016/j.ssi.2017.10.001
2,9713,We demonstrated that atomic layer deposition (ALD) is the method for a uniform coating and liquid-phase infiltration for growing nanoscale particles on the porous LSCF surfaces.,"Synchrotron X-ray studies of model SOFC cathodes, part II: Porous powder cathodes",10.1016/j.ssi.2017.10.001
3,9713,"The MnO infiltrate, grown by ALD, forms a conformal layer with a uniform thickness throughout the pores evidenced by USAXS thickness fringes.","Synchrotron X-ray studies of model SOFC cathodes, part II: Porous powder cathodes",10.1016/j.ssi.2017.10.001
4,9713,"The La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSC) and La2Zr2O7 (LZO) infiltrates, grown by liquid-phase infiltration, were found to form nanoscale particles on the surfaces of LSCF particles resulting in increased surface areas.","Synchrotron X-ray studies of model SOFC cathodes, part II: Porous powder cathodes",10.1016/j.ssi.2017.10.001
5,9713,"Impedance measurements suggest that the catalytic property of LSC infiltrate, not the increased surface area of LZO, is important for increasing oxygen reduction activities.","Synchrotron X-ray studies of model SOFC cathodes, part II: Porous powder cathodes",10.1016/j.ssi.2017.10.001
