1,17551,"A numerical model has been developed for the performance analysis of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)/micro gas turbine (MGT) hybrid systems with prereforming of natural gas, in which a quasi two-dimensional model has been built up to simulate the cell electrochemical reaction, heat and mass transfer within tubular SOFC.",Conceptual Design and Performance Analysis of SOFC/Micro Gas Turbine Hybrid Distributed Energy System,10.1115/1.4029395
2,17551,The developed model can be used not only to predict the overall performance of the SOFC/MGT hybrid system but also to reveal the nonuniform temperature distribution within SOFC unit.,Conceptual Design and Performance Analysis of SOFC/Micro Gas Turbine Hybrid Distributed Energy System,10.1115/1.4029395
3,17551,The effects of turbine inlet temperature (TIT) and pressure ratio (PR) on the performance of the hybrid system have been investigated.,Conceptual Design and Performance Analysis of SOFC/Micro Gas Turbine Hybrid Distributed Energy System,10.1115/1.4029395
4,17551,"The results show that selecting smaller TIT or PR value will lead to relative higher system efficiency and lower CO2 emission ratio; however, this will raise the risk to destroy SOFC beyond the limitation temperature of electrolyte.",Conceptual Design and Performance Analysis of SOFC/Micro Gas Turbine Hybrid Distributed Energy System,10.1115/1.4029395
