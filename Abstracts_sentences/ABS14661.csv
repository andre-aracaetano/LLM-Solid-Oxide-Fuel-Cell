4,14661,"Tests of single anode-supported planar SOFCs were carried Out in the presence of H2S Under Current load at 850 C. The cell voltage dropped as we periodically added 2-100 ppm H2S to an H-2-containing fuel in 24 h intervals, but it regenerated to the initial value after we turned off the H2S. Evaluation of the changes of the cell voltage Suggests that saturation coverage was reached at approximately 40 ppm H,S.",The effect of H2S on the performance of Ni-YSZ anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.001
5,14661,A front-like movement of S-poisoning over the anode was seen by monitoring the in-plane voltage in the anode.,The effect of H2S on the performance of Ni-YSZ anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.001
6,14661,"Furthermore, impedance spectra showed that mainly the polarization resistance increased when adding H2S. These changes in resistance were found to happen at 1212 Hz, which is related to reactions at the anode-electrolyte interface.",The effect of H2S on the performance of Ni-YSZ anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.001
