2,13989,"To obtain such characteristics, we fixed sputtered platinum electrodes on yttria stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte by covering the electrode with a porous ceramic layer.",ELECTRODE-REACTION AT FIXED PLATINUM FILM - FIXATION OF PLATINUM FILM ON STABILIZED-ZIRCONIA ELECTROLYTE AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ELECTRODE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOLID-ELECTROLYTE FUEL-CELL,10.1252/jcej.25.55
3,13989,"As a result of the fixation, the Pt film was kept stable and the resistance of the electrodes was very small.",ELECTRODE-REACTION AT FIXED PLATINUM FILM - FIXATION OF PLATINUM FILM ON STABILIZED-ZIRCONIA ELECTROLYTE AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ELECTRODE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOLID-ELECTROLYTE FUEL-CELL,10.1252/jcej.25.55
4,13989,Electrode impedance and potential-current curves were measured on the fixed electrodes.,ELECTRODE-REACTION AT FIXED PLATINUM FILM - FIXATION OF PLATINUM FILM ON STABILIZED-ZIRCONIA ELECTROLYTE AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ELECTRODE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOLID-ELECTROLYTE FUEL-CELL,10.1252/jcej.25.55
5,13989,"The effect of the oxygen partial pressure, P(O2), on the electrode resistance, R(i), which was obtained from the impedance plots, was represented as R(i) is-proportional-to P(O2)-1 at high temperature and low oxygen partial pressure, and as R(i) is-proportional-to P(O2)1/4 at low temperature and high oxygen partial pressure.",ELECTRODE-REACTION AT FIXED PLATINUM FILM - FIXATION OF PLATINUM FILM ON STABILIZED-ZIRCONIA ELECTROLYTE AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ELECTRODE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOLID-ELECTROLYTE FUEL-CELL,10.1252/jcej.25.55
