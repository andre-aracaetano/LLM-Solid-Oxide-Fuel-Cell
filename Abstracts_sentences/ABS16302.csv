5,16302,"In the fuel cell mode, a high power output of 1.28W cm(-2) and a low polarization resistance of 0.166 Omega cm(2) have been achieved at 800 degrees C with H-2 as fuel and ambient air as oxidant using nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the hydrogen electrode, YSZ as the electrolyte, and (La0.75Sr0.25)(0.95)MnO3-YSZ as the oxygen electrode.",Novel functionally graded acicular electrode for solid oxide cells fabricated by the freeze-tape-casting process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.109
6,16302,"In the electrolysis mode, a high current density of 2.3 A cm(-2) with 30 vol% absolute humidity in the hydrogen electrode at 800 degrees C has been achieved with an applied cell voltage of 1.6 V. It has been revealed that the novel acicular hydrogen electrode decreases the gas diffusion resistance, thus enhancing the cell performance.",Novel functionally graded acicular electrode for solid oxide cells fabricated by the freeze-tape-casting process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.109
