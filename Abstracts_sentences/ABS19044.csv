3,19044,The best repeating unit (RU) showed an area specific resistance of 0.4 cm2 and an initial voltage of 1.125V at 705 degrees C and -0.6Acm-2 when fed with 90% H2O/10% H2 at the hydrogen-electrode.,Durability Testing of a High-Temperature Steam Electrolyzer Stack at 700°C,10.1002/fuce.201300150
4,19044,"One instability factor has been observed, which led to dramatic voltage fluctuations for most RUs in the stack.",Durability Testing of a High-Temperature Steam Electrolyzer Stack at 700°C,10.1002/fuce.201300150
5,19044,"Such kind of voltage fluctuation is correlated predominantly to the variation of ohmic resistances of RUs, pointing out most probably unstable electrical contact in the stack under the present testing conditions.",Durability Testing of a High-Temperature Steam Electrolyzer Stack at 700°C,10.1002/fuce.201300150
6,19044,"Disregarding the worst RU (RU1), the average degradation rate (voltage increase rate) of all RUs in the stack has been determined to be around 2% kh-1 (24mV kh-1) for the last 500h of static operation free of voltage fluctuations.",Durability Testing of a High-Temperature Steam Electrolyzer Stack at 700°C,10.1002/fuce.201300150
7,19044,"The stack showed no noticeable degradation during the short-term transient operation (totally 756 ON/OFF current cycles), indicating preliminarily that it could be possible to couple intermittent power sources with high-temperature steam electrolyzers.",Durability Testing of a High-Temperature Steam Electrolyzer Stack at 700°C,10.1002/fuce.201300150
