1,1185,"Mixed reactant fuel cells (MR-FCs), are aimed at using a uniform mixture of fuel and oxygen applied to both the anode and the cathode.",Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
2,1185,"This allows redesign of fuel cells with a significantly simpler construction, having potentially a higher power density, better fuel utilization and be less expensive.",Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
3,1185,"The challenge in realizing MR-FCs is finding selective electrodes that can enhance oxygen reduction at the cathode, fuel oxidation at the anode while inhibiting the chemical reaction between the fuel and oxygen in the gas mixture.",Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
4,1185,"This task is in particular challenging in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), as they operate at elevated temperatures, where many reactions are easily activated and selectivity is difficult to achieve.",Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
5,1185,As a result no true MR-FC of the SOFC type were reported while some were found for low temperature fuel cells (FCs).,Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
6,1185,"The so-called single-chamber-SOFC are not true MR-FCs as they do not contain two selective electrodes, as required.",Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
7,1185,We shall discuss potential ways to search for and develop selective anodes and cathodes for SOFC type MR-FCs.,Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
8,1185,We first consider material properties which should contribute to that goal.,Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
9,1185,"This refers to electronic properties of the bulk, band banding under adsorbed specie, point defects in the bulk and on the surface.",Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
10,1185,"We then proceed to show how cell design, in particular electrode structure, can contribute to selectivity.",Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
11,1185,Finally operation conditions are considered and it is shown that they also can contribute to selectivity.,Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
12,1185,"The operation condition considered are gas mixture composition, gas mixture residence time in the hot zone, hence gas flow rate, current density and temperature.",Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
13,1185,The topics discussed hold for all FC types but are crucial for the SOFC type because of the difficulty to achieve selectivity at elevated temperatures.,Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
14,1185,It is suggested that a concerted effort taking advantage of all those options should allow development of a true SOFC type MR-FC.,Selectivity and mixed reactant fuel cells,10.1142/S179360471540010X
