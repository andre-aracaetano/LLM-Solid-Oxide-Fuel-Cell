1,8748,"Composites containing La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xRuxO3-delta (LSCrRu) with x-0-0.25 and Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) were studied as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta, (LSGM) electrolytes.",La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xRuxO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 solid oxide fuel cell anodes: Ru precipitation and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.022
2,8748,Electrode polarization resistance R-p decreased during initial SOFC operation before reaching a minimum.,La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xRuxO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 solid oxide fuel cell anodes: Ru precipitation and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.022
3,8748,"The decrease was more rapid, and the ultimate R-p value reached was generally lower, with increasing temperature and Ru content x. R-p was stable at longer times except for x=0.25 where it increased slightly.",La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xRuxO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 solid oxide fuel cell anodes: Ru precipitation and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.022
4,8748,"SOFCs with x=0.18 anodes at 800 degrees C yielded power densities as high as 0.53 W/cm(2) with an R-p value, including the (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O-3-GDC cathode, of <0.15 Omega cm(2).",La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xRuxO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 solid oxide fuel cell anodes: Ru precipitation and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.022
5,8748,Transmission electron microscopy revealed Ru nano-particles on LSCrRu surfaces: their size increased and their density decreased with increasing temperature.,La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xRuxO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 solid oxide fuel cell anodes: Ru precipitation and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.022
6,8748,Increasing the Ru content increased the density of Ru surface particles at a given time and temperature.,La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xRuxO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 solid oxide fuel cell anodes: Ru precipitation and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.022
7,8748,"Measured early-stage Ru surface coverage values were consistent with a model where Ru supply to the LSCrRu surface was limited by Ru bulk out-diffusion, but the coverage saturated at longer times.",La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xRuxO3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 solid oxide fuel cell anodes: Ru precipitation and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.022
