1,20984,"LSGM (La1-xSrxGa1-yMg gamma O3-delta) powders of four different compositions (x, y=0.1 or 0.2) (a symbolic system such as LSGM9191 for x = 0.1 and y = 0.1 or LSGM9182 for x = 0.1 and y = 0.2 is used hereafter) were synthesized using the GNP (glycine nitrate process) as the electrolyte material of the intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC).",Preparation and characterization of strontium and magnesium doped lanthanum gallates as the electrolyte for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.099
2,20984,"They were then calcined at 1000 degrees C for 2 h, compacted into a disc or a rod, and sintered at 1400 degrees C for 4 h in preparation for structural, electrical and thermomechanical characterizations.",Preparation and characterization of strontium and magnesium doped lanthanum gallates as the electrolyte for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.099
3,20984,"The reactivity of the LSGM with the cathode material of LSM (La0.85Sr0.15MnO3) or with the anode material of Ni-YSZ was analyzed by sintering an LSGM/LSM, LSGM/NiO or LSGM/YSZ powder mixture at 1400 degrees C for 4 h and then searching for possible reaction products in its XRD pattern.",Preparation and characterization of strontium and magnesium doped lanthanum gallates as the electrolyte for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.099

5,20984,"On the other hand, the sinter of LSGM8291 contained the second phases of LaSrGa3O7 and LaSrGaO4 as well in addition to the main LSGM phase.",Preparation and characterization of strontium and magnesium doped lanthanum gallates as the electrolyte for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.099
6,20984,The electrical conductivity of LSGM8282 (0.105 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C) turned out to be the highest among those of the four LSGMs and more than twice as high as that of YSZ (similar to 0.045 S cm(-1)).,Preparation and characterization of strontium and magnesium doped lanthanum gallates as the electrolyte for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.099
7,20984,The linear thermal expansion coefficient was measured to be 12.1 x 10(-6) K-1 for LSGM8282 which was very close to that of LSM (11.7 x 10(-6) K-1).,Preparation and characterization of strontium and magnesium doped lanthanum gallates as the electrolyte for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.099
