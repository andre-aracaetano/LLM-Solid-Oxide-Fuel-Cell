1,6649,A single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack with a linear array arrangement has been particularly investigated in methane-oxygen-argon mixture.,Performance of a linear array solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack operated in single-chamber conditions,10.1007/s11581-020-03780-6
2,6649,The stack with four cells connected in series exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 3.7 V and a maximum power output of 353 mW (total active area: 2 cm(2)) at 700 degrees C.,Performance of a linear array solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack operated in single-chamber conditions,10.1007/s11581-020-03780-6
3,6649,The performance of the cells was gradually reduced along with the gas flow direction at Ar flow rate of 140 sccm and the performance difference between the cells was decreased with the increasing gas flow rate.,Performance of a linear array solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack operated in single-chamber conditions,10.1007/s11581-020-03780-6
4,6649,Results showed that a CH4/O(2)ratio of 1 was the most favorable ratio for the downstream cells.,Performance of a linear array solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack operated in single-chamber conditions,10.1007/s11581-020-03780-6
5,6649,"The power output of the linear stack at Ar flow rate of 140 sccm was 50% higher than that of the previous stack with equal inlet gas for each single cell, which proved an advantage for the linear array arrangement at low gas flow rate not only for fuel economy but also for a better stack performance.",Performance of a linear array solid oxide fuel cell micro-stack operated in single-chamber conditions,10.1007/s11581-020-03780-6
