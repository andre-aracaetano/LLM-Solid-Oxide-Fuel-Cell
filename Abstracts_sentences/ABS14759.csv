3,14759,Both short- and long-term effects of moisture have previously been associated with use of ambient air.,"The effect of water vapor on surface oxygen exchange kinetics of thin film (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227478
4,14759,"To better understand these effects, we study oxygen exchange kinetics at the cathode surface and the cathode/electrolyte interface using La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2-Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) epitaxial thin films as a model-surface system.","The effect of water vapor on surface oxygen exchange kinetics of thin film (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227478
5,14759,In situ synchrotron X-ray techniques evaluate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics in response to environmental variables.,"The effect of water vapor on surface oxygen exchange kinetics of thin film (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227478
6,14759,The results suggest a clear enhancement of the ORR rate upon short term exposure of the perovskite-structured films to water.,"The effect of water vapor on surface oxygen exchange kinetics of thin film (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227478
7,14759,"On the basis of these measurements, along with in situ X-ray characterization of Sr segregation and computational first-principles studies, we suggest a model for this increased ORR activity that may lead to further improvements by stabilizing active cathode surface configurations.","The effect of water vapor on surface oxygen exchange kinetics of thin film (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227478
