1,17600,The mechanism for siliceous liquid-phase movement during sintering and thermal etching is investigated using single crystal alumina rods in a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) matrix.,Glass-Phase Movement in Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia/Alumina Composites,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03612.x
2,17600,"Bulk glass-phase extraction and intergranular movement during sintering is attributed to a chemically driven force; however, glass-phase expulsion is predominately due to thermal expansion differences in the glass phase, alumina fiber, and YSZ matrix.",Glass-Phase Movement in Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia/Alumina Composites,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03612.x
3,17600,"An increased understanding of the glass-phase mechanism will facilitate the reduction of the resistive grain-boundary phase, which consequently will decrease the operating temperature of high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.",Glass-Phase Movement in Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia/Alumina Composites,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03612.x
4,17600,"In this paper, we demonstrated that scavengers such as alumina in combination with a suitable thermal treatment can be used to purify the grain boundaries from unwanted impurities, such as Si, through the expulsion of the unwanted liquid impurity phase.",Glass-Phase Movement in Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia/Alumina Composites,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03612.x
5,17600,The driving forces behind the expulsion are mechanically and chemically driven capillary flow.,Glass-Phase Movement in Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia/Alumina Composites,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03612.x
