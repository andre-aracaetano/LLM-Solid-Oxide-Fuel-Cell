1,1323,"In intermediate temperature planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks, the interconnect, which is typically made from cost-effective, oxidation-resistant, high-temperature alloys, is typically sealed to the ceramic positive electrode-electrolyte-negative electrode (PEN) by a sealing glass.",Chemical stability of glass seal interfaces in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/10599490419298
2,1323,"To maintain the structural stability and minimize the degradation of stack performance, the sealing glass has to be chemically compatible with the PEN and alloy interconnects.",Chemical stability of glass seal interfaces in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/10599490419298
3,1323,"In the present study, the chemical compatibility of a barium-calcium-aluminosilicate (BCAS) based glass-ceramic (specifically developed as a sealant in SOFC stacks) with a number of selected oxidation resistant high temperature alloys (and the yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte) was evaluated.",Chemical stability of glass seal interfaces in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/10599490419298
4,1323,"This paper reports the results of that study, with a particular focus on Crofer22 APU, a new ferritic stainless steel that was developed specifically for SOFC interconnect applications.",Chemical stability of glass seal interfaces in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/10599490419298
