3,5904,"Herein, Sm, Bi co-doping CeO2/BaCeO3 electrolytes (80 wt% Ce0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O2-delta - 20 wt% Ce0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O2-delta, BiSDC-BCSBi) with ultra-fine grained (110-220 nm) and micron (1-1.8 mu m) structures were prepared.",Grain boundary conduction behaviors of ultra-fine grained CeO2/BaCeO3 based electrolytes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.204
4,5904,"In the ultra-fine grained structure, specific grain-boundary conductivities measured at 350 degrees C and 400 degrees C are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than micron structures, thus resulting in dramatically enhanced electrical performances, which can be attributed to two aspects.",Grain boundary conduction behaviors of ultra-fine grained CeO2/BaCeO3 based electrolytes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.204
