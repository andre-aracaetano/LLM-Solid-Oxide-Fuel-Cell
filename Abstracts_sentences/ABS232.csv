1,232,Ceramic high-temperature fuel cells (or solid oxide fuel cells) are nowadays operated at around 800 degrees C to directly convert hydrogen as well as hydrocarbons into electrical energy.,"Thin film coating technologies of (Ce,Gd)O2-δ interlayers for application in ceramic high-temperature fuel cells",10.1016/j.tsf.2006.10.127
2,232,Their outstanding advantage is the high efficiency of this conversion process compared to conventional power generation.,"Thin film coating technologies of (Ce,Gd)O2-δ interlayers for application in ceramic high-temperature fuel cells",10.1016/j.tsf.2006.10.127
3,232,"Recently developed functional layers to be used as electrodes show excellent performance, however they suffer from interfacial reactions with adjacent layers.","Thin film coating technologies of (Ce,Gd)O2-δ interlayers for application in ceramic high-temperature fuel cells",10.1016/j.tsf.2006.10.127
4,232,These reactions lead to a rapid degradation of the fuel cells which limits their potential for application and therefore must be prevented by protective coatings.,"Thin film coating technologies of (Ce,Gd)O2-δ interlayers for application in ceramic high-temperature fuel cells",10.1016/j.tsf.2006.10.127
5,232,"This paper discusses the performance of solid oxide fuel cells including ceramic (Ce,Gd)O2-delta (CGO) diffusion barrier coatings, which inhibit undesired interfacial reactions between cathode and electrolyte materials.","Thin film coating technologies of (Ce,Gd)O2-δ interlayers for application in ceramic high-temperature fuel cells",10.1016/j.tsf.2006.10.127
6,232,"The coatings were applied by different conventional processes like screen printing as well as physical vapor deposition (sputtering, electron beam evaporation).","Thin film coating technologies of (Ce,Gd)O2-δ interlayers for application in ceramic high-temperature fuel cells",10.1016/j.tsf.2006.10.127
7,232,"With physical-vapor-deposited CGO thin films the strontium diffusion from the cathode to the electrolyte and the detrimental reaction between the CGO layer and the electrolyte could be avoided, resulting in a significant improvement of the power density of solid oxide fuel cells.","Thin film coating technologies of (Ce,Gd)O2-δ interlayers for application in ceramic high-temperature fuel cells",10.1016/j.tsf.2006.10.127
