3,16754,"Based on the results obtained from a series of high-resolution structural analysis techniques, such as XRD, SAED, and HR-TEM, these double perovskite oxides possess tetragonal lattice symmetry and a stable crystal structure.","Structural and oxygen-transport studies of double perovskites PrBa1-xCo2O5+δ (x=0.00, 0.05, and 0.10) toward their application as superior oxygen reduction electrodes",10.1039/c4ta04372c
4,16754,"According to the information obtained from iodometric titration, TGA, and O-2-TPD measurements, an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration in the lattice with an increasing Ba cation deficiency (x value) is demonstrated.","Structural and oxygen-transport studies of double perovskites PrBa1-xCo2O5+δ (x=0.00, 0.05, and 0.10) toward their application as superior oxygen reduction electrodes",10.1039/c4ta04372c
5,16754,"Additionally, oxygen permeation flux and electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) measurements illustrate an improved oxygen ionic conductivity, chemical bulk diffusion coefficient (D-chem) and chemical surface exchange coefficient (K-chem) with the introduction of Ba deficiency, likely due to the increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies.","Structural and oxygen-transport studies of double perovskites PrBa1-xCo2O5+δ (x=0.00, 0.05, and 0.10) toward their application as superior oxygen reduction electrodes",10.1039/c4ta04372c
6,16754,"Tests at 700 degrees C of the electrochemical performance based on symmetrical cells show area specific resistances (ASRs) of 0.045, 0.041, and 0.036 Omega cm(2) for PrBa1-xCo2O5+delta with x = 0.00, 0.05, and 0.10, respectively.","Structural and oxygen-transport studies of double perovskites PrBa1-xCo2O5+δ (x=0.00, 0.05, and 0.10) toward their application as superior oxygen reduction electrodes",10.1039/c4ta04372c
