3,13792,"Sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of different operating parameters including H-2 recycling ratio (R-h), calcium to carbon ratio (R-ctc) and fuel utilization factor (U-f) on the energy efficiency (E-en), exergy efficiency (E-ex), total energy efficiency (E-ten), total exergy efficiency (E-tex) and carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration ratio (R-cs) of this system.",Energy and exergy analyses of a Zero emission coal system,10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.006
4,13792,The energy loss in the steam turbine (ST) is 35.2% which is the maximum among all the units and the maximum exergy loss of 37.0% occurs in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Energy and exergy analyses of a Zero emission coal system,10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.006
