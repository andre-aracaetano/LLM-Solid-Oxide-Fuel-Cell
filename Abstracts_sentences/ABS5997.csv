1,5997,A unique requirement of underwater vehicles' power/energy systems is that they remain neutrally buoyant over the course of a mission.,Estimating the neutrally buoyant energy density of a Rankine-cycle/fuel-cell underwater propulsion system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.09.113
2,5997,Previous work published in the journal of Power Sources reported gross as opposed to neutrally-buoyant energy densities of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell/Rankinecycle based power system based on the exothermic reaction of aluminum with seawater.,Estimating the neutrally buoyant energy density of a Rankine-cycle/fuel-cell underwater propulsion system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.09.113
3,5997,This paper corrects this shortcoming by presenting a model for estimating system mass and using it to update the key findings of the original paper in the context of the neutral buoyancy requirement.,Estimating the neutrally buoyant energy density of a Rankine-cycle/fuel-cell underwater propulsion system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.09.113
4,5997,It also presents an expanded sensitivity analysis to illustrate the influence of various design and modeling assumptions.,Estimating the neutrally buoyant energy density of a Rankine-cycle/fuel-cell underwater propulsion system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.09.113
5,5997,"While energy density is very sensitive to turbine efficiency (sensitivity coefficient in excess of 0.60), it is relatively insensitive to all other major design parameters (sensitivity coefficients < 0.15) like compressor efficiency, inlet water temperature, scaling methodology, etc.",Estimating the neutrally buoyant energy density of a Rankine-cycle/fuel-cell underwater propulsion system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.09.113
6,5997,"The neutral buoyancy requirement introduces a significant ( similar to 15%) energy density penalty but overall the system still appears to offer factors of five to eight improvements in energy density (i.e., vehicle range/endurance) over present batterybased technologies.",Estimating the neutrally buoyant energy density of a Rankine-cycle/fuel-cell underwater propulsion system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.09.113
