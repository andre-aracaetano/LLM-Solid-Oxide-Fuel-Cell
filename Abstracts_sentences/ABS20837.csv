10,20837,"A 15 mu m LTM coating should be sufficient to ensure a 40,000 h interconnect life at 800 degrees C. A comparison of LTM coating to Mn-Cr-spinel of earlier work shows that LTM coating is similar to 23 times more effective than spinel coating in suppressing oxidation kinetics.",Oxygen transport resistant and electrically conductive perovskite coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1149/1.2966179
