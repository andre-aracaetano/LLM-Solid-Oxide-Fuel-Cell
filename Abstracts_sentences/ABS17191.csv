3,17191,This reveals a wide distribution of activation energies with the favorable pathways corresponding to transport along the layers.,Internal Activation Strain and Oxygen Mobility in a Thermally Stable Layered Fe3+ Oxide,10.1021/cm4013359
4,17191,"In contrast, interlayer oxygen transport paths require higher activation barriers, whose limiting step corresponds to incorporation of oxide ion vacancies in the Ca2Fe2O5 sub-block of the structure with tetrahedrally coordinated Fe3+ ions, with a calculated activation barrier of 1.46 eV.",Internal Activation Strain and Oxygen Mobility in a Thermally Stable Layered Fe3+ Oxide,10.1021/cm4013359
5,17191,The latter is similar to the diffusion barrier of 1.41 eV evaluated by direct SIMS measurement on polycrystalline BCYF samples.,Internal Activation Strain and Oxygen Mobility in a Thermally Stable Layered Fe3+ Oxide,10.1021/cm4013359

7,17191,The random orientations of the grains in the polycrystal also result in highly anisotropic oxygen surface exchange properties.,Internal Activation Strain and Oxygen Mobility in a Thermally Stable Layered Fe3+ Oxide,10.1021/cm4013359
8,17191,"and the surface exchange coefficient, k*, shows a 4-fold difference from 1.2 x 10(-8) to 2.9 x 10(-9) cm s(-1) at 587 degrees C, depending on the grain-sized region selected.",Internal Activation Strain and Oxygen Mobility in a Thermally Stable Layered Fe3+ Oxide,10.1021/cm4013359
