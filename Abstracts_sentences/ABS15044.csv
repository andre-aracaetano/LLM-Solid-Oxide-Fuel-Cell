1,15044,A redox reversible composite anode with Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles in situ growth on SrLaFeO4-type and LaFeO3-type oxide substrates has been prepared for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (ITSOFC) by reducing perovskite precursor La0.4Sr0.6Fe0.75Ni0.1Nb0.15O3-delta (LSFNNb) in wet H-2 at 900 degrees C for 1 h. The anode has shown an excellent electrochemical catalytic activity for oxidation of hydrogen with much smaller E-a (25.1 similar to 68.9 kJ mol(-1)) than the value (> 160 kJ mol(-1)) at Ni-YSZ anode.,A novel high performance composite anode with in situ growth of Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles for intermediate solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.03.103
2,15044,"A scandium stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) electrolyte supported SOFC with the anode achieves maximum power densities of 0.71, 0.52, 0.35, and 0.21 W cm(-2) at 800, 750, 700 and 650 degrees C, respectively in wet H2 (3% H2O), and the corresponding R-p of 0.16, 0.21, 0.35, and 0.60 V cm(2) under OCV.",A novel high performance composite anode with in situ growth of Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles for intermediate solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.03.103
3,15044,"Moreover, the single cell shows stable power output during similar to 105 h operation at 800 degrees C under 0.7 V in wet H-2 after a initial degradation, indicating that R-LSFNNb is an excellent candidate as anode of IT-SOFC.",A novel high performance composite anode with in situ growth of Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles for intermediate solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.03.103
