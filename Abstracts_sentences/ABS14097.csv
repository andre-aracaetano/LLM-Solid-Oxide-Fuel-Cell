3,14097,"This work presents the development of an improved tank in series reactor model of the SOFC operating in cocurrent, countercurrent, and cross-current flow directions.",Improved Tank in Series Model for the Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ie101129k
4,14097,"The model, which accounts for the charge balances in the electrodes and electrolyte in addition to the component balances and the energy balances, is used for simulating the potentiostatic operation of the cell.",Improved Tank in Series Model for the Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ie101129k

6,14097,"Among different flow directions, the coflow case is the most favorable for the planar SOFC, with improved performance.",Improved Tank in Series Model for the Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ie101129k
7,14097,"In response to a voltage step increase, the coflow case provides the most uniform transient behavior at different points of the cell.",Improved Tank in Series Model for the Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ie101129k
8,14097,"Despite the coflow direction, in which temperature dominates the slow dynamics of the local current density, in the low temperature regions of the counterflow and cross-flow cases, the slow dynamics of the current density tends to be characterized by the initial undershoot followed by a slower transient response that is due to the combined effects of the diffusion resistance within the porous electrode, hydrogen accumulation toward the fuel outlets, and the influence of the PEN temperature.",Improved Tank in Series Model for the Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ie101129k
