1,14549,"Ni-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) cermets are known to be very good anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which are typically operated at 700-1000 degrees C.",Activation of H2 oxidation at sulphur-exposed Ni surfaces under low temperature SOFC conditions,10.1039/c3cp53377h
2,14549,"However, they are expected to be increasingly degraded as the operating temperature is lowered in the presence of H2S (5-10 ppm) in the H-2 fuel stream.",Activation of H2 oxidation at sulphur-exposed Ni surfaces under low temperature SOFC conditions,10.1039/c3cp53377h
3,14549,"However, at 500 to 600 degrees C, a temperature range rarely examined for sulphur poisoning, but of great interest for next generation SOFCs, we report that H2S-exposed Ni-YSZ anodes are catalytic towards the H-2 oxidation reaction, rather than poisoned.",Activation of H2 oxidation at sulphur-exposed Ni surfaces under low temperature SOFC conditions,10.1039/c3cp53377h
4,14549,"By analogy with bulk Ni3S2/YSZ anodes, shown previously to enhance H-2 oxidation kinetics, it is proposed that a thin layer of Ni sulphide, akin to Ni3S2, is forming, at least at the triple point boundary (TPB) region under our conditions.",Activation of H2 oxidation at sulphur-exposed Ni surfaces under low temperature SOFC conditions,10.1039/c3cp53377h
5,14549,"To explain why Ni3S2/YSZ is so active, it is shown from density functional theory (DFT) calculations that the O-2-anions at the Ni3S2/YSZ TPB are more reactive towards hydrogen oxidation than is O-2-at the Ni/YSZ TPB.",Activation of H2 oxidation at sulphur-exposed Ni surfaces under low temperature SOFC conditions,10.1039/c3cp53377h
6,14549,"This is accounted for primarily by structural transformations of Ni3S2 during H-2 oxidation, rather than by the electronic properties of this interface.",Activation of H2 oxidation at sulphur-exposed Ni surfaces under low temperature SOFC conditions,10.1039/c3cp53377h
7,14549,"To understand why a thin layer of Ni3S2 could form when a single monolayer of sulphur on the Ni surface is the predicted surface phase under our conditions, it is possible that the reaction of H-2 with O2-, forming water, prevents sulphur from re-equilibrating to H2S. This may then promote Ni sulphide formation, at least in the TPB region.",Activation of H2 oxidation at sulphur-exposed Ni surfaces under low temperature SOFC conditions,10.1039/c3cp53377h
