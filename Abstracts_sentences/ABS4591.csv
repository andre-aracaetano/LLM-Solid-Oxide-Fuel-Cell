2,4591,"It is constructed by combining 70 power generation units, each of which is composed of an anode-supported planar cell and separators.",Development of a high power density 2.5 kW class solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.05.044
3,4591,The power generation unit for the 2.5 kW class stack were designed so that the height of the unit were scaled clown by 2/3 of that for our conventional 1.5 kW class stack.,Development of a high power density 2.5 kW class solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.05.044
4,4591,"The power generation unit for the 2.5 kW class stack provided the same output as the unit used for the conventional 1.5 kW class stack, which means that power density per unit volume of the 2.5 kW class stack was 50% greater than that of the conventional 1.5 kW class stack.",Development of a high power density 2.5 kW class solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.05.044
