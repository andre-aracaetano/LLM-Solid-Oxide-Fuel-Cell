1,16414,"From the view point of the electrode for SOFC, we studied the reactivity at the interface between La(1-x)A(x)MnO(3-z)(A=Ca and Sr) and YSZ (8 mol% Y2O3 doped zirconia) or La(0.8)A(0.2)CrO(3).","STABILITY OF LA(1-X)A(X)MNO(3-Z) (A=CA, SR) AS CATHODE MATERIALS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS",10.1016/0167-2738(94)90156-2
2,16414,The atomic diffusion and reaction at the boundaries were observed by SEM with EDX.,"STABILITY OF LA(1-X)A(X)MNO(3-Z) (A=CA, SR) AS CATHODE MATERIALS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS",10.1016/0167-2738(94)90156-2
3,16414,"The long term annealing of Ca substituted perovskite system at 1200 degrees C brought the formation of Ca-rich phase at the boundary, while no extra phase was found in the case of Sr substituted system.","STABILITY OF LA(1-X)A(X)MNO(3-Z) (A=CA, SR) AS CATHODE MATERIALS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS",10.1016/0167-2738(94)90156-2
