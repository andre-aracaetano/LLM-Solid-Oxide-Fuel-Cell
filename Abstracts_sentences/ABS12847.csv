1,12847,Stainless steel type 441 (UNS S44100) is being considered for application as a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) interconnect material.,The impact of alloy chemistry on the formation of a silicon-rich subscale on two classes of ferritic steels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.107
2,12847,"It had been thought that Laves phase that forms in this alloy preferentially consumes the Si present in the alloy microstructure, thereby avoiding formation of a Si-rich layer at the scale/metal interface.",The impact of alloy chemistry on the formation of a silicon-rich subscale on two classes of ferritic steels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.107
3,12847,Recent work has shown this is not the case and a Si-rich layer does indeed form at the scale/metal interface.,The impact of alloy chemistry on the formation of a silicon-rich subscale on two classes of ferritic steels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.107
4,12847,"However, this layer is significantly different from the layer that forms in other ferritic stainless steels, for example, type 430.",The impact of alloy chemistry on the formation of a silicon-rich subscale on two classes of ferritic steels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.107
5,12847,In this present work the Si-rich layer that forms on 441ss is examined and compared to the layer that forms on several 430-type alloys with varying low levels of Si.,The impact of alloy chemistry on the formation of a silicon-rich subscale on two classes of ferritic steels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.107
6,12847,"This research has shown that even at very low levels of Si (170 ppm), a Si-rich layer begins to form on the 430-type stainless steels.",The impact of alloy chemistry on the formation of a silicon-rich subscale on two classes of ferritic steels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.107
7,12847,"However, the morphology, particularly with respect to the thickness and continuity of the Si-rich subscale that forms in alloy 441ss, is modified in comparison to non-Laves forming ferritic stainless steels and therefore, may not be as detrimental to long term SOFC performance.",The impact of alloy chemistry on the formation of a silicon-rich subscale on two classes of ferritic steels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.107
