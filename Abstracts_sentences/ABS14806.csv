1,14806,"A new class of mesoporous (nickel/platinum)-yttria-zirconia materials, denoted meso-(Ni/Pt)YZ, which may have utility as electrode material in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), have been synthesized by aqueous co-assembly of glycometalates and metal complexes with a surfactant template.",Self-assembling solid oxide fuel cell materials: Mesoporous yttria-zirconia and metal-yttria-zirconia solid solutions,10.1021/ja0013677
2,14806,These materials form as solid solutions with compositions that can be tuned over the range 12-56 atom % yttrium and 10-30 atom % nickel or 1-10 wt % platinum.,Self-assembling solid oxide fuel cell materials: Mesoporous yttria-zirconia and metal-yttria-zirconia solid solutions,10.1021/ja0013677
3,14806,The microstructure of the channel wall is nanocrystalline yttria-zirconia (YZ) and nickel/platinum is incorporated as metal oxide/metal clusters with diameters comparable to the size of the pores depending on the degree of loading of the metal precursor.,Self-assembling solid oxide fuel cell materials: Mesoporous yttria-zirconia and metal-yttria-zirconia solid solutions,10.1021/ja0013677
4,14806,Calcination in air of as-synthesized meso-(Ni/Pt)YZ materials causes the channel walls to crystallize and thicken as the imbibed organics are lost.,Self-assembling solid oxide fuel cell materials: Mesoporous yttria-zirconia and metal-yttria-zirconia solid solutions,10.1021/ja0013677
5,14806,"It is the relatively thick, YZ nanocrystalline walls which are believed to be responsible for the impressive 800 degrees C thermal stability of meso-(Ni/Pt)YZ.",Self-assembling solid oxide fuel cell materials: Mesoporous yttria-zirconia and metal-yttria-zirconia solid solutions,10.1021/ja0013677
