1,17811,Doped-BaGdInO4 is a promising material for many applications including solid oxide fuel cells due to its high oxide-ion conductivity.,Oxygen migration in doped BaGdInO4,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115729
2,17811,Here we employ atomistic simulations to show that the activation energy for oxygen migration in Ca-doped BaGdInO4 is lower as compared to undoped BaGdInO4 and importantly divalent doping will form oxygen vacancies.,Oxygen migration in doped BaGdInO4,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115729
3,17811,The results are consistent with recent experimental work that determined an increase in the diffusivity of Ca-doped BaGdInO4 as compared to the undoped case.,Oxygen migration in doped BaGdInO4,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115729
4,17811,"Additionally, the most thermodynamically feasible defect in this material is the Gd-In anti-site.",Oxygen migration in doped BaGdInO4,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115729
5,17811,"Promising isovalent dopants on the Ba, Gd and In were found to be the Sr, Al and Sc respectively.",Oxygen migration in doped BaGdInO4,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115729
6,17811,The most favourable dopant on the Gd site to produce oxygen vacancies is Ca and its solution energy is lower only by 0.02 eV than that calculated for Sr. Ba2+ ion conduction in this material is slow with the migration energy barrier being higher than 2 eV.,Oxygen migration in doped BaGdInO4,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115729
