2,7488,"In H-2, all the BFMox samples exhibit sufficient electrical conductivities (sigma > 2 S cm(-1)) at 600-800 degrees C.",Effects of high-valence Mo content on microstructure and properties of Ba2Fe2-xMoxO6-δ anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.173271
3,7488,"However, the BFMo0.7 and BFMo0.5 compositions exhibit relatively better redox stability than the others.",Effects of high-valence Mo content on microstructure and properties of Ba2Fe2-xMoxO6-δ anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.173271
4,7488,"Furthermore, using 250-mu m-thick La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta as electrolyte and Ba0.6Sr0.4Co0.9Nb0.1O3-delta as cathode(,) the BFMo0.7 and BFMo0.5 anode cells also show higher electrochemical performances with peak power density attaining 905 and 908 mW cm(-2), respectively, at 800 degrees C. Additi degrees nally, the BFMo0.7 and BFMo0.5 anodes show good electrochemical stability for long-term H-2 oxidation.",Effects of high-valence Mo content on microstructure and properties of Ba2Fe2-xMoxO6-δ anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.173271
5,7488,"However, the BFMo0.7 anode exhibits an especially high thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) similar to 61.9 x 10(-6) K-1 at 25-886 degrees C in air, nearly three times larger than that of the BFMo0.5 anode under the same condition (TEC=similar to 14.8 x10(-6) K-1).",Effects of high-valence Mo content on microstructure and properties of Ba2Fe2-xMoxO6-δ anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.173271
