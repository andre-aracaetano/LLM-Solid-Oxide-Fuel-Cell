2,1116,"In this paper, we describe fuel cells utilizing 8 mu m thick yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes to provide low ohmic loss.",Increased solid-oxide fuel cell power density using interfacial ceria layers,10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00113-6
3,1116,Adding thin porous yttria doped ceria (YDC) layers on either side of the YSZ yielded much-reduced interfacial resistances at both the LSM Cathodes and Ni-YSZ anodes.,Increased solid-oxide fuel cell power density using interfacial ceria layers,10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00113-6
4,1116,"The cells provide higher power densities than previously reported below 700 degrees C, e.g. 300 and 480 mW cm(-2) at 600 and 650 degrees C, respectively (measured in 97%H-2 + 3%H2O and air), and also provide high power densities at higher temperatures, e.g. 760 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C.",Increased solid-oxide fuel cell power density using interfacial ceria layers,10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00113-6
