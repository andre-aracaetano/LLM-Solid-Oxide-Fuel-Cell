1,10080,"In this study, low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with an similar to 560 mu m thick Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) electrolyte and similar to 890 mu m thick LiNi0.81Co0.15Al0.04O2-delta (NCAL) electrodes are constructed and characterized under three experimental conditions.",Effects of thermal history on the performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte and LiNi0.81Co0.15Al0.04O2 electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232560
2,10080,The cell with an NCAL cathode pre-reduced under an H2 atmosphere at 550 degrees C presents the best electrochemical performance.,Effects of thermal history on the performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte and LiNi0.81Co0.15Al0.04O2 electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232560
3,10080,"This is ascribed to facts that the reduction reaction generating Ni-Co alloy particles on the NCAL surface and partial reoxidation of Ni-Co to Ni(Co)O under an air atmosphere during subsequent experiments increase the triple-phase-boundary area, improve the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, and cause a low polarization resistance (0.186 Omega cm(2)).",Effects of thermal history on the performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte and LiNi0.81Co0.15Al0.04O2 electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232560
4,10080,"Also, the reduction of the Ni foam-NCAL anode triggers the formation of H+/O2- bi-ionic SDC-Li2CO3-LiOH composite electrolytes.",Effects of thermal history on the performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte and LiNi0.81Co0.15Al0.04O2 electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232560
5,10080,The LiOH-Li2CO3 melt permeates and densifies the electrolyte layer; this significantly increases the electrical conductivity of the electrolyte layer to 0.291 S cm(-1) and lowers the ohmic resistance of the cell (0.170 Omega cm(2)).,Effects of thermal history on the performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte and LiNi0.81Co0.15Al0.04O2 electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232560
6,10080,The Li2CO3-LiOH phases serve as electron-blocking layers to limit the electronic conductivity of the electrolyte layer.,Effects of thermal history on the performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte and LiNi0.81Co0.15Al0.04O2 electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232560
7,10080,This induces a high open-circuit voltage of 1.024 V and a high maximum power density of 611.3 mW center dot cm-2.,Effects of thermal history on the performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte and LiNi0.81Co0.15Al0.04O2 electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232560
