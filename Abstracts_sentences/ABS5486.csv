2,5486,"During processing, the two opposite sides of each cone-shaped anode tube are in different conditions-one side is in contact with coagulant (the corresponding surface is named as W-surface), while the other is isolated from coagulate (I-surface).",Effect of anode structure on performance of cone-shaped solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by phase inversion,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.126
3,5486,Single SOFCs are made with YSZ electrolyte membrane coated on either W-surface or I-surface.,Effect of anode structure on performance of cone-shaped solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by phase inversion,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.126
4,5486,"Compared to the cell with YSZ membrane on W-surface, the cell on I-surface exhibits better performance, giving a maximum power density of 350 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, using wet hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.",Effect of anode structure on performance of cone-shaped solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by phase inversion,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.126
