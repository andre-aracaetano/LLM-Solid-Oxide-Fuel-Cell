1,14276,"Featured Application This work proposes a home-scale charging station for electric vehicles (EVs), which makes use of the existing grid of natural gas.",Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
2,14276,The station is based on a CH4-fed solid oxide fuel cell for energy conversion.,Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
3,14276,The feasibility of the wide use of such a system has been also proved in economic terms.,Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
4,14276,"We study here the urban use of electric vehicles (EVs), focusing on the electricity production for charging purposes.",Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
5,14276,"This work proposes an innovative charging scheme for EVs, by introducing a home-applied power station, consisting of a fuel cell combined with an internal reforming unit, which is fed by natural gas and can thus be directly connected to the already-established natural gas grid.",Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
6,14276,"We therefore overcome the barriers posed by hydrogen use (establishment of storage equipment, energy consumption for keeping high pressure, development of supply grid, etc.)",Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
7,14276,"while we eliminate the environmental impact, since no fossil fuels are required for electricity production.",Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
8,14276,"Furthermore, comparisons against EVs charged by grid and vehicles fueled by petrol, both subjected to urban everyday use, have been carried out here.",Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
9,14276,"Precisely, we financially compare the use of an EV charged directly through the national electric grid against our innovative power station.",Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
10,14276,"Both options are also compared with the same vehicle, powered by an internal combustion engine fueled by petrol.",Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
11,14276,This study also implements a detailed thermodynamic analysis for this state-of-the-art power station and an additional financial analysis for the everyday use of these vehicles under the three different scenarios.,Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
12,14276,"For the sake of equivalence, the new Peugeot 208 was selected as the reference-vehicle, as it is equipped either with a petrol engine or an electric motor, under a roughly identical performance profile.",Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
13,14276,"This work also introduces the use of the existing grid of natural gas to produce the necessary electricity for charging EVs, rather than using other renewables (solar, wind, etc.), and could further strengthen the worldwide acceptance of the EVs as a viable and a financially feasible solution for everyday urban transportation.",Natural Gas as a New Prospect in Everyday Use of Electric Vehicles,10.3390/app10186590
