3,2421,Composite NiO catalysts were found to be more active and have lower over potential and higher current density than pure Pt although the electrical conductivity of NiO itself is lower than that of Pt.,Investigation of cathode catalysts for intermediate-temperature H2S-air fuel cells,10.1016/S1004-9541(07)60084-6
4,2421,This problem has been overcome by either admixing as high as 10% (by mass) Ag powder into NiO cathode layer or using composite NiO catalysts such as NiO-Pt and LiNiO2 catalysts.,Investigation of cathode catalysts for intermediate-temperature H2S-air fuel cells,10.1016/S1004-9541(07)60084-6
5,2421,"Composite catalysts like NiO with Ag, electrolyte and starch admixed, NiO-Pt, which was prepared from a mixture of NiO and Pt powders, by admixing electrolyte and starch, and LiNiO2, which is derived from the reaction of LiOH center dot H2O and NiO with electrolyte and starch admixed have been shown to be feasible and effective in an intermediate-temperature H2S-air fuel cell.",Investigation of cathode catalysts for intermediate-temperature H2S-air fuel cells,10.1016/S1004-9541(07)60084-6
