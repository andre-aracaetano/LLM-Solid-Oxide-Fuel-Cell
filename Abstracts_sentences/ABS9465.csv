1,9465,"A composite oxide containing samaria-doped ceria [SDC, (CeO2)(0.8)(SmO1.5)(0.2)] and yttria-stabilized zirconia [YSZ, (ZrO2)(0.92)(Y2O3)(0.08)] was developed as an electrolyte for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).",Solid oxide fuel cell with composite electrolyte consisting of samaria-doped ceria and yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1149/1.1838378
2,9465,"A SOFC with a YSZ electrolyte was characterized by a high open-circuit voltage (OCV) and a steep decrease in voltage, V, with increasing current, I, whereas that with a SDC electrolyte exhibited a low OCV and a gradual decrease of its V-I curve.",Solid oxide fuel cell with composite electrolyte consisting of samaria-doped ceria and yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1149/1.1838378
3,9465,A biphasic electrolyte microstructure with SDC and YSZ was proposed in which SDC grains are dispersed in a YSZ matrix.,Solid oxide fuel cell with composite electrolyte consisting of samaria-doped ceria and yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1149/1.1838378
4,9465,"In this composite structure, the electronic conduction caused by reduction of the SDC was effectively blocked by the YSZ matrix.",Solid oxide fuel cell with composite electrolyte consisting of samaria-doped ceria and yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1149/1.1838378
5,9465,An SOFC with this composite electrolyte offered the advantages of YSZ with its high OCV and SDC with its gradual decrease of the V-I curve.,Solid oxide fuel cell with composite electrolyte consisting of samaria-doped ceria and yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1149/1.1838378
6,9465,The SDC content and the particle size significantly affected the power-generation characteristics of a cell with this composite electrolyte.,Solid oxide fuel cell with composite electrolyte consisting of samaria-doped ceria and yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1149/1.1838378
7,9465,The electrode polarization was significantly lowered by using the SDC or the composite electrolyte.,Solid oxide fuel cell with composite electrolyte consisting of samaria-doped ceria and yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1149/1.1838378
