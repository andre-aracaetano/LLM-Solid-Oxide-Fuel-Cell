2,3253,Samples were first characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).,Synthesis and characterization of Ca and Sr co-doped ceria electrolytes,10.1007/s11581-013-0999-6
3,3253,The XRD and SEM results showed that a complete solid solution formed in fluorite structure and Ce0.85Ca0.15-x Sr (x) O2-delta had homogeneous distribution of particle with grain size in the range of 2.5 to 3 mu m. The electrical conductivities of Ce0.85Ca0.15-x Sr (x) O2-delta were evaluated for its use as a solid electrolyte in the intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells by complex plane impedance measurements.,Synthesis and characterization of Ca and Sr co-doped ceria electrolytes,10.1007/s11581-013-0999-6
4,3253,Impedance measurements were made in the frequency range 1 MHz-0.1 Hz and temperature range 300-700 A degrees,Synthesis and characterization of Ca and Sr co-doped ceria electrolytes,10.1007/s11581-013-0999-6
