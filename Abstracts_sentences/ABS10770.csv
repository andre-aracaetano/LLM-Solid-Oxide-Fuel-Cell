4,10770,The composite LSM-SSZ cathodes modified with PrO2-x were shown inert with respect to oxidation reactions of hydrocarbon fuel (methane) and highly active electrochemically with respect to oxygen reaction in non-equilibrium gas mixture of CH4 and O-2.,"Cathodes Based on (La, Sr)MnO3 Modified with PrO2-x",10.1134/S1023193509080060
5,10770,"In cells with (Ce, Sm)O-2 (SDC) and (Zr, Y)O-2 (YSZ) electrolytes, their overvoltage is below 80 mV at the current density about 0.5 A/cm(2) and temperature of 600 degrees C. These electrodes can be used as cathodes in single-chamber fuel cells.","Cathodes Based on (La, Sr)MnO3 Modified with PrO2-x",10.1134/S1023193509080060
