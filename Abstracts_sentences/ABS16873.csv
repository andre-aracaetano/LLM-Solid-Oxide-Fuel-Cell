1,16873,A fundamental issue with micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is improvement of the mechanical strength of the cell.,Mechanical properties of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.076
2,16873,"Fabricated using extrusion and co-firing techniques, the approximately 1.7 mm diameter SOFC tubes examined in this work are composed of a 50:50 NiO and Gd(0.2)Ce(0.8)O(2-x) Gd-doped ceria (GDC) cermet anode (support tube), GDC as an electrolyte and La(0.8)Sr(0.2)Co(0.6)Fe(0.4)O(3) (LSCF)-GDC as a cathode.",Mechanical properties of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.076
3,16873,The mechanical properties of SOFCs are analyzed through internal burst testing and micro- and nano-indentation testing; the burst test is an especially important parameter because of improved power efficiency at increased fuel pressures.,Mechanical properties of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.076
4,16873,Results from micro- and nano-indentation tests performed on electrolyte-coated Ni-GDC anode pellets indicate that the hardness of GDC is comparable or greater than that of YSZ.,Mechanical properties of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.076
5,16873,"In order to develop a trend for the mechanical behavior of micro-tubes in relation to variations in fabrication techniques, several parameters were varied.",Mechanical properties of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.076
6,16873,"The standard anodes, used as a baseline, have four key design parameters as follows: they are not reduced, contain 40 vol% pore former, are sintered at 1400 degrees C and have a wall thickness of approximately 315 mu m.",Mechanical properties of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.076
7,16873,An independent variation on each of the four parameters is performed.,Mechanical properties of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.076
8,16873,"The four variations are (1) to reduce the standard tube, (2) to increase the percent pore former to 50% then to 60%,(3) to decrease sintering temperature to 1350 degrees C, and (4) to decrease the wall thickness to approximately 230 mu m. An average burst strength of 22.4 +/- 1.5 MPa is observed for the standard tubes, 34.2 +/- 16.5 MPa for the reduced tubes, 16.5 +/- 4.2 MPa for 50 vol% pore former and 11.7 +/- 7.5 for 60 vol% pore former, 29.3 +/- 9.6 MPa for the decreased sintering temperature and 34.3 +/- 6.9 MPa for the thinner-walled tubes.",Mechanical properties of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.076
