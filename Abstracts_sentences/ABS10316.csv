3,10316,A semiconductor-ionic heterostructure of perovskite Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Sb0.2O3-delta (BSFSb) and fluorite structure Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) is developed.,Promoted electrocatalytic activity and ionic transport simultaneously in dual functional Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Sb0.2O3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ heterostructure,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120503
4,10316,The BSFSb-SDC heterostructure exhibits a high ionic conductivity >0.1 S cm(-1) (vs 0.01 S cm(-1) of SDC) and achieves a remarkable fuel cell performance (>1000 mWcm(-2)) at 550 degrees C. It was found that the BSFSb-SDC has both electrolyte and electrode (cathode) functions with enhanced ionic transport and electrocatalytic activity simultaneously.,Promoted electrocatalytic activity and ionic transport simultaneously in dual functional Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Sb0.2O3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ heterostructure,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120503
