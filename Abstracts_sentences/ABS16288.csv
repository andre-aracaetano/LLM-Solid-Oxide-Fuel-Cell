1,16288,"In order to electrochemically control oxygen pressure at low temperatures below 400 degreesC, a planar zirconia oxygen pump-gauge with Ag electrodes for a pump and a sensor was constructed by attaching a thin plate of YSZ electrolyte to a low thermal expansion alloy vessel.",Preparation and electrochemical characteristics of a planar zirconia oxygen pump-gauge with silver electrodes,10.2320/jinstmet1952.65.9_767
2,16288,"The sensor worked precisely to a lower limit of 250 degreesC and the pump quantitatively introduced oxygen throughout a wide range of oxygen pressures at 400 degreesC. As a result, this device responded well to both the stationary-injected and pulse-injected oxygen.",Preparation and electrochemical characteristics of a planar zirconia oxygen pump-gauge with silver electrodes,10.2320/jinstmet1952.65.9_767
