1,13665,Strontium cobaltite-based perovskites (SrCoO3-delta) have been widely studied as a promising cathode for the next-generation solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Computational Design and Experimental Validation of the Optimal Bimetal-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskite as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode,10.1021/jacs.1c03441
2,13665,"Here, we found a balance between oxygen vacancy (V-O) formation and its migration in designing SrCoO3-delta-based materials by using two activity descriptors, i.e., radius and electronegativity.",Computational Design and Experimental Validation of the Optimal Bimetal-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskite as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode,10.1021/jacs.1c03441
3,13665,"The ORR activity of these types of perovskites is found to strongly rely on the two proposed descriptors, and Nb- or Ta-doped SrCoO3-delta locates in the promising zone as predicted with a moderate value of both VO formation energy and ion migration barrier.",Computational Design and Experimental Validation of the Optimal Bimetal-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskite as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode,10.1021/jacs.1c03441
4,13665,Then Sc-Ta co-doped SrCoO3-delta (SSTC) and Sc-Nb co-doped SrCoO3-delta (SSNC) are screened out to be the best among 91 bimetal-doped SrCoO3-delta perovskites.,Computational Design and Experimental Validation of the Optimal Bimetal-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskite as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode,10.1021/jacs.1c03441
5,13665,"Further experiments have been carried out to synthesize the co-doped SSTC and prove ultralow area-specific resistance values (0.071, 0.198, and 0.701 Omega.cm(2) at 550, 500, and 450 degrees C, respectively), which is only one-third of that of benchmark materials for the SOFC cathodes.",Computational Design and Experimental Validation of the Optimal Bimetal-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskite as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode,10.1021/jacs.1c03441
