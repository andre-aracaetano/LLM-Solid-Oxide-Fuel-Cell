1,16655,The impact of La2Zr2O7 (LZO) on interfacial resistance (R-p) at the La0.78Sr0.20MnO3-delta/yttria-stabilized zirconia interface was studied upon isothermal sintering at 1200 degrees C for 2-25 h. Quantification of triple phase boundary length was performed by applying focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) serial-sectioning techniques and classical stereology.,Effect of La2Zr2O7 on Interfacial Resistance in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3484092
2,16655,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to characterize the R-p.,Effect of La2Zr2O7 on Interfacial Resistance in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3484092
3,16655,The effect of LZO formation on microstructural models for R-p was analyzed with respect to previous works that did not include this effect.,Effect of La2Zr2O7 on Interfacial Resistance in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3484092
