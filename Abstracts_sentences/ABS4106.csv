1,4106,"Boron volatility is one of the most important properties of borosilicate-based glass sealants in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), as boron contaminants react with lanthanum-containing cathodes, forming LaBO3 and degrading the activity of SOFCs.",Effect of Gd2O3 doping on structure and boron volatility of borosilicate glass sealants in solid oxide fuel cells-A study on the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.057
2,4106,"Here, we report that the reaction between the volatile boron and a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode during polarization can be significantly reduced by doping aluminoborosilicate glass with Gd2O3.",Effect of Gd2O3 doping on structure and boron volatility of borosilicate glass sealants in solid oxide fuel cells-A study on the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.057
3,4106,"Specifically, the Gd cations in glass with 2 mol.% Gd2O3 dissolve preferentially in the borate-rich environment to form more Gd-metaborate structures and promote the formation of calcium metaborate (CaB2O4); they also condense the B-O network after heat treatment, which suppresses poisoning by boron contaminants on the LSCF cathode.",Effect of Gd2O3 doping on structure and boron volatility of borosilicate glass sealants in solid oxide fuel cells-A study on the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.057
4,4106,The results provide insights into design and development of a reliable sealing glass for SOFC applications.,Effect of Gd2O3 doping on structure and boron volatility of borosilicate glass sealants in solid oxide fuel cells-A study on the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.057
