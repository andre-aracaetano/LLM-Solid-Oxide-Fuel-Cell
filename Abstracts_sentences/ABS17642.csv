3,17642,DSC and XRD measurements indicate that Sr2MgMoO6-delta exhibits a reversible phase transition around 275 degrees C from triclinic (I (1) over bar) with an octahedral tilting distortion to cubic (Fm (3) over barm) without octahedral distortion.,High temperature phase transition in SOFC anodes based on Sr2MgMoO6-δ,10.1016/j.jssc.2009.01.018
