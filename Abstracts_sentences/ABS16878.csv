7,16878,"The respective operational parameters of the system correspond to an electrolysis current density loading up 433.3 mA cm - 2 for 4 h, as well as fuel cell operation mode with a current density of 8.3 mA cm -2 for 12 h. It is found that the average voltage losses in the electrolysis cell and fuel cell mode are 0.27 %/cycle and 0.886 %/cycle, respectively, indicating that the lifetime of the cells can be more than 800 h. The reported studies demonstrate validity of applying rSOC-based P2H2 system, especially if abundant photovoltaic power and water resources are available.",A power-to-hydrogen nearby consumption system based on a flat-tube rSOC coupled with local photovoltaics and Yellow River water,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.113
