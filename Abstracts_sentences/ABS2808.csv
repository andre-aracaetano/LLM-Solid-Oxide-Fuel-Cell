1,2808,Plasma-sprayed coatings of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were fabricated using the feedstock powders obtained from co-precipitation (PPT) and spray-drying (SD) processes.,Effect of Feedstock Powders on the Microstructural and Electrical Characteristics of 8 mol% Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Plasma-Sprayed Coatings,10.1007/s11666-012-9823-5
2,2808,Particle size and the specific mass (SM) of the feedstock powder were found to be the critical parameters that influence the microstructural and electrical properties of the coatings.,Effect of Feedstock Powders on the Microstructural and Electrical Characteristics of 8 mol% Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Plasma-Sprayed Coatings,10.1007/s11666-012-9823-5
