7,223,The power output of the TSOFC after constructal optimization is increased by 18.20% compared to that of the TSOFC with cathode thickness t(c) = 2200 mu m and fuel cell length L = 1.5 m. The performance of the TSOFC is evidently improved by adopting the optimal constructs obtained in this paper.,Constructal optimization for a single tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.162
