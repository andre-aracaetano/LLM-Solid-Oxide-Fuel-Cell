1,8967,Composite cathodes based on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) are investigated for lower operating temperature (< 750 degrees C) applications of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,A bi-layer cathode based on lanthanum based cobalt- and iron-containing perovskite and gadolinium doped ceria for thin yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.04.086
2,8967,"To enhance a charge transfer, a bi-layer SOFC cathode is proposed, which has a LSCF-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) composite layer and a pure LSCF layer.",A bi-layer cathode based on lanthanum based cobalt- and iron-containing perovskite and gadolinium doped ceria for thin yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.04.086
3,8967,"The bi-layer cathode SOFC shows a current density of 0.65 A cm(-2) at 0.8 V and 660 degrees C, which is higher than a LSCF-GDC composite single-layer cathode SOFC cell of 0.35 A cm(-2).",A bi-layer cathode based on lanthanum based cobalt- and iron-containing perovskite and gadolinium doped ceria for thin yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.04.086
4,8967,"The charge transfer polarizations in the bi-layer cathode SOFC are 0.14 Omega cm(2) and 0.35 Omega cm(2) at 760 degrees C and 660 degrees C, respectively, which are lower than those in the single-layer cathode cell of 0.23 Omega cm(2) and 0.66 Omega cm(2).",A bi-layer cathode based on lanthanum based cobalt- and iron-containing perovskite and gadolinium doped ceria for thin yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.04.086
5,8967,The impedances characterized with a fitting model show that the lowered charge transfer polarization in the bi-layer cathode is a dominant factor in reducing the total polarization of SOFC.,A bi-layer cathode based on lanthanum based cobalt- and iron-containing perovskite and gadolinium doped ceria for thin yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.04.086
