5,20683,"Furthermore, the influence of V-O on the electronic and optical properties is investigated for the high temperature stable phases (T = 1100 K).","The influence of oxygen vacancy on the electronic and optical properties of ABO3-δ (A = La, Sr, B = Fe, Co) perovskites",10.1039/c9cp03883c
6,20683,"For the LaFeO3 insulator, the V-O donated electrons are all localized on the down-spin d3z(2)-r(2) orbitals of the nearest Fe ions.","The influence of oxygen vacancy on the electronic and optical properties of ABO3-δ (A = La, Sr, B = Fe, Co) perovskites",10.1039/c9cp03883c
7,20683,"These defect states located in the band gap induce a drop in the energy onset of absorption as pristine bulk -> V2+O -> V1+O -> V0O, and especially, an extra absorption peak appears between 0.5 and 1.5 eV due to V0O and V1+O formation.","The influence of oxygen vacancy on the electronic and optical properties of ABO3-δ (A = La, Sr, B = Fe, Co) perovskites",10.1039/c9cp03883c
8,20683,"In the rest of the crystals that expressed a metallic feature, the V-O donated electrons partially localize on the down-spin d3z(2)-r(2) orbital and partially delocalize through the lattice, by which the absorption peaks (0.5-2.0 eV for LaCoO3, 0.0-0.5 eV for SrFeO3 and SrCoO3) from the electronic excitation near the Fermi level are enhanced.","The influence of oxygen vacancy on the electronic and optical properties of ABO3-δ (A = La, Sr, B = Fe, Co) perovskites",10.1039/c9cp03883c
9,20683,"A high V-O concentration of oxygen divacancy in SrFeO3 and SrCoO3 could enhance charge localization on down-spin d3z(2)-r(2) orbitals, resulting in a remarkable increase of optical absorption at 1.5-3.0 eV.","The influence of oxygen vacancy on the electronic and optical properties of ABO3-δ (A = La, Sr, B = Fe, Co) perovskites",10.1039/c9cp03883c
