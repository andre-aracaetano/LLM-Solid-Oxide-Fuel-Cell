3,268,The pollutant emissions of one system of each technology have been tested with a portable probe both in laboratory and field-test configurations.,Experimental assessment of pollutant emissions from residential fuel cells and comparative benchmark analysis,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121017
4,268,"In this paper, the nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) emission levels are compared to other combustion technologies such as a recent Euro 6 diesel automotive vehicle, a classical gas condensing boiler, and a gas absorption heat pump.",Experimental assessment of pollutant emissions from residential fuel cells and comparative benchmark analysis,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121017
5,268,"At last, a method of converting the concentration of pollutants (in ppm) measured by the sensors into pollutant intensity per unit of energy (in mg/kWh) is documented and reported.",Experimental assessment of pollutant emissions from residential fuel cells and comparative benchmark analysis,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121017
6,268,"This allows for comparing the pollutant emissions levels with relevant literature, especially other studies conducted with other measuring sensors.",Experimental assessment of pollutant emissions from residential fuel cells and comparative benchmark analysis,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121017

8,268,The CO emissions can be considered quite low for the tested SOFC and even nil for the tested PEMFC.,Experimental assessment of pollutant emissions from residential fuel cells and comparative benchmark analysis,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121017
9,268,The biggest issue of natural gas fuel cell technologies still lies in the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with the fossil fuel they consume.,Experimental assessment of pollutant emissions from residential fuel cells and comparative benchmark analysis,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121017

11,268,"At last, this study illustrates that the high level of hybridization between a fuel cell and a gas boiler may be responsible for unexpected ON/OFF cycling behaviours and therefore prevent both sub-systems from operating as optimally and reliably as they would have as standalone units.",Experimental assessment of pollutant emissions from residential fuel cells and comparative benchmark analysis,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121017
