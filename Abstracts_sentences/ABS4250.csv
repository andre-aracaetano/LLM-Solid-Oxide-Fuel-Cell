1,4250,"A simple and cost-effective method, starting with electrophoretic deposition (EPD) on a carbon sheet, has been developed for preparation of a NiO-YSZ anode and thin, gas-tight YSZ electrolyte layer on it for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Preparation of NiO-YSZ/YSZ bi-layers for solid oxide fuel cells by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.090
2,4250,"The innovative feature of this approach enables the deposition of anode materials as well as the YSZ electrolyte, which were subsequently co-fired in air at high temperatures to remove the carbon and form an anode-supported dense YSZ electrolyte.",Preparation of NiO-YSZ/YSZ bi-layers for solid oxide fuel cells by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.090
3,4250,"A functional SOFC constructed by brush painting a layer of mixed cathode consisting of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and YSZ on the electrolyte layer followed by firing at 1250 degrees C, displayed a peak power density of 434 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C when tested with H-2 as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.",Preparation of NiO-YSZ/YSZ bi-layers for solid oxide fuel cells by electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.090
