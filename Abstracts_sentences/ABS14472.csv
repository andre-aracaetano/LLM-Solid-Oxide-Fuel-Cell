2,14472,"Advantages of reduced power requirements, atmospheric pressure operation, portability, and the circumventing of catalyst issues have made microplasmas a fascinating alternative for hydrocarbon reforming.",Analysis of a Microplasma Fuel Reformer with a Carbon Dioxide Decomposition Reaction,10.1021/ef302199a
3,14472,"Through the course of previous work, these microplasma reactors have displayed process and plasma variability that make characterizing the microplasma reactor challenging.",Analysis of a Microplasma Fuel Reformer with a Carbon Dioxide Decomposition Reaction,10.1021/ef302199a
4,14472,"In the current study, 24 experiments were run using 16 different microplasma reactors, with carbon dioxide as the only reactant.",Analysis of a Microplasma Fuel Reformer with a Carbon Dioxide Decomposition Reaction,10.1021/ef302199a
5,14472,Carbon dioxide decomposition was chose because it provides a simple experimental reaction environment that eliminates the need for a carrier gas and reduces the number of undesirable products.,Analysis of a Microplasma Fuel Reformer with a Carbon Dioxide Decomposition Reaction,10.1021/ef302199a
6,14472,Carbon dioxide decomposition also has potential application for greenhouse gas mitigation.,Analysis of a Microplasma Fuel Reformer with a Carbon Dioxide Decomposition Reaction,10.1021/ef302199a
7,14472,"For example, an array of microplasma devices on the exhaust of a fossil fuel power station or an automobile would not only reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air but the product, carbon monoxide, could be sued as a fuel, resulting in a reduction in net carbon footprint.",Analysis of a Microplasma Fuel Reformer with a Carbon Dioxide Decomposition Reaction,10.1021/ef302199a
8,14472,"Carbon monoxide could be used in specific fuel cell types, such as solid oxide fuel cells, or in direct combustion.",Analysis of a Microplasma Fuel Reformer with a Carbon Dioxide Decomposition Reaction,10.1021/ef302199a
9,14472,"Despite the simplified carbon dioxide reaction chemistry, this study has revealed device variability in reaction outcomes while observed over operating lifetimes varying from 10 s to 180 min. Input electrical energy was found to have a direct link to the amount of carbon dioxide that is reformed.",Analysis of a Microplasma Fuel Reformer with a Carbon Dioxide Decomposition Reaction,10.1021/ef302199a
