4,647,"In addition, increasing the temperature entering the turbine and increasing the pressure ratio increased the production entropy and, as a result, increased the irreversibility of the system.",Energy and Exergy Analysis of the Impact of Renewable Energy with Combined Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Micro-Gas Turbine on Poly-Generation Smart-Grids,10.3390/w15061069
5,647,"The results of the research at the design point showed that 65% of the irreversibility of the system was caused by the combustion chamber and fuel cell (35% of the amount of entropy produced, the contribution of the combustion chamber, and 30% of the contribution of the solid oxide fuel cell) and 19% was due to the contribution of the heat exchanger.",Energy and Exergy Analysis of the Impact of Renewable Energy with Combined Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Micro-Gas Turbine on Poly-Generation Smart-Grids,10.3390/w15061069
6,647,"In addition, the combined system has an efficiency of 9.81%, while the system without a fuel cell has an efficiency of 33.4%, which shows the extraordinary performance of the combined system.",Energy and Exergy Analysis of the Impact of Renewable Energy with Combined Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Micro-Gas Turbine on Poly-Generation Smart-Grids,10.3390/w15061069
