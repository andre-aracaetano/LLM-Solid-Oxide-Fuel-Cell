5,17601,"In this work, the key parameters of the hybrid system are selected by an innovative tool based on a genetic algorithm (GA), which replaces the cumbersome parameter studies that generally are performed for this purpose.",Optimisation of an SOFC/GT system with CO2-capture,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.090
6,17601,The focus is put on the evaluation of the GA as a tool for handling the multi-variable non-linear optimisation problem.,Optimisation of an SOFC/GT system with CO2-capture,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.090
7,17601,The result of the optimisation procedure is a SOFC/GT system that exhibits an electrical efficiency above 60% with part capture of the CO2.,Optimisation of an SOFC/GT system with CO2-capture,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.090
