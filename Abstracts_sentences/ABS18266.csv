1,18266,The application of spinel coatings has been proposed to overcome the difficulties in ultilizing ferritic stainless steel as interconnection.,Diffusion behavior and electrical performance of La2O3 doped Ni-Co films and their application as metallic interconnection of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.tsf.2023.139692
2,18266,"In this paper, a La2O3-doped (Ni,Co)3O4 coating containing 15 wt% La2O3 was synthesized on a SUS430 stainless steel via codeposition, followed by thermal conversion of the deposited layer in air at 800 celcius for 1000 h. The surface and cross-sectional microstructure of the samples is analyzed by scanning electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction.",Diffusion behavior and electrical performance of La2O3 doped Ni-Co films and their application as metallic interconnection of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.tsf.2023.139692
