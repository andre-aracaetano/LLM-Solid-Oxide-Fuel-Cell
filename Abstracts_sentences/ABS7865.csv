1,7865,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with bi-layer Zirconia/Ceria electrolytes have been studied extensively because of their great potential for producing high power density at reduced operating temperature, important for reducing cost and thereby allowing broader SOFC commercialization.",Reduced-temperature firing of solid oxide fuel cells with zironia/ceria bi-layer electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.025
2,7865,"The bi-layer electrolytes are designed to take advantage of the high oxygen ion conductivity of Ceria, the low electronic conductivity of Zirconia, and the low reactivity of Ceria with high-performance cathodes.",Reduced-temperature firing of solid oxide fuel cells with zironia/ceria bi-layer electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.025
3,7865,"However, zirconia/ceria processing has proven problematic due to interdiffusion during high temperature co-firing, or ceria layer porosity after two-step firing.",Reduced-temperature firing of solid oxide fuel cells with zironia/ceria bi-layer electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.025
4,7865,"Here we first show a new method for bi-layer co-firing at a reduced temperature of 1250 degrees C, similar to 150 degrees C lower than the usual sintering temperature, achieved using Fe2O3 as a sintering aid.",Reduced-temperature firing of solid oxide fuel cells with zironia/ceria bi-layer electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.025
5,7865,"This novel process enables high power density SOFCs by producing: (1) low-resistance Y0.16Zr0.92O2-delta (YSZ)/Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) electrolytes that also yield high open-circuit voltage, (2) dense GDC layers that prevent reactions between highly-active La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 (LSFC) cathode materials and YSZ, and (3) Ni-YSZ anodes with high electrochemical activity due to fine-scale microstructure with high TPB densities.",Reduced-temperature firing of solid oxide fuel cells with zironia/ceria bi-layer electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.025
