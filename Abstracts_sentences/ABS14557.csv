2,14557,"Compared to single-phase materials, the fabricated porous heterostructured NSC214/113 shows optimized electrochemical properties, including a better conductivity, 20 times faster surface oxygen exchange kinetics, and a comparatively lower area-specific resistance (0.065 LI cm2 at 800 & DEG;C).",Enhanced oxygen reduction kinetics by a porous heterostructured cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.egyai.2020.100027
3,14557,"The single cell with Ni-YSZIYSZGDCINSC214m3 configuration exhibits a high peak power density of 1.10 W cm -2 at 800 & DEG;C, superior to other cells reported in literature with similar heterostructured cathodes.",Enhanced oxygen reduction kinetics by a porous heterostructured cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.egyai.2020.100027
4,14557,"Moreover, the underlying mechanism of the ORR performance enhancement is further investigated, revealing that the formation of heterojunction can lead to a narrowed energy bandgap and a decrease of Co oxidation state, which further induce better conductivity, more available electrons and oxygen vacancies to enhance the ORR process.",Enhanced oxygen reduction kinetics by a porous heterostructured cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.egyai.2020.100027
