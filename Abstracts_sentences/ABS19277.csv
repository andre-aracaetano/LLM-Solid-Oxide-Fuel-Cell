1,19277,An uncoated and MnCo1.9Fe(0.1)O(4) (MCF) coated Fe-22Cr meshes were dipped into LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-delta (LNF) slurry to form a continuous protective/conductive layer for Crofer22APU interconnect.,Evaluation of using protective/conductive coating on Fe-22Cr mesh as a composite cathode contact material for intermediate solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.02.052
2,19277,"After aged these samples at 800 degrees C for 1000 h, energy dispersive Xray (EDX) results concluded that: if the deposition of the protective coating was not enough to form a dense and continuous layer across the width of the mesh, then the use of MCF spinel layer is not enough to prevent chromium migration.",Evaluation of using protective/conductive coating on Fe-22Cr mesh as a composite cathode contact material for intermediate solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.02.052
