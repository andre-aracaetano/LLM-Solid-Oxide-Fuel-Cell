1,8226,Infiltration of fine-grained electrocatalyst particles into ceramic porous scaffolds is a very effective way to improve electrode performance for low-to-intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Performance of a commercial cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cells prepared by single-step infiltration of an ion-conducting electrocatalyst,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.079
2,8226,"Conventionally, fine particles of an electronic or mixed electronic and oxide-ion conducting material are impregnated into an ion conducting porous scaffold.",Performance of a commercial cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cells prepared by single-step infiltration of an ion-conducting electrocatalyst,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.079
3,8226,"However, this approach usually requires higher infiltrant-loading, therefore tedious repetitive infiltration/drying and calcinations steps, in order to form percolated electron conducting network for effective current collection.",Performance of a commercial cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cells prepared by single-step infiltration of an ion-conducting electrocatalyst,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.079
4,8226,"In this study, we present an alternative single-step route involving infiltration of an ion conducting Sm-doped CeO2 (SDC) into an electron conducting cathode porous scaffold as well as anode of a commercial cathode-supported SOFC.",Performance of a commercial cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cells prepared by single-step infiltration of an ion-conducting electrocatalyst,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.079
5,8226,A comparative study shows that the cathode polarization can be reduced by a factor of five to thirteen from 700 to 1000 degrees C by the infiltrated SDC.,Performance of a commercial cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cells prepared by single-step infiltration of an ion-conducting electrocatalyst,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.079
6,8226,"The single-cell performance exhibits a performance improvement by a factor of three from 700 to 800 degrees C. Stability tests within a limited time frame and low current-density show a relatively flat performance for SDC-infiltrated cell and break-in behavior for the baseline cell, suggesting electrolyte/cathode interface being activated by the infiltrated electrocatalyst.",Performance of a commercial cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cells prepared by single-step infiltration of an ion-conducting electrocatalyst,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.079
