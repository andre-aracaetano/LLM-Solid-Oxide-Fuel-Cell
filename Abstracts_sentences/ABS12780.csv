1,12780,"A power interchange operation, in which electric power generated by multiple residential solid oxide fuel cell cogeneration systems (R-FCGSs) is shared among residences in a housing complex with no reverse power flow to a commercial electric power system, has a high energy-saving effect as compared with a stand-alone operation of individual systems.",Optimal sizing of residential SOFC cogeneration system for power interchange operation in housing complex from energy-saving viewpoint,10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.056
2,12780,"To further improve its energy-saving effect, the optimal sizing of the R-FCGS for this power interchange operation is discussed from the energy-saving viewpoint by conducting optimal operational planning based on mixed-integer linear programming.",Optimal sizing of residential SOFC cogeneration system for power interchange operation in housing complex from energy-saving viewpoint,10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.056
3,12780,The energy-saving effect of the power interchange operation is analyzed for 14 different scales of the R-FCGSs with the rated electric power output ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 kW per 0.1 kW.,Optimal sizing of residential SOFC cogeneration system for power interchange operation in housing complex from energy-saving viewpoint,10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.056
4,12780,The analysis for a housing complex with 20 residences located in Japan reveals that the power interchange operation has an advantage over the stand-alone operation in terms of energy saving for any scale of the R-FCGS investigated in this study.,Optimal sizing of residential SOFC cogeneration system for power interchange operation in housing complex from energy-saving viewpoint,10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.056
5,12780,"Furthermore, it is found that the 0.6-kW R-FCGS is the optimal scale for the power interchange operation in terms of the energy saving and saves the annual primary energy consumption of 17% as compared with the conventional energy supply with no R-FCGS.",Optimal sizing of residential SOFC cogeneration system for power interchange operation in housing complex from energy-saving viewpoint,10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.056
