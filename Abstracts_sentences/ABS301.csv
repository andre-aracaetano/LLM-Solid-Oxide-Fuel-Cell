1,301,Flame fuel cell (FFC) is a novel kind of fuel cell coupling rich-flame and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) together.,Highly Thermal-Integrated Flame Fuel Cell Module with High Temperature Heatpipe,10.1149/2.1591713jes
2,301,"With rich-flame as both heater and reformer, FFC is advantageous for quick start-up, simple setup and low cost.",Highly Thermal-Integrated Flame Fuel Cell Module with High Temperature Heatpipe,10.1149/2.1591713jes
3,301,"In this study, high-temperature heatpipes were introduced to a flame fuel cell module to lower the temperature gradient and improve the FFC performance.",Highly Thermal-Integrated Flame Fuel Cell Module with High Temperature Heatpipe,10.1149/2.1591713jes
4,301,Experimental results showed that the temperature gradient along the axis of the tubular SOFC decreased from 24 K/10 mm to 14 K/10 mm due to the high heat transfer rate of the heatpipe.,Highly Thermal-Integrated Flame Fuel Cell Module with High Temperature Heatpipe,10.1149/2.1591713jes
5,301,"For a methane-rich flame at an equivalence ratio of 1.6, the power output for a single FFC increased from 1.21 W to 1.52 W at 0.6 V with a columnar heatpipe.",Highly Thermal-Integrated Flame Fuel Cell Module with High Temperature Heatpipe,10.1149/2.1591713jes
6,301,"Furthermore, by integrating an annular heatpipe and modifying the micro-tubular SOFC, a significant power of 2.0 W at 0.7 V for a single FFC was obtained.",Highly Thermal-Integrated Flame Fuel Cell Module with High Temperature Heatpipe,10.1149/2.1591713jes
