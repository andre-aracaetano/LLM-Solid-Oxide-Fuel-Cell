2,17525,Tracer oxygen-18 diffusion studies of polycrystalline alpha-Bi2O3 at 600 degrees C using an ion microscope with lateral resolutions of similar to 50 nm for the surface distributions of the oxygen isotopes have resolved the secondary fast migration pathways as well as the normal bulk diffusion profile in the grains.,Fast grain boundary oxygen ion diffusion in the α-phase of Bi2O3,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.08.002
