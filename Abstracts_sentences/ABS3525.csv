2,3525,The objectives of this study are to find the operation characteristics of the SOFC in the hybrid system and determine the operational design point of the hybrid system.,Solid oxide fuel cell operation in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system and the design point performance of the hybrid system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113681
3,3525,"To accomplish these objectives, operation of a 5 kW-class SOFC-ICE hybrid system was analysed by integrating the experimental results of the internal combustion engine with the simulation models of other system components.",Solid oxide fuel cell operation in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system and the design point performance of the hybrid system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113681
4,3525,Two unique characteristics of SOFC operation were found and analysed.,Solid oxide fuel cell operation in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system and the design point performance of the hybrid system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113681
5,3525,"First, the SOFC in the hybrid system should utilize anode inlet gas with low temperature (e.g., 750-800 K) and low external reforming rate (e.g., 30-40%), which decreases the SOFC temperature, especially at the entrance, where the current density becomes very low, decreasing SOFC performance.",Solid oxide fuel cell operation in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system and the design point performance of the hybrid system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113681
6,3525,"Second, the overall effects of pressure pulsation caused by the engine on SOFC operation are insignificant since the flow path between the SOFC and the engine acts as a damper, reducing the pressure pulsation amplitude.",Solid oxide fuel cell operation in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system and the design point performance of the hybrid system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113681
