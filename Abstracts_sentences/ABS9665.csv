1,9665,The ferritic stainless steel Crofer 22 APU is attractive for the use as interconnects in solid oxide fuel cell stacks.,Effect of pre-oxidation on the oxidation resistance of Crofer 22 APU,10.1016/j.corsci.2018.04.016
2,9665,The oxidation rate of this alloy in air at 800 degrees C was reduced by pre-oxidation at higher temperatures in either air or N-2-9%H-2-1%H2O.,Effect of pre-oxidation on the oxidation resistance of Crofer 22 APU,10.1016/j.corsci.2018.04.016
3,9665,"Conversely, the oxidation rate increased when the alloy grain size was increased by heat-treating in H-2 (pO(2) similar to 10(-21) atm).",Effect of pre-oxidation on the oxidation resistance of Crofer 22 APU,10.1016/j.corsci.2018.04.016
4,9665,"In all cases the scale formed on Crofer 22 APU consisted of an outer (Mn,Cr)(3)O-4 layer, an inner Cr2O3 layer and sub-scale MnCr2O4 nodules that preferentially formed at alloy grain boundaries.",Effect of pre-oxidation on the oxidation resistance of Crofer 22 APU,10.1016/j.corsci.2018.04.016
