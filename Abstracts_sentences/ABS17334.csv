1,17334,This work presents a thermodynamic analysis of the integration of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with chemical looping combustion (CLC) in natural gas power plants.,Integration of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and chemical looping combustion (CLC) for ultra-high efficiency power generation and CO2 production,10.1016/j.ijggc.2018.02.005
2,17334,The fundamental idea of the proposed process integration is to use a dual fluidized-bed CLC process to complete the oxidation of the H-2-CO-rich anode exhausts from the SOFC in the CLC fuel reactor while preheating the air stream to the cathode inlet temperature in the CLC air reactor.,Integration of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and chemical looping combustion (CLC) for ultra-high efficiency power generation and CO2 production,10.1016/j.ijggc.2018.02.005
3,17334,"Thus, fuel oxidation can be completed in N-2-free environment without the high energy and economic costs associated to O-2 production, avoiding at the same time the high temperature and high cost heat exchanger needed in conventional SOFC plants for air preheating.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and chemical looping combustion (CLC) for ultra-high efficiency power generation and CO2 production,10.1016/j.ijggc.2018.02.005
