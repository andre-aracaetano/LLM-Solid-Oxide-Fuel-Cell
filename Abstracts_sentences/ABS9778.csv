1,9778,"Solid oxide fuel cell systems such as those presented in this paper are not only applicable for a pure supply with electric energy, they can typically also be used in decentralized power stations, i.e., as micro-cogeneration systems for houses, where both electric and thermal energy are required.",Experiments-Based Comparison of Different Power Controllers for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Against Model Imperfections and Delay Phenomena,10.3390/a13040076
2,9778,"For that application, obviously, the electric power need is not constant but rather changes over time.",Experiments-Based Comparison of Different Power Controllers for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Against Model Imperfections and Delay Phenomena,10.3390/a13040076
3,9778,"In such a way, it essentially depends on the user profiles of said houses which can refer to e.g., private households as well as offices.",Experiments-Based Comparison of Different Power Controllers for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Against Model Imperfections and Delay Phenomena,10.3390/a13040076
4,9778,The power use is furthermore not predefined.,Experiments-Based Comparison of Different Power Controllers for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Against Model Imperfections and Delay Phenomena,10.3390/a13040076
5,9778,"For an optimal operation of the fuel cell, we want to adjust the power, to match the need with sufficiently small time constants without the implementation of mid- or long-term electrical storage systems such as battery buffers.",Experiments-Based Comparison of Different Power Controllers for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Against Model Imperfections and Delay Phenomena,10.3390/a13040076
6,9778,"To adapt the produced electric power a simple, however, sufficiently robust feedback controller regulating the hydrogen mass flow into the cells is necessary.",Experiments-Based Comparison of Different Power Controllers for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Against Model Imperfections and Delay Phenomena,10.3390/a13040076
7,9778,"To achieve this goal, four different controllers, namely, a PI output-feedback controller combined with a feedforward control, an internal model control (IMC) approach, a sliding-mode (SM) controller and a state-feedback controller, are developed and compared in this paper.",Experiments-Based Comparison of Different Power Controllers for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Against Model Imperfections and Delay Phenomena,10.3390/a13040076
8,9778,"As the challenge is to find a controller ensuring steady-state accuracy and good tracking behavior despite the nonlinearities and uncertainties of the plant, the comparison was done regarding these requirements.",Experiments-Based Comparison of Different Power Controllers for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Against Model Imperfections and Delay Phenomena,10.3390/a13040076
9,9778,Simulations and experiments show that the IMC outperforms the alternatives with respect to steady-state accuracy and tracking behavior.,Experiments-Based Comparison of Different Power Controllers for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Against Model Imperfections and Delay Phenomena,10.3390/a13040076
