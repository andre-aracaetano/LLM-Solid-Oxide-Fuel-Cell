1,11066,A modified sol-gel process was developed for the fabrication of sub-micrometer scale yttrium-doped barium zirconate (BZY) thin film at much lower processing temperatures.,Fabrication of yttrium-doped barium zirconate thin films with sub-micrometer thickness by a sol-gel spin coating method,10.1016/j.tsf.2014.11.093
2,11066,"The film was fabricated by direct spin-coating of the sol on a Si3N4 passivated Si substrate, followed by low temperature thermal annealing at 1000 degrees C, and single BZY phase without barium carbonate residue was obtained.",Fabrication of yttrium-doped barium zirconate thin films with sub-micrometer thickness by a sol-gel spin coating method,10.1016/j.tsf.2014.11.093
3,11066,A 200 nm-thick thin film without obvious through-film cracks was fabricated with optimized process parameters of sol concentration and heating rate.,Fabrication of yttrium-doped barium zirconate thin films with sub-micrometer thickness by a sol-gel spin coating method,10.1016/j.tsf.2014.11.093
4,11066,The stoichiometry of the BZY thin film was well-controlled and no Ba evaporation was observed due to the low processing temperature.,Fabrication of yttrium-doped barium zirconate thin films with sub-micrometer thickness by a sol-gel spin coating method,10.1016/j.tsf.2014.11.093
