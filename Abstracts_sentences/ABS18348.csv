1,18348,The slow transport of dopants through crystal lattices has hindered the development of novel devices.,Ultrafast palladium diffusion in germanium,10.1039/c4ta06210h
2,18348,Typically atoms are contained within deep potential energy wells which necessitates multiple attempts to hop between minimum energy positions.,Ultrafast palladium diffusion in germanium,10.1039/c4ta06210h
3,18348,This is because the bonds that constrain atoms are strongest at the minimum positions.,Ultrafast palladium diffusion in germanium,10.1039/c4ta06210h
4,18348,"As they hop between sites the bonds must be broken, only to re-form as the atoms slide into adjacent minima.",Ultrafast palladium diffusion in germanium,10.1039/c4ta06210h
5,18348,Here we demonstrate that the Pd atoms introduced into the Ge lattice behave differently.,Ultrafast palladium diffusion in germanium,10.1039/c4ta06210h
6,18348,They retain bonds as the atoms shift across so that at the energy maximum between sites Pd still exhibits strong bonding characteristics.,Ultrafast palladium diffusion in germanium,10.1039/c4ta06210h
7,18348,This reduces the energy maximum to almost nothing (a migration energy of only 0.03 eV) and means that the transport of Pd through the Ge lattice is ultrafast.,Ultrafast palladium diffusion in germanium,10.1039/c4ta06210h
8,18348,"We scrutinize the bonding characteristics at the atomic level using quantum mechanical simulation tools and demonstrate why Pd behaves so differently to other metals we investigated (i.e. Li, Cu, Ag, Pt and Au).",Ultrafast palladium diffusion in germanium,10.1039/c4ta06210h
9,18348,"Consequently, this fundamental understanding can be extended to systems where extremely rapid diffusion is desired, such as radiation sensors, batteries and solid oxide fuel cells.",Ultrafast palladium diffusion in germanium,10.1039/c4ta06210h
