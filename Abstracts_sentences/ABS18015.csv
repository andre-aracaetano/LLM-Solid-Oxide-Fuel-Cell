2,18015,"Here we present a bilayer electrolyte equivalent circuit model that does not assume continuity of the oxygen chemical potential at the electrolyte interface, in line with experimental results.",Insights into strontium zirconate-induced interface pressures in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233747
3,18015,We use the model to assess the assumption that strontium zirconate growth is responsible for oxygen electrode interface pressure increases and delamination.,Insights into strontium zirconate-induced interface pressures in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233747
4,18015,"We find that 5% Y-doped strontium zirconate does not drive fracture for accumulations up to 250 nm except at 800 degrees C and 1.6 V. With a low electronic conductivity, 5% La-doped strontium zirconate shows a region of stability where increased thickness actually stabilizes the interface pressure.",Insights into strontium zirconate-induced interface pressures in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233747
5,18015,We also highlight the importance of modeling interface stability with the proper electronic conductivity.,Insights into strontium zirconate-induced interface pressures in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233747
6,18015,"Finally, we present interface stability requirements and contextualize the strontium zirconate composition results in terms of interface stabilization strategies.",Insights into strontium zirconate-induced interface pressures in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233747
