1,20715,"Samarium-doped ceria (SDC) and gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) thin films were formed by e-beam vapor deposition on SiO2 substrate, changing the deposition rate and substrate temperature during the deposition.",Raman Study of Nanocrystalline-Doped Ceria Oxide Thin Films,10.3390/coatings10050432
2,20715,"X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-Ray spectrometry (EDS) were employed in order to investigate the structure ad morphology of the films.",Raman Study of Nanocrystalline-Doped Ceria Oxide Thin Films,10.3390/coatings10050432
3,20715,A single Raman peak describing the structure of undoped CeO2 was observed at a frequency of 466 cm(-1).,Raman Study of Nanocrystalline-Doped Ceria Oxide Thin Films,10.3390/coatings10050432
4,20715,Doping of cerium oxide with rare-earth elements shifted the peak to lower frequencies (for Sm-462 cm(-1)).,Raman Study of Nanocrystalline-Doped Ceria Oxide Thin Films,10.3390/coatings10050432
5,20715,This shift occurs due to the increased number of oxygen vacancies in doped cerium oxide and it depends on the size and concentration factor of the dopant.,Raman Study of Nanocrystalline-Doped Ceria Oxide Thin Films,10.3390/coatings10050432
6,20715,"It was found that wavenumbers and their intensity differed for the investigated samples, even though the peaks resembled each other in shape.",Raman Study of Nanocrystalline-Doped Ceria Oxide Thin Films,10.3390/coatings10050432
7,20715,The indicated bands for doped ceria originated as a result of the Raman regime (F2g) of fluorite dioxide associated with the space group (Fm3m).,Raman Study of Nanocrystalline-Doped Ceria Oxide Thin Films,10.3390/coatings10050432
8,20715,The observed peak's position shifting to a lower frequency range demonstrates the symmetric vibrations of oxygen ions around Ce4+ ions in octahedra CeO8.,Raman Study of Nanocrystalline-Doped Ceria Oxide Thin Films,10.3390/coatings10050432
9,20715,"Raman shift to the lower frequencies for the doped samples has two reasons: an increase in oxygen vacancies caused by doping cerium oxide with rare-earth materials and the size factor, i.e., the change in frequency Delta omega associated with the change in the lattice constant Delta a.",Raman Study of Nanocrystalline-Doped Ceria Oxide Thin Films,10.3390/coatings10050432
