1,8116,Three-dimensionally ordered macroporous cathode was fabricated for a zirconia based micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,A reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cell with three-dimensionally ordered macroporous cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.107
2,8116,"Three different cathodes (cathode A, no pore former; cathode B, with pore former (1.5 mu m in diameter); cathode C, with pore former (0.8 mu m in diameter)) were compared to investigate how the microstructure of it affected the cell performance at various operating temperatures.",A reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cell with three-dimensionally ordered macroporous cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.107
3,8116,"Micro-sized pores were well distributed within cathode B and C. The total porosity of cathode A is 35%, while it respectively reached 42 and 50% for cathodes B and C. At the same time, the specific surface area of them was 28.8 and 52.0% larger than that of the cathode A. As a result, the peak power density of the zirconia based cell, with cathode C, was 0.25 and 0.56 W cm(-2) at 550 and 600 degrees C, while the respective value was just 0.11 and 0.30 W cm(-2) for the cell with cathode A.",A reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cell with three-dimensionally ordered macroporous cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.107
4,8116,"Thus, optimizing microstructure of cathode should be one of the best approaches for lowering the operating temperature for SOFCs.",A reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cell with three-dimensionally ordered macroporous cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.107
