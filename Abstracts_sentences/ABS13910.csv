2,13910,"The powders, with various contents of calcium (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1), were prepared by means of thermal decomposition of organometallic precursors containing EDTA.","Some observations on the synthesis and electrolytic properties of (Ba1-xCax)(M0.9Y0.1)O3, M = Ce, Zr-based samples modified with calcium",10.1515/msp-2016-0022
3,13910,"All of the BaCeO3-based powders synthesised at 1100 degrees C were monophasic with a rhombohedral structure, however, completely cubic BaZrO3-based solid solutions were obtained at 1200 degrees C. A study of the sinterability of BaZr0.9Y0.1O3 and BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-based pellets was performed under non-isothermal conditions within a temperature range of 25 to 1200 degrees C.","Some observations on the synthesis and electrolytic properties of (Ba1-xCax)(M0.9Y0.1)O3, M = Ce, Zr-based samples modified with calcium",10.1515/msp-2016-0022
4,13910,"The partial substitution of barium for calcium in the (Ba1-xCax)(M0.9Y0.1)O-3, M = Ce, Zr solid solution improved the sinterability of the samples in comparison to the initial BaCe0.9Y0.1O3 or BaZr0.9Y0.1O3.","Some observations on the synthesis and electrolytic properties of (Ba1-xCax)(M0.9Y0.1)O3, M = Ce, Zr-based samples modified with calcium",10.1515/msp-2016-0022
5,13910,The relative density of calcium-modified BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-based samples reached approximately 95 to 97 % after sintering at 1500 degrees C for 2 h in air.,"Some observations on the synthesis and electrolytic properties of (Ba1-xCax)(M0.9Y0.1)O3, M = Ce, Zr-based samples modified with calcium",10.1515/msp-2016-0022
6,13910,"The same level of relative density was achieved after sintering calcium-modified BaZr0.9Y0.1O3 at 1600 degrees C for 2 h. Analysis of the electrical conductivity from both series of investigated materials showed that the highest ionic conductivity, in air and wet 5 % H-2 in Ar, was attained for the compositions of x = 0.02 to 0.05 (Ba1-xCax)(M0.9Y0.1)O-3, M = Zr, Ce.","Some observations on the synthesis and electrolytic properties of (Ba1-xCax)(M0.9Y0.1)O3, M = Ce, Zr-based samples modified with calcium",10.1515/msp-2016-0022
7,13910,"The oxygen reduction reaction on the interface Pt vertical bar BaM0.9Y0.1O3, M = Ce, Zr was investigated using Pt microelectrodes.","Some observations on the synthesis and electrolytic properties of (Ba1-xCax)(M0.9Y0.1)O3, M = Ce, Zr-based samples modified with calcium",10.1515/msp-2016-0022
