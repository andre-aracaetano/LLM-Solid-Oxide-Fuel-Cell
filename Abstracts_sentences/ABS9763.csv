1,9763,"Perovskite Sm0.5Sr0.5MnO3 (SSM55) material is prepared via the sol-gel method, and its crystal structure, chemical stability, thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), and electrical conductivity are characterized.",Sm0.5Sr0.5MnO3 as a potential cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.07.021
2,9763,"The electrochemical performance of a SSM55 cathode on 8 mol % Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (8YSZ) electrolyte is evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range between 650 and 800 degrees C, and compared to a La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM82) cathode.",Sm0.5Sr0.5MnO3 as a potential cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.07.021
3,9763,"The SSM55 is thermally stable at temperatures up to 1400 degrees C with a TEC of 10.7 x 10(-6) K-1 in the temperature range between 20 and 800 degrees C, and its electrical conductivity varies from 64 to 138 S cm(-1) between 300 and 800 degrees C.",Sm0.5Sr0.5MnO3 as a potential cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.07.021
4,9763,"The polarization resistance of SSM55 cathode on 8YSZ electrolyte is determined as 64.98,39.44, 8.67 and 1.92 Omega cm(2) at 650, 700,750 and 800 degrees C respectively, which is significantly lower than that of a LSM82 cathode at temperatures above 700 degrees C. To further increase the electrochemical performance of the cathode, SSM55-8YSZ composite cathode was obtained with a polarization resistance of 1.08 and 0.45 Omega cm(2) at 750 and 800 degrees C, respectively.",Sm0.5Sr0.5MnO3 as a potential cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.07.021
5,9763,"These values are considerably lower than that of a LSM82-8YSZ cathode, suggesting that the SSM55 is a promising cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells operated at 750 degrees C and above.",Sm0.5Sr0.5MnO3 as a potential cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.07.021
