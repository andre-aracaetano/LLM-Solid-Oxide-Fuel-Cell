3,18527,"Sometimes referred to as cracking, the standard approach for recovering hydrogen from ammonia relies on harsh reaction conditions that limit its suitability for low-carbon transitions.",Benchmarking plasma and electrolysis decomposition technologies for ammonia to power generation,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117166
4,18527,"This work investigates the technology development status and potential cost of plasma and electrolysis-based ammonia decomposition, benchmarks them with thermalchemical decomposition, and further compares them with direct ammonia-to-power solid oxide fuel cell systems.",Benchmarking plasma and electrolysis decomposition technologies for ammonia to power generation,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117166
5,18527,"Results suggest that in order to reach cost parity with cracking technologies, plasma-based decomposition must achieve one order of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency (to 10 kWh/kg or lower), while electrolysis decomposition must achieve enhanced durability using cheap electrolytes.",Benchmarking plasma and electrolysis decomposition technologies for ammonia to power generation,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117166
