1,17668,Microstructural refinement of Ni/Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (Ni/GDC20) anode by wet-infiltration of PdCl2 precursor was studied to further improve the anodic performance of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC).,Microstructural refinement of Ni/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell by wet infiltration loading of PdCl2,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.075
2,17668,"The effect of <1 wt% of Pd loadings on polarization resistance of Ni/GDC cermet anodes for H-2 oxidation reaction was examined using symmetric Ni-GDC20IGDC20IPt electrolyte-supported cells at 400-600 degrees C. Nanostructure evolution before and after H-2 reduction at 600 degrees C and also after anodic performance test revealed effectiveness of PdO loading content on the nanoparticles architecture, with Pdaas the sole Pd-phase after calcination at 600 degrees C with no residual chloride.",Microstructural refinement of Ni/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell by wet infiltration loading of PdCl2,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.075
3,17668,"In the process of H-2 reduction in high loading of PdO (0.26 mg/cm(2)), a nano-grained network of metallic palladium (Pd-0) containing nanopores structure, which resulted from 40% volume deoxidizing shrinkage of PdO, was developed on the anode surface.",Microstructural refinement of Ni/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell by wet infiltration loading of PdCl2,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.075

5,17668,"The significant decrease of anodic polarization resistance, e.g. similar to 100 times at 500 degrees C, on highly Pd-infiltrated anode was accompanied with <= 40 nm agglomerates in Pd-nanonetwork and 45% oxidizing of Pd to PdO in H-2 environment.",Microstructural refinement of Ni/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell by wet infiltration loading of PdCl2,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.075
6,17668,Detailed anodic impedance analysis and activation energy (E-a) evaluation can be denoted to a balance between the E-a of reaction-limiting step of charge transfer and the E-a of the facilitating step of diffusion/adsorption/dissociation of the arrived O2- species to triple phase boundaries (TPBs).,Microstructural refinement of Ni/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell by wet infiltration loading of PdCl2,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.075
