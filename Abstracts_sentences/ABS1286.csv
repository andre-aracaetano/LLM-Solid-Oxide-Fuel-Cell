1,1286,"This paper reports on integration of a supported thin film catalyst as a reformer, consisting of nano-scale ruthenium particles well dispersed in the ceria matrix, into the anode chamber of a ceria-electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Enabling catalysis of Ru-CeO2 for propane oxidation in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.072
2,1286,"Operation on the propane-air fuel mixture yields maximum power densities of 395 mW cm(-2), 280 mW cm(-2) and 160 mW cm(-2) at 500,450 and 400 degrees C, respectively.",Enabling catalysis of Ru-CeO2 for propane oxidation in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.072
3,1286,"In comparison, the output power densities drop to 298 mW cm(-2) at 500 degrees C and <10 mW cm(-2) at 450 degrees C in the absence of the catalyst layer.",Enabling catalysis of Ru-CeO2 for propane oxidation in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.072
4,1286,"The substantially enhanced performance can be explained by the high catalytic activity of the Ru-CeO2 layer for propane partial oxidation reactions, producing higher amount of hydrogen available for the fuel cell operation and thereby reducing the anodic polarization resistance.",Enabling catalysis of Ru-CeO2 for propane oxidation in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.072
