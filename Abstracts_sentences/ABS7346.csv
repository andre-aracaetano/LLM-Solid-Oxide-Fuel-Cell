1,7346,The paper studies the performance of the intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with the sputter deposited La-1-xSrxCoO3 (LSC) interlayer between the cathode and electrolyte.,The performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with sputter deposited La1-xSrxCoO3 interlayer,10.1007/s10832-021-00235-w
2,7346,"The sputter deposition of the LSC thin films is carried out in argon gas and in a mixture of argon and oxygen gases and then are annealed at 600, 800 and 1000 degrees C in air for 2 h. The structure and composition of the sputter deposited LSC films are investigated by the X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopies, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.",The performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with sputter deposited La1-xSrxCoO3 interlayer,10.1007/s10832-021-00235-w
3,7346,"The polarization resistance of the sputter deposited LSC films (600 nm thick) on the symmetric cells is 0.13, 0.45 and 2.48 Ohm center dot cm(2) measured at 800, 700 and 600 degrees C, respectively.",The performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with sputter deposited La1-xSrxCoO3 interlayer,10.1007/s10832-021-00235-w
4,7346,Measurements are performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.,The performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with sputter deposited La1-xSrxCoO3 interlayer,10.1007/s10832-021-00235-w
5,7346,"The maximum power density of the anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with the yttria-stabilized zirconia/gadolinia-doped ceria bilayer electrolyte, LSC interlayer, and LSC cathode is 2.27, 1.58 and 0.68 W/cm(2) measured at 800, 700 and 600 degrees C, respectively.",The performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with sputter deposited La1-xSrxCoO3 interlayer,10.1007/s10832-021-00235-w
6,7346,"These values of the power density are respectively 1.4, 1.6 and 2.3 times higher than that of the reference cell without the LSC interlayer.",The performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with sputter deposited La1-xSrxCoO3 interlayer,10.1007/s10832-021-00235-w
