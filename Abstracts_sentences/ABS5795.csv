2,5795,"The plated oxide layer was firmly adherent to the substrate, and its morphology was finely porous.",SYNTHESIS AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF AN OXIDE ELECTRODE LAYER PREPARED BY A NEW ELECTROLESS PLATING TECHNIQUE,
3,5795,The crystal phase of the oxide was determined by XRD to be a perovskite-type.,SYNTHESIS AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF AN OXIDE ELECTRODE LAYER PREPARED BY A NEW ELECTROLESS PLATING TECHNIQUE,
4,5795,The mechanism for the oxide layer formation by an oxide electroless plating was studied by means of ESCA.,SYNTHESIS AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF AN OXIDE ELECTRODE LAYER PREPARED BY A NEW ELECTROLESS PLATING TECHNIQUE,
5,5795,"As a cathode of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), the electrode characteristics of an oxide plated in this way were measured by the current interruption method at 1000-degrees-C. The cathodic overpotential of this electrode was less than 40 mV at 1 A cm-2.",SYNTHESIS AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF AN OXIDE ELECTRODE LAYER PREPARED BY A NEW ELECTROLESS PLATING TECHNIQUE,
6,5795,This small overvoltage was considered to be based on an effective large electrode reaction area.,SYNTHESIS AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF AN OXIDE ELECTRODE LAYER PREPARED BY A NEW ELECTROLESS PLATING TECHNIQUE,
