1,4238,The polarization resistances in solid oxide fuel cells are predicted using the cell combined micro- and macro-model; and the effect of the micro-/nano-structure of porous composite electrodes on the cell total polarization resistance is studied.,Minimization of polarization resistance in solid oxide fuel cells by proper design of micro-/nano-structure of porous composite electrodes,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.10.083
2,4238,"In this study, several anode-supported co-flow planar Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSM-YSZ cells with a range of micro-/nano-structures of electrodes are simulated; and the mean total polarization resistance and mean polarization resistances corresponding to the anode, cathode, electrolyte, and interconnect of these cells are predicted.",Minimization of polarization resistance in solid oxide fuel cells by proper design of micro-/nano-structure of porous composite electrodes,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.10.083
3,4238,The results reveal that there is an optimum value for most of the structural variables of porous composite electrodes at which the mean total polarization resistance of the cell is minimized.,Minimization of polarization resistance in solid oxide fuel cells by proper design of micro-/nano-structure of porous composite electrodes,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.10.083
