1,11687,"Catalysts of 2 wt % Pd supported on CeO2, Sm2O3, and CeO2/Sm2O3 (in a 4:1 molar ratio) were studied in detail by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping, both as-prepared and after undergoing one of three reduction pretreatments of increasing severity.","Pretreatment-Induced Nanostructural Evolution in CeO2-, Sm2O3-, and CeO2/Sm2O3-Supported Pd Catalysts for Intermediate-Temperature Methanol Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp8075194
2,11687,"The evolution in the nanostructure, composition, and disposition of the phases were studied in detail as a function of starting composition and of pretreatment conditions.","Pretreatment-Induced Nanostructural Evolution in CeO2-, Sm2O3-, and CeO2/Sm2O3-Supported Pd Catalysts for Intermediate-Temperature Methanol Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp8075194
3,11687,"The trends observed were compared with the trends in activity and selectivity of the catalysts for hydrogen generation front methanol fuel, with a view to their application in direct methanol intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.","Pretreatment-Induced Nanostructural Evolution in CeO2-, Sm2O3-, and CeO2/Sm2O3-Supported Pd Catalysts for Intermediate-Temperature Methanol Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp8075194
4,11687,The catalyst preparation conditions had a dramatic effect on the Sm-containing materials but not on the Pd/CeO2.,"Pretreatment-Induced Nanostructural Evolution in CeO2-, Sm2O3-, and CeO2/Sm2O3-Supported Pd Catalysts for Intermediate-Temperature Methanol Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp8075194
5,11687,"The Pd/CeO2/Sm2O3 catalyst was seen to develop a beneficial hierarchical structure in which Pd particles were supported on fine Sm2O3 crystallites, which were ill turn supported on larger CeO2 particles.","Pretreatment-Induced Nanostructural Evolution in CeO2-, Sm2O3-, and CeO2/Sm2O3-Supported Pd Catalysts for Intermediate-Temperature Methanol Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp8075194
