1,17596,"Because of the different densification characteristics of a La0.8Ca0.2Cr0.9Co0.1O3-delta (LCCC) interconnector and a NiO added yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode, complete adhesion between the two layers is hardly obtainable.",Adhesion behavior between yttrium-stabilized zirconia added La0.8Ca0.2Cr0.9Co0.1O3-δ interconnector and yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based substrate,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.059
2,17596,"In this study, we have investigated the sintering behavior of LCCC with the addition of YSZ.",Adhesion behavior between yttrium-stabilized zirconia added La0.8Ca0.2Cr0.9Co0.1O3-δ interconnector and yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based substrate,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.059
3,17596,"As the amount of YSZ increases, densification of the LCCC is inhibited and the initial temperature of the densification increases.",Adhesion behavior between yttrium-stabilized zirconia added La0.8Ca0.2Cr0.9Co0.1O3-δ interconnector and yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based substrate,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.059
4,17596,"However, when the LCCC-YSZ composite layer is screen printed on the NiO-YSZ substrates, the density of the composite layer increases and the layer is firmly attached to the substrates.",Adhesion behavior between yttrium-stabilized zirconia added La0.8Ca0.2Cr0.9Co0.1O3-δ interconnector and yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based substrate,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.059
5,17596,"It is proposed that tensile stress is decreased on the composite layer due to the relatively delayed densification of the LCCC-YSZ composite, compared to the densification of the NiO-YSZ substrate.",Adhesion behavior between yttrium-stabilized zirconia added La0.8Ca0.2Cr0.9Co0.1O3-δ interconnector and yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based substrate,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.04.059
