4,5370,The resulting films were studied by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry.,Formation of NiO/YSZ functional anode layers of solid oxide fuel cells by magnetron sputtering,10.1134/S1023193517060064
5,5370,"Comparative tests of planar SOFCs with a NiO/YSZ anode support, NiO/YSZ functional nanostructured anode layer, YSZ electrolyte, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 (LSCF/CGO) cathode were performed.",Formation of NiO/YSZ functional anode layers of solid oxide fuel cells by magnetron sputtering,10.1134/S1023193517060064
6,5370,"It was shown that the formation of a NiO/YSZ functional nanostructured anode leads to a 15-25% increase in the maximum power density of fuel cells in the working temperature range 500-800A degrees C. The NiO/YSZ nanostructured anode layers lead not only to a reduction of the polarization resistance of the anode, but also to the formation of denser electrolyte films during subsequent magnetron sputtering of electrolyte.",Formation of NiO/YSZ functional anode layers of solid oxide fuel cells by magnetron sputtering,10.1134/S1023193517060064
