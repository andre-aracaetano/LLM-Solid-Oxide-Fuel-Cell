2,11952,(BZY)-NiO composite powders with different BZY-NiO weight ratios were prepared by a combustion method as anodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ-NiO Composite Anodic Powders for Proton-Conducting SOFCs Prepared by a Combustion Method,10.1149/1.3591040
3,11952,"After heating to 1100 degrees C for 6 h, the composite powders were made of a well-dispersed mixture of two phases, BZY and NiO. Chemical stability tests showed that the BZY-NiO anodic powders had good stability against CO2, whereas comparative tests under the same conditions showed degradation for BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-delta NiO, which is at present the most used anode material for proton-conducting SOFCs.",BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ-NiO Composite Anodic Powders for Proton-Conducting SOFCs Prepared by a Combustion Method,10.1149/1.3591040
4,11952,Area specific resistance (ASR) measurements for BZY-NiO anodes showed that their electrochemical performance depended on the BZY-NiO weight ratio.,BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ-NiO Composite Anodic Powders for Proton-Conducting SOFCs Prepared by a Combustion Method,10.1149/1.3591040
5,11952,"The best performance was obtained for the anode containing 50 wt % BZY and 50 wt % NiO, which showed the smallest ASR values in the whole testing temperature range (0.37 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C).",BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ-NiO Composite Anodic Powders for Proton-Conducting SOFCs Prepared by a Combustion Method,10.1149/1.3591040
6,11952,"The 50 wt % BZY and 50 wt % NiO anode prepared by combustion also showed superior performance than that of the BZY-NiO anode conventionally made by a mechanical mixing route, as well as that of Pt.
