1,7793,"In this paper a novel process for the production of pure hydrogen from natural gas based on the integration of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOECs) is presented In this configuration the SOFC is fed by natural gas and provides electricity and heat to the SOEC which carries out the separation of steam into hydrogen and oxygen Depending on the system layout considered the oxygen available at the SOEC anode outlet can be either mixed with the SOFC cathode stream in order to improve the SOFC performance or regarded as a co product Two configurations of the cell stack are studied The first consists of a stack with the same number of SOFCs and SOECs working at the same current density In this case since in typical operating conditions the voltage delivered by the SOFC is lower than the one required by the SOEC, the required additional power is supplied by means of an electric grid connection In the second case the electricity balance is compensated by providing additional SOFCs to the stack which are fed by a supple mentary natural gas feed Simulations carried out with Aspen Plus show that pure hydrogen can be produced with a natural gas to hydrogen LHV efficiency that is about twice the value of a typical water electrolyzer and comparable to that of medium scale reformers (C) 2010 Professor T Nejat Veziroglu Published by Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved",A novel system for the production of pure hydrogen from natural gas based on solid oxide fuel cell-solid oxide electrolyzer,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.07.078
