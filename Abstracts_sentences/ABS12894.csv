1,12894,"In this study, La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM)-supported micro tubular solid oxide fuel cells (T-SOFCs) with two different configurations, one containing an LSGM-Ce0.6La0.4O2-delta (LDC) bi-layer electrolyte (Cell A) and one containing an LDC-LSGM-LDC tri-layer electrolyte (Cell B), were fabricated using extrusion and dip-coating.",Characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layer and tri-layer electrolytes,10.2109/jcersj2.16244
2,12894,"After optimizing the paste formulation for extrusion, the flexural strength of the dense and uniform LSGM micro-tubes sintered at 1500 degrees C was determined to be approximately 144 MPa.",Characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layer and tri-layer electrolytes,10.2109/jcersj2.16244
3,12894,"Owing to the insertion of an LDC layer between LSGM electrolyte and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-LSGM cathode, the ohmic resistances of Cell B were slightly larger than those of Cell A at the operating temperatures investigated, mainly because of interfacial resistance, but Cell B exhibited slightly lower polarization resistance than Cell A.",Characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layer and tri-layer electrolytes,10.2109/jcersj2.16244
4,12894,"The maximum power densities (MPDs) of Cell A were 0.25, 0.35, 0.43, and 0.47W cm(-2) at 650, 700, 750, and 800 degrees C, respectively, which are slightly larger than those of Cell B, i.e., 0.23, 0.33, 0.42, and 0.41W cm(-2), respectively, owing to the facts that Cell A exhibited a slightly higher open-circuit voltage and a smaller R-t value.",Characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layer and tri-layer electrolytes,10.2109/jcersj2.16244
5,12894,"Cell A containing the LSGM (288 mu m)-LDC (8 mu m) bilayer electrolyte can be operated at approximately 650 degrees C with an MPD value of approximately 0.25W cm(-2); however, a similarly structured single cell containing a Zr0.8Sc0.2O2-delta (ScSZ) (210 mu m) electrolyte need to be operated at 900 degrees C, and one containing an Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (GDC; 285 mu m)-ScSZ (8 mu m) bi-layer electrolyte has to be operated at 700 degrees",Characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layer and tri-layer electrolytes,10.2109/jcersj2.16244
