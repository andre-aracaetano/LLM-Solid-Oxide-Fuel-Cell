4,6148,Experimental tests (polarization curves and performance/efficiency maps) are run in different operating conditions in terms of fuel utilization and temperature in three gas composition scenarios.,Performance Evaluation of an Anode-Supported SOFC Short-Stack Operating with Different Fuel Blends as Stationary-CHP System,10.1149/1945-7111/ad4783
5,6148,"To assess the efficiency of the SOFC unit under the different feedstock operation, different formulations of stack and system efficiencies are proposed and analyzed, based on the boundary conditions considered for the input/output energy streams.",Performance Evaluation of an Anode-Supported SOFC Short-Stack Operating with Different Fuel Blends as Stationary-CHP System,10.1149/1945-7111/ad4783
6,6148,"Experimental results were key to evaluate the different efficiency definitions proposed; albeit the highest voltage/power is obtained with the 100% H2 scenario, the efficiency may be higher with 100% NG and blend scenarios, due to the lower energy content of the input fuel.",Performance Evaluation of an Anode-Supported SOFC Short-Stack Operating with Different Fuel Blends as Stationary-CHP System,10.1149/1945-7111/ad4783
