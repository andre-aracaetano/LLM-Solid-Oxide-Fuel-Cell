2,12981,The SOFC half-cells with and without GDC interlayer were prepared and tested under 400 rapid current load cycles.,Effect of GDC interlayer on the degradation of solid oxide fuel cell cathode during accelerated current load cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.022
3,12981,"The half-cells consisted of lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF)-GDC composite cathode, GDC interlayer, scandia ceria stabilized zirconia (ScCeSZ) electrolyte, and platinum anode as a counter electrode.",Effect of GDC interlayer on the degradation of solid oxide fuel cell cathode during accelerated current load cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.022
4,12981,The area specific resistance (ASR) of the half-cell was measured every 10 current load cycles.,Effect of GDC interlayer on the degradation of solid oxide fuel cell cathode during accelerated current load cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.022
5,12981,"The ASR of the half-cell without GDC interlayer greatly increased with current load cycling, which is attributed to the delamination of the cathode/electrolyte interface due to SrZrO3 formation during sintering.",Effect of GDC interlayer on the degradation of solid oxide fuel cell cathode during accelerated current load cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.022
6,12981,"On the other hand, the half-cell with GDC interlayer showed a minute increase in ASR during current load cycling due to very small elemental diffusion across the GDC interlayer/electrolyte interface.",Effect of GDC interlayer on the degradation of solid oxide fuel cell cathode during accelerated current load cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.022
7,12981,These results mean that the GDC interlayer produced high resistance to cathode degradation under the current load cycling due to effective suppression of Sr diffusion across the interface.,Effect of GDC interlayer on the degradation of solid oxide fuel cell cathode during accelerated current load cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.022
