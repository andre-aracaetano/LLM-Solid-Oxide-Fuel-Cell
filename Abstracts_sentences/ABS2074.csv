1,2074,An analytical method to determine the electrochemical energy efficiencies of electrolytes with partial electronic conduction has been developed previously and reported in the literature.,Modified Energy Efficiencies of Proton-conducting SOFCs with Partial Conductions of Oxide-ions and Holes,10.1002/fuce.201800181
2,2074,"However, this analytical method does not address the effects of differing ionic species in electrolytes, i.e., the oxide-ions or protons.",Modified Energy Efficiencies of Proton-conducting SOFCs with Partial Conductions of Oxide-ions and Holes,10.1002/fuce.201800181
3,2074,"Therefore, we aimed to modify this analytical method to account for the effects of differing ionic species, and applied it to compare the energy efficiencies of oxide-ion conducting solid electrolytes such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) to proton-conducting solid electrolytes, such as yttria-doped barium zirconate (BZY).",Modified Energy Efficiencies of Proton-conducting SOFCs with Partial Conductions of Oxide-ions and Holes,10.1002/fuce.201800181
4,2074,"With the modification, difference in the influence of the fuel consumption between the oxide-ion conducting electrolyte and the proton-conducting electrolyte has been successfully taken into account.",Modified Energy Efficiencies of Proton-conducting SOFCs with Partial Conductions of Oxide-ions and Holes,10.1002/fuce.201800181
5,2074,The energy efficiency of the BZY electrolyte relatively increased against those of YSZ or GDC electrolytes by the modification.,Modified Energy Efficiencies of Proton-conducting SOFCs with Partial Conductions of Oxide-ions and Holes,10.1002/fuce.201800181
6,2074,"Additionally, partial oxide-ion conduction in the proton-conducting electrolyte was successfully estimated using the modified analytical method.",Modified Energy Efficiencies of Proton-conducting SOFCs with Partial Conductions of Oxide-ions and Holes,10.1002/fuce.201800181
