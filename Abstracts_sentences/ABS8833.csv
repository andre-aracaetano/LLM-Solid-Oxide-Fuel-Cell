1,8833,In-situ exsolution type perovskites as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFCs) anode materials have received widespread attention because of their excellent catalytic activity.,B-Site Super-Excess Design Sr2V0.4Fe0.9Mo0.7O6-δ-Ni0.4 as a Highly Active and Redox-Stable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode,10.1021/acsami.3c11271
2,8833,"In this study, excessive NiO is introduced to the Sr2V0.4Fe0.9Mo0.7O6-delta (SVFMO) perovskite with the B-site excess design, and in-situ growth of FeNi3 alloy nanoparticles is induced in the reducing atmosphere to form the Sr2V0.4Fe0.9Mo0.7O6-delta-Ni-0.4 (SVFMO-Ni-0.4) composite anode.",B-Site Super-Excess Design Sr2V0.4Fe0.9Mo0.7O6-δ-Ni0.4 as a Highly Active and Redox-Stable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode,10.1021/acsami.3c11271
3,8833,"Here, with H-2 or CH4 as SOFCs fuel gas, the formation of FeNi3 nanoparticles further enhances the catalytic ability.",B-Site Super-Excess Design Sr2V0.4Fe0.9Mo0.7O6-δ-Ni0.4 as a Highly Active and Redox-Stable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode,10.1021/acsami.3c11271
4,8833,"Compared with SVFMO, the maximum power density (P-max) of Sr2V0.4Fe0.9Mo0.7O6-delta-Ni-0.4 (SVFMO-Ni-0.4) increases from 538 to 828 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C with hydrogen as the fuel gas, and the total polarization resistance (R-P) decreases from 0.23 to 0.17 Omega cm(2).",B-Site Super-Excess Design Sr2V0.4Fe0.9Mo0.7O6-δ-Ni0.4 as a Highly Active and Redox-Stable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode,10.1021/acsami.3c11271
5,8833,"In addition, the long-term operational stability of the SVFMO-Ni-0.4 anode shows no apparent performance degradation for more than 300 h. Compared with SVFMO, the P-max of SVFMO-Ni-0.4 increases from 138 to 464 mW cm(-2) with methane as fuel gas, and the R-P decreases from 1.21 to 0.29 Omega cm(2).",B-Site Super-Excess Design Sr2V0.4Fe0.9Mo0.7O6-δ-Ni0.4 as a Highly Active and Redox-Stable Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode,10.1021/acsami.3c11271
