3,13133,"The model shows that the percolated TPB lengths of a composite electrode consisting of poly-dispersed particle sizes for both materials (i.e., having a normal distribution with a non-dimensional standard deviation of 0.4) are about 32% lower than that of the composite electrode with mono-sized particles.",Percolation micro-model to predict the effective properties of the composite electrode with poly-dispersed particle sizes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.107
4,13133,And the higher percolated TPB lengths can be achieved by reducing the mean particle size of each material and narrowing the particle size distribution.,Percolation micro-model to predict the effective properties of the composite electrode with poly-dispersed particle sizes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.107

6,13133,"The model also shows that the composite electrode with large mean particle size radii ratio between the electrode- and electrolyte-materials and broad particle size distributions can not only provide higher inter-particle ion conductivity, but also reduce the percolation volume fraction threshold of the electrode-material.",Percolation micro-model to predict the effective properties of the composite electrode with poly-dispersed particle sizes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.107
7,13133,And this may be helpful for a composite anode to obtain a higher overall ion conductivity.,Percolation micro-model to predict the effective properties of the composite electrode with poly-dispersed particle sizes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.107
