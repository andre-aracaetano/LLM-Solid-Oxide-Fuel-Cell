1,15161,"We investigate the influence of position, under large circular sputtering targets, on the final electrochemical performance of 35 mm diameter button solid oxide fuel cells with sputter-deposited Gadolinium doped Ceria barrier layers, positioned in order to almost cover the entirety of the area associated with a 120 x 80 mm(2) industrial cell.","Large Area Deposition by Radio Frequency Sputtering of Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Buffer Layers in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Structural, Morphological and Electrochemical Investigation",10.3390/ma14195826
2,15161,"We compare the results obtained via structural and morphological analysis to the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements performed on the button cells, disentangling the role of different parameters.","Large Area Deposition by Radio Frequency Sputtering of Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Buffer Layers in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Structural, Morphological and Electrochemical Investigation",10.3390/ma14195826
3,15161,"The Atomic Force Microscopy analysis makes it possible to observe a decrease in the roughness values from the peripheral to the central zones under the sputtering target, with peak-to-valley roughness values, respectively, decreasing from 380 nm to 300 nm, while Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy show a dependence of the layer coverage from the position.","Large Area Deposition by Radio Frequency Sputtering of Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Buffer Layers in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Structural, Morphological and Electrochemical Investigation",10.3390/ma14195826
4,15161,"The electrochemical performances of button cells with buffer layers of only 200 nm in thickness, and with negligible thickness gradients across them, show current density values of up to 478 mA/cm(2) at 0.8 V and 650 degrees C, with an improvement of more than 67% with respect to button cells with standard (screen printed) buffer layers.","Large Area Deposition by Radio Frequency Sputtering of Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Buffer Layers in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Structural, Morphological and Electrochemical Investigation",10.3390/ma14195826
5,15161,These results point out the major influence exerted by parameters such as the thickness gradient and the coverage of the sputtered buffer layers in determining the final electrochemical performances.,"Large Area Deposition by Radio Frequency Sputtering of Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Buffer Layers in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Structural, Morphological and Electrochemical Investigation",10.3390/ma14195826
