1,14729,Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies reveal that the crystal structure and microstructure of GdBaCo2O5+delta are highly influenced by the oxygen stoichiometry.,"New insights into the GdBaCo2O5+δ material: Crystal structure, electrical and electrochemical properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.019
2,14729,"In addition to layered-type ordering of the Ba and Gd atoms along the c-direction of the structure and location of anion vacancies within the (GdO)x planes giving a a(p) x a(p) x 2a(p) unit cell, two different perovskite related superstructures are observed.","New insights into the GdBaCo2O5+δ material: Crystal structure, electrical and electrochemical properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.019
3,14729,"A superstructure with a(p) x 3a(p) x 2a(p) unit cell, probably due to extra ordering of the anion vacancies within the (GdO)(x) planes is formed for 6 values close to 033 and a superstructure with root 2a(p) x root 2b(p) x 2a(p) unit cell associated to tilting of the CoO6 octahedra appears for the compound with 6 values close to 1.","New insights into the GdBaCo2O5+δ material: Crystal structure, electrical and electrochemical properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.019
