1,16756,"Ba0.5Sr0.5[CoxZn0.2-x]Fe0.8O3-delta, (x = 0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12) cathode formulations were successfully synthesized by solid state reactions and the effect of cobalt doping at Zn site of Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (BSZF0.2) on the electrical conductivity, the polarization resistance and electrochemical behavior was evaluated.","Synthesis and evaluation of thermal, electrical, and electrochemical properties of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.04Zn0.16Fe0.8O3-δ as a novel cathode material for IT-SOFC applications",10.1007/s11581-012-0692-1
2,16756,X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that a single cubic perovskite phase of Ba0.5Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta oxide is successfully obtained.,"Synthesis and evaluation of thermal, electrical, and electrochemical properties of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.04Zn0.16Fe0.8O3-δ as a novel cathode material for IT-SOFC applications",10.1007/s11581-012-0692-1
3,16756,Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.04Zn0.16Fe0.8O3-delta (BSCZF0.16) exhibited a high electrical conductivity of 10 S/cm at 400 A degrees C in comparison to the BSZF0.2 showing 5.5 S/cm.,"Synthesis and evaluation of thermal, electrical, and electrochemical properties of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.04Zn0.16Fe0.8O3-δ as a novel cathode material for IT-SOFC applications",10.1007/s11581-012-0692-1
4,16756,"Further, BSCZF0.16 also possess a low polarization resistance as low as 0.22, 0.38, 0.87, and 1.55 Omega cm(2) at 750, 700, 650, and 600 A degrees C in air, respectively.","Synthesis and evaluation of thermal, electrical, and electrochemical properties of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.04Zn0.16Fe0.8O3-δ as a novel cathode material for IT-SOFC applications",10.1007/s11581-012-0692-1
5,16756,"Accordingly, a low activation energy value of 149.8 kJ/mol for BSCZF0.16 in comparison to 159.4 kJ/mol for BSZF0.2 indicates high catalytic efficiency.","Synthesis and evaluation of thermal, electrical, and electrochemical properties of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.04Zn0.16Fe0.8O3-δ as a novel cathode material for IT-SOFC applications",10.1007/s11581-012-0692-1
6,16756,Enhancement of desirable properties such as electrical conductivity in combination with low-polarization resistance and low-activation energy values can be attributed to the coexistence of Co and Zn in the B-site of BSCZF0.16 leading to the multivalent states which contributes to the enhanced electron transport properties demonstrating BSCZF0.16 as a better cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells applications.,"Synthesis and evaluation of thermal, electrical, and electrochemical properties of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.04Zn0.16Fe0.8O3-δ as a novel cathode material for IT-SOFC applications",10.1007/s11581-012-0692-1
