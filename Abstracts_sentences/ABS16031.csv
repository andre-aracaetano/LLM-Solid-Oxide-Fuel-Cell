1,16031,"Low-operating-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) with various kinds of fuel, such as hydrocarbons, biogas, natural gas, and oxygenated fuel has been an active SOFC research topic.",Improved electrochemical performance and durability of butane-operating low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell through palladium infiltration,10.1002/er.5547
2,16031,"However, conventional SOFC anodes comprised of nickel metal and yttria-stabilized zirconia composite (Ni-YSZ) experience rapid degradation when operated for the butane direct internal steam reforming (B-DISR), especially at a low temperature (LT) range.",Improved electrochemical performance and durability of butane-operating low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell through palladium infiltration,10.1002/er.5547
3,16031,"This study reveals that the impregnated Pd into the Ni-YSZ anode support of thin-film SOFCs (TF-SOFCs) is effective for achieving better performance and stability regarding the TF-SOFC in B-DISR at 600 degrees C. Adding Pd as a dopant into Ni-YSZ significantly promotes the catalytic activity due to the Pd-Ni alloy formation, both on the YSZ grain and the Ni grain surface.",Improved electrochemical performance and durability of butane-operating low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell through palladium infiltration,10.1002/er.5547
4,16031,The electrochemical performance of cells without Pd (Ni-YSZ cell) and a Pd-infiltrated Ni-YSZ anode (Pd-Ni-YSZ cell) are compared at 600 degrees C for the B-DISR mode at a ratio of steam-to-carbon of 3.,Improved electrochemical performance and durability of butane-operating low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell through palladium infiltration,10.1002/er.5547
5,16031,"Finally, long-term durability tests were performed at 600 degrees C and under 0.15 A cm(-2).",Improved electrochemical performance and durability of butane-operating low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell through palladium infiltration,10.1002/er.5547
6,16031,"The Pd infiltration decreases the deterioration rate to 0.63 mV h(-1)after the first 80 hours of operation for the Pd-Ni-YSZ cell, which was a significant improvement from that of the Ni-YSZ cell, 3.75 mV h(-1)after 40 hours of operation.",Improved electrochemical performance and durability of butane-operating low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell through palladium infiltration,10.1002/er.5547
