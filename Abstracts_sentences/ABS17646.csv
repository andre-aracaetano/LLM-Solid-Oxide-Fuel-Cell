1,17646,Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is a kind of electrolyte materials widely used for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Preparation and study of YSZ electrolyte doped with multi-elements by combustion synthesis with glycin,
2,17646,"Some rare earth elements (Dy3+, Yb3+, Sc3+, etc), which have similar radii to Zr4+, can dissolve into ZrO2, and result in oxygen vacancy and crystal lattice distortion, so enhance its conductivity and lower the activation energy.",Preparation and study of YSZ electrolyte doped with multi-elements by combustion synthesis with glycin,
3,17646,YSZ electrolyte doped with Sc3+ (Dy3+) and Yb3+ were prepared by combustion synthesis.,Preparation and study of YSZ electrolyte doped with multi-elements by combustion synthesis with glycin,
4,17646,"The conductivity is enhanced due to the distortions of crystal lattice and the increase in oxygen transfer passage radii, reaching 0.15 S-cm(-1) at 1000 degrees C. Crystalline symmetry of ZrO2 changed from monoclinic to tetragonal, and then to cubic, with the elevation of calcining temperature.",Preparation and study of YSZ electrolyte doped with multi-elements by combustion synthesis with glycin,
5,17646,SEM photographs show the complex additives promoted growth of ZrO2.,Preparation and study of YSZ electrolyte doped with multi-elements by combustion synthesis with glycin,
6,17646,"There are some second phases along the grain boundaries, which restricted the further increase of conductivity.",Preparation and study of YSZ electrolyte doped with multi-elements by combustion synthesis with glycin,
7,17646,"The addition of Al3+ or Ca2+ improve grain boundary, but lower the high-temperature conductivity.",Preparation and study of YSZ electrolyte doped with multi-elements by combustion synthesis with glycin,
