1,12703,A thermo-fluid reacting numerical model for the multiphysics process in the planar proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is presented.,Multi-physics simulation of transport phenomena in planar proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228997
2,12703,"A non-dimensional formulation of the governing equations is derived aimed to specify the dimensionless quantities that influence the power generation in SOFC, those being the Sherwood, Peclet, Reynolds, Darcy, Butler-Volmer, the first Damkohler, and the third Damkohler numbers.",Multi-physics simulation of transport phenomena in planar proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228997
3,12703,The model is implemented in an in-house computational code and shown to be in adequate agreement with experimental data from the literature to verify the efficacy of the model.,Multi-physics simulation of transport phenomena in planar proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228997
4,12703,A parametric study is subsequently conducted to understand the effect of porous electrodes parameters on the performance of SOFC.,Multi-physics simulation of transport phenomena in planar proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228997
5,12703,It is found that decreasing the Darcy and increasing Sherwood and Reynolds numbers results in a depletion of gas species in the electrochemically active area of the cell and thus a reduction in the electrical current generation.,Multi-physics simulation of transport phenomena in planar proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228997
6,12703,"In addition, a high Peclet and the third Damkoler numbers increase SOFC operating temperature, leading to an improvement in the cell power density.",Multi-physics simulation of transport phenomena in planar proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228997
