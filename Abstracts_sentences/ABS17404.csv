1,17404,"The nanomechanical characteristics and fracture behaviors of the Ba1-xKxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-delta (K-doped BCZY, 0.0 <= x <= 0.15) oxides were investigated by using nanoindentation techniques.",Nanomechanical Properties and Fracture Behaviors of Ba1-xKxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-δ Electrolytes by Nanoindentation,10.1166/sam.2014.1941
2,17404,"The BKCZY samples were prepared by the citrate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complexing sol-gel process, followed by uniaxial pressure pressing and sintering at 1600 degrees C for 4 h. The XRD results indicated that the BKCZY samples occurred predominantly in perovskite-type cubic structures.",Nanomechanical Properties and Fracture Behaviors of Ba1-xKxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-δ Electrolytes by Nanoindentation,10.1166/sam.2014.1941
3,17404,The hardness and Young's modulus of BKCZY samples were measured by a Berkovich nanoindenter operated in continuous contact stiffness measurements (CSM) mode.,Nanomechanical Properties and Fracture Behaviors of Ba1-xKxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-δ Electrolytes by Nanoindentation,10.1166/sam.2014.1941
4,17404,"Results indicated that the hardness and Young's modulus of BKCZY sample decreased substantially with increasing the K doping concentration, presumably due to doping-enhanced grain growth.",Nanomechanical Properties and Fracture Behaviors of Ba1-xKxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-δ Electrolytes by Nanoindentation,10.1166/sam.2014.1941
5,17404,"Furthermore, the SEM observations indicated that Berkovich nanoindentation-induced fracture mode was mostly transgranular and the fracture toughness exhibited a similar doping dependence as that of the hardness and Young's modulus.",Nanomechanical Properties and Fracture Behaviors of Ba1-xKxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-δ Electrolytes by Nanoindentation,10.1166/sam.2014.1941
