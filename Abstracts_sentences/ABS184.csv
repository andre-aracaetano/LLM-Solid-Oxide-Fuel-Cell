1,184,"Planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) incorporating a single ceria electrolyte element, doubly doped with gadolinium and praseodymium were fabricated, and tested at 700 degrees C. Two fuel cell configurations were investigated, platinum/ceria/platinum and platinum/ceria/perovskite.",Solid oxide fuel cells of ceria doped with gadolinium and praseodymium,10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00530-4
