5,14859,The reason for this adverse result was analyzed and the microstructural analyses showed a thick white gas-tight film at the interface between the zirconia (electrolyte) and LSM-YSZ (cathode).,Interface reactions during co-firing of solid oxide fuel cell components,10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2003.11.025
6,14859,This white layer starts forming at similar to1300 degreesC and becomes thicker and thicker as the sintering temperature increases.,Interface reactions during co-firing of solid oxide fuel cell components,10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2003.11.025
