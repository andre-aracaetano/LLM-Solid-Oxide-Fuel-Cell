1,11350,"It is promising for metal especially ferritic stainless steel (FSS) to he used as interconnector when the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is operated at temperature lower than 800 degrees C. However, there are many challenges for FSS such as anti-oxidant, poisoning to cathode and high area specific resistance (ASR) when using as SOFC interconnector.","Oxidation resistance, thermal expansion and area specific resistance of Fe-Cr alloy interconnector for solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/S1006-706X(17)30011-0
