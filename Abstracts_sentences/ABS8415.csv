1,8415,"Reducing the working temperature of solid oxide fuel cells is critical to their increased commercialization but is inhibited by the slow oxygen exchange kinetics at the cathode, which limits the overall rate of the oxygen reduction reaction.",Factors controlling surface oxygen exchange in oxides,10.1038/s41467-019-08674-4
2,8415,"We use ab initio methods to develop a quantitative elementary reaction model of oxygen exchange in a representative cathode material, La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta, and predict that under operating conditions the rate-limiting step for oxygen incorporation from O-2 gas on the stable, (001)-SrO surface is lateral (surface) diffusion of O-adatoms and oxygen surface vacancies.",Factors controlling surface oxygen exchange in oxides,10.1038/s41467-019-08674-4
3,8415,"We predict that a high vacancy concentration on the metastable CoO2 termination enables a vacancy-assisted O-2 dissociation that is 10(2)-10(3) times faster than the rate limiting step on the Sr-rich (La,Sr)O termination.",Factors controlling surface oxygen exchange in oxides,10.1038/s41467-019-08674-4
4,8415,"This result implies that dramatically enhanced oxygen exchange performance could potentially be obtained by suppressing the (La,Sr)O termination and stabilizing highly active CoO2 termination.",Factors controlling surface oxygen exchange in oxides,10.1038/s41467-019-08674-4
