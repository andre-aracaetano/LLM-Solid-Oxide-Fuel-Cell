4,6402,The findings of this study show that a decrease in temperature not only leads to thinner oxide scales and less Cr vaporization but also to a significant change in the chemical composition of the oxide scale.,Co- and Ce/Co-coated ferritic stainless steel as interconnect material for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.045
5,6402,"Very low ASR values (below 10 m Omega cm(2)) were measured for both Co- and Ce/Co-coated steel at 650 and 750 degrees C, indicating that the observed change in the chemical composition of the Co spinel does not have any noticeable influence on the ASR.",Co- and Ce/Co-coated ferritic stainless steel as interconnect material for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.045
6,6402,"Instead it is suggested that the Cr2O3 scale is expected to be the main contributor to the ASR, even at temperatures as low as 650 degrees C.
