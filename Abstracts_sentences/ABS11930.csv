1,11930,A La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM) thin film was fabricated by the usual tape casting method using a doctor blade to reduce the operating temperature in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 electrolyte film,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01026-6
2,11930,The resultant LSGM film was 130 3 pm in thickness and its relative density was over 99%.,Performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 electrolyte film,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01026-6
3,11930,"Also, the thin LSGM film showed a single phase, and its conductivity was 0.113 S/cm at 800 degreesC and 0.054 S/cm at 700 degreesC, respectively.",Performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 electrolyte film,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01026-6
4,11930,"Therefore, it seemed that the thin LSGM film was suitable as an electrolyte for intermediate temperature operating SOFCs.",Performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 electrolyte film,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01026-6
5,11930,"Ni-SDC and La(Sr)CoO3 synthesized by spray pyrolysis were used as an anode and a cathode, respectively, and a single cell was fabricated with the thin LSGM film as an electrolyte.",Performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 electrolyte film,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01026-6
6,11930,"This single cell with the thin LSGM electrolyte exhibited excellent electrical performance, of which power density was over 0.7 W/cm(2) at 800 degreesC and 0.4 W/cm(2) at 700 degreesC. These results suggested that the LSGM-bused SOFCs with the thin LSGM film in this study would exhibit adequate performance at a temperature lower than 700 degreesC.
