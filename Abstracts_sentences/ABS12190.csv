1,12190,Thin films of La and Si with Si/(La + Si) atomic ratios ranging from 036 to 0.44 were produced by magnetron sputtering in pure Ar.,Lanthanum silicate thin films for SOFC electrolytes synthesized by magnetron sputtering and subsequent annealing,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.01.042
2,12190,"For all compositions, the apatite-like La9.33Si6O26 phase was formed during annealing in air at 900 degrees C. A preferential orientation was developed during annealing of the films with higher silicon content while formation of oxide impurities was detected for the films with less silicon.",Lanthanum silicate thin films for SOFC electrolytes synthesized by magnetron sputtering and subsequent annealing,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.01.042
3,12190,Silicon segregation to the thin film/substrate interface was observed after annealing for thin films with higher Si/(La + Si) atomic ratios.,Lanthanum silicate thin films for SOFC electrolytes synthesized by magnetron sputtering and subsequent annealing,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.01.042
4,12190,The higher ionic conductivity values were obtained with the films with lower silicon content (2.81 x 10(-3) Scm(-1) at 800 degrees C for the film with Si/(La + Si) atomic ratio of 0.36).,Lanthanum silicate thin films for SOFC electrolytes synthesized by magnetron sputtering and subsequent annealing,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.01.042
