1,10684,YSZ-MgO composite electrolytes were prepared by mixing partially stabilized zirconia with various amounts of magnesium oxide and firing at 1400 degreesC for 5 h. From X-ray diffraction (XRD) and dilatometry it was observed that 15-20 mol% MgO was dissolved in the zirconia leading to composites composed of fully stabilized zirconia and magnesia.,YSZ-MgO composite electrolyte with adjusted thermal expansion coefficient to other SOFC components,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.08.019
2,10684,The thermal expansion increased with increasing MgO content and a thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of 12.3 x 10(-6) K-1 was obtained with 80 mol% MgO in the starting mixture.,YSZ-MgO composite electrolyte with adjusted thermal expansion coefficient to other SOFC components,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.08.019
3,10684,"The thermal expansion fits very well with those of interconnect and electrode materials in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) but the YSZ-MgO composite already contains high amounts of MgO, which percolatively inhibits the conductivity.",YSZ-MgO composite electrolyte with adjusted thermal expansion coefficient to other SOFC components,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.08.019
4,10684,Highest total conductivity at 800 degreesC of 0.015 S cm(-1) was measured on a composite with 20 mol% MgO in the starting mixture which is similar to values of fully yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).,YSZ-MgO composite electrolyte with adjusted thermal expansion coefficient to other SOFC components,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.08.019
