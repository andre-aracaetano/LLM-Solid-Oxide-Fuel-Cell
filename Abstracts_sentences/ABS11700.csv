2,11700,Two types of the SOFCs are manufactured and their cell performances are characterized via the detail analysis of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).,Characterization of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Composite LSM-YSZ and LSM-GDC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3527985
3,11700,"The maximum power densities are 411 and 289 mW/cm(2) for the high and low performance cells at 800 degrees C, respectively.",Characterization of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Composite LSM-YSZ and LSM-GDC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3527985
4,11700,"According to the EIS analysis, the electrochemical performance of the poor cell is dominated by the anodic noncharge-transfer resistance, which is mainly resulted by the gas diffusion polarization due to the low porosity of the anode.",Characterization of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Composite LSM-YSZ and LSM-GDC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3527985
5,11700,"The high performance cell is controlled by the simultaneous contributions of the ohmic resistance (Ro), the anodic polarization (R-AP), and the cathodic polarization (R-CP) at the operation temperature of 800 degrees C.",Characterization of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Composite LSM-YSZ and LSM-GDC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3527985
6,11700,"However, the R-CP will dominate the performance of the cell as the temperature is lowered down to 700 degrees C. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.",Characterization of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Composite LSM-YSZ and LSM-GDC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3527985
