2,16270,"The structure, morphology and growth rate of the layers deposited on silicon substrates were studied as a function of deposition temperature.",CO3O4 protective coatings prepared by Pulsed Injection Metal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition,10.1016/j.tsf.2004.07.081
3,16270,"Pure Co3O4 spinel structure was found for deposition temperatures ranging from 360 to 540 degreesC. The optimum experimental parameters to prepare dense layers with a high growth rate were determined and used to prepare corrosion protective coatings for Fe-22Cr metallic interconnects, to be used in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells.",CO3O4 protective coatings prepared by Pulsed Injection Metal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition,10.1016/j.tsf.2004.07.081
