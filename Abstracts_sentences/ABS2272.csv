2,2272,"Here, we report the investigation of the HDCFC with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, NiO-YSZ anode and lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) cathode using the eutectic mixture of 62 mol% Li(2)CO(3) and 38 mol% K(2)CO(3).",Catalysis and oxidation of carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.066
3,2272,An open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.71 V at 800 degrees C is recorded without the carbonate which increases to 1.15-1.23V in the presence of the carbonate at the same temperature.,Catalysis and oxidation of carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.066
4,2272,"In addition, the cell's OCV is enhanced not only by the thermal history but also by the carbonate, which is in excess of 1.57 V after the high temperature treatment.",Catalysis and oxidation of carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.066
