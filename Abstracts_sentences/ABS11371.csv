1,11371,The system of chromia-forming alloy/Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM) electrode/3 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 (TZ3Y) electrolyte has been investigated at 900 degrees C in air under cathodic polarization conditions.,Deposition of chromium species on Sr-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1388-2481(99)00080-6
2,11371,"Deposition of chromium species was found to occur preferentially at the TZ3Y electrolyte surface, forming a deposit ring around the edge of the LSM electrode coating.",Deposition of chromium species on Sr-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1388-2481(99)00080-6
3,11371,The width of the ring was about 60 mu m for an LSM electrode polarized for about 50 h. Overpotential (eta) increases with polarization time.,Deposition of chromium species on Sr-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1388-2481(99)00080-6
4,11371,In contrast to eta electrode interface resistance (R-E) measured under open circuit conditions decreases initially after passing the current and remains almost constant with polarization.,Deposition of chromium species on Sr-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1388-2481(99)00080-6
5,11371,The results indicate that the deposition process of chromium species may not be dominated by electrochemical reduction processes in competition with O-2 reduction at an early stage of polarization.,Deposition of chromium species on Sr-doped LaMnO3 cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1388-2481(99)00080-6
