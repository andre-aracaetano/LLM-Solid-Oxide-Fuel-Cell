1,9351,An anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with lanthanum-doped ceria (LDC) and strontium and magnesium doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM) bilayer electrolytes was fabricated and tested.,A high-performance anode-supported SOFC with LDC-LSGM bilayer electrolytes,10.1149/1.1667016
2,9351,"The bilayer electrolyte thin film, consisting of a 25 mum thick LDC layer and a 75 mum thick LSGM layer, was prepared by a simple dry-pressing process.",A high-performance anode-supported SOFC with LDC-LSGM bilayer electrolytes,10.1149/1.1667016
3,9351,"The two electrolyte layers were sintered together well, and no crack and peel-off at the interface were observed.",A high-performance anode-supported SOFC with LDC-LSGM bilayer electrolytes,10.1149/1.1667016
4,9351,"An open-circuit potential of 1.02 V and a maximum power density of over 1.1 W/cm(2) was achieved with H-2 as fuel and air as oxidant at 800degreesC. The results show that the reactions between LSGM and anode materials were restrained by the LDC electrolyte layer, whereas the electronic conductivity of ceria-based electrolyte was blocked by the LSGM electrolyte layer.",A high-performance anode-supported SOFC with LDC-LSGM bilayer electrolytes,10.1149/1.1667016
