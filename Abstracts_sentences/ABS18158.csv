1,18158,"In situ vibrational Raman scattering has been employed to examine rates of carbon formation and removal from Ni/YSZ cermet anodes in functioning, electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
2,18158,"Specifically, Raman scattering characterized the ability of different gas phase species commonly used as reforming agents to remove carbon that had accumulated on Ni/YSZ cermet anodes at 730 degrees C. Anodes held at open circuit voltage (OCV) were exposed first to a dry methane feed and then to an inert carrier gas containing either H2O(g), CO2, or O-2.",In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
3,18158,Carbon deposits began to form within 5 s of methane exposure.,In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
4,18158,Vibrational Raman spectra showed that the carbon deposits consisted of highly ordered graphite as evidenced by a single pronounced feature in the spectra at 1556 cm(-1).,In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
5,18158,"Changing the incident gas phase environment over the anode to Ar containing either H2O (2%), CO2 (6%), or O-2 (6%) led to quantitative removal of the carbon and partial or complete oxidation of the Ni as evidenced by the growth of a NiO vibrational band (at 1080 cm(-1)) in.",In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e

7,18158,"Carbon removal rates from the Ni/YSZ anode were fastest with vapor phase H2O, then O-2, and finally slowest with CO2.",In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
8,18158,The extent of Ni oxidation was much more pronounced with O-2 than with either H2O or CO2.,In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
9,18158,These chemical processes observed directly in the Raman spectra were reflected in the device's open circuit voltage (OCV).,In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
10,18158,Correlating findings from these two methods-in situ Raman spectroscopy and voltage measurements-provided a direct connection between the chemical composition of SOFC anodes and the electrochemical condition of the device.,In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
11,18158,"These results inspire confidence that any of the reforming agents used-H2O, O-2, and CO2-will remove carbon from Ni anodes quantitatively on a time scale of similar to 10 to similar to 125 s.",In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
12,18158,"However, H2O and CO2 appear less likely to damage the cell following carbon removal, as H2O and CO2 do not quantitatively oxidize the Ni in the cermet anode.",In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
13,18158,"In contrast, exposure to O-2 leads to much more extensive Ni oxidation and an OCV that approaches 0.0 V, implying that the Ni/NiO equilibrium sustained by H2O and CO2 is driven completely to NiO by O-2.",In Situ Raman Studies of Carbon Removal from High Temperature Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes by Gas Phase Reforming Agents,10.1021/jp408192e
