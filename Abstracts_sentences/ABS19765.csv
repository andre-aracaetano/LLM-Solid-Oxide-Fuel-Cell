1,19765,There is a considerable interest in lowering the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells.,"Segregation Resistant Nanocrystalline/Amorphous (La, Sr) CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 Composite Cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1149/2.0201915jes
2,19765,"In this respect, (La,Sr)CoO3(La,Sr)(2)CoO4 dual phase oxides have attracted much attention as cathode materials due to their enhanced oxygen reduction reaction kinetics.","Segregation Resistant Nanocrystalline/Amorphous (La, Sr) CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 Composite Cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1149/2.0201915jes
3,19765,The main drawback in lanthanum strontium cobaltite cathodes is Sr-segregation at operating temperatures which causes a sudden degradation in performance.,"Segregation Resistant Nanocrystalline/Amorphous (La, Sr) CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 Composite Cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1149/2.0201915jes
4,19765,"In the current study, this segregation is verified by a specially designed experiment where a (La0.8Sr0.2)CoO3 - (La0.5Sr0.5)(2)CoO4 bilayer is deposited and annealed for an extended period of time.","Segregation Resistant Nanocrystalline/Amorphous (La, Sr) CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 Composite Cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1149/2.0201915jes
5,19765,Thin film cathodes are then deposited via co-sputtering of (La0.8Sr0.2)CoO3 and (La0.5Sr0.5)(2)CoO4 yielding non-crystalline structures with acceptable area specific resistance values at temperatures as low as 575 degrees C.,"Segregation Resistant Nanocrystalline/Amorphous (La, Sr) CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 Composite Cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1149/2.0201915jes
6,19765,The stability of these cathodes is investigated over an extensive range of compositions (La0.8Sr0.2)CoO3: (La0.5Sr0.5)(2)CoO4 = 0.10:0.90 - 0.90:0.10.,"Segregation Resistant Nanocrystalline/Amorphous (La, Sr) CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 Composite Cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1149/2.0201915jes
7,19765,Prolonged annealing of cathodes at temperature of the same initial area specific resistance shows an exceptionally stable cathode performance as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy responses.,"Segregation Resistant Nanocrystalline/Amorphous (La, Sr) CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 Composite Cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1149/2.0201915jes
8,19765,"It is therefore concluded that co-sputtered (La0.8Sr0.2)CoO3 - (La0.5Sr0.5)(2)CoO4 dual phase cathodes with their amorphous/nanocrystalline structures, especially at mid-compositions, provide an extremely stable microstructure with a strong resistance to Sr segregation.","Segregation Resistant Nanocrystalline/Amorphous (La, Sr) CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 Composite Cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1149/2.0201915jes
