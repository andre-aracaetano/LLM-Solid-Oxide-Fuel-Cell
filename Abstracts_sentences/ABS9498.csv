1,9498,Two different low Ni content (10 wt.%) anode catalysts were investigated for intermediate temperature (800 degrees C) operation in solid oxide fuel cells fed with dry propane.,Electrochemical behaviour of propane-fed solid oxide fuel cells based on low Ni content anode catalysts,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.03.077
2,9498,"Both catalysts were prepared by the impregnation of a Ni-precursor on different oxide supports, i.e. gadolinia doped ceria (CGO) and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 perovskite, and thermal treated at 1100 degrees C for 2 h. The Ni-modified perovskite catalyst was mixed with a CGO powder and deposited on a CGO electrolyte to form a composite catalytic layer with a proper triple-phase boundary.",Electrochemical behaviour of propane-fed solid oxide fuel cells based on low Ni content anode catalysts,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.03.077

4,9498,Electrochemical performance was recorded at different times during 100 h operation in dry propane.,Electrochemical behaviour of propane-fed solid oxide fuel cells based on low Ni content anode catalysts,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.03.077
5,9498,The Ni-modified perovskite showed significantly better performance than the Ni/CGO anode.,Electrochemical behaviour of propane-fed solid oxide fuel cells based on low Ni content anode catalysts,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.03.077
6,9498,A power density of about 300 mW cm(-2) was obtained for the electrolyte supported SOFC in dry propane at 800 degrees C. Structural investigation of the composite anode layer after SOFC operation indicated a modification of the perovskite structure and the occurrence of a La2NiO4 phase.,Electrochemical behaviour of propane-fed solid oxide fuel cells based on low Ni content anode catalysts,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.03.077
