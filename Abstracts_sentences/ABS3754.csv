1,3754,A single reversible solid oxide fuel cell (RSOFC) can accomplish two functions: (1) as a solid oxide steam electrolyzer (SOSE) for hydrogen production and (2) as a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) for power generation.,Theoretical analysis of reversible solid oxide fuel cell based on proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.057
2,3754,An electrochemical model was developed to study the performance of an RSOFC based on a proton-conducting electrolyte (RSOFC-H).,Theoretical analysis of reversible solid oxide fuel cell based on proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.057
3,3754,"In both SOSE and SOFC modes, the hydrogen electrode-supported configuration was identified as the most favorable design to achieve high energy conversion efficiency of RSOFC-H. For comparison, in a previous study on conventional RSOFC based on an oxygen ion-conducting electrolyte (RSOFC-O), the hydrogen electrode-supported configuration was found to be favorable in the SOFC mode but such configuration would cause high concentration overpotential in the SOSE mode.",Theoretical analysis of reversible solid oxide fuel cell based on proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.057
4,3754,"Thus, the oxygen electrode-supported configuration was desirable for RSOFC-O operating in the SOSE mode.",Theoretical analysis of reversible solid oxide fuel cell based on proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.057
5,3754,The results obtained in this study show that RSOFC-H has a natural advantage over RSOFC-O in terms of structural design.,Theoretical analysis of reversible solid oxide fuel cell based on proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.057
6,3754,The modeling study signifies the difference between RSOFC-H and RSOFC-O and can serve as a useful tool for further design optimization.,Theoretical analysis of reversible solid oxide fuel cell based on proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.057
