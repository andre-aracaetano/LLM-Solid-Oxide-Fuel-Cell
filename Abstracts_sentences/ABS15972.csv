1,15972,"Thin (similar to 30-45 mu m) gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte, Ni + yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode-supported cells were fabricated with platinum reference electrodes (probes) embedded within the electrolyte layer.","Measurement of oxygen chemical potential in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.068
2,15972,The exposed parts of the probes were sealed off from the atmosphere using an oxygen impermeable glass.,"Measurement of oxygen chemical potential in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.068
3,15972,"Thus, no oxygen exchange could occur and voltage measurements at the probes correspond to the reduced negative electrochemical potential of electrons (psi = -(mu) over tilde (e)/e, where (mu) over tilde is the electrochemical potential of electrons and e is the electronic charge).","Measurement of oxygen chemical potential in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.068
4,15972,The p was measured at 650 degrees C under open circuit conditions with air circulated past the cathode and hydrogen circulated past the anode.,"Measurement of oxygen chemical potential in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.068
5,15972,The open circuit voltage was similar to 0.84 V.,"Measurement of oxygen chemical potential in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.068
6,15972,The voltages between the anode and reference electrodes were very small-less than 30 mV. This was attributed to significant electronic conduction throughout the electrolyte from anode/electrolyte interface to cathode/electrolyte interface.,"Measurement of oxygen chemical potential in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.068
7,15972,"Thus, voltage drop mainly occurs across the cathode/electrolyte interface.","Measurement of oxygen chemical potential in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.068
8,15972,"The variation of chemical potential of oxygen, mu(o2), within the GDC electrolyte was estimated, which showed a large drop in mu(o2) across the cathode/electrolyte interface.","Measurement of oxygen chemical potential in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.068
9,15972,The oxygen partial pressure in GDC just inside the cathode was estimated to be similar to 10(-22) atm.,"Measurement of oxygen chemical potential in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.068
10,15972,"Thus, in GDC-based anode-supported cells the effective electrolyte thickness is very small.","Measurement of oxygen chemical potential in thin electrolyte film, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.068
