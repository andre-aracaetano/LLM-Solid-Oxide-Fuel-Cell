1,1817,"To provide answers to the concern as to how quickly the temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for transportation application will drop, a thermal analysis of the cool-down time of an SOFC stack during vehicle idle or stand-by has been carried out.",Cool-down time of solid oxide fuel cells intended for transportation application,10.1016/0378-7753(96)02326-9
2,1817,"Because a large amount of thermal energy is stored in high-temperature SOFC stacks, it is important to select suitable thermal insulations to reduce heat loss.",Cool-down time of solid oxide fuel cells intended for transportation application,10.1016/0378-7753(96)02326-9
3,1817,Three typical kinds of thermal insulating materials have been selected in the present calculations.,Cool-down time of solid oxide fuel cells intended for transportation application,10.1016/0378-7753(96)02326-9
4,1817,"The results indicate that a high-performance, vacuum-multifoil thermal insulation can be applied to significantly reduce heat loss and to maintain temperature uniformity across a cell stack.",Cool-down time of solid oxide fuel cells intended for transportation application,10.1016/0378-7753(96)02326-9
5,1817,"Consequently, the cool-down time from 1000 to 800 degrees C is extended from 2 h (with a 5 cm thick conventional material) to about 31 h (with a 1 cm thick high-performance material).",Cool-down time of solid oxide fuel cells intended for transportation application,10.1016/0378-7753(96)02326-9
