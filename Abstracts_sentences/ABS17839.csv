5,17839,"All samples were oxidized for 1000 and 2260 h in air at 1073 K. Microstructural and oxidation kinetics studies revealed that gadolinium segregation at grain boundaries in the Cr2O3 scale between the steel and the spinel layer reduces the oxidation rate for the steel/coating system, thereby improving the adhesion of the scale to the substrate.",Influence of Gd deposition on the oxidation behavior and electrical properties of a layered system consisting of Crofer 22 APU and MnCo2O4 spinel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.11.169
