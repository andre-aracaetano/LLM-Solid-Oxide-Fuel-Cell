1,5735,"Present challenges forfuel cell (FC) commercialisation are related to the material and system limitations, delaying the FC market.",New generation or universal fuel cell system? R&D for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs),
2,5735,Most intensive interests currently for the FCs are concentrated on the polymer electroyte fuel cells (PEFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,New generation or universal fuel cell system? R&D for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs),
3,5735,"Due to the material constraint the SOFC system has to be operated at high temperature, e.g., 1000 degreesC, resulting in expensive SOFC system and complex technology; while the noble platinum catalyst has to be used for the PEFCs, creating a bottleneck for its commercialisation.",New generation or universal fuel cell system? R&D for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs),
4,5735,"In addition, the PEFC system has limited applications due to a shortage of the fuel flexibility, e.g., for hydrocarbon fuels, existing commonly in present fuel infrastructure.",New generation or universal fuel cell system? R&D for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs),
5,5735,"There is therefore a need to develop new generation or universal FC system, which can be employed for various applications for both mobile, e.g., electrical vehicles, and stationary, e.g., power generation plant.",New generation or universal fuel cell system? R&D for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs),
6,5735,"These request an advanced FC system that should possess of the wide fuel flexibility, i.e., fitting to various present hydrocarbon fiiels, and most importantly, this FC system should be cost-effective and marketable.",New generation or universal fuel cell system? R&D for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs),
7,5735,"However the present FC systems themselves alone are difficult to meet these demands due to the, material and system limitations.",New generation or universal fuel cell system? R&D for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs),
8,5735,Our strategy is to develop a new advanced or near universal FC system to combine technological advantage from present FC systems to create a new competitive vis-a-vis FC technology.,New generation or universal fuel cell system? R&D for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs),
9,5735,To realise this strategy a key issue is addressed from the material point of view.,New generation or universal fuel cell system? R&D for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs),
10,5735,", This paper thus reviews recent developments/progresses and achievements/applications for R&D on the materials and ITSOFCs, more concerned on the new material-based ITSOFCs.",New generation or universal fuel cell system? R&D for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs),
