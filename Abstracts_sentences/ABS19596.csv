1,19596,"During the operation of Solid Oxide Cell (SOC) fuel electrodes, the mobility of nickel can lead to significant changes in electrode morphology, with accompanying degradation in electrochemical performance.",Unveiling the mechanisms of solid-state dewetting in Solid Oxide Cells with novel 2D electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.02.068
2,19596,"In this work, the dewetting of nickel films supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), hereafter called 2D cells, is studied by coupling in-situ environmental scanning electron microscopy (E-SEM), image analysis, cellular automata simulation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).",Unveiling the mechanisms of solid-state dewetting in Solid Oxide Cells with novel 2D electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.02.068
3,19596,"Analysis of experimental E-SEM images shows that Ni dewetting causes an increase in active triple phase boundary (aTPB) length up to a maximum, after which a sharp decrease in aTPB occurs due to Ni de-percolation.",Unveiling the mechanisms of solid-state dewetting in Solid Oxide Cells with novel 2D electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.02.068
4,19596,"This microstructural evolution is consistent with the EIS response, which shows a minimum in polarization resistance followed by a rapid electrochemical degradation.",Unveiling the mechanisms of solid-state dewetting in Solid Oxide Cells with novel 2D electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.02.068
5,19596,"These results reveal that neither evaporation-condensation nor surface diffusion of Ni are the main mechanisms of dewetting at 560-800 degrees C. Rather, the energy barrier for pore nucleation within the dense Ni film appears to be the most important factor.",Unveiling the mechanisms of solid-state dewetting in Solid Oxide Cells with novel 2D electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.02.068
6,19596,This sheds light on the relevant mechanisms and interfaces that must be controlled to reduce the electrochemical degradation of SOC electrodes induced by Ni dewetting.,Unveiling the mechanisms of solid-state dewetting in Solid Oxide Cells with novel 2D electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.02.068
