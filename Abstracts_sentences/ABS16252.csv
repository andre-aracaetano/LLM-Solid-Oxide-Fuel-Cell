2,16252,Here we summarise some recent studies of the mechanical properties of oxygen ion-conducting ceramics for the applications mentioned.,Mechanical behaviour of ceramic oxygen ion-conducting membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00714-1
3,16252,Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of several materials of interest for SOFCs have now been characterised; including the effects of temperature and porosity on these parameters.,Mechanical behaviour of ceramic oxygen ion-conducting membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00714-1
4,16252,The biaxial flexural strength and fracture toughness of tape-cast YSZ have been measured at room temperature and at a typical operating temperature of 900 degreesC. Fracture toughness decreases with increasing temperature; from 1.61+/-0.12 MPa m(0.5) at room temperature to 1.02+/-0.05 MPa m(0.5) at 900 degreesC. Flexural strength and fracture toughness were found to be quantitatively consistent with fracture being initiated at observed surface defects.,Mechanical behaviour of ceramic oxygen ion-conducting membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00714-1
5,16252,YSZ has also been found to be susceptible to sub-critical crack growth.,Mechanical behaviour of ceramic oxygen ion-conducting membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00714-1
6,16252,Many oxygen-ion conducting ceramics suffer from a chemically induced stress when subjected to a gradient in the thermodynamic activity of oxygen.,Mechanical behaviour of ceramic oxygen ion-conducting membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00714-1
