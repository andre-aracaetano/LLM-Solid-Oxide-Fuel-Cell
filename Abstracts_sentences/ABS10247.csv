2,10247,High temperature XRD data are used to quantify atomic positional shift from mean position with temperature.,Influence of gadolinium doping on the structure and defects of ceria under fuel cell operating temperature,10.1063/1.4869116
3,10247,"The Raman spectroscopy study shows additional vibration modes related to ordering of defect spaces (Gd-Ce' - V-o(center dot center dot))* and (2Gd(Ce)' - V-o(center dot center dot))(x) generated due to association of oxygen vacancies and reduced cerium or dopant cations site (Gd3+), which disappear at 450 degrees C; indicating oxygen vacancies dissociation from the defect complex.",Influence of gadolinium doping on the structure and defects of ceria under fuel cell operating temperature,10.1063/1.4869116
4,10247,The experimental evidences of cation-anion positional shifting and oxygen vacancies dissociation from defect complex in the IT-SOFC operating temperature are discussed to correlate with activation energy for ionic conductivity.,Influence of gadolinium doping on the structure and defects of ceria under fuel cell operating temperature,10.1063/1.4869116
