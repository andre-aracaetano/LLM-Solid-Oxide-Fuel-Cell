3,2373,BCO shows well chemical compatibility with typical proton conductor BZCY (BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta).,Ba2Co9O14 as Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on Proton Conductor,
4,2373,"The electrochemical performance of BCO cathode is improved when BZCY is cooperated, and the lowest interfacial polarization resistance is achieved at the compositon with 70wt% BCO, which exhibits an activation energy of about 1.26 eV. Single cells are also constructed with Ni-cermet anode supports.",Ba2Co9O14 as Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on Proton Conductor,
