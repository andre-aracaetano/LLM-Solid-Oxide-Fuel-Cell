1,1271,The exergetic and thermal efficiency of hybrid systems using various solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) intermediate-temperature fuel cell electrolytes at various temperatures and electrolyte thicknesses was simulated and evaluated.,"Exergetic Studies of Intermediate-Temperature, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolytes",10.1149/1.3072897
2,1271,"Electrolytes reported on here include lanthanum strontium gallate magnesite, yttria-stabilized zirconium, and gadolinium-doped ceria oxide (GDC).","Exergetic Studies of Intermediate-Temperature, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolytes",10.1149/1.3072897
3,1271,"The Wagner mass transfer model (MTM), which includes solid-state oxygen-ion, hole, and electron conduction, was incorporated into a thermodynamic model for a simple hybrid system.","Exergetic Studies of Intermediate-Temperature, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolytes",10.1149/1.3072897
4,1271,The MTM-projected performance trends for the various electrolytes agreed well with trends previously observed experimentally by the authors for electrolytes alone.,"Exergetic Studies of Intermediate-Temperature, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolytes",10.1149/1.3072897
5,1271,The projected exergetic performance with the typical thermodynamic model without the incorporation of the MTM generally gave higher performance over a broader temperature range than expected through experimental trends previously observed.,"Exergetic Studies of Intermediate-Temperature, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolytes",10.1149/1.3072897
6,1271,"Thus, the projected performance of these very important hybrid systems can be greatly impacted by electrolyte choice and electronic conductivity.","Exergetic Studies of Intermediate-Temperature, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolytes",10.1149/1.3072897
7,1271,"GDC was predicted to have a good exergetic efficiency, but only over a very narrow temperature region.","Exergetic Studies of Intermediate-Temperature, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolytes",10.1149/1.3072897
8,1271,A thermodynamically consistent picture of SOFC exergetic performance from the defect chemistry and solid-state electrochemistry to the phenomenological fuel cell and macroscopic thermodynamic performance was established.,"Exergetic Studies of Intermediate-Temperature, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolytes",10.1149/1.3072897
