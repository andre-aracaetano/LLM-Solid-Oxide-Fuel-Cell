2,3929,"Steam reforming, partial oxidation and exhaust gas reforming have been compared.",THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF METHANE FUELED SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,10.1016/0360-3199(92)90188-3
3,3929,"As a theoretical tool, an electrochemical generator was used, where the reactions involved in the reformer, in the fuel cell and in the exhaust gas sections have been separately analysed.",THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF METHANE FUELED SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,10.1016/0360-3199(92)90188-3
4,3929,Equilibrium calculations were performed in the temperature range 1000 - 1400 K assuming different oxidized/reduced component ratios at the inlet and at the outlet of the electrochemical section.,THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF METHANE FUELED SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,10.1016/0360-3199(92)90188-3
5,3929,"On this basis the results pointed out that the most efficient way to feed a SOFC is by exhaust gas reforming, while the partial oxidation efficiencies show lower values, especially at high temperatures.",THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF METHANE FUELED SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,10.1016/0360-3199(92)90188-3
