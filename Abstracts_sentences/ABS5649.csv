1,5649,"The effect of some technological parameters (firing temperature, thickness of a interphase layer Z C made of solid electrolyte Ce0.82Gd0.18O1.91 (GDC), the GDC electrolyte amount in nickel-cermet) on the electrochemical and electric properties of a nickel-cermet (Ni-GDC) anode intended for fuel cells with the La0.88Sr0.12Ga0.82Mg0.18O2.85(LSGM) electrolyte is studied.",Nickel-cermet anode for fuel cells with the LSGM electrolyte,10.1134/S1023193507080058
2,5649,The polarization resistance of such an electrode is shown to hardly depend on the thickness of the interphase layer (4.5-23.5 mu m) and the GDC electrolyte amount in nickel-cermet and to increase with the anode firing temperature.,Nickel-cermet anode for fuel cells with the LSGM electrolyte,10.1134/S1023193507080058
3,5649,It is established that the contact resistance is concentrated in cells with the developed nickel-cermet electrode at the GDC/LSGM interface.,Nickel-cermet anode for fuel cells with the LSGM electrolyte,10.1134/S1023193507080058
4,5649,At a temperature of 700 degrees C the developed anodes may ensure a current density of I A cm(-2) at an overvoltage of less than 100 mV when using both moist hydrogen and a methane-oxygen mixture as the fuel.,Nickel-cermet anode for fuel cells with the LSGM electrolyte,10.1134/S1023193507080058
