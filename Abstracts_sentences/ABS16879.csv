6,16879,"With increasing temperature from 773 to 1073 K, the total oxide-ion conductivity (& sigma;total) along the grain-alignment direction steadily increased from 1.31 x 10-4 to 3.21 x 10-3 S cm-1, each value of which was, at the same temperature, more than 7.7 times larger than that of the randomly grain-oriented polycrystal with the same bulk chemical composition.",Preparation of grain-aligned polycrystal of doped lanthanum silicate oxyapatite by templated grain growth method and evaluation of its structural and electrical properties,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116309
