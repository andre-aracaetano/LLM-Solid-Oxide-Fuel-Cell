1,9801,Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-8-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-8 (SFMO-SDC) composites are high-efficiency fuel electrode materials for reversible solid oxide cells (rSOCs).,On the composition of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-8-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-8 composite as fuel electrodes for hydrogen reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.fuel.2023.128642
2,9801,Systematic variation in the SFMO-SDC composite shows that the composite with 40 wt% of SDC gives rise to the highest amount of oxygen vacancy and the highest number of electronic defects due to multiple electronic activation effects.,On the composition of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-8-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-8 composite as fuel electrodes for hydrogen reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.fuel.2023.128642
3,9801,"Polarization resistance changes over the steam content show the parabolic trend with the optimal humidity at 20 vol% at open circuit voltage and in fuel cell mode, while in electrolyzer mode, highly humidified hydrogen is favored.",On the composition of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-8-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-8 composite as fuel electrodes for hydrogen reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.fuel.2023.128642
4,9801,Electrochemical studies and distributions of relaxation times analysis illustrate that the rate-determining step in fuel cell mode is the water desorption reaction whereas that in electrolyzer and at open circuit voltage (OCV) is surface chemical diffusion/oxide transport processes.,On the composition of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-8-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-8 composite as fuel electrodes for hydrogen reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.fuel.2023.128642
