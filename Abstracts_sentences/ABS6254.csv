1,6254,Investigation has been conducted on the poisoning effect of various contaminants containing chlorine at ppm level (< 10 ppm) on the performance of Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells.,Chlorine contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-010-1166-x
2,6254,"The results indicate that cell performance drops by exposure to 1 ppm Cl-2(g) at 750 A degrees C,",Chlorine contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-010-1166-x
3,6254,whereas the introduction of Cl-2(g) with concentration higher than 5 ppm causes only a slight degradation at 850 A degrees C.,Chlorine contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-010-1166-x
4,6254,The presence of 2-6 ppm CH3Cl(g) and C2H3Cl(g) can also induce measurable cell performance decline at 750 and 850 A degrees C and this deterioration cannot be completely removed after switching to pure fuel at 850 A degrees C.,Chlorine contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-010-1166-x
5,6254,No performance loss is found when the cell is operated in fuel containing 1-8 ppm HCl(g) at 750 and 850 A degrees C.,Chlorine contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-010-1166-x
6,6254,"It is thus concluded that chlorine in the form of Cl-2(g) yields the largest poisoning effect at 750 A degrees C, while the degradation rate caused by addition of C2H3Cl(g) increases with the increase of operation temperature.",Chlorine contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-010-1166-x
7,6254,"Agglomerations at anodic region are observed in the samples after poisoning test by Cl-2(g), CH3Cl(g), and C2H3Cl(g), but the anode microstructure is uniform for the sample exposed to HCl(g) for poisoning test.",Chlorine contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-010-1166-x
