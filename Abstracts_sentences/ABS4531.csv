1,4531,We report on the intermediate-temperature synthesis (973 K) and operation (<750 K) of Ce-4.67(SiO4)(3)O-based thin-film oxy-apatites.,Cerium silicate-based thin-film apatites: high conductivity and solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1557/mrc.2017.24
2,4531,"The apatite thin films show the high conductivity of similar to 0.05-0.5 S/cm and excellent stability in reducing atmosphere (<10(-17) atm), which makes promising these materials as anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application.",Cerium silicate-based thin-film apatites: high conductivity and solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1557/mrc.2017.24
3,4531,"The proto-type SOFCs implementing single-layer apatite and apatite/Pt bilayer anodes were fabricated and the resulting performance (e.g., peak power density of similar to 5 mW/cm(2) at 748 K) presents notable feasibility of ZCS-based oxy-apatite anodes for thin-film SOFC devices.",Cerium silicate-based thin-film apatites: high conductivity and solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1557/mrc.2017.24
