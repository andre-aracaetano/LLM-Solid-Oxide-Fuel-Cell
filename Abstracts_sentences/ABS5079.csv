1,5079,Here we report the fabrication of composite cathodes for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells by impregnating aqueous solutions corresponding to SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5 (SBSCO) into the porous La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) backbones.,Nanostructuring of SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ cathodes for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.113
2,5079,"Examination of X-Ray diffraction patterns indicates that phase-pure SBSCO layered perovskite oxides can be only achieved at calcination temperatures >= 900 degrees C. Based upon impedance measurement of symmetric cells, the SBSCO-LSGM composites calcinated at 850 degrees C show a trade-off between the SBSCO phase purity and catalyst size, and thereby exhibit minimal cathode polarization resistances with respect to the infiltrate calcination temperature, e.g., 0.035 Omega cm(2) at 550 degrees C and 0.12 Omega cm(2) at 500 degrees C at the loadings of 21 wt%.",Nanostructuring of SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ cathodes for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.113
3,5079,Analysis of impedance spectra under varied oxygen partial pressures suggests that oxygen reduction reactions on the nano-scale SBSCO-LSGM composite are largely dominated by ionization of adsorbed oxygen atoms on the SBSCO surfaces.,Nanostructuring of SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ cathodes for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.113
4,5079,Thin LSGM electrolyte fuel cells with impregnated Ni anodes and SBSCO cathodes show high power densities of 1.5 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C and 0.70 W cm(-2) at 500 degrees C.
