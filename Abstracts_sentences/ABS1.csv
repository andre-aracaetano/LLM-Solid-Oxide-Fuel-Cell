1,1,"There are four types of fuel cells: Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFC), Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFC), Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC), and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC).",Performance of several types of fuel cells and factor analysis of performance,
2,1,The performance of these fuel cells has not been compared.,Performance of several types of fuel cells and factor analysis of performance,
3,1,Equations that are able to express the performance of these fuel cells accurately were derived or modified from the latest published performance data.,Performance of several types of fuel cells and factor analysis of performance,
4,1,"The cell voltages of the four fuel cells were estimated by these equations, resulting in high-temperature fuel cells such as MCFC and SOFC having higher energy conversion efficiencies than low-temperature fuel cells such as PEFC and PAFC.",Performance of several types of fuel cells and factor analysis of performance,
5,1,"This difference originates from low cathode polarization, overcoming both a decrease of open circuit voltage with increasing temperature and higher Nernst losses for high-temperature fuel cells of approximately 85 mV than those for low-temperature fuel cells due to steam generation in the anode chamber in the high-temperature fuel cells.",Performance of several types of fuel cells and factor analysis of performance,
6,1,"A generalized relationship between cell voltage and operating temperature was derived, stating that the cell voltage is almost constant between 500 degreesC and 1000 degreesC. A fuel cell which has protons as a migration species in the electrolyte and works between 250 degreesC and 500 degreesC would give a performance comparable with high-temperature fuel cells due to lower Nernst losses than those for high-temperature fuel cells.",Performance of several types of fuel cells and factor analysis of performance,
