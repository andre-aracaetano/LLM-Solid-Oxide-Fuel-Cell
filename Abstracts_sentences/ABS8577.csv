1,8577,"The development of active and selective catalysts for methane partial oxidation is one of today's challenges, because these catalysts could be used either for hydrogen production purposes or as anode materials in single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Methane partial oxidation using Ni/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2catalysts,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.04.025
2,8577,"In this work, the synthesis of ceria-zirconia solid solutions of nominal composition Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 through the gel-combustion route is presented.",Methane partial oxidation using Ni/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2catalysts,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.04.025
3,8577,"The solids obtained were impregnated with nickel solutions to achieve contents of 9% and 50% (m/m), characterized texturally and structurally, and their catalytic behavior in the methane partial oxidation reaction was assessed.",Methane partial oxidation using Ni/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2catalysts,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.04.025
4,8577,"The synthesis method was effective, leading to solids with good morphological properties.",Methane partial oxidation using Ni/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2catalysts,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.04.025
5,8577,"Likewise, the Ni/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 catalysts proved to be active and showed a stable behavior during the working period, with methane conversion levels of 90% at temperatures above 550 degrees C, being hydrogen and carbon monoxide the main products.",Methane partial oxidation using Ni/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2catalysts,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.04.025
