1,18997,"Surface-decoration of perovskites can strongly affect the oxygen reduction activity, and therefore is a new and promising approach to improve SOFC cathode materials.",Enhanced oxygen reduction activity on surface-decorated perovskite thin films for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c1ee01245b
2,18997,"In this study, we demonstrate that a small amount of secondary phase on a (001) La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta (LSC) surface can either significantly activate or passivate the electrode.",Enhanced oxygen reduction activity on surface-decorated perovskite thin films for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c1ee01245b
3,18997,"LSC (001) microelectrodes prepared by pulsed laser deposition on a (001)-oriented yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrate were decorated with La-, Co-, and Sr-(hydr) oxides/carbonates.",Enhanced oxygen reduction activity on surface-decorated perovskite thin films for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c1ee01245b
4,18997,"Sr''-decoration with nanoparticle coverage in the range from 50% to 80% of the LSC surface enhanced the surface exchange coefficient, k(q), by an order of magnitude while La''-decoration and Co''-decoration led to no change and reduction in k(q), respectively.",Enhanced oxygen reduction activity on surface-decorated perovskite thin films for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c1ee01245b
5,18997,"Although the physical origin for the enhancement is not fully understood, results from atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggest that the observed k(q) enhancement for Sr''-decorated surfaces can be attributed largely to catalytically active interface regions between surface Sr-enriched particles and the LSC surface.",Enhanced oxygen reduction activity on surface-decorated perovskite thin films for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c1ee01245b
