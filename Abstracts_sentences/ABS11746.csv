1,11746,"Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes were co-sintered at a temperature as low as 1250 degrees C, lower than the usual 1400 degrees C, by using 1 mol% Fe2O3 sintering aid.",Effects of Reduced Firing Temperature on Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.033405jes
2,11746,The effect of sintering temperature on cell electrochemical performance was investigated for cells with two different composite cathodes: (LaasSr(0 2))(0 98)MnO3-delta (LSM) -YSZ or La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 (LSCF) - Gd-doped Ceria (GDC).,Effects of Reduced Firing Temperature on Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.033405jes
3,11746,"For the latter case, the electrolyte included a 1.4-mu m-thick GDC layer that was co-sintered with the YSZ electrolyte and Ni-YSZ anode.",Effects of Reduced Firing Temperature on Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.033405jes
4,11746,Open-circuit voltages were near theoretical values for all cells.,Effects of Reduced Firing Temperature on Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.033405jes
