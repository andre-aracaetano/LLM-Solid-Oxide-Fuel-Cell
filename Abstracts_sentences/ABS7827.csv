3,7827,"Here, a novel cobalt-free perovskite Ba0.75Sr0.25Fe0.875Ga0.125O3-delta (BSFG) is developed as an efficient oxygen reduction electrode for SOFCs, featuring cubic-symmetry structure, large oxygen vacancy concentration and fast oxygen transport.",Achieving exceptional activity and durability toward oxygen reduction based on a cobalt-free perovskite for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.04.020
4,7827,"Benefiting from these merits, cells incorporated with BSFG achieve exceptionally high electrochemical performance, as evidenced by a low polarization area-specific resistance of 0.074 Omega cm(2) and a high peak power density of 1145 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C. Meanwhile, a robust short-term performance stability of BSFG cathode can be ascribed to the stable crystalline structure and favorable thermal expansion behavior.",Achieving exceptional activity and durability toward oxygen reduction based on a cobalt-free perovskite for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jechem.2021.04.020
