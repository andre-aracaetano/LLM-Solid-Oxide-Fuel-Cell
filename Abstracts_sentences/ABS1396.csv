6,1396,"Accordingly, the impacts of the system performance parameters, including the fuel consumption coefficients, compressor pressure ratio, fuel pre-reforming percentage, and the steam to carbon ratio are investigated on the CO2, CO, and NOx emission rates.","Environmental assessment of a hybrid system composed of solid oxide fuel cell, gas turbine and multiple effect evaporation desalination system",10.1177/0958305X20973575
7,1396,"Based on the findings, it is concluded that of different species, the impacts of CO, CO2, and NOx emission rates are significant on the environment.","Environmental assessment of a hybrid system composed of solid oxide fuel cell, gas turbine and multiple effect evaporation desalination system",10.1177/0958305X20973575
8,1396,"Thus, the impacts of pressure ratio and pre-reforming percentage on their emission rates have been studied.","Environmental assessment of a hybrid system composed of solid oxide fuel cell, gas turbine and multiple effect evaporation desalination system",10.1177/0958305X20973575
9,1396,"The results revealed with increasing the compressor pressure ratio, increasing the fuel consumption coefficients, and decreasing the fuel cell's exhaust temperature, the CO and NOx emission rates and corresponding social costs diminished.","Environmental assessment of a hybrid system composed of solid oxide fuel cell, gas turbine and multiple effect evaporation desalination system",10.1177/0958305X20973575
10,1396,"On the other hand, with elevation of the ratio of steam to carbon, the recovery rate, the fuel cell's exhaust temperature, the concerned gas emission rates, and corresponding social costs increased.","Environmental assessment of a hybrid system composed of solid oxide fuel cell, gas turbine and multiple effect evaporation desalination system",10.1177/0958305X20973575
