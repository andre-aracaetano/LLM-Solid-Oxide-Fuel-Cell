1,4806,"The elastic properties of 0, 10, 15, and 20 mol% yttrium-doped barium zirconate (BZY0, BZY10, BZY15, and BZY20) at the operating temperatures of protonic ceramic fuel cells were evaluated.",High-Temperature Elastic Properties of Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.3390/met11060968
2,4806,"The proposed measurement method for low sinterability materials could accurately determine the sonic velocities of small-pellet-type samples, and the elastic properties were determined based on these velocities.",High-Temperature Elastic Properties of Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.3390/met11060968
3,4806,"The Young's modulus of BZY10, BZY15, and BZY20 was 224, 218, and 209 GPa at 20 degrees C, respectively, and the values decreased as the yttrium concentration increased.",High-Temperature Elastic Properties of Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.3390/met11060968
4,4806,"At high temperatures (>20 degrees C), as the temperature increased, the Young's and shear moduli decreased, whereas the bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio increased.",High-Temperature Elastic Properties of Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.3390/met11060968
5,4806,The Young's and shear moduli varied nonlinearly with the temperature: The values decreased rapidly from 100 to 300 degrees C and gradually at temperatures beyond 400 degrees C.,High-Temperature Elastic Properties of Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.3390/met11060968
6,4806,"The Young's modulus of BZY10, BZY15, and BZY20 was 137, 159, and 122 GPa at 500 degrees C, respectively, 30-40% smaller than the values at 20 degrees C.",High-Temperature Elastic Properties of Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.3390/met11060968
7,4806,The influence of the temperature was larger than that of the change in the yttrium concentration.,High-Temperature Elastic Properties of Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.3390/met11060968
