1,16786,"The variation in the crystal structure of Ln(2)Ni(1-x)Cu(x)O(4+delta), which has great potential as a new cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells, based on the type of Ln (La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and their solid solution), was investigated.","Variation in crystal structure of Ln2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and their solid solution) based on type of Ln: Relationship between crystal structure and tolerance factor",10.2109/jcersj2.19028
2,16786,"For Ln with ionic radius larger than 1.21 angstrom (1 angstrom = 0.1 nm), a single-phase K2NiF4 structure called T-phase was prepared for 0.0 <= x <= 1.0.","Variation in crystal structure of Ln2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and their solid solution) based on type of Ln: Relationship between crystal structure and tolerance factor",10.2109/jcersj2.19028
3,16786,"For Ln with ionic radius between 1.21 and 1.15 angstrom, the crystal structure changed from single T-phase to single Nd2CuO4 structure called T'-phase, through the mixture of T-phase and T'-phase, along with increasing Cu content.","Variation in crystal structure of Ln2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and their solid solution) based on type of Ln: Relationship between crystal structure and tolerance factor",10.2109/jcersj2.19028
4,16786,"The range of Cu content, in which the mixture phase was obtained because of the miscibility gap, increased with the decreasing size of Ln.","Variation in crystal structure of Ln2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and their solid solution) based on type of Ln: Relationship between crystal structure and tolerance factor",10.2109/jcersj2.19028
5,16786,The single T-phase was never prepared for Ln with ionic radius below 1.15 angstrom.,"Variation in crystal structure of Ln2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and their solid solution) based on type of Ln: Relationship between crystal structure and tolerance factor",10.2109/jcersj2.19028
6,16786,"Rough tendencies were observed, indicating that the single T-phase was obtained or was not prepared if the tolerance factor was above or below 0.865, respectively.","Variation in crystal structure of Ln2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and their solid solution) based on type of Ln: Relationship between crystal structure and tolerance factor",10.2109/jcersj2.19028
7,16786,The mixture of T-phase and T'-phase was obtained because of the miscibility gap by decreasing the tolerance factor slightly below about 0.865.,"Variation in crystal structure of Ln2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and their solid solution) based on type of Ln: Relationship between crystal structure and tolerance factor",10.2109/jcersj2.19028
8,16786,The T-phase was never generated by decreasing the tolerance factor any further.,"Variation in crystal structure of Ln2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and their solid solution) based on type of Ln: Relationship between crystal structure and tolerance factor",10.2109/jcersj2.19028
9,16786,The change of the crystal structure by Cu content and kind of Ln can also be explained by using Jahn-Teller effect of Cu2+ ion.,"Variation in crystal structure of Ln2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ (Ln: La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and their solid solution) based on type of Ln: Relationship between crystal structure and tolerance factor",10.2109/jcersj2.19028
