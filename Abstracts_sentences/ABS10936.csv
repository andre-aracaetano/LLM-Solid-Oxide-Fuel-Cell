2,10936,The resultant coating is stable during cyclic oxidation tests and is effective at improving the oxidation resistance of SUS430 alloy.,Development of low-temperature sintered Mn-Co spinel coatings on Fe-Cr ferritic alloys for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.02.058
3,10936,"The area-specific resistance of coated samples remains nearly constant during long-term oxidation at 800 degrees C and is less than 6 m Omega cm(2) even after oxidation for 1000 h. These results indicate that the low-temperature sintered MnCo2O4-MnO2 coating is a promising protective material for Fe-Cr ferrite alloys, especially SUS430, which are seriously oxidized at temperatures >= 850 degrees C.
