1,20141,"The oxygen nonstoichiometry of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (- delta) has been the topic of various reports in the literature, but has been exclusively measured at high oxygen partial pressures, pO(2), and/or elevated temperatures.",Oxygen nonstoichiometry and thermo-chemical stability of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - δ,10.1016/j.jssc.2012.08.001
2,20141,"For applications of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (- delta) such as solid oxide fuel cell cathodes or oxygen permeation membranes, knowledge of the oxygen nonstoichiometry and thermo-chemical stability over a wide range of pO(2) is crucial, as localized low pO(2) could trigger failure of the material and device.",Oxygen nonstoichiometry and thermo-chemical stability of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - δ,10.1016/j.jssc.2012.08.001
3,20141,"By employing coulometric titration combined with thermogravimetry, the oxygen nonstoichiometry of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (- delta) was measured at high and intermediate pO(2) until the material decomposed (at log(pO(2)/bar)approximate to -4.5 at 1073 K).",Oxygen nonstoichiometry and thermo-chemical stability of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - δ,10.1016/j.jssc.2012.08.001
4,20141,"For a gradually reduced sample, an offset in oxygen content suggests that La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (- delta) forms a super-reduced solid solution before decomposing.",Oxygen nonstoichiometry and thermo-chemical stability of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - δ,10.1016/j.jssc.2012.08.001
5,20141,"When the sample underwent alternate reduction-oxidation, a hysteresis-like pO(2) dependence of the oxygen content in the decomposition pO(2) range was attributed to the reversible formation of ABO(3) and A(2)BO(4) phases.",Oxygen nonstoichiometry and thermo-chemical stability of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - δ,10.1016/j.jssc.2012.08.001
