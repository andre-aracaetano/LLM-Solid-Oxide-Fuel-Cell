1,5707,A trial tubular SOFC system was fabricated.,Primary study on solid oxide fuel cells,
2,5707,the electrical performance of this SOFC was evaluated at temperatures of 500 to 950 degrees C. H-2 and CH4 were used as the fuels and air as the oxidant gas.,Primary study on solid oxide fuel cells,
3,5707,"The internal resistance, output current and output power of this SOFC were measured.",Primary study on solid oxide fuel cells,
4,5707,"When H-2 and CH4 were imported into the SOFC system at 950 degrees C, the open circuit voltages were 0.98V and 1.05V, maximum output current densities were 19.6mA/cm(2) and 16.4mA/cm(2), the maximum output power was 30.0mW and 24.4mW, respectively.",Primary study on solid oxide fuel cells,
5,5707,"The endurance test was conducted over 145h, but this SOFC system showed no significant degradation.",Primary study on solid oxide fuel cells,
