3,4419,"In this communication, we report our preliminary findings in developing catalyst (1 wt.% Pt dispersed on porous Gd-doped ceria) for pre-reforming of propane with relatively low steam to carbon (S/C) ratio (similar to0.5), coupled with direct utilization of the reformate in low-temperature SOFCs.",Pre-reforming of propane for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.004

5,4419,A peak power density of 247 mW/cm(2) was observed when pre-reformed propane was directly fed to an SOFC operated at 600 degreesC. No carbon deposition was observed in the fuel cell for a continuous operation of 10 It at 600 degreesC.,Pre-reforming of propane for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.004
6,4419,These results imply that pre-reforming could greatly enhance the performance of low-temperature SOFCs that run on higher hydrocarbon fuels.,Pre-reforming of propane for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.004
