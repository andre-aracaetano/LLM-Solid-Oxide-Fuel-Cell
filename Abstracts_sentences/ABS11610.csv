1,11610,This work examines the electrical transport properties and electrode performance of two ceramic cathode materials (La0.84Sr0.16Co0.3Fe0.7O3 - LSCFe7 and La0.84Sr0.16Co0.7Fe0.3O3 - LSCFe3) prepared by solid state reaction from oxides and carbonates.,Cathode materials for intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00286-6
2,11610,Point-type electrodes pressed against the electrolyte material (GCO - Gd2O3 doped CeO2) were used to study the intrinsic performance of these electrode-electrolyte combinations.,Cathode materials for intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00286-6
3,11610,Pt electrodes were also used for comparison.,Cathode materials for intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00286-6
4,11610,"For both ceramic cathodes a significant decrease in the cell ohmic contribution with increasing cathodic overpotentials suggests that the electrochemical reaction spreads from the triple phase boundary line to the electrode surface, a typical feature of mixed conducting electrode materials.",Cathode materials for intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00286-6
5,11610,"Overall, the steady state cathodic polarization measurements performed at 800 degrees C showed the LSCFe3 sample to be the best cathode material.",Cathode materials for intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00286-6
6,11610,"LSCFe3 also had a higher conductivity than LSCFe7 (in the range 200 to 800 degrees C), thus showing an overall highly promising performance.",Cathode materials for intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00286-6
