1,11415,This work aims to analyse and compare the thermodynamic performance and size of two types of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-based plants.,Size and exergy assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-based H2-fed power generation system with alternative electrolytes: A comparative study,10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113681
2,11415,"The former is the conventional H-2-fed plant based on SOFC with an oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte (SOFC-O), and the latter is based on SOFC using a proton-conducting electrolyte (SOFC-H).",Size and exergy assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-based H2-fed power generation system with alternative electrolytes: A comparative study,10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113681
3,11415,"Thermodynamic analysis reveals that in the SOFC-H system, due to H2O formation at the cathode side, not only the anode concentration losses decreases, but also the partial pressure difference between H2 and H2O increases which leads to an increase in Nernst voltage compared to the SOFC-O system.",Size and exergy assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-based H2-fed power generation system with alternative electrolytes: A comparative study,10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113681
4,11415,"Due to this, SOFC-H and SOFC-O based plants exhibit different performance in terms of the cell voltage, power, efficiency, stack outlet temperature and size of heat exchangers used for preheating the fuel and air.",Size and exergy assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-based H2-fed power generation system with alternative electrolytes: A comparative study,10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113681
5,11415,"The results indicate, for current densities less than around 3,000 A/m(2), the energy and exergy efficiencies of SOFC-H-based system are more than those of the SOFC-O-based plant.",Size and exergy assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-based H2-fed power generation system with alternative electrolytes: A comparative study,10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113681
6,11415,This results in reduced area of heat exchangers per unit power used in the SOFC-H-based plant as compared with the SOFC-O-based plant.,Size and exergy assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-based H2-fed power generation system with alternative electrolytes: A comparative study,10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113681
7,11415,"In addition, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that using thin cells in the SOFC stack is favourable for the SOFC-H-based plant.",Size and exergy assessment of solid oxide fuel cell-based H2-fed power generation system with alternative electrolytes: A comparative study,10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113681
