7,16173,"At a reliability level of 70%, the highest flexural strength of 110.20 MPa is obtained from the anode support layer with a doctor blade gap of 175 mu m and the 16 cm(2) active area cell with this anode support layer also exhibits the highest peak performance of 0.483 W/cm(2) at an operating temperature of 800 degrees C. Thus, a doctor blade gap of 175 mu m is found to have such a microstructure that provides not only better mechanical strength but also higher electrochemical performance.",Influence of doctor blade gap on the properties of tape cast NiO/YSZ anode supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.10.221
