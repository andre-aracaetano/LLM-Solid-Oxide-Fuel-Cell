5,11954,Uniaxial compaction of such powders (without binder addition to the powders) under low uniaxial pressures (rising from 20 to 100 MPa) gave rise to green compacts with high porosity and good mechanical properties.,Elaboration of metallic compacts with high porosity for mechanical supports of SOFC,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2008.09.006
6,11954,"After annealing at 800 degrees C under H(2) atmosphere, the compacts still present interconnected porosity high enough to allow sufficient gas flow to feed a SOFC single cell in hydrogen: the porosity rises from 25 to 50% for iron compacts, from 20 to 50% for cobalt compacts, and is higher than 40% for nickel compacts.",Elaboration of metallic compacts with high porosity for mechanical supports of SOFC,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2008.09.006
