1,1592,"BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY7) exhibits adequate proton conductivity as well as sufficient chemical and thermal stability over a wide range of SOFC operating conditions, while layered GdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta (GBSC) perovskite deposited on a doped ceria electrolyte demonstrates advanced electrochemical properties.",GdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ layered perovskite as promising cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.02.169
2,1592,This research fully takes advantage of these advanced properties and develops novel protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells (PCMFCs) of Ni-BZCY7 vertical bar BZCY7 vertical bar GBSC.,GdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ layered perovskite as promising cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.02.169
3,1592,"The results show that the open-circuit potential of 1.003 V. maximum power density of 430 mW cm(-2), and a low polarization resistance of the electrodes of 0.08 Omega cm(2) are achieved at 700 degrees C. With temperature increases, the total cell resistance decreases, among which electrolyte resistance becomes increasingly dominant over polarization resistance.",GdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ layered perovskite as promising cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.02.169
4,1592,"The results also indicate that GBSC perovskite cathode is a good candidate for intermediate temperature PCMFC development, while the developed Ni-BZCY7 vertical bar BZCY7 vertical bar GBSC cell is a promising functional material system for next generation SOFCs.",GdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ layered perovskite as promising cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.02.169
