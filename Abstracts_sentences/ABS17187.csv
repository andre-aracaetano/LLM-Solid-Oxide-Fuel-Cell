2,17187,"Colloidal dispersed homogeneous mixtures of commercial, submicron Bi2O3, Al2O3 and CaCO3 powders were used to fabricate mullite-type Bi2Al4O9 and (Bi,Ca)(2)Al4O9 by means of reaction sintering in the solid state or in liquid-phase assisted processes.","Synthesis and electrical conductivity of mullite-type Bi2Al4O9 and (Bi,Ca)2Al4O9 ceramics",10.3139/146.110720
3,17187,"The products were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and the sintering density was compared to two conventional sintering runs.","Synthesis and electrical conductivity of mullite-type Bi2Al4O9 and (Bi,Ca)2Al4O9 ceramics",10.3139/146.110720
4,17187,"This showed that the formation of the mullite-type Bi2Al4O9 proceeds via dissolution of Al2O3 in Bi2O3 at the temperatures > 750 degrees C. Details on the formation mechanisms of mullite phase, electrical conductivity versus the residual gamma-Bi24Al2O39 phase, and effects of Ca-dopant are reported.","Synthesis and electrical conductivity of mullite-type Bi2Al4O9 and (Bi,Ca)2Al4O9 ceramics",10.3139/146.110720
