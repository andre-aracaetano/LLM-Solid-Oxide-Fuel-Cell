1,9080,"Stabilized ZrO2.Y2O3 represents one of the most promising materials for technical applications as a solid electrolyte in sensors and fuel cells, since it combines a high ionic conductivity of oxygen with mechanical and chemical resilience.",Oxygen diffusion in nanocrystalline ZrO2,
2,9080,"The question, whether the oxygen conductivity can be further enhanced by nanostructurization, is of key importance for the development of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), as lower operating temperatures greatly improve the efficiency and working lifespan.",Oxygen diffusion in nanocrystalline ZrO2,
3,9080,"The oxygen self-diffusion has been studied on highly dense, nanocrystalline specimens of both un-doped and Y2O3 alloyed ZrO2 using O-18 as a tracer and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS).",Oxygen diffusion in nanocrystalline ZrO2,
4,9080,The results of tracer diffusion studies will be discussed in context of recent studies on the electric conductivity and diffusion data from literature and focusing on the role of grain boundaries.,Oxygen diffusion in nanocrystalline ZrO2,
