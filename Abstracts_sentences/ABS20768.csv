5,20768,"The DRT calculation may identify the number of processes occurring, as well as their respective resistivity and characteristic timescale, and may resolve processes which have relatively similar timescales.",Application of finite Gaussian process distribution of relaxation times on SOFC electrodes,10.1016/j.elecom.2023.107458
6,20768,"Using a nonparametric tool known as Gaussian process (GP) regression, we showcase a method of finding a unique solution to the ill-posed DRT problem by optimising kernel hyperparameters as opposed to ad-hoc regularisation.",Application of finite Gaussian process distribution of relaxation times on SOFC electrodes,10.1016/j.elecom.2023.107458
7,20768,"In this work, we use finite GP regression under inequality constraints (fGP) to analysed EIS data generated by a (Ni/CGO|CGO|YSZ|Reference Cathode) solid-oxide fuel cell in a gas mixture of 0.5 bar H2/0.5 bar H2O and at a temperature of 600 degrees C. By varying the current density, we can characterise the current-voltage relationship of the electrode and shed light on the re-action mechanism governing charge transfer at the solid-gas interface.",Application of finite Gaussian process distribution of relaxation times on SOFC electrodes,10.1016/j.elecom.2023.107458
