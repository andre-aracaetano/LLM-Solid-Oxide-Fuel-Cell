2,15698,"The structural characteristics, thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), dilatometry, DC four-terminal method, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques.","Characterization and electrochemical performance of (Ba0.6Sr0.4)1-xLaxCo0.6Fe0.4O3-δ (x=0, 0.1) cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.materresbull.2010.05.002
3,15698,"The TEC of (Ba0.6Sr0.4)(0.9)La0.1Co0.4Fe0.6O3-delta (BSLCF) was 14.9 x 10(-6) K-1 at 30-800 degrees C, lower than Ba0.6Sr0.4Co0.4Fe0.6O3-delta (BSCF) of 15.6 x 10(-6) K-1.","Characterization and electrochemical performance of (Ba0.6Sr0.4)1-xLaxCo0.6Fe0.4O3-δ (x=0, 0.1) cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.materresbull.2010.05.002
4,15698,"The electrical conductivity of BSCF was improved by La-doping, e.g. a value of 122 S cm-(1) for BSLCF vs. 52 S cm(-1) for BSCF at 500 degrees C, respectively.","Characterization and electrochemical performance of (Ba0.6Sr0.4)1-xLaxCo0.6Fe0.4O3-δ (x=0, 0.1) cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.materresbull.2010.05.002
