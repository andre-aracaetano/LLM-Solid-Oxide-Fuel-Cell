2,11776,Lifetime and durability associated with solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology is strongly related to the amount of contaminants that reach the stack.,Damage of Siloxanes on Ni-YSZ Anode Supported SOFC Operated on Hydrogen and Bio-Syngas,10.1002/fuce.201400185
3,11776,Several experiments on Ni anode-supported (AS) single cells are performed in order to clarify the mechanism of degradation and also the possibility of cell performance recovery.,Damage of Siloxanes on Ni-YSZ Anode Supported SOFC Operated on Hydrogen and Bio-Syngas,10.1002/fuce.201400185
4,11776,"Three experiments focus on the degradation and recovery of AS Ni-YSZ fed with H-2, co-feeding 5 ppm D4-siloxane (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, C8H24O4Si4) as representative compound for the organic silicon species, at 800 degrees",Damage of Siloxanes on Ni-YSZ Anode Supported SOFC Operated on Hydrogen and Bio-Syngas,10.1002/fuce.201400185
