2,18394,"LSM-YSZ composite electrodes are prepared by infiltrating pre-sintered YSZ scaffold with LSM nitrate solution, followed by heat-treatment at 900 or 1100 degrees C.","Reasons for the high stability of nano-structured (La,Sr)MnO3 infiltrated Y2O3-ZrO2 composite oxygen electrodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.033
3,18394,"The electrodes heat-treated at 900 degrees C exhibit an electrode polarization resistance as low as 0.21 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C and are relatively stable under electrolysis operation at 500 mA cm(-2) for 100 h, while the electrodes heat-treated at 1100 degrees C show the increased stability with the electrolysis polarization.","Reasons for the high stability of nano-structured (La,Sr)MnO3 infiltrated Y2O3-ZrO2 composite oxygen electrodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.033
4,18394,"The results clearly indicate that LSM lattice shrinkage under anodic electrolysis conditions inhibits the agglomeration and grain growth of infiltrated LSM nanoparticles, leading to the highly stable nano-structured LSM-YSZ electrode structure.","Reasons for the high stability of nano-structured (La,Sr)MnO3 infiltrated Y2O3-ZrO2 composite oxygen electrodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.033
