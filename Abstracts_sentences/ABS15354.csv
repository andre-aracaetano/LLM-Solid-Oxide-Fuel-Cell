1,15354,"Cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electro-chemical impedance have been used for the analysis of the following medium temperature half-cells: Ce(0.85)Sm(0.15)O(1.925)vertical bar La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta, Ce(0.85)Sm(0.15)O(1.925)vertical bar Pr0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta and Ce(0.85)Sm(0.15)O(1.925)vertical bar Gd0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta.","Electrochemical characteristics of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ, Pr0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and Gd0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ on Ce0.85Sm0.15O1.925 electrolyte",10.1007/s10008-005-0040-8
2,15354,The influence of the atomic mass of the A-site cation in the perovskite cathode on the oxygen reduction kinetics has been discussed.,"Electrochemical characteristics of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ, Pr0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and Gd0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ on Ce0.85Sm0.15O1.925 electrolyte",10.1007/s10008-005-0040-8
3,15354,"The total polarisation resistance, obtained from the Z, Z'-plots, increases with the rise of atomic mass of the cation in the A-site position.","Electrochemical characteristics of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ, Pr0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and Gd0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ on Ce0.85Sm0.15O1.925 electrolyte",10.1007/s10008-005-0040-8
4,15354,"Two different time constants have been obtained for the oxygen electroreduction process, and the replacement of La3+ by Gd3+ in the cathode material decreases somewhat the surface catalytic activity, but the noticeably higher low-frequency series resistance, i.e. mainly diffusion-like mass transfer resistance, values have been obtained.","Electrochemical characteristics of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ, Pr0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and Gd0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ on Ce0.85Sm0.15O1.925 electrolyte",10.1007/s10008-005-0040-8
5,15354,"However, the mainly diffusion-limited process at T <= 773 K for Gd0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta and the kinetically mixed process (diffusion + charge transfer) for Pr0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta have been established.","Electrochemical characteristics of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ, Pr0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and Gd0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ on Ce0.85Sm0.15O1.925 electrolyte",10.1007/s10008-005-0040-8
6,15354,"At higher temperature (T >= 993 K) and more negative potentials, the O-2 reduction process is limited mainly by the heterogeneous charge transfer step.","Electrochemical characteristics of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ, Pr0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and Gd0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ on Ce0.85Sm0.15O1.925 electrolyte",10.1007/s10008-005-0040-8
