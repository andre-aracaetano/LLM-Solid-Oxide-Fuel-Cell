1,17531,"The effect of synthesis condition, such as calcining temperature and grinding, on the sinterability and electrical conductivity were investigated for the perovskite-type oxides which are expressed as (La1-xCax+y) CrO3 (x=0-0.5, y=0-0.2).","Property of (La, Ca)CrO3 for interconnect in solid oxide fuel cell (Part 1) -: Sintering characteristic and electrical conductivity",10.2109/jcersj.108.1264_1103
2,17531,"The sinterability depended on the calcium content (x), A-site excess amount (y), calcining temperature, and ball-milling procedure.","Property of (La, Ca)CrO3 for interconnect in solid oxide fuel cell (Part 1) -: Sintering characteristic and electrical conductivity",10.2109/jcersj.108.1264_1103
3,17531,"(La1-xCax) CrO3 (x=0.2-0.3) without A-site excess (y=0) showed high sinterability by bring in air at 1300 degreesC, provided that the calcining temperature was above 1000 degreesC and that subsequent ball-milling was adopted.","Property of (La, Ca)CrO3 for interconnect in solid oxide fuel cell (Part 1) -: Sintering characteristic and electrical conductivity",10.2109/jcersj.108.1264_1103
4,17531,The electrical conductivity at 1000 degreesC (1273 K) also strongly depended on the calcium content (x) and A-site excess amount (y).,"Property of (La, Ca)CrO3 for interconnect in solid oxide fuel cell (Part 1) -: Sintering characteristic and electrical conductivity",10.2109/jcersj.108.1264_1103
5,17531,"The electrical conductivity was proportional to the calcium content (x) in the compositional range of x=0-0.4, y=0.","Property of (La, Ca)CrO3 for interconnect in solid oxide fuel cell (Part 1) -: Sintering characteristic and electrical conductivity",10.2109/jcersj.108.1264_1103
