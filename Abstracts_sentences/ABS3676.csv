1,3676,"Multifunctional roles of La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 (LSCT) perovskite material as anode, cathode, and electrolyte for low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC) are discovered for the first time, and have been investigated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and fuel cell (FC) measurements.",All in One Multifunctional Perovskite Material for Next Generation SOFC,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.061
2,3676,LSCT resistance decreases prominently in FC environment as shown in this study.,All in One Multifunctional Perovskite Material for Next Generation SOFC,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.061
3,3676,An improved performance was observed by compositing LSCT with samaria doped ceria (SDC) at 550 degrees C when the FC power density increased from tens of mW cm(-2) for the pure LSCT system up to hundreds of mW cm(-2).,All in One Multifunctional Perovskite Material for Next Generation SOFC,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.061
