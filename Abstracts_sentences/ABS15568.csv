1,15568,The performance of low-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) is heavily dependent on the electrocatalytic activity of the cathode toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).,Pr2BaNiMnO7-δ double-layered Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides as efficient cathode electrocatalysts for low temperature proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta11212j
2,15568,"To overcome the obstacles of the poor activity and stability of traditional cathode materials, a Pr2BaNiMnO7-delta double-layered Ruddlesden-Popper structural oxide was developed that exhibits high ORR activity, exceptional low-temperature cell performance, long-term stability, and excellent chemical compatability with a BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) proton-conducting electrolyte.",Pr2BaNiMnO7-δ double-layered Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides as efficient cathode electrocatalysts for low temperature proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta11212j
