3,15609,"A distinct transient liquid phase forms during the sintering process, which spreads into a uniform layer and covers the grain boundaries, thereby enhancing densification.","A modified liquid-phase-assisted sintering mechanism for La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xFexO3-δ-A high density, redox-stable perovskite interconnect for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.012
4,15609,"Additionally, it is determined that the amount of liquid phase formed during liquid-phase-assisted sintering significantly affects the densification of doped lanthanum chromites.","A modified liquid-phase-assisted sintering mechanism for La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xFexO3-δ-A high density, redox-stable perovskite interconnect for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.012
5,15609,"Relative densities of 94.6% and 96.6% are successfully obtained for La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.6Fe0.4O3-delta and La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-delta, respectively.","A modified liquid-phase-assisted sintering mechanism for La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xFexO3-δ-A high density, redox-stable perovskite interconnect for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.012
6,15609,"Furthermore, these compounds are also redox-stable after being heated to 900 degrees C in flowing H-2 for 6 h. The electrical conductivity increases with Fe-doping levels, and the conductivity of La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-delta is measured to be 21.88 S cm(-1) in air and 6.45 S cm(-1) in 5% H-2/Ar at 800 degrees C. Therefore, dense La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-delta is a promising interconnect alternative for solid oxide fuel cells.","A modified liquid-phase-assisted sintering mechanism for La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xFexO3-δ-A high density, redox-stable perovskite interconnect for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.012
