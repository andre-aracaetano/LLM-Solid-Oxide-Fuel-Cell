5,12328,"To determine the contribution of grains, sigma (g) and grain boundaries, sigma (gb) to the total conductivity, sigma (t) impedance is measured in the frequency range 1-1 MHz at different steady temperatures in the range 250-500 A degrees C. It has been found that conductivity of the co-doped composition is more than singly doped with Al but less than singly doped lanthanum composition.",Preparation and characterization of Al and La co-doped (Ce1-x-y Al x LayO2-(x+y)/2) ceria,10.1007/s11581-012-0698-8
