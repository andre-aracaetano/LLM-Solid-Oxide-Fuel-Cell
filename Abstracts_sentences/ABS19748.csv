2,19748,"The electrolyte was Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 (YSZ), the anode NiO/YSZ and the cathode La0.75Sr0.2MnO3-delta.",The influence of electrodes on the strength of planar zirconia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004833909780
3,19748,The residual stress in the electrodes was estimated by curvature measurement after removal of one electrode.,The influence of electrodes on the strength of planar zirconia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004833909780
4,19748,The residual stress in the anodes was very low (11 MPa) due to stress relief by extensive channel cracking.,The influence of electrodes on the strength of planar zirconia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004833909780
5,19748,The residual stress in the cathodes was much higher (39 MPa) and was in reasonable agreement with the expected thermoelastic stress.,The influence of electrodes on the strength of planar zirconia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004833909780
6,19748,"The applied load at failure, and the stress in the electrolyte at failure (343 MPa), for anode MEAs were almost equal to those of electrolyte plates (374 MPa).",The influence of electrodes on the strength of planar zirconia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004833909780
7,19748,This is consistent with the low residual stress and observed crack deflection by delamination at the anode/electrolyte interface.,The influence of electrodes on the strength of planar zirconia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004833909780
8,19748,"The applied load at failure, and the stress in the electrolyte at failure (182 MPa), for cathode MEAs were much lower.",The influence of electrodes on the strength of planar zirconia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004833909780
9,19748,"This is partially explained by the residual stress in the cathode acting to increase the applied stress intensity at defects in the electrolyte, but this effect is not large enough to explain fully the reduced strength.",The influence of electrodes on the strength of planar zirconia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004833909780
