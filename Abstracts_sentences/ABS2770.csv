1,2770,The electrochemical performance of two different anode supported tubular cells (50:50 wt% NiO:YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) or 34:66 vol.% Ni:YSZ) as the fuel electrode and YSZ as the electrolyte) under SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) and SOEC (solid oxide electrolysis cell) modes were studied in this research.,The effect of electrode infiltration on the performance of tubular solid oxide fuel cells under electrolysis and fuel cell modes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.071
2,2770,"LSM (La0.80Sr0.20MnO3-delta) was infiltrated into a thin porous YSZ layer to form the oxygen electrode of both cells and, in addition, SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9) was infiltrated into the fuel electrode of one of the cells.",The effect of electrode infiltration on the performance of tubular solid oxide fuel cells under electrolysis and fuel cell modes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.071
3,2770,The microstructure of the infiltrated fuel cells showed a suitable distribution of fine LSM and SDC particles (50-100 nm) near the interface of electrodes and electrolyte and throughout the bulk of the electrodes.,The effect of electrode infiltration on the performance of tubular solid oxide fuel cells under electrolysis and fuel cell modes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.071
4,2770,The results show that SDC infiltration not only enhances the electrochemical reaction in SOFC mode but improves the performance even more in SOEC mode.,The effect of electrode infiltration on the performance of tubular solid oxide fuel cells under electrolysis and fuel cell modes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.071
5,2770,"In addition, LSM infiltrated electrodes also boost the SOEC performance in comparison with standard LSM YSZ composite electrodes, due to the well-dispersed LSM nanoparticles (favouring the electrochemical reactions) within the YSZ porous matrix.",The effect of electrode infiltration on the performance of tubular solid oxide fuel cells under electrolysis and fuel cell modes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.071
