2,16411,"In this study, nanocrystalline CGO thin films (with thickness ranging from 0.3 to 1.35 mu m) were deposited from a Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta target by electron-beam physical vapour deposition onto a selection of substrates (Si, glass, fused silica and Al2O3) which were either maintained at room temperature or at 700 degrees C during deposition.",Electrical properties of nanometric CGO-thin films prepared by electron-beam physical vapour deposition,10.1039/c3ta15274j
3,16411,Films have a columnar microstructure with (111) texture in the surface plane.,Electrical properties of nanometric CGO-thin films prepared by electron-beam physical vapour deposition,10.1039/c3ta15274j
4,16411,The crystallinity of the films deposited at a substrate temperature of 700 degrees C was found to be much superior to those deposited at RT and subsequently heated.,Electrical properties of nanometric CGO-thin films prepared by electron-beam physical vapour deposition,10.1039/c3ta15274j
5,16411,"Impedance spectroscopy revealed that the in-plane resistivity of the films in air at 900 degrees C is greater than that of bulk CGO by around two orders of magnitude, with this difference increasing with decreasing temperature.",Electrical properties of nanometric CGO-thin films prepared by electron-beam physical vapour deposition,10.1039/c3ta15274j
6,16411,The poor electrical properties of the nanocrystalline films may be considerably affected by the expected higher concentration of strains in comparison with the micrometric sample.,Electrical properties of nanometric CGO-thin films prepared by electron-beam physical vapour deposition,10.1039/c3ta15274j
7,16411,The composition of the thin films was also affected by a de-doping process.,Electrical properties of nanometric CGO-thin films prepared by electron-beam physical vapour deposition,10.1039/c3ta15274j
8,16411,"The in-plane charge transport in films is limited by grain boundaries, mainly due to both a greater grain-boundary volume and higher specific grain-boundary resistivity.",Electrical properties of nanometric CGO-thin films prepared by electron-beam physical vapour deposition,10.1039/c3ta15274j
9,16411,Conductivity measurements as a function of oxygen partial pressure reveal a considerably narrower electrolytic domain for the thin films than that of bulk CGO.,Electrical properties of nanometric CGO-thin films prepared by electron-beam physical vapour deposition,10.1039/c3ta15274j
