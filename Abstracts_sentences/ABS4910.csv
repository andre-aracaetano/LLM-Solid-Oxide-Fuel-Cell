1,4910,The effect of Mn alloying on PdO powder and Pd-impregnated Pd + YSZ cathode for the O-2 reduction reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells had been studied in detail.,Mn-Stabilised Microstructure and Performance of Pd-impregnated YSZ Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800078
2,4910,"The microstructure, thermal stability, electrochemical activity and performance stability of the powder and cathode were analysed using thermal gravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",Mn-Stabilised Microstructure and Performance of Pd-impregnated YSZ Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800078
3,4910,"The results indicate that an addition of 5 moL% Mn effectively inhibits the growth and coalescence of Pd and PdO particles at high temperatures and stabilises the microstructure of the powders and the electrode; as a consequence, the electrochemical performance and stability of the cathode are significantly improved.",Mn-Stabilised Microstructure and Performance of Pd-impregnated YSZ Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800078
4,4910,The electrochemical performance of the Pd + YSZ and Pd0.95Mn0.05 + YSZ cathodes so prepared is much better than that of the conventional LSM-based cathodes and is also comparable with the mixed ionic and electronic conducting oxide cathodes such as LSCF,Mn-Stabilised Microstructure and Performance of Pd-impregnated YSZ Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.200800078
