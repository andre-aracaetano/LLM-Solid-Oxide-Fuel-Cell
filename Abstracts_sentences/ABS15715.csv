2,15715,"Comparison of measured ohmic resistances of chromium- (CFY) and ferritic-based alloy (Crofer) MICs at 850 degrees C in air with the growth of mean oxide scale thicknesses, obtained from SEM cross section images, reveals a non-trivial, non-linear relationship.",Model-based prediction of the ohmic resistance of metallic interconnects from oxide scale growth based on scanning electron microscopy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.08.098
3,15715,"To understand the correlation between scale evolution and resulting ohmic losses, 2D finite element (FE) simulations of electrical current distributions have been performed for a large number of real oxide scale morphologies.",Model-based prediction of the ohmic resistance of metallic interconnects from oxide scale growth based on scanning electron microscopy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.08.098
4,15715,"It turns out that typical morphologies favor nonhomogeneous electrical current distributions, where the main current flows over rather few bridges, i.e. local spots with relatively thin oxide scales.",Model-based prediction of the ohmic resistance of metallic interconnects from oxide scale growth based on scanning electron microscopy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.08.098
5,15715,These current-bridges are the main reason for the non-linear dependence of ohmic losses on the corresponding oxide scale morphology.,Model-based prediction of the ohmic resistance of metallic interconnects from oxide scale growth based on scanning electron microscopy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.08.098
6,15715,Combining electrical conductivity and SEM measurements with FE simulations revealed two further advantages: it permits a more reliable extrapolation of MIC-degradation data over the whole stack lifetime and it provides a method to assess the effective electrical conductivity of thermally grown Cr2O3 scales under stack operation.,Model-based prediction of the ohmic resistance of metallic interconnects from oxide scale growth based on scanning electron microscopy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.08.098
