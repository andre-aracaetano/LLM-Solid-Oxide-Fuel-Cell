1,8403,"With the goal of improving the electrochemical performance while maintaining good phase stability, the Fe-substituted swedenborgite-type Y0.9In0.1BaCo3Zn1 (-) (x)nFe(x)O(7) (+) (delta) series of oxides have been investigated as cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","High-performance Y0.9In0.1BaCo3(Zn,Fe)O7 + δ swedenborgite-type oxide cathodes for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.027
2,8403,All the samples with 0 <= x <= 0.8 were obtained as single-phase oxides with the P31c space group.,"High-performance Y0.9In0.1BaCo3(Zn,Fe)O7 + δ swedenborgite-type oxide cathodes for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.027
3,8403,"Both the x = 0 and 0.2 samples were stable after 120 h exposure to 600, 700, and 800 degrees C, while the x = 0.6 and 0.8 samples showed instability at 700 and 800 degrees C.","High-performance Y0.9In0.1BaCo3(Zn,Fe)O7 + δ swedenborgite-type oxide cathodes for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.027
4,8403,"The x = 0.4 sample was stable at 600 and 800 degrees C, but generated a BaCoO3 impurity phase at 700 degrees C.","High-performance Y0.9In0.1BaCo3(Zn,Fe)O7 + δ swedenborgite-type oxide cathodes for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.027
5,8403,The reversible oxygen absorption tendency of these materials was found to increase with increasing Fe content.,"High-performance Y0.9In0.1BaCo3(Zn,Fe)O7 + δ swedenborgite-type oxide cathodes for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.027
6,8403,Increasing the Fe content in the range of 0 <= x <= 0.4 was found to reduce the polarization resistance in the Y0.3In0.1BaCo3Zn1 (-) xFexO7 (+) (delta) +,"High-performance Y0.9In0.1BaCo3(Zn,Fe)O7 + δ swedenborgite-type oxide cathodes for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.027
7,8403,"Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite cathodes, and the x = 0.4 sample was found to have performance superior to that of the well-studied Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (-) (delta) (BSCF) cathode in the range of 400-700 degrees C, making it an attractive cathode candidate for intermediate temperature SOFCs.","High-performance Y0.9In0.1BaCo3(Zn,Fe)O7 + δ swedenborgite-type oxide cathodes for reduced temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.027
