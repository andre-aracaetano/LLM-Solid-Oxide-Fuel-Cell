8,19700,"Pr comprised a single fluorite phase that turned out to be inhomogeneous with some close cation content distribution, which could be seen in the oxygen incorporation region upon heating in a synthetic air flow after thermocycling in an inert gas flow.",In Situ Synchrotron XRD Study of the Pr-Ce-Ni-O System,10.1134/S1027451023060137
9,19700,It is seen under these conditions since the fluorite lattice parameter is sensitive to oxygen release (a sharp increase in the lattice parameters) and oxygen incorporation (a sharp decrease in the lattice parameters).,In Situ Synchrotron XRD Study of the Pr-Ce-Ni-O System,10.1134/S1027451023060137
