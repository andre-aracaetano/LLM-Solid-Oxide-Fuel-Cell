1,15699,"To further understand the suitability of Ni-Cr-base alloys for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) interconnect applications, three commercial Ni-Crbase alloys, Haynes 230, Hastelloy S and Haynes 242 were selected and evaluated for oxidation behavior under different exposure conditions, scale conductivity and thermal expansion.",Evaluation of Ni-Cr-base alloys for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.099
2,15699,"Haynes 230 and Hastelloy S, which have a relatively high Cr content, formed a thin scale mainly comprised of Cr2O3 and (Mn,CrNi)(3)O-4 spinels under SOFC operating conditions, demonstrating excellent oxidation resistance and a high scale electrical conductivity.",Evaluation of Ni-Cr-base alloys for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.099
3,15699,"In contrast, a thick double-layer scale with a NiO outer layer above a chromia-rich substrate was grown on Haynes 242 in moist air or at the air side of dual exposure samples, indicating limited oxidation resistance for the interconnect application.",Evaluation of Ni-Cr-base alloys for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.099
4,15699,"With a face-centered-cubic (FCC) substrate, all three alloys possess a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is higher than that of candidate ferritic stainless steels, e.g. Crofer-22 APU.",Evaluation of Ni-Cr-base alloys for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.099
5,15699,"Among the three alloys, Haynes 242, which is heavily alloyed with W and Mo and contains a low Cr content, demonstrated the lowest average CTE at 13.1 x 10(-6) K-1 from room temperature to 800 degrees C, but it was also observed that the CTE behavior of Haynes 242 was very non-linear.",Evaluation of Ni-Cr-base alloys for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.099
