1,14968,"Ni-catalyst-based anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating with H-2 fuel are highly efficient, low-emission, electrochemical energy conversion devices.","Hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with surface-modified, hydroxylated Sn/Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 heterogeneous catalyst anode",10.1039/c4ta02662d
2,14968,"However, the economical production of hydrogen is a challenge, and there is immense interest to use hydrocarbon fuels directly with SOFC.","Hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with surface-modified, hydroxylated Sn/Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 heterogeneous catalyst anode",10.1039/c4ta02662d
3,14968,"Unfortunately, the solid-carbon generated continuously by hydrocarbon cracking accumulates on the Ni-metal surface and leads to rapid decline in performance.","Hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with surface-modified, hydroxylated Sn/Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 heterogeneous catalyst anode",10.1039/c4ta02662d
4,14968,"We show here that 1 atom% Sn (with respect to Ni) incorporated onto a surface-modified Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC) cermet anode with extended three-phase boundaries, where O2- ions, electrons, and fuels get together, acts as an excellent decoking agent.","Hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with surface-modified, hydroxylated Sn/Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 heterogeneous catalyst anode",10.1039/c4ta02662d
5,14968,"The hydrophilic Sn doped on the surface of Ni is hydrated and hydroxylated by reacting with the water vapour produced by the electrochemical oxidation of the fuel, and the hydroxyl groups aid the oxidation of neighbouring carbon and drive off as CO2.","Hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with surface-modified, hydroxylated Sn/Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 heterogeneous catalyst anode",10.1039/c4ta02662d
6,14968,"Moreover, the enlarged three-phase boundaries of the anode allow 02 ions to rapidly reach the deposited carbon as well as the hydrocarbon gas and electrochemically oxidize them.","Hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with surface-modified, hydroxylated Sn/Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 heterogeneous catalyst anode",10.1039/c4ta02662d
7,14968,"With this modified Sn/Ni-GDC catalyst anode, GDC electrolyte, and La(0.6)Sr(0.4)ACo(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) cathode, more than 200 h of operation with a methane-fueled SOFC is demonstrated here.","Hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with surface-modified, hydroxylated Sn/Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 heterogeneous catalyst anode",10.1039/c4ta02662d
