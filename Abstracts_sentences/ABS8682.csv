2,8682,Co-precipitation method has been adopted to prepare nano-sized BZCYYb precursors with an average particle size of 30 nm.,Two-step sintering of ultrafine-grained barium cerate proton conducting ceramics,10.1016/j.electacta.2012.09.007
3,8682,"By controlling the sintering profile, an average grain size of 184 nm was obtained for dense BZCYYb ceramics via the two-step sintering method, compared to 445 nm for the conventional sintered samples.",Two-step sintering of ultrafine-grained barium cerate proton conducting ceramics,10.1016/j.electacta.2012.09.007
4,8682,The two-step sintered BZCYYb samples showed less impurity and an enhanced electrical conductivity compared with the conventional sintered ones.,Two-step sintering of ultrafine-grained barium cerate proton conducting ceramics,10.1016/j.electacta.2012.09.007
5,8682,"Further, the two-step sintering method was applied to fabricate anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using BZCYYb as the electrolyte, resulting in dense ultrafine-grained electrolyte membranes and porous anode substrates with fine particles.",Two-step sintering of ultrafine-grained barium cerate proton conducting ceramics,10.1016/j.electacta.2012.09.007
6,8682,"Due to the reduced ohmic as well as polarization resistances, the maximum power output of the cells fabricated from the two-step sintering method reached 349 mW m(-2) at 700 degrees C, significantly improved from 172 mW cm(-2) for the conventional sintered cells, suggesting that two-step sintering method is very promising for optimizing the microstructure and thus enhancing the electrochemical performances for barium cerate based proton-conducting SOFCs.",Two-step sintering of ultrafine-grained barium cerate proton conducting ceramics,10.1016/j.electacta.2012.09.007
