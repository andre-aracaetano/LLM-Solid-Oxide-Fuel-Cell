4,3820,It was validated against published data for operation on natural gas.,Simulation of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack Operating on Biomass Syngas Using Aspen Plus,10.1149/1.3407524
5,3820,"Operating parameters such as fuel and air utilization factor (U-f and U-a, respectively), current density j, and steam to carbon ratio (STCR) were varied and had significant influence.",Simulation of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack Operating on Biomass Syngas Using Aspen Plus,10.1149/1.3407524
6,3820,The model was run on wood and miscanthus syngas.,Simulation of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack Operating on Biomass Syngas Using Aspen Plus,10.1149/1.3407524
7,3820,"The results indicated that there must be a trade-off between voltage, efficiency, and power with respect to j and that the stack should be operated at a low STCR and a high U-f. Also, the stack should be operated at a U-a of similar to 20%.",Simulation of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack Operating on Biomass Syngas Using Aspen Plus,10.1149/1.3407524
