6,19073,Based on the constriction resistance occurring in the electrolyte a model was developed which provides an estimate for the width of the active three-phase boundary zone.,Electrode properties of Sr-doped LaMnO3 on yttria-stabilized zirconia .1. Three-phase boundary area,10.1149/1.1837374
7,19073,This zone is most likely to extend outside the cathode particle across the zirconia surface.,Electrode properties of Sr-doped LaMnO3 on yttria-stabilized zirconia .1. Three-phase boundary area,10.1149/1.1837374
8,19073,The width calculated in this way was found to vary in the range of 0.03 to 0.07 mu m for the different electrode microstructures.,Electrode properties of Sr-doped LaMnO3 on yttria-stabilized zirconia .1. Three-phase boundary area,10.1149/1.1837374
9,19073,It is argued that the actual values may be smaller by one or two orders of magnitude.,Electrode properties of Sr-doped LaMnO3 on yttria-stabilized zirconia .1. Three-phase boundary area,10.1149/1.1837374
