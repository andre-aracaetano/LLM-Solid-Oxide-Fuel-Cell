1,2511,This work suggests a method for obtaining heat-resistant protective coatings for 08Kh17T stainless steel that can be used as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells.,Development of SOFC Interconnects Based on Industrial Steels with Oxide Coating,10.3390/en16031237
2,2511,"The suggested approach is based on the layer-by-layer precipitation of nickel, cobalt, and manganese, followed by heat treatment in a vacuum and oxidizing atmosphere.",Development of SOFC Interconnects Based on Industrial Steels with Oxide Coating,10.3390/en16031237
3,2511,XRD results show that the coatings consist of a mixture of metal oxides and compounds with a spinel structure.,Development of SOFC Interconnects Based on Industrial Steels with Oxide Coating,10.3390/en16031237
4,2511,The obtained coatings demonstrate high resistance to high-temperature oxidation for 100 h. The coating with the ratio of the thicknesses of the cobalt and manganese layers of 1.5/0.5 mu m obtained by electrodeposition is the most stable.,Development of SOFC Interconnects Based on Industrial Steels with Oxide Coating,10.3390/en16031237
5,2511,"The specific electrical resistance of this coating is 3.50 center dot 10(-3) omega center dot cm(2) after 100 h of exposure at 850 degrees C, which meets the requirements for SOFC interconnect materials.",Development of SOFC Interconnects Based on Industrial Steels with Oxide Coating,10.3390/en16031237
