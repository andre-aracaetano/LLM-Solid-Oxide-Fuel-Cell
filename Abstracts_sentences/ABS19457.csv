2,19457,"Normally, there are two pathways of oxygen reaction in porous LSCF: in reaction region with oxygen exchanging at electrode/air interface, and around electrode/electrolyte interface with oxygen exchanging at electrode/electrolyte/air triple-phase boundary (TPB).",Kinetics of oxygen reaction in porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.071

4,19457,"In addition, because the formation of LSCF/GDC interface increases the length of TPB and affects the geometry of reaction region, oxygen reaction in LSCF-GDC tends to proceed in the TPB pathway.",Kinetics of oxygen reaction in porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.071
5,19457,"The performance and oxygen reactions of LSCF-GDC are evaluated at 650 degrees C and 850 degrees C. Oxygen reaction in LSCF-GDC is suppressed by CO2, but increasing GDC content is able to improve the CO2 tolerance of electrode.",Kinetics of oxygen reaction in porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.071
