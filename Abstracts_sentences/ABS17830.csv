1,17830,The gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) is considered as one of the most promising electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,"Studies on structural, morphological and electrical properties of Ce1-xGdxO2-(x/2)",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.10.028
2,17830,"Since the operating temperature of SOFC mainly depends on properties of electrolytes, the structural, morphological and electrical properties of GDC are studied as a function of concentration of 'Gd' and sintering temperature.","Studies on structural, morphological and electrical properties of Ce1-xGdxO2-(x/2)",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.10.028
3,17830,"The lattice parameter, density, surface morphology and conductivity of GDC samples are improved upon sintering.","Studies on structural, morphological and electrical properties of Ce1-xGdxO2-(x/2)",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.10.028
4,17830,Further an increase in lattice parameter with concentration of Gd confirms the dissolution of Gd2O3 in CeO2.,"Studies on structural, morphological and electrical properties of Ce1-xGdxO2-(x/2)",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.10.028
5,17830,The crystallite size and grain size was observed to decrease with Gd concentration.,"Studies on structural, morphological and electrical properties of Ce1-xGdxO2-(x/2)",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.10.028
6,17830,All GDC samples sintered at 1773 K showed uniform and smoother surfaces with conductivity similar to 0.1 S cm(-1) at 1023 K and activation energies less than 0.9 eV. An impedance study confirms the formation of well-grown grains at higher sintering temperature.,"Studies on structural, morphological and electrical properties of Ce1-xGdxO2-(x/2)",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.10.028
