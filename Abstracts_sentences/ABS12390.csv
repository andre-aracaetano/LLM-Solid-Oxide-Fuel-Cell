1,12390,This paper studies the robustness of off-shore solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) installations and the nature and causes of possible cell degradation in marine environments.,Single-Cell Tests to Explore the Reliability of Sofc Installations Operating Offshore,10.3390/en13071624
2,12390,"Two important, cathode-related, impediments to ensuring SOFC reliability in off-shore installations are: cathode degradation due to salt contamination and oxygen depletion in the air supply.",Single-Cell Tests to Explore the Reliability of Sofc Installations Operating Offshore,10.3390/en13071624
3,12390,"Short-term and long-term tests show the effect of salt contamination in the cathode feed on cell performance, and reveal the underlying cause of the degradation seen.",Single-Cell Tests to Explore the Reliability of Sofc Installations Operating Offshore,10.3390/en13071624

5,12390,analyses made it possible to identify salt taken up in the cathode microstructure after the short-term testing while the macroscopic cell structure remained intact after the short-term tests.,Single-Cell Tests to Explore the Reliability of Sofc Installations Operating Offshore,10.3390/en13071624
6,12390,"The long-term degradation was found to be more severe, and SEM images showed delamination at the cathode/electrolyte interface with salt present, something that was not seen after long-term testing without salt.",Single-Cell Tests to Explore the Reliability of Sofc Installations Operating Offshore,10.3390/en13071624
7,12390,The effect of oxygen depletion on the performance was also determined at three different temperatures using I-V curves.,Single-Cell Tests to Explore the Reliability of Sofc Installations Operating Offshore,10.3390/en13071624
