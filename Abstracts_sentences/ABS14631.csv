1,14631,A hemispherical electrolyte probe (HEP) technique has been adapted and introduced as a method to rapidly characterize potential cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells.,A Hemispherical Electrolyte Probe for Screening of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode Materials,10.1149/2.0341608jes
2,14631,"The technique was used to measure the linear-specific triple phase boundary (TPB) resistance of electronic conductors La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and (La0.87Ca0.13)(0.95)MnO3 (LCM), along with the area-specific surface resistance of mixed ionic/electronic conductors (MIECs) Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3-delta (SSC), and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta (LSFC).",A Hemispherical Electrolyte Probe for Screening of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode Materials,10.1149/2.0341608jes
3,14631,"These parameters are measures of the catalytic performance of the cathode materials, independent of the electrode geometry.",A Hemispherical Electrolyte Probe for Screening of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode Materials,10.1149/2.0341608jes
4,14631,"HEP-measured linear-specific TPB resistance and surface resistance values are consistently lower by a factor of similar to 3 compared with literature values for these materials, while activation energies are in fair agreement with the literature values.",A Hemispherical Electrolyte Probe for Screening of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode Materials,10.1149/2.0341608jes
5,14631,The technique could be useful for comparative rapid screening of candidate cathode materials.,A Hemispherical Electrolyte Probe for Screening of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode Materials,10.1149/2.0341608jes
6,14631,"Alternatively, good estimates of linear-specific TPB resistance or area-specific surface resistance values can be obtained using a HEP probe that has been calibrated with a known standard.",A Hemispherical Electrolyte Probe for Screening of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode Materials,10.1149/2.0341608jes
