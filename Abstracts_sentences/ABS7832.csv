2,7832,"Compared with Pt, Ag current collector results in a decrease of cathode polarization resistance (R-p) by an order of magnitude, which suggests that Ag is electrocatalytically active and not suitable for the use of studying the cathode performance of IT-SOFCs.",A CO2-tolerant La2NiO4+δ-coated PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.12.106
3,7832,"The R-p value of PBSCF-LN cathode is significantly lower than that of PBSCF cathode, no matter whether Pt or Ag current collector is used for the measurement.",A CO2-tolerant La2NiO4+δ-coated PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.12.106
