1,9920,"The effect of Cr deposition and poisoning on the electrochemical activity and microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) electrodes is investigated in detail under open circuit conditions at 900 degrees C, 800 degrees C and 700 degrees C in the presence of a Fe-Cr alloy interconnect.",Cr deposition on porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ electrodes of solid oxide cells under open circuit condition,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.08.018
2,9920,The electrochemical performance of LSCF electrodes for the O-2 reduction reaction (ORR) under solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) mode and for the O-2 evolution reaction (OER) under solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) mode is seriously degraded after exposure to Cr-containing air at open circuit voltage.,Cr deposition on porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ electrodes of solid oxide cells under open circuit condition,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.08.018
3,9920,"SEM, XRD and Raman spectroscopy analyses reveal the formation of SrCrO4 phase and the deposition of a similar to 1 mu m thick Cr deposit layer on the outer surface of LSCF electrodes after exposure to Fe-Cr alloy interconnect at 900 degrees C for 20 h under open circuit conditions, greatly limiting the oxygen exchange and diffusion related processes.",Cr deposition on porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ electrodes of solid oxide cells under open circuit condition,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.08.018

5,9920,The results also confirm that the mechanism of Cr deposition on LSCF electrodes is a chemical process in nature that is initiated most likely by the nucleation reaction between surface segregated SrOx and gaseous Cr species.,Cr deposition on porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ electrodes of solid oxide cells under open circuit condition,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.08.018
