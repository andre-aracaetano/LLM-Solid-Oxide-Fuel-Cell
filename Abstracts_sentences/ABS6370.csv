1,6370,The electrochemical properties and long-term performance of an in-situ composite cathode comprised of SmBa0.5Sr0.5CO2O5+delta (SBSCO) and Ge(0.9)G(0.1)O(2-delta) (CGO91) are investigated for metal supported solid oxide fuel cell (MS-SOFC) application.,Electrochemical properties and durability of in-situ composite cathodes with SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.158
2,6370,The Area Specific Resistance (ASR) of an in-situ composite cathode comprised of 50 wt% of SBSCO and 50 wt% of CG091 (SBSCO:50) is 0.031 Omega cm(2) in the first stage of measurement at 700 degrees C; this value of ASR increases to 0.138 Omega cm(2) after 1000 h. The ASR of SBSCO:50 (in situ sample at 750 degrees C) is 0.014 Omega cm(2) at the initial stage of measurement; the increase of ASR after 1000 h at 750 degrees C is only 0.067 Omega cm(2).,Electrochemical properties and durability of in-situ composite cathodes with SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.158
