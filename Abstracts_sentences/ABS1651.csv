2,1651,"Unfortunately, protonic ceramic fuel cells, which are considered next-generation solid oxide fuel cells operating at lower temperatures (<= 600 degrees C), do not satisfy the requirements.",Electrochemical analysis of high-performance protonic ceramic fuel cells based on a columnar-structured thin electrolyte,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.043
3,1651,"While thin electrolyte and rapid reactions at electrode/electrolyte interfaces are crucial for cell performance, the thickness of the electrolyte via cost-effective ceramic processes is still not satisfactory (currently capable of > 10 mu m) and the electrode reaction (s) are yet to be clarified.",Electrochemical analysis of high-performance protonic ceramic fuel cells based on a columnar-structured thin electrolyte,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.043
4,1651,"Here we demonstrate the fabrication of a columnar-structured thin electrolyte (similar to 2.5 mu m) of BaCe0.55Zr0.3Y0.15O3-delta, in which no perpendicular grain boundaries exist against the current direction, through a low-cost screen printing method.",Electrochemical analysis of high-performance protonic ceramic fuel cells based on a columnar-structured thin electrolyte,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.043
5,1651,"A high open-cell voltage of 1.10 V ensures that the thin electrolyte is sufficiently dense for gas-tightness, thereby achieving an extraordinary maximum power density of 350 mW/cm(2) at 500 degrees C.",Electrochemical analysis of high-performance protonic ceramic fuel cells based on a columnar-structured thin electrolyte,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.043
6,1651,"The electrode reactions are investigated by distribution of relaxation time method based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as a function of oxygen partial pressure and hydrogen partial pressure at 500 degrees C, suggesting that the reaction step corresponding to the surface diffusion of an adsorbed oxygen to the triple phase boundaries at the cathode is most probably the main contributor to the overall polarization resistances.",Electrochemical analysis of high-performance protonic ceramic fuel cells based on a columnar-structured thin electrolyte,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.043
