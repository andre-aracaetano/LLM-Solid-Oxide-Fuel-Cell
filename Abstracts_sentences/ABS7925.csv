1,7925,Porous composite cathode coatings containing (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 (LSM) and ZrO2-12% Y2O3 (YSZ) were prepared by vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) and dame spraying (FS) on prefabricated substrate-based planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with 60 mm in diameter.,Microstructure and polarization resistance of thermally sprayed composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell use,10.1361/105996300770349773
2,7925,"Microstructural observations reveal the open porosity of the cathode coatings and prove qualitatively the compositional gradient from YSZ-LSM I composite to pure I,SM.",Microstructure and polarization resistance of thermally sprayed composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell use,10.1361/105996300770349773
3,7925,The electrochemical behavior was investigated by impedance spectroscopy.,Microstructure and polarization resistance of thermally sprayed composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell use,10.1361/105996300770349773
4,7925,The results of graded cathodes compared with nongradient and bilayered ones are discussed with respect to the cathodic polarization resistance between 750 and 950 degrees C. Bilayered cathodes indicate the lowest cathodic losses followed by the graded ones and the conventional composite.,Microstructure and polarization resistance of thermally sprayed composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell use,10.1361/105996300770349773
5,7925,Flame spraying as a rarely used processing tool for SOFC components can provide cathodes of high electrochemical performance.,Microstructure and polarization resistance of thermally sprayed composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell use,10.1361/105996300770349773
