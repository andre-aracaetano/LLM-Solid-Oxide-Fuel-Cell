1,18258,A technical description and experimental analysis of a SOFC demonstration unit is presented.,Experimental Analysis on Performance and Durability of SOFC Demonstration Unit,10.1002/fuce.200900152
2,18258,"The unit contains most of the primary BoP-components of a complete SOFC system, except of air and fuel recirculation equipment or fuel system compressor.",Experimental Analysis on Performance and Durability of SOFC Demonstration Unit,10.1002/fuce.200900152
3,18258,Natural gas is used as the fuel and electricity is supplied to the electric grid.,Experimental Analysis on Performance and Durability of SOFC Demonstration Unit,10.1002/fuce.200900152
4,18258,"A 5 kW power class planar SOFC stack from Research Centre Julich is assembled to the demo unit and a long-term experiment is conducted to assess the characteristic performance and durability of different components of the unit (e.g. the SOFC stack, the fuel pre-reformer and air heat exchangers).",Experimental Analysis on Performance and Durability of SOFC Demonstration Unit,10.1002/fuce.200900152
5,18258,The evolution of absolute voltage drop of the stack over time is found to be of the same magnitude when compared to short stack experiments.,Experimental Analysis on Performance and Durability of SOFC Demonstration Unit,10.1002/fuce.200900152
6,18258,"Thus, other system components are not observed to cause an increase in the characteristic voltage drop of the stack.",Experimental Analysis on Performance and Durability of SOFC Demonstration Unit,10.1002/fuce.200900152
7,18258,"Two BoP-components, the afterburner and the power conversion unit failed to operate as designed.",Experimental Analysis on Performance and Durability of SOFC Demonstration Unit,10.1002/fuce.200900152
8,18258,"The performance of other BoP-components i.e. fuel pre-reformer and heat exchangers were satisfactory during the test run, and no significant performance loss could be measured.",Experimental Analysis on Performance and Durability of SOFC Demonstration Unit,10.1002/fuce.200900152
