4,20082,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in synthetic air at 460 and 608 degrees C with anodic DC voltages up to 440 mV. Chemical capacitance values of the electrodes were derived from the obtained spectra.,Formation and Detection of High-Pressure Oxygen in Closed Pores of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Solid Oxide Electrolysis Anodes,10.1021/acsaem.2c00888
5,20082,"While the chemical capacitance of dense and porous electrodes decreased as expected with increasing anodic overpotential, electrodes with closed pores exhibited very unusual peaks with extremely high values of >8000 F/cm(3) at overpotentials of >100 mV. We demonstrate that this huge capacitance increase agrees very well with calculated chemical capacitances deduced from a real gas equation.",Formation and Detection of High-Pressure Oxygen in Closed Pores of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Solid Oxide Electrolysis Anodes,10.1021/acsaem.2c00888
6,20082,"Hence, we conclude that the formation of highly pressurized oxygen (up to gas pressures of similar to 10(4) bar) in closed pores is responsible for this strong capacitive effect at anodic overpotentials.",Formation and Detection of High-Pressure Oxygen in Closed Pores of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Solid Oxide Electrolysis Anodes,10.1021/acsaem.2c00888
7,20082,Such measurements can thus detect and quantify the buildup of high internal gas pressures in closed pores at the anode side of solid oxide electrolysis cells.,Formation and Detection of High-Pressure Oxygen in Closed Pores of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Solid Oxide Electrolysis Anodes,10.1021/acsaem.2c00888
