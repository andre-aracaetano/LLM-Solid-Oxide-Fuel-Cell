5,17032,"It is found that when the droplet diameter is smaller than 30 mu m, the preferential vaporization induced Sr loss is significantly increased up to 45% with decreasing particle size, while it is greatly reduced if the droplet size is larger than 30 mu m. Two mechanisms including diffusion-dominated mass transfer and convection-dominated mass transfer are proposed to explain the particle size effect on Sr loss.",Plasma-sprayed lanthanum-doped strontium titanate as an interconnect for solid oxide fuel cells: Effects of powder size and process conditions,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160212
