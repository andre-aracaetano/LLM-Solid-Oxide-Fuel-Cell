1,10177,"A four-layer solid oxide fuel cell stack consisting of standard anode-supported cells was assembled to investigate long-term stability, but at higher current densities and/or fuel utilization compared to previous investigations.","Degradation Analysis of an SOFC Short Stack Subject to 10,000 h of Operation",10.1149/1945-7111/abc843
2,10177,"The stack was operated within a furnace temperature range of 700 degrees C-750 degrees C with hydrogen fuel at a current density of up to 1 Acm(-2) and fuel utilization of up to 80% for more than 10,000 h.","Degradation Analysis of an SOFC Short Stack Subject to 10,000 h of Operation",10.1149/1945-7111/abc843
3,10177,The average voltage degradation rate was approximately 0.6%kh(-1).,"Degradation Analysis of an SOFC Short Stack Subject to 10,000 h of Operation",10.1149/1945-7111/abc843
4,10177,Increases in the ohmic resistance and anode polarization dominated the degradation behavior.,"Degradation Analysis of an SOFC Short Stack Subject to 10,000 h of Operation",10.1149/1945-7111/abc843
5,10177,An increase in the current density and fuel utilization under current testing conditions did not fundamentally influence the degradation rate.,"Degradation Analysis of an SOFC Short Stack Subject to 10,000 h of Operation",10.1149/1945-7111/abc843
6,10177,"However, the possible modification in the nickel structure by local higher fuel utilization may have had a long-term impact on the lifetime of the stack.","Degradation Analysis of an SOFC Short Stack Subject to 10,000 h of Operation",10.1149/1945-7111/abc843
7,10177,The complexity of the degradation analysis of stacks resulting from an inhomogeneous contact inside the stack was analyzed with the support of impedance measurements and a post-mortem analysis.,"Degradation Analysis of an SOFC Short Stack Subject to 10,000 h of Operation",10.1149/1945-7111/abc843
