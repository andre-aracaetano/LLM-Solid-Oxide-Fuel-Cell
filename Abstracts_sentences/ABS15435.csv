4,15435,"Thermal processing at temperatures not exceeding 1100 degrees C yielded composite ceramics comprising perovskitetype SrTiO3, pyrovanadate Sr2V2O7 and orthovanadate Sr-3(VO4)(2) phases, while increasing firing temperatures to 1250-1440 degrees C enabled the formation of SrTi1-yVyO3 perovskites.",SrTiO3-SrVO3 Ceramics for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes: A Route from Oxidized Precursors,10.3390/ma16247638

6,15435,"Both perovskite and composite oxidized ceramics exhibit moderate thermal expansion coefficients in air, 11.1-12.1 ppm/K at 30-1000 degrees C, and insignificant dimensional changes induced by reduction in a 10%H-2-N-2 atmosphere.",SrTiO3-SrVO3 Ceramics for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes: A Route from Oxidized Precursors,10.3390/ma16247638
7,15435,"The electrical conductivity of reduced perovskite samples remains comparatively low, similar to 10-1 S/cm at 900 degrees C, whereas the transformation of oxidized vanadate phases into high-conducting SrVO3-delta perovskites upon reduction results in enhancement in conductivity, which reaches similar to 3 S/cm at 900 degrees C in porous composite ceramics with nominal composition SrTi0.7V0.3Oz.",SrTiO3-SrVO3 Ceramics for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes: A Route from Oxidized Precursors,10.3390/ma16247638
