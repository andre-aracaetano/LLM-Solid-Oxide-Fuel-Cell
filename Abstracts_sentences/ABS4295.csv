1,4295,"Cathodic materials Nd2-xSrxFeO4+delta (x=0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) with K2NiF4-type structure, for use in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), have been prepared by the glycine-nitrate process and characterized by XRD, SEM, AC impedance spectroscopy, and DC polarization measurements.",Preparation and electrochemical properties of Nd2-xSrxFeO4+δ cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-010-1277-4
2,4295,"The results have shown that no reaction occurs between an Nd2-xSrxFeO4+delta electrode and an Sm0.2Gd0.8O1.9 electrolyte at 1,200 degrees C, and that the electrode forms a good contact with the electrolyte after sintering at 1,000 C for 2 h. In the series v (x=0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0), the composition Nd2-xSrxFeO4+delta shows the lowest polarization resistance and cathodic overpotential, 2.75 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C and 68 mV at a current density of 24.3 mA cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, respectively.",Preparation and electrochemical properties of Nd2-xSrxFeO4+δ cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-010-1277-4
3,4295,It has also been found that the electrochemical properties are remarkably improved the increasing Sr content in the experimental range.,Preparation and electrochemical properties of Nd2-xSrxFeO4+δ cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-010-1277-4
