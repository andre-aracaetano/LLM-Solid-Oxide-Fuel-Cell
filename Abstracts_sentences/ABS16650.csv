1,16650,A combined approach of molecular modeling and experiment has been applied to optimize the electrical conductivity of LaCrO3 by screening all group IIa elements that may partially substitute La. Electronic structures of both doped and undoped LaCrO3 have been calculated and a semiconducting state for M2+-doped LaCrO3 has been demonstrated.,Optimization of electrical conductivity of LaCrO3 through doping:: A combined study of molecular modeling and experiment,10.1063/1.2431780
