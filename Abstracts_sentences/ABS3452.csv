2,3452,The cell performance was improved by infiltrating the nanoparticle Bi2O3-Eu2O3 solid solution into the porous LSM-YSZ cathode.,Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells With Bi2O3-Eu2O3 Infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 Cathodes,10.1115/1.4001320
3,3452,The power density of the cell with the LSM-LSZ cathode was enhanced from 0.28 W/cm(2) to 0.52 W/cm(2) at 0.7 V and 750 degrees C by infiltration of (Bi2O3)(0.7)(Eu2O3)(0.3).,Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells With Bi2O3-Eu2O3 Infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 Cathodes,10.1115/1.4001320
4,3452,The improvement of the power density was explained by decreasing the electrode resistance for oxygen reduction on the cathode.,Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells With Bi2O3-Eu2O3 Infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 Cathodes,10.1115/1.4001320
5,3452,No significant degradation of the power density was observed within 200 h at 750 degrees C and 0.7 V. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4001320],Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells With Bi2O3-Eu2O3 Infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 Cathodes,10.1115/1.4001320
