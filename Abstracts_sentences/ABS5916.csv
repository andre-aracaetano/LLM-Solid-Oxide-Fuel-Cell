1,5916,"This study examines the development of lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and the incremental improvement in performance obtained from a wide range of techniques, from pressed anodes to tape-cast anodes, from gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) single-layer electrolytes to erbium-stabilized bismuth oxide (ESB)/GDC bilayer, and from La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-GDC composite cathodes to optimized Bi2Ru2O7-ESB composites.",Development of High Performance Ceria/Bismuth Oxide Bilayered Electrolyte SOFCs for Lower Temperature Operation,10.1149/1.3276503
2,5916,"GDC single-layer electrolyte-based SOFCs were prepared from four different fabrications and exhibit maximum power densities ranging from 0.338 to 1.03 W/cm(2) at 650 degrees C. At each fabrication stage, an ESB layer was applied to form a bilayer electrolyte.",Development of High Performance Ceria/Bismuth Oxide Bilayered Electrolyte SOFCs for Lower Temperature Operation,10.1149/1.3276503

4,5916,"The result confirms that depending on a fabrication route, the bilayer electrolyte can reduce the total area specific resistance (ASR) 33-49% and increase the maximum power density 44-93%.",Development of High Performance Ceria/Bismuth Oxide Bilayered Electrolyte SOFCs for Lower Temperature Operation,10.1149/1.3276503
5,5916,"By using a combination of the materials and fabrication routes, a maximum power density of 1.95 W/cm(2) and 0.079 cm(2) total cell ASR was achieved at 650 degrees C for a bilayer cell.",Development of High Performance Ceria/Bismuth Oxide Bilayered Electrolyte SOFCs for Lower Temperature Operation,10.1149/1.3276503
