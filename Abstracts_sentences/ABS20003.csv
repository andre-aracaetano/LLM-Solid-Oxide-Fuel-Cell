2,20003,A mass spectrometer is used to monitor fuel mixtures of hydrogen and phosphine after exposure to two environments.,Mass Spectrometry of SOFC Fuel Mixtures Containing Phosphine,10.1149/2.1051509jes
3,20003,"In the first environment, the gas mixtures are passed through a heated zone in a tube furnace.",Mass Spectrometry of SOFC Fuel Mixtures Containing Phosphine,10.1149/2.1051509jes
4,20003,"In the second environment, the gas mixtures are passed across the anodes of operating SOFCs, both electrolyte- and anode-supported.",Mass Spectrometry of SOFC Fuel Mixtures Containing Phosphine,10.1149/2.1051509jes
5,20003,Phosphine appears to react with residual oxygen in dry hydrogen at intermediate temperatures (400-600 degrees C) but is stable above 600 degrees C. Phosphine reacts with water in wet hydrogen mixtures and with a Ni/YSZ anode at temperatures above 400 degrees C. Evidence is presented for deposition of non-volatile contaminants following prolonged phosphine exposure.,Mass Spectrometry of SOFC Fuel Mixtures Containing Phosphine,10.1149/2.1051509jes
6,20003,"The contaminants react with dry hydrogen to generate PH3 at 800 degrees C. Mass spectra of the anode exhaust of an electrolyte-supported SOFC show that a few torr of water, either present initially or electrochemically generated by fuel oxidation, is sufficient to suppress the phosphine signal.",Mass Spectrometry of SOFC Fuel Mixtures Containing Phosphine,10.1149/2.1051509jes
7,20003,"At all gas compositions and currents, no new mass signals were detected in the mass range of 45-100, suggesting that HPO, HPO2 and HPO3 are not products of phosphine reaction or electrochemical oxidation.",Mass Spectrometry of SOFC Fuel Mixtures Containing Phosphine,10.1149/2.1051509jes
