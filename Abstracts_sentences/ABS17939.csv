1,17939,"The performance of lanthanum nickelate, La2NiO4+delta (LNO), as a cathode in IT-SOFCs with the electrolyte cerium gadolinium oxide, Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CGO), has been investigated by AC impedance spectroscopy of symmetrical cells.",Development of lanthanum nickelate as a cathode for use in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.02.014
2,17939,A significant reduction in the area specific resistance (ASR) has been achieved with a layered cathode structure consisting of a thin compact LNO layer between the dense electrolyte and porous electrode.,Development of lanthanum nickelate as a cathode for use in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.02.014
3,17939,This decrease in ASR is believed to be a result of contact at the electrolyte/cathode boundary enhancing the oxygen ion transfer to the electrolyte.,Development of lanthanum nickelate as a cathode for use in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.02.014
4,17939,"An ASR of 1.0 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C was measured in a symmetrical cell with this layered structure, compared to an ASR of 7.4 Omega cm(2) in a cell without the compact layer.",Development of lanthanum nickelate as a cathode for use in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.02.014
5,17939,"In addition, further improvements were observed by enhancing the cell current collection and it is anticipated that a symmetrical cell consisting of a layered structure with adequate current collection would lower these ASR values further.",Development of lanthanum nickelate as a cathode for use in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.02.014
