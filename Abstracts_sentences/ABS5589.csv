1,5589,The suppression of Ni agglomeration in Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) nano-composite thin films deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has been investigated by varying post-annealing temperatures at a range of 800-1200 degrees C. Grain growth to a certain extent appears to be necessary to obtain a stable Ni-YSZ composite microstructure by suppressing massive Ni agglomeration.,Suppression of Ni agglomeration in PLD fabricated Ni-YSZ composite for surface modification of SOFC anode,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.07.035
2,5589,"The microstructurally stable and uniform nano-porous Ni-YSZ thin film was obtained by 1200 degrees C post-annealing and reduction of the NiO-YSZ thin film, and it was applied as the surface modification layer of the bulk anode support used in conventional solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Suppression of Ni agglomeration in PLD fabricated Ni-YSZ composite for surface modification of SOFC anode,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.07.035
3,5589,"By this approach, we were able to successfully realize a thin film electrolyte SOFC exhibiting the open cell voltage (OCV) higher than 1 V with a 1-mu m thick film electrolyte on the porous anode support.",Suppression of Ni agglomeration in PLD fabricated Ni-YSZ composite for surface modification of SOFC anode,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.07.035
