1,9695,This work evaluates the performance of cobalt/cerium oxide (Co/CeO2) composite coatings and pure Co coatings to be used for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) interconnects.,Oxidation behaviour and electrical properties of cobalt/cerium oxide composite coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.128
2,9695,The coatings are electroplated on the ferritic stainless steels Crofer 22 APU and Crofer 22H. Coated and uncoated samples are exposed in air at 800 degrees C for 3000 h and oxidation rates are measured and oxide scale microstructures are investigated.,Oxidation behaviour and electrical properties of cobalt/cerium oxide composite coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.128
3,9695,Area-specific resistances (ASR) in air at 850 degrees C of coated and uncoated samples are also measured.,Oxidation behaviour and electrical properties of cobalt/cerium oxide composite coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.128

6,9695,The CeO2 was present as discrete particles in the outer oxide layer after exposure.,Oxidation behaviour and electrical properties of cobalt/cerium oxide composite coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.128
7,9695,The Cr oxide layer thicknesses and oxidations rates were significantly reduced for Co/CeO2 coated samples compared to for Co coated and uncoated samples.,Oxidation behaviour and electrical properties of cobalt/cerium oxide composite coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.128
8,9695,The ASR of all Crofer 22H samples increased significantly faster than of Crofer 22 APU samples which was likely due to the presence of SiO2 in the oxide/metal interface of Crofer 22H.
