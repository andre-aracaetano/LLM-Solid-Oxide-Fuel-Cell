4,18950,"More than 92% of the theoretical density has been obtained after sintering at 1350 degrees C. AC impedance measurements have been carried out to separate the contributions of grains, grain boundaries and electrode/specimen interface to the total observed resistance in the temperature range 200-600 degrees C. Enhancement in the ionic conductivity has been observed due to substitution of Nd3+ and Y3+ in ceria.",Ionic conductivity of Nd3+ and Y3+ co-doped ceria solid electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.10.277
