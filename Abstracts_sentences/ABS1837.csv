1,1837,"The electrochemical performance of a hydrogen sulfide solid oxide fuel cell having the configuration H2S Pt/(ZrO2)(0.92)(Y2O3)(0.08)/Pt, air has been examined at atmospheric pressure and 750-800 degreesC using both pure and 5% H2S anode feed streams.",Performance of a solid oxide fuel cell utilizing hydrogen sulfide as fuel,10.1016/S0378-7753(00)00660-1
2,1837,"The performance of the cell is higher when using diluted H2S feed compared with pure H2S feed: current densities up to 100 mA cm(-2) and power densities up to 15.4 mW cm(-2) have been achieved using diluted H2S gas (5%) at 800 degreesC. However, the platinum anode degrades over time in H2S stream due to the formation of PtS. Electrochemical oxidation of H2S on the Pt anode significantly accelerated its degradation.",Performance of a solid oxide fuel cell utilizing hydrogen sulfide as fuel,10.1016/S0378-7753(00)00660-1
