1,1225,"BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY7) exhibits adequate proton conductivity as well as sufficient chemical and thermal stability over a wide range of SOFC operating conditions, while layered SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta (SBSC) perovskite demonstrates advanced electrochemical properties based on doped ceria electrolyte.",A novel layered perovskite cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.022
2,1225,This research fully takes advantage of these advanced properties and develops novel protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells (PCMFCs) of Ni-BZCY7 vertical bar BZCY7 vertical bar SBSC.,A novel layered perovskite cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.022
3,1225,"The results show that the open-circuit potential of 1.015 V and maximum power density of 533 mW cm(-2) are achieved at 700 degrees C. With temperature increase, the total cell resistance decreases, among which electrolyte resistance becomes increasingly dominant over polarization resistance.",A novel layered perovskite cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.022
4,1225,"The results also indicate that SBSC perovskite cathode is a good candidate for intermediate temperature PCMFC development, while the developed Ni-BZCY7 vertical bar BZCY7 vertical bar SBSC cell is a promising functional material system for next generation SCFCs.",A novel layered perovskite cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.022
