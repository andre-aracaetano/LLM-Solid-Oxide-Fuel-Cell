1,11456,"A number of bolt-microtubular anode supports (BMASs) are manufactured by winding the corresponding thin tapes on threaded rods of different thread pitches and depths, followed by co-lamination using isostatic press.",Boosting the performance of bolt-microtubular solid oxide fuel cells through surface pattern tuning,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2024.05.018
2,11456,Bolt-microtubular cells (BMCs) are also constructed on BMASs to investigate the effects of the created surface patterns on the cell performance and microstructure.,Boosting the performance of bolt-microtubular solid oxide fuel cells through surface pattern tuning,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2024.05.018
3,11456,"The bolt-microtubular cell, whose anode support is patterned by using a threaded rod with 0.8 mm thread pitch and 0.4 mm thread depth, exhibits similar to 92% higher maximum performance than that of the reference cell at 800 degrees C under 0.3 NL/min hydrogen flow and stagnant air.",Boosting the performance of bolt-microtubular solid oxide fuel cells through surface pattern tuning,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2024.05.018
4,11456,The almost doubled performance is mainly due to the increase in anode-electrolyte and cathode-electrolyte interfacial areas by the surface patterns created.,Boosting the performance of bolt-microtubular solid oxide fuel cells through surface pattern tuning,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2024.05.018
5,11456,The cell is also subjected to a 200-h life test at 800 degrees C and 0.7 V and demonstrates a stable performance.,Boosting the performance of bolt-microtubular solid oxide fuel cells through surface pattern tuning,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2024.05.018
