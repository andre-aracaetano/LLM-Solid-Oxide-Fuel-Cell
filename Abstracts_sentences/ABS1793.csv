2,1793,"In this paper, Sm3+ and Nd3+ co-doped CeO2 (SNDC) and pure CeO2 are synthesized via glycine-nitrate process (GNP) and the electro-chemical properties of the nanocrystalline structure electrolyte are investigated using complementary techniques.",High Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Nanostructured Ceria-Based Electrolyte,10.3390/nano11092231
3,1793,"The result shows that Sm3+ and Nd3+ have been successfully doped into CeO2 lattice, and has the same cubic fluorite structure before, and after, doping.",High Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Nanostructured Ceria-Based Electrolyte,10.3390/nano11092231
4,1793,"Sm3+ and Nd3+ co-doped causes the lattice distortion of CeO2 and generates more oxygen vacancies, which results in high ionic conductivity.",High Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Nanostructured Ceria-Based Electrolyte,10.3390/nano11092231
5,1793,The fuel cells with the nanocrystalline structure SNDC and CeO2 electrolytes have exhibited excellent electrochemical performances.,High Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Nanostructured Ceria-Based Electrolyte,10.3390/nano11092231
6,1793,"At 450, 500 and 550 degrees C, the fuel cell for SNDC can achieve an extraordinary peak power densities of 406.25, 634.38, and 1070.31 mW center dot cm(-2), which is, on average, about 1.26 times higher than those (309.38, 562.50 and 804.69 mW center dot cm(-2)) for pure CeO2 electrolyte.",High Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Nanostructured Ceria-Based Electrolyte,10.3390/nano11092231
7,1793,The outstanding performance of SNDC cell is closely related to the high ionic conductivity of SNDC electrolyte.,High Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Nanostructured Ceria-Based Electrolyte,10.3390/nano11092231
