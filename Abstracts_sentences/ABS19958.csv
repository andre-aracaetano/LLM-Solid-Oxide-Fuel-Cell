2,19958,powders were prepared with the Pechini method.,Characterization of High Density CeO2-Based Electrolyte,10.12693/APhysPolA.135.571
3,19958,The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of co-doping on the ionic conductivity of ceria (CeO2) for its use as solid electrolyte in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Characterization of High Density CeO2-Based Electrolyte,10.12693/APhysPolA.135.571
4,19958,Results of the X-ray diffraction analyses showed that all powders calcined at 600 degrees C for 4 h were single phase with cubic fluorite structure.,Characterization of High Density CeO2-Based Electrolyte,10.12693/APhysPolA.135.571
5,19958,The average crystallite sizes calculated by the Scherrer formula were found as between 24 and 30 nm.,Characterization of High Density CeO2-Based Electrolyte,10.12693/APhysPolA.135.571
6,19958,The samples were sintered at 1400 degrees C for 6 h to obtain dense ceramics (over 93%).,Characterization of High Density CeO2-Based Electrolyte,10.12693/APhysPolA.135.571
7,19958,The two-probe a.c. impedance spectroscopy was used to study the ionic conductivity of the co-doped ceria samples.,Characterization of High Density CeO2-Based Electrolyte,10.12693/APhysPolA.135.571
8,19958,Effects of co-doping on crystal structure and electrical conductivity were studied comparing with the single doping.,Characterization of High Density CeO2-Based Electrolyte,10.12693/APhysPolA.135.571
9,19958,"The results indicated that Ce0.80Nd0.10Sm0.10O1.(90) had the highest electrical conductivity, sigma(750) degrees C which is equal to 4.42 x 10(2) S/cm.",Characterization of High Density CeO2-Based Electrolyte,10.12693/APhysPolA.135.571
10,19958,It can be therefore concluded that co-doping with Sm-3 vertical bar and Nd-3 vertical bar cations can further improve the electrical properties of ceria electrolytes compared to single element doped ceria (Ce0.80Sm0.20O1.(90)).,Characterization of High Density CeO2-Based Electrolyte,10.12693/APhysPolA.135.571
