1,5850,The atomic level chemical and microstructural features of grain boundaries in gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte thin film supported by Ni-GDC cermet anode were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM).,Diffusion and segregation along grain boundary at the electrolyte-anode interface in IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.03.021
2,5850,It was found that metallic Ni can diffuse from the anode into the thin film electrolyte along grain boundaries.,Diffusion and segregation along grain boundary at the electrolyte-anode interface in IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.03.021
3,5850,"In addition, Ce and Gd can also diffuse and segregate at grain boundaries between Ni grains in the anode substrate.",Diffusion and segregation along grain boundary at the electrolyte-anode interface in IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.03.021
4,5850,"HR-TEM observations revealed that Ni diffusion and segregation at grain boundaries between GDC grains enhanced the inhomogeneity and led to microstructural changes at grain boundary regions, i.e. the formation of superstructure.",Diffusion and segregation along grain boundary at the electrolyte-anode interface in IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.03.021
5,5850,The observations also indicated that enhanced inhomogeneity at grain boundaries might play a significant role in the conductivity of GDC electrolyte film in solid oxide fuel cells.,Diffusion and segregation along grain boundary at the electrolyte-anode interface in IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.03.021
