1,12307,"The microstructure and electrochemical performance of LSM-YSZ composite electrodes infiltrated with La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) as an electronic conductor, LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3-delta (LCN) as a mixed conductor and Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (CGO) as an ionic conductor, were compared in the temperature range 550-800 degrees C.","Infiltration of ionic-, electronic- and mixed-conducting nano particles into La0.75Sr0.25MnO3-Y0.16Zr0.84O2 cathodes - A comparative study of performance enhancement and stability at different temperatures",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.070
2,12307,All three infiltrates resulted in improved electrochemical performance.,"Infiltration of ionic-, electronic- and mixed-conducting nano particles into La0.75Sr0.25MnO3-Y0.16Zr0.84O2 cathodes - A comparative study of performance enhancement and stability at different temperatures",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.070
3,12307,"Impedance analysis suggested dissociative adsorption and transfer of species to the triple phase boundary as the main mechanism responsible for the performance enhancement in all cases, attributed to the increase in surface area and triple phase boundary upon infiltration.","Infiltration of ionic-, electronic- and mixed-conducting nano particles into La0.75Sr0.25MnO3-Y0.16Zr0.84O2 cathodes - A comparative study of performance enhancement and stability at different temperatures",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.070
4,12307,"LCN showed the most pronounced improvement at 550 degrees C, but its performance degraded drastically with increasing temperature.","Infiltration of ionic-, electronic- and mixed-conducting nano particles into La0.75Sr0.25MnO3-Y0.16Zr0.84O2 cathodes - A comparative study of performance enhancement and stability at different temperatures",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.070
5,12307,LSM and CGO infiltrated electrodes degraded less upon heating up to 800 degrees C. Infiltrated CGO electrodes showed the smallest degradation rate upon long term testing at 750 degrees C.
