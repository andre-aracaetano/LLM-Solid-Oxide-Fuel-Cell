1,6699,"Anode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were manufactured by consecutive aqueous electrophoretic depositions (EPDs) of porous anode layer (8YSZ-NiO), dense electrolyte layer (8YSZ) and porous cathode layer (LSM) onto a thin Cu wire, followed by stripping, drying, and a single-step co-sintering.",Microstructure and performance of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.144
2,6699,"The microstructure of the micro-tubular SOFC, including the thickness and porosity of each layer, was controlled by the processing parameters such as solid loading, current density, surfactant concentration and sintering temperature.",Microstructure and performance of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.144
3,6699,The electrochemical performance of such a micro-tubular SOFC was demonstrated by the V-I-P (voltage current power) and impedance measurements.,Microstructure and performance of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.10.144
