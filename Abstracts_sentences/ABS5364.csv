1,5364,"Cobalt-containing cathodes often encounter problems such as high thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) and poor stability, making them unsuitable for practical use as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",High redox and performance stability of layered SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Cu0.5O5+δ perovskite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3cp53883d
2,5364,"This study focuses on the effects of Cu doping in the Co site of SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta in terms of structural characteristics, electrical properties, electrochemical performance, redox properties, and performance stability as an IT-SOFC cathode material.",High redox and performance stability of layered SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Cu0.5O5+δ perovskite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3cp53883d
3,5364,"The TEC value of a SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta (SBSCCu50) sample is 12.8 x 10(-6) K-1, which is lower than that (13.7 x 10(-6) K-1) of a SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta (SBSCO) sample at 700 degrees C. SBSCCu50 showed higher redox stability at lower p(O-2) and a more stable cell power output while retaining desirable electrochemical performance, as compared with SBSCO.",High redox and performance stability of layered SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Cu0.5O5+δ perovskite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3cp53883d
