3,9203,Next generation anode materials should be more robust towards sulfur poisoning e.g. in the event of failure or expiry of desulfurization units utilized in SOFC systems.,Performance and sulfur tolerance of a short stack with solid oxide cells using infiltrated strontium titanate based anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233458
4,9203,"Herein we present the performance and sulfur tolerance of short stacks with large area electrolyte supported cells with Ni:Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (CGO) and FeNi:CGO co-infiltrated La0.4Sr0.4Fe0.03Ni0.03Ti0.oO3 (LSFNT) anodes tested under real-life conditions using reformed grid natural gas and an upstream, bypassable desulfurization unit.",Performance and sulfur tolerance of a short stack with solid oxide cells using infiltrated strontium titanate based anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233458
5,9203,The initial performance at 750 degrees C and 850 degrees C was similar to a SoA cell with Ni/CGO cermet anode for both types of infiltrate.,Performance and sulfur tolerance of a short stack with solid oxide cells using infiltrated strontium titanate based anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233458
