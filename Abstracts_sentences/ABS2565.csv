2,2565,"This research evaluates the performance of a ferritic stainless steel (AISI 430 - a candidate SOFC interconnect material) with and without a Co coating (via sol-gel dip coating technique) with various pre-treatments, during cyclic oxidation exposures up to 750 degrees C in laboratory air.",Pre-treatment and oxidation behavior of sol-gel Co coating on 430 steel in 750 °C air with thermal cycling,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.02.023
3,2565,"A pre-treatment exposure of Co coated samples to a 750 degrees C reducing atmosphere (prior to oxidation exposures) led to the formation of an effective Co-based spinet oxide coating that lowers oxidation rates by more than 40 times, and substantially lowers area specific resistance (ASR) in comparison to uncoated specimens.",Pre-treatment and oxidation behavior of sol-gel Co coating on 430 steel in 750 °C air with thermal cycling,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2012.02.023
