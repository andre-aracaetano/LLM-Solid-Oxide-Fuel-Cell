2,2699,The sintering schedules use a coarsening stage (step one) prior to reaching the peak temperature (step two).,Three-step sintering of constrained yttria stabilised zirconia layers and its effect on microstructure and gas permeance,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.12.013
3,2699,Once the peak temperature has been reached the temperature is lowered and an isothermal dwell takes place (step three).,Three-step sintering of constrained yttria stabilised zirconia layers and its effect on microstructure and gas permeance,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.12.013
4,2699,"As the YSZ layers form part of a solid oxide fuel cell, and thus need to prevent the fuel and air from mixing, gas flow across the layers was measured and gas permeance values calculated.",Three-step sintering of constrained yttria stabilised zirconia layers and its effect on microstructure and gas permeance,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.12.013
5,2699,Several of the three-step sintering schedules produced layers with lower gas permeance values compared with a conventional sintering schedule that is used currently.,Three-step sintering of constrained yttria stabilised zirconia layers and its effect on microstructure and gas permeance,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.12.013
6,2699,"Further, a three-step schedule produced one of the lowest gas flow rates and minimised the maximum temperature exposure thus offering several potential benefits in terms of processing options.",Three-step sintering of constrained yttria stabilised zirconia layers and its effect on microstructure and gas permeance,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.12.013
