2,6008,Silica is normally avoided in this material because formation of amorphous silica phases along the grain boundaries causes an increased grain boundary impedance.,Structural and electrical characterisation of silica-containing yttria-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/S0955-2219(98)00329-X
3,6008,The present study examines the effect of SiO2 and SiO2 with Mn-oxide on the structure and resistivity of yttria stabilised zirconia electrolyte materials.,Structural and electrical characterisation of silica-containing yttria-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/S0955-2219(98)00329-X

5,6008,"It is shown that a grain boundary phase which causes an insulating layer in the grain boundaries is formed when both SiO2 and Mn-oxide coexist in the samples, whereas such effects are much less pronounced when only SiO2 is present.",Structural and electrical characterisation of silica-containing yttria-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/S0955-2219(98)00329-X
