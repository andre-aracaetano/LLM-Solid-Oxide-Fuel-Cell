1,11398,"In this study, the interactions of a Sr- and Mg-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM with composition La0.9Sr0.1 Ga0.8Mg0.2Odelta) electrolyte with Fe2O3, Co2O3 and NiO as the anode starting materials were investigated.","Interactions of a La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte with Fe2O3, Co2O3 and NiO anode materials",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00833-X
2,11398,"It was found that the older of reactivity of the LSGM with the three oxides was Co2O3 > NiO > Fe2O3, and La-containing oxides were detected in these binary powder mixtures after firing.","Interactions of a La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte with Fe2O3, Co2O3 and NiO anode materials",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00833-X
