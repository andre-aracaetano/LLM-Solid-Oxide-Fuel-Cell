1,1705,Data on the mid-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with thin-film ZrO2 Y2O3 (YSZ) electrolyte are shown.,Mid-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Thin Film ZrO2:Y2O3 Electrolyte,10.1134/S1023193511040185
2,1705,"Such a fuel cell comprises a carrying Ni-YSZ anode, a YSZ electrolyte 3-5 mu m thick formed by vacuum ion-plasma methods, and a LaSrMnO3 cathode.",Mid-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Thin Film ZrO2:Y2O3 Electrolyte,10.1134/S1023193511040185
3,1705,"It is shown that the use of a combined method of YSZ electrolyte deposition, which involves the magnetron deposition of a 0.5-1.5-mu m thick sub-layer and its pulse electron-beam processing allows a dense nanostructured electrolyte film to be formed and the SOFC working temperature to be lowered down as the result of a decrease in both the solid electrolyte Ohmic resistance and the Faradaic resistance to charge transfer.",Mid-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Thin Film ZrO2:Y2O3 Electrolyte,10.1134/S1023193511040185
4,1705,SOFC are studied by the methods of voltammentry and impedance spectroscopy.,Mid-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Thin Film ZrO2:Y2O3 Electrolyte,10.1134/S1023193511040185
5,1705,"The maximum power density of the SOFC under study is 250 and 600 mW/cm(-2) at temperatures of 650 and 800 degrees C, respectively.",Mid-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Thin Film ZrO2:Y2O3 Electrolyte,10.1134/S1023193511040185
