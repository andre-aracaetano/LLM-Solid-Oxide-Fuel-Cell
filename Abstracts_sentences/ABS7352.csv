2,7352,The poison effect on cathode is observed by a group of orthogonal experiments at the presence of Fe-Cr alloy involving with air flow and current passages.,The investigation of interaction between La0.9Sr0.1 MnO3 cathode and metallic interconnect for solid oxide fuel cell at reduced temperature,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.11.054
3,7352,"After the current polarization, the cathode layer has been delaminated from the electrolyte (YSZ), and the Cr deposition reaction is accelerated with adding air partial pressure.",The investigation of interaction between La0.9Sr0.1 MnO3 cathode and metallic interconnect for solid oxide fuel cell at reduced temperature,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.11.054
4,7352,"When the LSM cathode has undergone Cr poison for 3000 min with current passage of 400 mA cm(-2) and air flow of 100 mL(-1) two rapid increase stages of polarization potential E-cathode are found, which can be reasonably explained by Cr deposition resulting in cathode delaminated from the electrolyte layer.",The investigation of interaction between La0.9Sr0.1 MnO3 cathode and metallic interconnect for solid oxide fuel cell at reduced temperature,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.11.054
5,7352,"Furthermore, the Cr deposition ring and two kinds of Cr-contain agglomerates are observed in the interface of LSM/YSZ, which indicates that the formation of Cr2O3 and (Cr,Mn)(3)O-4 oxides, respectively.",The investigation of interaction between La0.9Sr0.1 MnO3 cathode and metallic interconnect for solid oxide fuel cell at reduced temperature,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.11.054
