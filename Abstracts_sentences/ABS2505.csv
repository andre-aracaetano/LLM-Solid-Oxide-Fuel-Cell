2,2505,The model takes into account the transient effects of both charge migration and species transport in PEN assembly.,Transient modeling of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.06.034
3,2505,"Due to the lack of transient experimental data, the transient model, under steady state operating conditions, is validated using experimental results from open literature.",Transient modeling of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.06.034
4,2505,"Numerical results show that the cell can obtain very quick transient current response when subjected to a step voltage change, followed by a slow current transient period due to species diffusion effects within porous electrodes.",Transient modeling of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.06.034
5,2505,"It is also found that the transient response of the cell current is sensitive to oxygen concentration change at cathode/channel interface, whereas the current response is slow when step change of hydrogen concentration is applied at anode/channel interface.",Transient modeling of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.06.034
6,2505,The cell transient performance can be improved by increasing porosity or decreasing tortuosity of electrodes.,Transient modeling of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.06.034
