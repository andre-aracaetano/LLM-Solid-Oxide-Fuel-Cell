1,14454,We report the fabrication and characterization of a micro-tubular cathode-supported cell consisting of a Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolyte with a Ni-cermet anode on a porous La0.6Sr0.4CO0.2Fe0.8O3-delta/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (60:40 volume) tube (460 mu m wall thickness and 2.26mm diameter).,Fabrication and characterization of micro-tubular cathode-supported SOFC for intermediate temperature operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.101
2,14454,The cells were fabricated by a cost-effective technique involving extrusion molding and slurry coating through a co-firing process.,Fabrication and characterization of micro-tubular cathode-supported SOFC for intermediate temperature operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.101
3,14454,"Densification of the ceria film (thickness < 15 mu m) was successful by co-firing the laminated electrolyte with the porous cathode at 1200 degrees C. NiO-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (Ni: Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 = 50:50 in volume after reduction) was subsequently sintered on the electrolyte at 1100 degrees C to construct a 10 mu m thick, porous and well-adherent anode.",Fabrication and characterization of micro-tubular cathode-supported SOFC for intermediate temperature operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.101
4,14454,"The cell having 1.5 cm tube length fed with humidified 30 vol.% H-2-Ar (3% H2O) yielded the maximum power densities of 0.16, 0.13 and 0.11 W cm(-2), at 600, 550 and 500 degrees C, respectively.",Fabrication and characterization of micro-tubular cathode-supported SOFC for intermediate temperature operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.101
5,14454,"It was found that the cell performance is strongly dominated by the tube length, due to a high substrate resistance from the cathode current collections.",Fabrication and characterization of micro-tubular cathode-supported SOFC for intermediate temperature operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.101
