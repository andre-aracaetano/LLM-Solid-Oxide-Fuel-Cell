2,20613,"According to the dilatometer analysis, the synergistic combination of lithium and bismuth promotes the reduction of sintering temperature down to 800-900 degrees C. A densification > 95% was achieved for the electrolytes sintered at 900 degrees C. Raman analysis, in agreement with XRD, demonstrated that the lithium and bismuth induced changes due to the growth of the topological disorder and a higher defectiveness provoked by doping.",Unravelling the synergistic effect on ionic transport and sintering temperature of nanocrystalline CeO2 tri-doped with Li Bi and Gd as dense electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162880
3,20613,The high dopant concentration (5 mol%) is well distributed into the lattice and forms a complex network of defects that traps the oxygen vacancies and hence mobile ions promoting the ionic transport.,Unravelling the synergistic effect on ionic transport and sintering temperature of nanocrystalline CeO2 tri-doped with Li Bi and Gd as dense electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162880
4,20613,"As compared to a single (CGO) or a bi-doped system (BiCGO and LiCGO) an improvement of total conductivity was achieved at lower sintering temperature, with a maximum value for Ce0.76Gd0.19Li0.03Bi0.02O1.85 of 2.68.10(-3)-1.66.10(-1)",Unravelling the synergistic effect on ionic transport and sintering temperature of nanocrystalline CeO2 tri-doped with Li Bi and Gd as dense electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162880
