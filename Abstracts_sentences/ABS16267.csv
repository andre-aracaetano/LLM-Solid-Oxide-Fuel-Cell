1,16267,"The effect of the addition of copper-doped bismuth-vanadium oxide to yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) on the sinterability and electrical conductivity, especially in reducing atmospheres, has been investigated.",Low-temperature Sintering of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia Using Bismuth-Vanadium Oxide as a Sintering Aid at 800 °C,10.1246/cl.140712
2,16267,"When Bi2Cu0.1V0.9O5.35 was used as a sintering aid, the sintering temperature could be reduced to 800 degrees C, whereas the conventional sintering process requires temperatures above 1300 degrees C.",Low-temperature Sintering of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia Using Bismuth-Vanadium Oxide as a Sintering Aid at 800 °C,10.1246/cl.140712
3,16267,"Although the conductivity of YSZ with 1.5 mol % Bi2Cu0.1V0.9O5.35 was slightly lower than that of pure YSZ sintered at 1300 degrees C, no Po-2 dependence was observed under reducing conditions (e.g., Po-2 = 10(-5)-10(-2)4 atm), which indicates that the electrolyte is applicable to solid-oxide fuel cells.",Low-temperature Sintering of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia Using Bismuth-Vanadium Oxide as a Sintering Aid at 800 °C,10.1246/cl.140712
