3,285,"However, such fuel cells face several design challenges and cannot operate with hydrocarbon fuels of higher energy density.",A thermally self-sustained micro solid-oxide fuel-cell stack with high power density,10.1038/nature03673
4,285,"Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) enable direct use of higher hydrocarbons(4-6), but have not been seriously considered for portable applications because of thermal management difficulties at small scales, slow start-up and poor thermal cyclability.",A thermally self-sustained micro solid-oxide fuel-cell stack with high power density,10.1038/nature03673
5,285,Here we demonstrate a thermally self-sustaining micro-SOFC stack with high power output and rapid start-up by using single chamber operation on propane fuel.,A thermally self-sustained micro solid-oxide fuel-cell stack with high power density,10.1038/nature03673
6,285,The catalytic oxidation reactions supply sufficient thermal energy to maintain the fuel cells at 500 - 600 degrees C. A power output of similar to 350 mW( at 1.0 V) was obtained from a device with a total cathode area of only 1.42 cm(2).,A thermally self-sustained micro solid-oxide fuel-cell stack with high power density,10.1038/nature03673
