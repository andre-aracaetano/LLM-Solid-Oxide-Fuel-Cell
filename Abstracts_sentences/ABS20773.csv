1,20773,A simple method to predict the thermal characteristics of a micro-SOFC system is presented in this study.,Analyzing a micro-solid oxide fuel cell system by global energy balances,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.009
2,20773,The basic design requirements for a thermally self-sustaining operation at a stack temperature of about 550 degrees C are assessed.,Analyzing a micro-solid oxide fuel cell system by global energy balances,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.009
3,20773,"Based on steady-state global energy and mass balances, the influence of the electrical efficiency, the overall air-to-fuel ratio and the heat losses on the operating temperature is discussed.",Analyzing a micro-solid oxide fuel cell system by global energy balances,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.009
4,20773,"It was found that at high electrical efficiencies and, hence, low heat release rates, a recuperator is needed to achieve the desired operating temperature.",Analyzing a micro-solid oxide fuel cell system by global energy balances,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.009
5,20773,"At lower electrical efficiencies, in contrast, disposing the released heat becomes an issue and an efficient cooling of the stack is required.",Analyzing a micro-solid oxide fuel cell system by global energy balances,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.009
6,20773,"Whether a recuperator or additional cooling components are necessary also depends on the electrical power output, the stack size and the thermal insulation specifications.",Analyzing a micro-solid oxide fuel cell system by global energy balances,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.009
7,20773,"The threshold between cooling and recuperator mode is of special interest, since this operating point allows a simple design of the thermal system without recuperator and only a minimum of air to be supplied to the system.",Analyzing a micro-solid oxide fuel cell system by global energy balances,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.009
8,20773,"This threshold efficiency, which is the maximal electrical efficiency that allows a thermally self-sustaining operation without recuperator, is above 50% under adiabatic operating conditions.",Analyzing a micro-solid oxide fuel cell system by global energy balances,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.009
9,20773,"In a non-adiabatic system, the threshold efficiency is reduced to about 45% in a 20 W-el and to about 20% in a 2.5 W-el system even with a state-of-the art thermal insulation.",Analyzing a micro-solid oxide fuel cell system by global energy balances,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.009
10,20773,The considered thermal insulations dominate the system volume.,Analyzing a micro-solid oxide fuel cell system by global energy balances,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.009
