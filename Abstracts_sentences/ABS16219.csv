1,16219,"In this work, the challenges associated with the formation of single and bilayer coatings based on Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) and CuO modified BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BCZYYbO-CuO) solid state electrolytes on porous non-conducting NiO-SDC anode substrates by the method of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) are considered.",Challenges of Formation of Thin-Film Solid Electrolyte Layers on Non-Conductive Substrates by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.3390/coatings11070805
2,16219,"Various approaches that had been selected after analysis of the literature data in order to carry out the EPD, are tested: direct deposition on a porous non-conductive anode substrate and multiple options for creating the conductivity of the anode substrate under EPD conditions such as the reduction of the NiO-SDC substrate and the creation of a surface conducting sublayer via synthesizing a polypyrrole (PPy) film.",Challenges of Formation of Thin-Film Solid Electrolyte Layers on Non-Conductive Substrates by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.3390/coatings11070805
3,16219,New effective method was proposed based on the deposition of a platinum layer on the front side of the substrate.,Challenges of Formation of Thin-Film Solid Electrolyte Layers on Non-Conductive Substrates by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.3390/coatings11070805
4,16219,"It was ascertained that, during the direct EPD on the porous NiO-SDC substrate, the formation of a continuous coating did not occur, which may be due to insufficient porosity of the substrate used.",Challenges of Formation of Thin-Film Solid Electrolyte Layers on Non-Conductive Substrates by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.3390/coatings11070805
5,16219,"It was shown that the use of reduced substrates leads to cracking and, in some cases, to the destruction of the entire SDC/NiO-SDC structure.",Challenges of Formation of Thin-Film Solid Electrolyte Layers on Non-Conductive Substrates by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.3390/coatings11070805
6,16219,The dependence of the electrolyte film sinterability on the substrate shrinkage was studied.,Challenges of Formation of Thin-Film Solid Electrolyte Layers on Non-Conductive Substrates by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.3390/coatings11070805
7,16219,"In contrast to the literature data, the use of the substrates with a reduced pre-sintering temperature had no pronounced effect on the densification of the SDC electrolyte film.",Challenges of Formation of Thin-Film Solid Electrolyte Layers on Non-Conductive Substrates by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.3390/coatings11070805
8,16219,It was revealed that complete sintering of the SDC electrolyte layer with the formation of a developed grain structure is possible at a temperature of 1550 degrees C.,Challenges of Formation of Thin-Film Solid Electrolyte Layers on Non-Conductive Substrates by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.3390/coatings11070805
