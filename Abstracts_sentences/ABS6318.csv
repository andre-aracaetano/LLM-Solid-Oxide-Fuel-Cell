2,6318,"A small addition of cobalt oxide remarkably enhanced the sinterability of GDC, especially for GDC powder with a specific surface area of 40 m(2) g(-1), which was synthesized via a citrate method.",Investigation and optimization of interface reactivity between Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 and Zr0.89Sc0.1Ce0.01O2-δ for high performance intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.004
3,6318,Relative densities of approximately 95% can be achieved for GDC pellet samples using 2 mol% Co dopant and sintering at 1100 degrees C for 10 h. The thermal expansion and electrical expansion of 2 mol% Co-doped GDC were comparble to those of the non-doped sample.,Investigation and optimization of interface reactivity between Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 and Zr0.89Sc0.1Ce0.01O2-δ for high performance intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.004
