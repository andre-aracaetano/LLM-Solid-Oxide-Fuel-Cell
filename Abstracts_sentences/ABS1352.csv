1,1352,This paper investigates the environmental and economic impacts of hydrogen-powered ferries in inland passenger and car transportation using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA).,Environmental and economic assessment of hydrogen-powered ferries for inland transportation,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2024.117556
2,1352,"Three types of electrolysers and two types of fuel cells, focusing on their manufacturing locations, are compared with two Marine Diesel Oils (MDOs) with various sulphur percentages.",Environmental and economic assessment of hydrogen-powered ferries for inland transportation,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2024.117556
3,1352,"In addition, this study utilises the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to weigh and rank the environmental impacts of all power options based on expert opinions.",Environmental and economic assessment of hydrogen-powered ferries for inland transportation,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2024.117556
4,1352,"As a result of the combination of LCA and AHP analysis, the most environmentally friendly power option is found to be the Solid Oxide Electrolyser-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell system for the case study, while the worst option is the Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyser- Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system.",Environmental and economic assessment of hydrogen-powered ferries for inland transportation,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2024.117556
5,1352,"Moreover, MDOs are the most cost-effective power options in all carbon-tax scenarios.",Environmental and economic assessment of hydrogen-powered ferries for inland transportation,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2024.117556
