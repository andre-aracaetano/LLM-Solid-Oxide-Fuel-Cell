1,18705,The joining of ceramic and metal (interconnect) parts is one of the main challenges in the development of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Non-crystallising glass sealants for SOFC: Effect of Y2O3 addition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.266
2,18705,A promising approach to solving this problem is the use of glassy sealants.,Non-crystallising glass sealants for SOFC: Effect of Y2O3 addition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.266
3,18705,"In this work, we investigated the effect of yttria additions on the properties of SiO2-Al2O3 -CaO-Na2O-ZrO2-Y2O3 glass sealants.",Non-crystallising glass sealants for SOFC: Effect of Y2O3 addition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.266
4,18705,An increase in the concentration of yttria is shown to reduce the tendency of the glasses under study to crystallisation.,Non-crystallising glass sealants for SOFC: Effect of Y2O3 addition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.266
5,18705,"A glass containing 4 wt% of Y2O3 is found to be amorphous, even after exposure at 850 degrees C for 100 h. Moreover, the defectiveness of the glass microstructure, after sealing, is found to decrease along with a growth in the Y2O3 concentration.",Non-crystallising glass sealants for SOFC: Effect of Y2O3 addition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.266
6,18705,The developed non-crystallising sealant was successfully applied for joining a YSZ ceramic and an Fe-Ni-Co alloy having the phase transition of around 500 degrees C.,Non-crystallising glass sealants for SOFC: Effect of Y2O3 addition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.266
7,18705,"The use of the non-crystallising sealant allows us to join materials with very different thermal expansion coefficients and to avoid cracking under cooling, which might occur due to a large difference in thermal expansion coefficients.",Non-crystallising glass sealants for SOFC: Effect of Y2O3 addition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.10.266
