1,19749,Are the energy markets shifting backtoward coal?,Coal cleans up its act,
2,19749,"In some ways, they never left-coal generates more than 50% of U.S. electricity, for example.",Coal cleans up its act,
3,19749,"Yet since the 1950s, coal's share of that market has declined against natural gas and other fuels, largely because emissions from coal-fired plants have hurt the environment and stirred up not-in-my-backyard sentiments.",Coal cleans up its act,
4,19749,"Now, new technologies are helping coal clean up its act-and not a moment too soon.",Coal cleans up its act,
5,19749,"As demand for energy skyrockets in such countries as India and China, cleaning up coal emissions is an effective short-term strategy for helping safeguard our planet's climate and air quality.",Coal cleans up its act,
6,19749,"Environmentalists point toward a future of renewable energy sources, but in the meantime, more coal-fired plants are being planned than at any other time in decades.",Coal cleans up its act,
7,19749,"And with significant coal deposits still available around the world, clean coal is piquing the interest of private investors and subsidy-wielding government officials.",Coal cleans up its act,
8,19749,"Tech Talk: The new technologies range from simple pollution-control devices, such as advanced flue scrubbers, to gasification systems that use coal to create synthetic gas.",Coal cleans up its act,
9,19749,The most common such system is called integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC).,Coal cleans up its act,
10,19749,IGCC plants cost about 20% more to build than their traditional counterparts but can generally produce much more power with significantly lower emissions.,Coal cleans up its act,
11,19749,The most efficient of the new clean-coal technologies will likely be solid oxide fuel cells.,Coal cleans up its act,
12,19749,"Fuel cell plants convert the chemical energy of coal into electrical energy through chemical reactions, without burning the coal. ''",Coal cleans up its act,
13,19749,"We think we can make coal plants substantially more efficient than they are today, while at the same time eliminating all carbon dioxide emissions and all other emissions to the atmosphere;'' says Hans Ziock of Los Alamos National Laboratory.",Coal cleans up its act,
14,19749,"Still, considerable R&D is required, particularly in the area of absorbing or storing carbon dioxide created in power generation so that it does not pollute the atmosphere.",Coal cleans up its act,
15,19749,Why It Matters: '',Coal cleans up its act,
16,19749,"For the first time, there is major worldwide competition for fossil fuel supplies,'' explains Tony Lent, a partner at Los Angeles-based investment fund U.S. Renewables Group.",Coal cleans up its act,
17,19749,"As occurs in all energy markets, demand for coal in any given area is largely driven by Costs, including those imposed by regulation.",Coal cleans up its act,
18,19749,"The costs of oil, natural gas, geothermal energy, and renewable energy sources like solar and wind power make clean coal look '' pretty attractive as an investment,'' says Lent.",Coal cleans up its act,
19,19749,Clean coal is also important to national security.,Coal cleans up its act,
20,19749,An estimated 200-PIUS years of coal reserves are in the ground worldwide. '',Coal cleans up its act,
21,19749,"The U.S. is the Saudi Arabia of coal, with Russia, China, India, and Australia next on the list,'' says Aaron Mandell, CTO of a Cambridge, Massachusetts based clean-coal company that is still in stealth mode.",Coal cleans up its act,
22,19749,Governments concerned with the geopolitical power of oil-rich Middle Eastern countries are willing to bet big on coal.,Coal cleans up its act,
23,19749,"The U.S. government is investing more than $2 billion in cleancoal technologies, and China is thought to be the top user of coal gasification.",Coal cleans up its act,
24,19749,In the Game: Energy companies around the world are investing in cleancoal technologies.,Coal cleans up its act,
25,19749,"The leaders include General Electric, which recently purchased ChevronTexaco's IGCC business, ConocoPhilips, and Houston-based Global Energy.",Coal cleans up its act,
26,19749,"Important research is being done in government and academic laboratories in Canada, the United States, China, and India.",Coal cleans up its act,
27,19749,"Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national laboratories, the University of North Dakota, Pennsylvania State University, and the University of Kentucky are among the top centers in North America.",Coal cleans up its act,
