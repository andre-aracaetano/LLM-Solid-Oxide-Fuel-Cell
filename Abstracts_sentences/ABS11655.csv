2,11655,"Three kinds of cathode current-collecting layer (CCCL) are used, (La,Sr) (Co,Fe)O-3 (LSCF), LSCF+10% Ag, and Ag, and tested in a SUS430/CCCL/SUS430 sandwich structure to simulate the actual operation of the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",On the dependence of interfacial resistance on contact materials between cathode and interconnect in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.128
3,11655,"Experimental results show that the ICR of LSCF+10% Ag exhibits the smallest value, in comparison with the specimens with LSCF and Ag paste, as well as the sample without a CCCL.",On the dependence of interfacial resistance on contact materials between cathode and interconnect in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.128
4,11655,"For LSCF+10% Ag contact, the ICR increases from 0.0069 m Omega cm(2) to 3.74 m Omega cm(2) under an isothermal condition for 150 h, then increases from 3.74 m Omega cm(2) to 10.79 m Omega cm(2) after 15 thermal cycles.",On the dependence of interfacial resistance on contact materials between cathode and interconnect in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.128
