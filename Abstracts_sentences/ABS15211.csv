2,15211,"XRD analysis revealed that the BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta powders obviously decomposed into CeO2 and BaCO3 after exposure in 5% H2O + 5% CO2 + 90% N-2 at 500 degrees C for 10 h. However, samples containing Sn remains unchanged in the same conditions, demonstrating a better stability in the presence Of CO2 and H2O.",The chemical stability and conductivity of BaCe0.9-xYxSn0.1O3-δ solid proton conductor for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.12.120
3,15211,"The conductivity of BaCe0.9-xYxSn0.1O3-delta increased with the increase of Y content (x <= 0.20), and the highest value was observed at x = 0.20 while the conductivity significantly decreases with x = 0.30 and 0.35.",The chemical stability and conductivity of BaCe0.9-xYxSn0.1O3-δ solid proton conductor for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.12.120
