1,10333,The oxygen-deficient perovskite Sr0.7Ho5.3CoO3-delta (SHCO) operates on the Co(III)/Co(II) redox couple rather than the usual Co(IV)/Co(III) couple for an oxygen reduction reaction(ORR) cathode of an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC).,Sr0.7Ho0.3CoO3-δ as a potential cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.028
2,10333,"The room-temperature XRD pattern of SHCO prepared by solid-state reaction can be indexed in the tetragonal 14/mmm space group with unit-cell parameters a= 7.617 angstrom, and c= 15.293 angstrom.",Sr0.7Ho0.3CoO3-δ as a potential cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.028
3,10333,SHCO exhibits an electrical conductivity with values larger than 488 S cm(-1) over the temperature range 560-800 C. The area specific resistance (ASR) of a SHCO cathode measured on a La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 (LSGM) electrolyte reaches a relatively low value of 0.14 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C in air.,Sr0.7Ho0.3CoO3-δ as a potential cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.028
4,10333,"With a 300-mu m-thick LSGM disk as the electrolyte and NiO-GDC as the anode, a cell with the SHCO cathode exhibited maximum power densities of 1274, 756, and 493 mW cm(-2) at 850, 800, and 750 degrees C, respectively, with hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.",Sr0.7Ho0.3CoO3-δ as a potential cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.028
