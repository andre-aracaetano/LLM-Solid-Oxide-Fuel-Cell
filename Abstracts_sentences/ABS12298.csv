1,12298,"The chemical compatibility, thermal expansion and electrochemical property measurements of the SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (SCF)-La0.45Ce0.55O2-delta (LDC) composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) and cathodic polarization measurements together with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).","Chemical compatibility, thermal expansion matches and electrochemical performance of SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.06.111
2,12298,"The results indicated that LDC had good chemical compatibility with SCF and La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM), and the addition of LDC to SCF markedly reduced the polarization resistance.","Chemical compatibility, thermal expansion matches and electrochemical performance of SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.06.111
3,12298,"When the content of LDC reached 50 wt%, the SCF50 cathode showed the best electrochemical performance, with a cathodic over-potential of 0.1 V at the current density of 1102.0 mA cm(-2), together with a polarization resistance of 0.149 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C.","Chemical compatibility, thermal expansion matches and electrochemical performance of SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.06.111
4,12298,"The improved electrochemical performance was attributed to the expansion of the electrochemical reaction region into the electrode, and offering an easier path for the oxygen ion transport.","Chemical compatibility, thermal expansion matches and electrochemical performance of SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.06.111
5,12298,"Furthermore, the SCF LDC composite cathodes match better with the LSGM electrolyte.","Chemical compatibility, thermal expansion matches and electrochemical performance of SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.06.111
