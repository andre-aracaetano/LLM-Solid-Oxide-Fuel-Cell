1,17140,A modified co-pressing process was developed to fabricate anode-supported dense and uniform Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-delta (BZCY) electrolyte films (similar to 20 mu m thick) from BZCY powders with different characteristics; the powders derived from a glycine nitrate process was used for the anode whereas the powders from solid state reaction for the electrolyte.,High-performance anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells based on Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ (BZCY) fabricated by a modified co-pressing process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.018
2,17140,"The BZCY electrolyte films sintered at 1350 degrees C for 6 h reached a conductivity of similar to 0.025 S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C, similar to that of BZCY pellet sintered at 1550 degrees C for 10 h. Further, a test cell based oil such an anode-supported BZCY electrolyte demonstrated peak power densities of similar to 780 and similar to 490 mW cm(-2) at 700 and 600 degrees C, respectively.",High-performance anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells based on Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ (BZCY) fabricated by a modified co-pressing process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.018
