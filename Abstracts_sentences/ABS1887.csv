3,1887,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are largely promising as they show the highest efficiency and flexibility (H-2, CnHm, CO, etc.) and do not need platinum group catalysts.",The Influence of Hydrogen Concentration in an Ar-H2 Mixture on the Electrical Properties of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11106-021-00245-x
4,1887,Much attention is paid to improving the structure of SOFCs to increase their electrical properties.,The Influence of Hydrogen Concentration in an Ar-H2 Mixture on the Electrical Properties of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11106-021-00245-x
5,1887,Different research groups commonly study the electrical properties of SOFCs under different conditions depending on the available equipment and the capabilities of their laboratories; this complicates an overall comparison between the electrical properties of fuel cells.,The Influence of Hydrogen Concentration in an Ar-H2 Mixture on the Electrical Properties of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11106-021-00245-x
6,1887,"In this regard, this research focuses on establishing the dependence of the specific electrical power (P-0.7) at 0.7 V voltage for SOFCs on the hydrogen concentration in model fuel (a mixture of hydrogen and inert gas), other experimental conditions being equal.",The Influence of Hydrogen Concentration in an Ar-H2 Mixture on the Electrical Properties of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11106-021-00245-x
7,1887,The specific electrical power P-0.7 was chosen as one of the most important indicators for SOFC operation in power systems.,The Influence of Hydrogen Concentration in an Ar-H2 Mixture on the Electrical Properties of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11106-021-00245-x
8,1887,"The experimental dependence of P-0.7 on the hydrogen concentration (C-H2) in model fuel for different SOFCs was fitted with the least squares method to polynomial, logarithmic, and linear functions and the factor of coincidence (determination factor R-2) with the experimental data was calculated.",The Influence of Hydrogen Concentration in an Ar-H2 Mixture on the Electrical Properties of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11106-021-00245-x
9,1887,"The quadratic and linear fitting functions were found to be most accurate among the functions considered and showed an average relative fitting error of no more than 9 and 12%, respectively.",The Influence of Hydrogen Concentration in an Ar-H2 Mixture on the Electrical Properties of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11106-021-00245-x
10,1887,The prospects of the proposed hypothesis are that the fitted dependences of the SOFC electrical indicators can be used not only to predict the electrical properties of SOFCs in different operating conditions but also to facilitate the comparison of their electrical properties.,The Influence of Hydrogen Concentration in an Ar-H2 Mixture on the Electrical Properties of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11106-021-00245-x
