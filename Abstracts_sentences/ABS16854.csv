1,16854,"The oxygen electrode reaction at the Pt/yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) interface is investigated at 1000 degreesC on Pt point electrodes on YSZ and YSZ point contacts on Pt. Linear potential sweeps show a pronounced non-linear current-voltage relation and inductive hysteresis, in particular at low sweep rates (similar to 1 muV S-1).",Hysteresis in the solid oxide fuel cell cathode reaction,10.1016/S0013-4686(00)00689-7
2,16854,"Correspondingly, an inductive behaviour is observed at low frequency by impedance measurements on polarised electrodes.",Hysteresis in the solid oxide fuel cell cathode reaction,10.1016/S0013-4686(00)00689-7
3,16854,The behaviour is attributed to a current-induced activation mechanism and subsequent deactivation at equilibrium conditions.,Hysteresis in the solid oxide fuel cell cathode reaction,10.1016/S0013-4686(00)00689-7
4,16854,Several mechanisms are discussed and rejected as responsible for the phenomena.,Hysteresis in the solid oxide fuel cell cathode reaction,10.1016/S0013-4686(00)00689-7
5,16854,"Finally, the stability of the triple phase boundary is questioned and a current-sensitive reaction zone geometry is suggested as an explanation for the behaviour.",Hysteresis in the solid oxide fuel cell cathode reaction,10.1016/S0013-4686(00)00689-7
