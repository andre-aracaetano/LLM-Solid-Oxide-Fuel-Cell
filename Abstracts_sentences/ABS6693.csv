1,6693,Information from ex situ characterization can fall short in describing complex materials systems simultaneously exposed to multiple external stimuli.,Operando and In situ X-ray Spectroscopies of Degradation in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Thin Film Cathodes in Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201402670
2,6693,Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to probe the local atomistic and electronic structure of specific elements in a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3- (LSCF) thin film cathode exposed to air contaminated with H2O and CO2 under operating conditions.,Operando and In situ X-ray Spectroscopies of Degradation in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Thin Film Cathodes in Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201402670
3,6693,"While impedance spectroscopy showed that the polarization resistance of the LSCF cathode increased upon exposure to both contaminants at 750 degrees C, XAS near-edge and extended fine structure showed that the degree of oxidation for Fe and Co decreases with increasing temperature.",Operando and In situ X-ray Spectroscopies of Degradation in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Thin Film Cathodes in Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201402670
