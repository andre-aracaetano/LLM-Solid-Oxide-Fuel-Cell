2,17242,This ceramic framework is sintered at high temperatures with subsequent impregnation and low temperature processing of the active electrode materials.,Development and Performance of MnFeCrO4-Based Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aenm.201300361
3,17242,Here we seek to develop this impregnated electrode concept by investigating a novel scaffold material similar to the main corrosion product of ferritic stainless steel.,Development and Performance of MnFeCrO4-Based Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aenm.201300361
4,17242,"The chromium rich spinel (MnFeCrO4) was used as an electrode support material, either alone or impregnated with (La0.75Sr0.25)(0.97)Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta,La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta, Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta, CeO2 and/or Pd.",Development and Performance of MnFeCrO4-Based Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aenm.201300361
5,17242,In these initial studies it was found that all of the impregnated phases adhere very well to the spinel and considerably enhance performance and stability to a level sufficient for SOFC applications.,Development and Performance of MnFeCrO4-Based Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aenm.201300361
