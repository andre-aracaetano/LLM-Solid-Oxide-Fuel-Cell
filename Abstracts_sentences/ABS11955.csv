1,11955,"The analysis of the medium temperature half-cell Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9|70 wt% La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSCO) + 30 wt % Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (CGO) has been made by electrochemical impedance, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry.",Electrochemical characteristics of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9|La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ + Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 half-cell,10.1007/s10008-004-0640-8
2,11955,The shape of complex impedance plots depends on temperature and cathodic polarisation of the electrode.,Electrochemical characteristics of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9|La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ + Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 half-cell,10.1007/s10008-004-0640-8
3,11955,"Nyquist (Z'', Z'-) plots were fitted by equivalent circuit taking into account the electrolyte properties (at very high frequencies), charge transfer process at grain boundaries (at high frequencies), and medium and low frequency O-2 reduction process at the cathode surface and inside the porous cathode material.",Electrochemical characteristics of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9|La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ + Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 half-cell,10.1007/s10008-004-0640-8
4,11955,"Two different time constants have been obtained for the cathode process, i.e. for electroreduction of oxygen.",Electrochemical characteristics of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9|La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ + Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 half-cell,10.1007/s10008-004-0640-8
5,11955,It was found that the addition of CGO into the cathode material (LSCO) only somewhat decreases the surface catalytic activity but the noticeably higher low-frequency resistance (i.e. mainly diffusion-like mass transfer resistance R-D) values at lower temperatures have been calculated.,Electrochemical characteristics of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9|La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ + Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 half-cell,10.1007/s10008-004-0640-8
6,11955,It was found that the mainly bulk diffusion-limited process at T <= 773 K deviates toward the kinetically mixed process (diffusion + charge transfer) with increasing temperature.,Electrochemical characteristics of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9|La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ + Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 half-cell,10.1007/s10008-004-0640-8
