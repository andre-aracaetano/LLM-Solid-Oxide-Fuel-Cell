The area specific resistance (ASR) of the oxide scale measured at 750 degrees C is 16.3m Omega cm(2), which is higher than that formed in the oxidizing atmosphere but is still within the maximum limit of 100m Omega cm(2), required for metallic interconnects.",Performance evaluation of a new Fe-Cr-Mn alloy in the reducing atmosphere of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.002
8,12899,"The increase in oxidizing temperature from 650 degrees C to 850 degrees C promoted the outward diffusion of Mn and Ti ions, thus changing the composition and morphology of the formed oxides; in addition, the oxidation rate of the alloy increased dramatically, leading to an increase of both the oxide scale thickness and the ASR values.",Performance evaluation of a new Fe-Cr-Mn alloy in the reducing atmosphere of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.002
