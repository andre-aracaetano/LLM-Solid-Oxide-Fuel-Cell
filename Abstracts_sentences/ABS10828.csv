1,10828,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are attractive devices for combined power and heat generation because they can operate with a variety of fuels.,Operando optical studies of solid oxide fuel cells operating on CO and simulated syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229598
2,10828,Syngas (CO + H-2) is particularly attractive but many questions remain about its behavior on SOFC anodes including the relative oxidation efficiencies of CO and H-2 and tendency to form carbon deposits.,Operando optical studies of solid oxide fuel cells operating on CO and simulated syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229598
3,10828,"In this report, operando spectroelectrochemical measurements, including infrared emission spectroscopy, near infrared thermal imaging, and vibrational Raman scattering, combined with spectrochronopotentiometry, are performed using anode-supported SOFCs operating with simulated syngas at 800 degrees C. Results quantify the fate of syngas over Ni-YSZ anodes in SOFCs related to their performance.",Operando optical studies of solid oxide fuel cells operating on CO and simulated syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229598
4,10828,SOFCs operating with simulated syngas mixtures are compared with those for H-2 and CO used separately.,Operando optical studies of solid oxide fuel cells operating on CO and simulated syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229598
5,10828,Thermal imaging shows more SOFC anode heating for H-2-rich syngas than for operating on CO or H-2 alone.,Operando optical studies of solid oxide fuel cells operating on CO and simulated syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229598
6,10828,We attribute this result to carbon gasification by water that is produced by H-2 oxidation.,Operando optical studies of solid oxide fuel cells operating on CO and simulated syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229598
7,10828,"Raman spectra together with spectrochronopotentiometry experiments illustrate that carbon is not observed on the anode surface at 800 degrees C - although it is at 750 degrees C and 700 degrees C - yet carbon is likely present in the spectroscopically inaccessible, electrochemically active region at the electrolyte-electrode interface.",Operando optical studies of solid oxide fuel cells operating on CO and simulated syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229598
