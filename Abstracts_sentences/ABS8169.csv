2,8169,Both dramatically enhanced sinterability and electrical performance are obtained due to the Bi doping.,Processing and characterization of novel Ce0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O2-δ-BaCe0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O3-δ (BiSDC-BCSBi) composite electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.11.227
3,8169,"BiSDC-BCSBi composites are densified at as low as 1200 degrees C, allowing a decrease of 350 degrees C compared with Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta-BaCe0.8Sm0.2O3-delta (SDC-BCS) composites.",Processing and characterization of novel Ce0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O2-δ-BaCe0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O3-δ (BiSDC-BCSBi) composite electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.11.227
4,8169,"The optimal electrical conductivity of BiSDC-BCSBi electrolytes measured at 600 degrees C in humid air reaches up to 27.97 mS cm(-1), almost 6 times higher than that of SDC-BCS electrolytes (3.91 mS cm(-1) in humid air), which is mainly attributed to their lower sintering temperature, more uniform microstructure, larger tensile strains, and higher concentrations of O-H groups and oxygen vacancies.",Processing and characterization of novel Ce0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O2-δ-BaCe0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O3-δ (BiSDC-BCSBi) composite electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.11.227
5,8169,The electrolyte-supported single cell with BiSDC-BCSBi electrolyte displays a peak power density of 397 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C using humid hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.,Processing and characterization of novel Ce0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O2-δ-BaCe0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O3-δ (BiSDC-BCSBi) composite electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.11.227
6,8169,These results imply that BiSDC-BCSBi composites have a great application prospect for IT-SOFCs.,Processing and characterization of novel Ce0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O2-δ-BaCe0.8Sm0.1Bi0.1O3-δ (BiSDC-BCSBi) composite electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.11.227
