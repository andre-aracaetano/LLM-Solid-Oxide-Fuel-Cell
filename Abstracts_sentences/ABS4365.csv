3,4365,The use of low-cost Na+ rather than K+ as the dopant in monoclinic SrSiO3 (C12/C1) is shown to provide a larger solid solution range (0 < x <= 0.45) in Sr1-xNaxSiO3-0.5x and to achieve an oxide ion conductivity sigma(o) >= 10(-2),Monoclinic Sr1-xNaxSiO3-0.5x: New Superior Oxide Ion Electrolytes,10.1021/ja4042737

5,4365,"The Sr1-xNaxSiO3-0.5x electrolytes are much less hygroscopic than Sr1-xNaxSiO3-0.5x and are stable with a nickel composite anode in 5% H-2/Ar as well as with cathodes such as La1-xSrxMnO3-delta and Sr0.7Y0.3CoO3-delta in air, which makes them candidate electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells or for other applications of oxide ion electrolytes.",Monoclinic Sr1-xNaxSiO3-0.5x: New Superior Oxide Ion Electrolytes,10.1021/ja4042737
