1,11892,Perovskite La0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) usually acts as both cathode and anode in a reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC).,Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 in Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acs.iecr.2c02282
2,11892,"It is found that the traditional preparation method can be improved to reduce the particle size, increase the specific surface area, and enhance the oxygen vacancy concentration of LSCF, further improving its bifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR).",Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 in Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acs.iecr.2c02282
3,11892,"Compared with that of LSCF prepared by the traditional solid-state reaction method, the oxygen vacancy concentration of LSCF prepared by the hard-template method is increased.",Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 in Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acs.iecr.2c02282
4,11892,"Moreover, the LSCF prepared by the hard-template method shows better catalytic activity for HOR and ORR.",Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 in Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acs.iecr.2c02282
5,11892,"In addition, the rate-determining steps for HOR and ORR on the surface of LSCF prepared by the hard-template method are the charge transfer reaction and the reduction of oxygen atoms to O-, respectively.",Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 in Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acs.iecr.2c02282
6,11892,"Furthermore, a single-component fuel cell and a reversible single-component cell composed of LSCF prepared by the hard-template method exhibit better performance for discharge and water electrolysis.",Enhancing Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Activities of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 in Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acs.iecr.2c02282
