1,8500,"In this work, air-blast spray deposition (ASD) was applied to prepare dense gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) films on silicon substrates for electrolyte applications in solid oxide fuel cells.",Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Films Prepared by Using an Air-Blast Spray Deposition Technique,10.3938/jkps.53.2636
2,8500,"The morphology of the GDC film depended on process parameters such as the substrate temperature, the liquid flow rate, the deposition time and the nozzle-substrate distance.",Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Films Prepared by Using an Air-Blast Spray Deposition Technique,10.3938/jkps.53.2636
3,8500,"The effects of heating temperature on the crystal structures of the films were investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD) in the heating temperature range of 400 degrees C to 1000 degrees C. A dense GDC film was successfully prepared in a solution flow rate range of 1 l/min to 1.8 l/min, a substrate temperature range of 149 degrees C to 243 OC, a nozzle-substrate distance range of 1 cm to 6 cm and a deposition time range of 0.5 min to 4 min.",Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Films Prepared by Using an Air-Blast Spray Deposition Technique,10.3938/jkps.53.2636
