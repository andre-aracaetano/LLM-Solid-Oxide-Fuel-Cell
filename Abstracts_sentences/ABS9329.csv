1,9329,An anodic cermet of NiCu alloy and gadolinia doped ceria has been investigated for CH4 electro-oxidation in IT-SOFCs.,Performance and life-time behaviour of NiCu-CGO anodes for the direct electro-oxidation of methane in IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.078
2,9329,Polarization curves have been recorded in the temperature range from 650 to 800 degrees C. A maximum power density of 320 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C has been obtained in the presence of dry methane in an electrolyte-supported cell.,Performance and life-time behaviour of NiCu-CGO anodes for the direct electro-oxidation of methane in IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.078
3,9329,The electrochemical behaviour during 1300 h operation in dry methane and in the presence of redox-cycles has been investigated at 750 degrees C; variation of the electrochemical properties during these experiments have been interpreted in terms of anode morphology modifications.,Performance and life-time behaviour of NiCu-CGO anodes for the direct electro-oxidation of methane in IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.078
4,9329,The methane cracking process at the anode catalyst has been investigated by analysing the oxidative stripping of deposited carbon species.,Performance and life-time behaviour of NiCu-CGO anodes for the direct electro-oxidation of methane in IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.078
