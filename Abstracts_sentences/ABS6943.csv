1,6943,The solid oxide fuel cell-micro gas turbine hybrid system with CO2 capture seems to be a prospective system with high efficiency and low emissions.,Parametric Analysis on Hybrid System of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Micro Gas Turbine With CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4027393
2,6943,Three hybrid systems with/without CO2 capture are designed and simulated based on the IPSEPro simulation platform.,Parametric Analysis on Hybrid System of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Micro Gas Turbine With CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4027393
3,6943,"The performance on the design point shows that case 2 is a better one, whose system efficiency is 59% and CO2 capture rate is 99%; thus, case 2 is suitable to build a quasi-zero carbon emission plant.",Parametric Analysis on Hybrid System of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Micro Gas Turbine With CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4027393
4,6943,"However, case 3 is more suitable to rebuild an existing plant.",Parametric Analysis on Hybrid System of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Micro Gas Turbine With CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4027393
5,6943,Then the off-design point performance and the effect of the capture rate on the system performance of cases 2 and 3 are investigated.,Parametric Analysis on Hybrid System of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Micro Gas Turbine With CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4027393
6,6943,"The suggested capture rate for cases 2 and 3 is given based on the result, taking both economic factors and carbon emissions into consideration.",Parametric Analysis on Hybrid System of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Micro Gas Turbine With CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4027393
