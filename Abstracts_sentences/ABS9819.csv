1,9819,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with symmetric configuration have received widespread attention for their potential immunity toward resisting coking and sulfur poisoning.,La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-Based Electrodes for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by A-Site Deficiency Manipulation,10.1021/acsaem.2c03142
2,9819,A key requirement for electrodes in the development of symmetric solid oxide fuel cells is the high electrocatalytic activity in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres.,La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-Based Electrodes for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by A-Site Deficiency Manipulation,10.1021/acsaem.2c03142
3,9819,Herein we report a facile method to improve the electrochemical performance of La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-delta- (LSTF-) based perovskite electrode material by introducing the deficiency in the A-site.,La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-Based Electrodes for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by A-Site Deficiency Manipulation,10.1021/acsaem.2c03142
4,9819,"X-ray diffraction (XRD) results demonstrated that A-site deficient LSTF exsolves a small amount of Fe0 metallic particles and layer perovskite Sr2TiO4, which exhibits high electrical conductivity in H2 atmosphere, while at the same time the exsolution is reversible.",La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-Based Electrodes for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by A-Site Deficiency Manipulation,10.1021/acsaem.2c03142
5,9819,"The polarization resistances (Rp) of (La0.3Sr0.7)0.95Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-delta (LSTF-5%) are 0.032 and 0.110 omega cm2 in air and wet H2 (containing 3% H2O), respectively, at 800 degrees C.",La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-Based Electrodes for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by A-Site Deficiency Manipulation,10.1021/acsaem.2c03142
6,9819,The power density of the electrolyte-supported SSOFCs with LSTF-5% as symmetrical electrode reaches up to 431.8 mW cm-2 at 800 degrees C in wet H2/air.,La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-Based Electrodes for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by A-Site Deficiency Manipulation,10.1021/acsaem.2c03142
7,9819,And the LSTF-5% symmetrical cell also exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and high stability for electrochemically reducing pure CO2.,La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-Based Electrodes for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by A-Site Deficiency Manipulation,10.1021/acsaem.2c03142
