1,3086,"Performances of four anode compositions with different weight ratios of Ni3 +/- xS2 to MoS2 (2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4) were compared for H2S oxidation in SOFC at 700-850 degrees C. Their thermal and chemical stability were determined using DSC/TGA, XRD, SEM and NAA.",Performance and stability of composite nickel and molybdenum sulfide-based anodes for SOFC utilizing H2S,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.12.097
2,3086,Electrochemical stability was investigated in fuel cell mode under OCV and constant overpotential conditions.,Performance and stability of composite nickel and molybdenum sulfide-based anodes for SOFC utilizing H2S,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.12.097
3,3086,It was shown that MoS2 disappearance previously attributed to its volatility at temperature above 450 degrees C was instead related to its preliminary oxidation to MoO3 in fuel cell mode as MoO3 is highly volatile at temperatures above 600 degrees C. Suppression of volatility of MoO3 by addition of Ni3 +/- xS2 was shown by DSC/TGA analysis.,Performance and stability of composite nickel and molybdenum sulfide-based anodes for SOFC utilizing H2S,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.12.097
