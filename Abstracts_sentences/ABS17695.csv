3,17695,"Torr, the resultant films were pore-free and contained no detectable oxygen vacancy, The chemical composition of the films almost agreed with the target.",PREPARATION OF LA1-XSRXCRO3-DELTA FILM BY LASER-ABLATION METHOD,10.1016/0167-2738(94)00248-Q
4,17695,Film crystallinity depended on the crystal structure of the substrates.,PREPARATION OF LA1-XSRXCRO3-DELTA FILM BY LASER-ABLATION METHOD,10.1016/0167-2738(94)00248-Q
5,17695,The film formed on YSZ substrate showed remarkable primary particle growth resulting from heat-treatment at 1473 K for 5 h in air.,PREPARATION OF LA1-XSRXCRO3-DELTA FILM BY LASER-ABLATION METHOD,10.1016/0167-2738(94)00248-Q
6,17695,"When a film was formed on the LaMnO3 substrate, which has a crystal structure similar to that of LaCrO3, under the same conditions as above, neither crystal structure change nor particle growth was observed from heat-treatment at 1473 K.",PREPARATION OF LA1-XSRXCRO3-DELTA FILM BY LASER-ABLATION METHOD,10.1016/0167-2738(94)00248-Q
