1,6575,"Perovskites containing lanthanides, partially substituted by alkaline-earth elements and transition metals like Cr, Ti, Fe or Co show a very broad range of physical properties.",Chromite/titanate based perovskites for application as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00391-X
2,6575,"Therefore several perovskite materials, based on lanthanum chromite and strontium titanate were synthesised and investigated with regard to their application as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells.",Chromite/titanate based perovskites for application as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00391-X
3,6575,"The perovskite powders were studied by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), Conductivity data in the range of 100-900 degreesC and the thermal expansion behaviour were measured both in air and Ar-4%H(2).",Chromite/titanate based perovskites for application as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00391-X
4,6575,The electrochemical properties of a screen-printed electrode were studied preliminary as function of the hydrogen partial pressure using impedance spectroscopy.,Chromite/titanate based perovskites for application as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00391-X
5,6575,"In this group of materials high electronic conductivity of up to 60 S/cm at 900 degreesC was observed, However, none of the materials investigated so far showed a combination of the advantageous properties and is therefore superior to the state-of-the-art Ni-YSZ anode.",Chromite/titanate based perovskites for application as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00391-X
