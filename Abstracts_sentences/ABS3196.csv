1,3196,"Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) or proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are a class of electro-chemical devices with high proton conductivity at the intermediate, even low operating temperatures (450-750 C), which directly convert the chemical energy of hydrogen or hydrogen-containing fuels into elec-tricity in a clean and efficient manner.",Composite cathodes for protonic ceramic fuel cells: Rationales and materials,10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.109881
2,3196,"In comparison to oxygen-ion conducting SOFCs, the operation at lower operating temperature overcomes the incompatibility and cathode delamination issues in high-temperature operated SOFCs.",Composite cathodes for protonic ceramic fuel cells: Rationales and materials,10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.109881
3,3196,"More attractively, the fuel is not diluted owing to the production of water at the cathode side.",Composite cathodes for protonic ceramic fuel cells: Rationales and materials,10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.109881
4,3196,"However, lowing working temperature weakens the electrode reaction kinetics and the ion migration, therefore the rational design of high-performance cathode materials is highly desired for PCFCs.",Composite cathodes for protonic ceramic fuel cells: Rationales and materials,10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.109881
5,3196,"Herein, we provide a review on the design criteria and state-of-art materials of PCFC composite cathodes including proton-conducting composite, proton-blocking composite and other types of composite cathodes, and discuss the un-derlying rationales and mechanisms.",Composite cathodes for protonic ceramic fuel cells: Rationales and materials,10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.109881
6,3196,"In particular, we discuss the feasibility of self-assembled composite cath-odes used in PCFCs, and point out the future development directions of composite cathodes.",Composite cathodes for protonic ceramic fuel cells: Rationales and materials,10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.109881
