1,21078,"To better understand the oxide ion conduction mechanism of rare earth silicate apatites as intermediate temperature electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), the effect of lower valent metal doping on the performance of Nd(28+x)/3AlxSi6-xO26 (0 <= x <= 2) single crystals has been examined.",Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
2,21078,The measurement of ionic conductivity via AC impedance spectroscopy showed that the conductivities were anisotropic and superior along the c direction.,Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
3,21078,"An interesting aspect from the impedance studies was the identification of a second semicircle with capacitance similar to that of a grain boundary component, despite the fact that polarized optical microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction showed that the single crystals consisted of a single grain.",Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
4,21078,"This semicircle disappeared after long-term (up to 3 months) annealing of the single crystals at 950 degrees C, also leading to a reduction in the bulk conductivity.",Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
5,21078,"In order to explain these observations, single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies were performed both before and after annealing.",Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
6,21078,"These studies found the undoped crystal conformed to P6(3)/m, but with the 0(3) oxygen positions, that participate in conduction, split nonstatistically across two sites with a shortened Si-O(3) bond.",Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
7,21078,"Consequently, the bond valence sum (BVS) of the Si (4.20) is larger than the formal valence.",Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
8,21078,"Fourier difference maps of the Al-doped crystals contain regions of excess scattering, suggesting the possible lowering of symmetry or creation of superstructures.",Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
9,21078,"After long-term annealing, the single crystal structure determinations were of higher quality and the experimental and nominal compositions were in better agreement.",Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
10,21078,"From these observations, we propose that in the as-prepared single crystals there are regions of high and low interstitial content (e.g., Nd9.67Si6O26.5 and Nd9.33Si6O26), and the second semicircle relates to the interface between such regions.",Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
11,21078,"On annealing, Nd redistribution and homogenization removes these interfaces and also reduces the number of interstitial oxide ions, hence eliminating this second semicircle while reducing the bulk conductivity.",Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
12,21078,The results therefore show for the first time that the conductivity of apatite materials containing cation vacancies is affected by the thermal history.,Crystallographic Correlations with Anisotropic Oxide Ion Conduction in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/cm4000685
