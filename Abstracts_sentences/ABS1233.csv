1,1233,Calcium and strontium-doped praseodymium manganite powders were prepared as cathode materials in solid oxide fuel cells.,"Characteristics of Pr1-xMxMnO3 (M=Ca, Sr) as cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0254-0584(98)80006-0
2,1233,"The characteristics of these materials such as particle size distribution, electrical conductivity, cathodic polarization, thermal expansion, and reactivity with electrolyte were investigated.","Characteristics of Pr1-xMxMnO3 (M=Ca, Sr) as cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0254-0584(98)80006-0
3,1233,It was found that the optimum doping content of Ca and Sr was 30 mol% and that Ca-doped PrMnO3 had higher electrical conductivity and lower cathodic overpotential than Sr-doped PrMnO3.,"Characteristics of Pr1-xMxMnO3 (M=Ca, Sr) as cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0254-0584(98)80006-0
4,1233,"Further, the 30 mol% Ca-doped PrMnO3 had not reacted with Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) in the temperature range 1000-1200 degrees C for 100 h and it had a thermal expansion coefficient close to that of YSZ.","Characteristics of Pr1-xMxMnO3 (M=Ca, Sr) as cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0254-0584(98)80006-0
5,1233,It was found that 30 mol% Ca-doped PrMnO3 was satisfactory for use as a cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells.,"Characteristics of Pr1-xMxMnO3 (M=Ca, Sr) as cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0254-0584(98)80006-0
