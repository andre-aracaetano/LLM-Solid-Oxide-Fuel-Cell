1,17134,"The effect of water vapor on the mechanical properties of a porous nickel/yttria- stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) composite ( volume ratio of Ni:YSZ = 40: 60) was evaluated at 850 degrees C, a typical operating temperature of a reversible solid oxide cell.",Effect of water vapor on static fatigue behavior of a nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia composite,10.2109/jcersj2.16294
2,17134,Both the flexural strength and static fatigue limit of Ni-YSZ obtained from the static fatigue lifetime under a wet atmosphere (containing 4% H2O) were lower than those under a dry atmosphere.,Effect of water vapor on static fatigue behavior of a nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia composite,10.2109/jcersj2.16294
