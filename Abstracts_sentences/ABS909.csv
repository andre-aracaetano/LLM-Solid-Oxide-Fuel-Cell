1,909,Planer-type electrolyte substrates are often utilized for stack manufacturing of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells (ES-SOFCs) to fulfill necessary requirements such as a high mechanical strength and redox stability.,The Effect of the Anode Thickness on Electrolyte Supported SOFCs,10.33961/jecst.2022.00850
2,909,This work did an electrochemical analysis of ES-SOFC with different NiO-YSZ anode thicknesses to find the optimal value for the high performance of the fuel cell.,The Effect of the Anode Thickness on Electrolyte Supported SOFCs,10.33961/jecst.2022.00850
3,909,"The cell resistivities were constant at anode thickness between 25-58 mu m, but a thick anode (74 mu m) caused a high electrode resistivity leading to a dramatic reduction in cell performance.",The Effect of the Anode Thickness on Electrolyte Supported SOFCs,10.33961/jecst.2022.00850
4,909,"A stability test was performed for 50 hours at 700 C, and the results showed a degradation rate of 0.3% per 1000 h by extrapolated fitting.",The Effect of the Anode Thickness on Electrolyte Supported SOFCs,10.33961/jecst.2022.00850
