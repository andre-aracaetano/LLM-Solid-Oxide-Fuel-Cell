1,4713,Stainless steel interconnect materials used in solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysers need to be coated to improve oxidation resistance and to mitigate Cr-vaporization.,Protective Coatings for Ferritic Stainless Steel Interconnect Materials in High Temperature Solid Oxide Electrolyser Atmospheres,10.3390/en15031168
2,4713,"This work aimed to explore the optimal steel/coating combinations suitable for use in reversible solid oxide stacks and evaluated (Co,Mn)(3)O-4 spinel, LaFeO3 perovskite, Ce/Co and Y-based coatings, on AISI441 and Crofer 22 APU steels.",Protective Coatings for Ferritic Stainless Steel Interconnect Materials in High Temperature Solid Oxide Electrolyser Atmospheres,10.3390/en15031168
3,4713,The coatings were evaluated based on measurements of mass gain and oxide scale thickness after exposure at 700 and 800 degrees C to fuel side (90 vol.% H2O/10 vol.% H-2) and air/oxygen side (pure O-2) atmospheres.,Protective Coatings for Ferritic Stainless Steel Interconnect Materials in High Temperature Solid Oxide Electrolyser Atmospheres,10.3390/en15031168
4,4713,"In pure O-2, the most efficient coatings for limiting oxide scale formation and Cr evaporation, compared to the bare steel, were (Co,Mn)(3)O-4 and CeCo on Crofer 22 APU.",Protective Coatings for Ferritic Stainless Steel Interconnect Materials in High Temperature Solid Oxide Electrolyser Atmospheres,10.3390/en15031168
5,4713,"In 90 vol.% H2O/10 vol.% H-2, the Y-based coating showed the largest improvement in oxidation resistance.",Protective Coatings for Ferritic Stainless Steel Interconnect Materials in High Temperature Solid Oxide Electrolyser Atmospheres,10.3390/en15031168
