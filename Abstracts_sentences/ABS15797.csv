1,15797,"For solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems fueled by kerosene, reforming of methane, ethylene, and desulfurized kerosene was investigated over Ni-8YSZ catalyst at 750 degrees C and steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C) = 3 as a function of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV).","Reforming of methane, ethylene, and desulfurized kerosene over Ni-8YSZ catalyst",10.1016/j.apcata.2008.06.043
2,15797,"At temperatures higher than 650 degrees C, a thick Ni-8YSZ layer exhibited a high catalytic activity for reforming of methane, ethylene, and kerosene of which gas concentration in a pre-reformate gas was less than 1%.","Reforming of methane, ethylene, and desulfurized kerosene over Ni-8YSZ catalyst",10.1016/j.apcata.2008.06.043
3,15797,"On the other hand, thin anode layer will require some modification of the catalytic activity.","Reforming of methane, ethylene, and desulfurized kerosene over Ni-8YSZ catalyst",10.1016/j.apcata.2008.06.043
4,15797,"Carbon was formed as particles in the inlet quartz wool via pyrolysis of ethylene at flow-stagnation points, which will cause pore closure in Ni-anode catalysts.","Reforming of methane, ethylene, and desulfurized kerosene over Ni-8YSZ catalyst",10.1016/j.apcata.2008.06.043
5,15797,This type of carbon formation would bring about inhomogeneous flow-and-voltage distribution in a cell.,"Reforming of methane, ethylene, and desulfurized kerosene over Ni-8YSZ catalyst",10.1016/j.apcata.2008.06.043
6,15797,"Direct feed of steam and kerosene to Ni-8YSZ was examined at GHSV = 2400 h(-1), 1, S/C = 3 and 550-750 degrees C. Gas composition analysis and FTIR spectra indicate that high kerosene conversion (>= 95%) could be attained at 650-750 degrees C over Ni-8YSZ assuming relatively thick Ni-anode layer.","Reforming of methane, ethylene, and desulfurized kerosene over Ni-8YSZ catalyst",10.1016/j.apcata.2008.06.043
7,15797,The catalytic activity was deteriorated at lower temperatures.,"Reforming of methane, ethylene, and desulfurized kerosene over Ni-8YSZ catalyst",10.1016/j.apcata.2008.06.043
8,15797,Clear carbon deposition on Ni-8YSZ or inlet quartz wool was not observed on the experimental condition.,"Reforming of methane, ethylene, and desulfurized kerosene over Ni-8YSZ catalyst",10.1016/j.apcata.2008.06.043
9,15797,"The direct feeding system may be possible only at high temperatures and high S/C. As long as a temperature of anode-supported SOFCs is kept over 650 degrees C, small amount of methane, ethylene, and kerosene will not harm performance of the SOFCs.","Reforming of methane, ethylene, and desulfurized kerosene over Ni-8YSZ catalyst",10.1016/j.apcata.2008.06.043
