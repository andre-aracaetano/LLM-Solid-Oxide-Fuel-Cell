1,2983,A new high temperature fuel cell-micro gas turbine physical emulator has been designed and installed in the framework of the European Integrated Project FELICITAS at the Thermochemical Power Group (TPG) laboratory located at Savona.,Hybrid Simulation Facility Based on Commercial 100 kWe Micro Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.3006200
2,2983,The test rig is based on a commercial 100 kWe recuperated micro gas turbine (mGT) (Turbec T100) modified to be connected to a modular volume designed for physical emulation of fuel cell stack influence.,Hybrid Simulation Facility Based on Commercial 100 kWe Micro Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.3006200
3,2983,The test rig has been developed starting with a complete theoretical analysis of the micro gas turbine design and off-design performance and with the definition of the more flexible layout to be used for different hybrid system (molten carbonate fuel cell or solid oxide fuel cell) emulation.,Hybrid Simulation Facility Based on Commercial 100 kWe Micro Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.3006200
4,2983,"The layout of the system (connecting pipes, valves, and instrumentation, in particular mass flow meter locations) has been carefully designed, and is presented in detail in this paper.",Hybrid Simulation Facility Based on Commercial 100 kWe Micro Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.3006200
5,2983,"Particular attention has been focused on the viscous pressure loss minimization: (i) to reduce the unbalance between compressor and expander, (ii) to maintain a high measurement precision, and (iii) to have an effective plant flexibility.",Hybrid Simulation Facility Based on Commercial 100 kWe Micro Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.3006200
6,2983,"Moreover, the volume used to emulate the cell stack has been designed to be strongly modular (different from a similar system developed by U.S. Department Of Energy-National Energy Technology Laboratory) to allow different volume size influence on the mGT rig to be easily tested.",Hybrid Simulation Facility Based on Commercial 100 kWe Micro Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.3006200
7,2983,The modular high temperature volume has been designed using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) commercial tool (FLUENT).,Hybrid Simulation Facility Based on Commercial 100 kWe Micro Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.3006200
8,2983,"The CFD analysis was used (i) to reach a high level of uniformity in the flow distribution inside the volume, (ii) to have a velocity field (m/s) similar to the one existing inside the emulated cell stack, and (iii) to minimize (as possible) the pressure losses.",Hybrid Simulation Facility Based on Commercial 100 kWe Micro Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.3006200
9,2983,The volume insulation will also allow to consider a strong thermal capacity effect during the tests.,Hybrid Simulation Facility Based on Commercial 100 kWe Micro Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.3006200
10,2983,This paper reports the experimental results of several tests carried out on the rig (using the mGT at electrical stand-alone conditions with the machine control system operating at constant rotational speed) at different load values and at both steady-state and transient conditions.,Hybrid Simulation Facility Based on Commercial 100 kWe Micro Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.3006200
