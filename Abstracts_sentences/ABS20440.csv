4,20440,The prepared coatings were heated up to 700 degrees C and held on for 15 h to allow the conductivity evolution.,"The Microstructure and Conductivity Evolution of Plasma-Sprayed (Mn, Co)3O4 Spinel Coatings during Conductivity Measurements at Elevated Temperature",10.3390/coatings11050533
5,20440,"The microstructure and composition of coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS).","The Microstructure and Conductivity Evolution of Plasma-Sprayed (Mn, Co)3O4 Spinel Coatings during Conductivity Measurements at Elevated Temperature",10.3390/coatings11050533
6,20440,The results show that all coatings were evidently densified in two hours of heating while the measured conductivities were continuously evolved.,"The Microstructure and Conductivity Evolution of Plasma-Sprayed (Mn, Co)3O4 Spinel Coatings during Conductivity Measurements at Elevated Temperature",10.3390/coatings11050533
7,20440,The phase composition was found contributed more to the conductivity evolutions than the densification.,"The Microstructure and Conductivity Evolution of Plasma-Sprayed (Mn, Co)3O4 Spinel Coatings during Conductivity Measurements at Elevated Temperature",10.3390/coatings11050533
8,20440,The conversion of CoO to MnCo2O4 was observed and thus endowed the coatings a conductivity of 40 S/cm.,"The Microstructure and Conductivity Evolution of Plasma-Sprayed (Mn, Co)3O4 Spinel Coatings during Conductivity Measurements at Elevated Temperature",10.3390/coatings11050533
9,20440,"A high fraction of Co3+ diffraction peaks, a high amount of Mn2+ and a low content of Co2+ jointly showed that more Co3+ occupied the B site of AB(2)O(4) phase and more Mn2+ stood at the A site, indicating a stoichiometric composition of MnCo2O4.","The Microstructure and Conductivity Evolution of Plasma-Sprayed (Mn, Co)3O4 Spinel Coatings during Conductivity Measurements at Elevated Temperature",10.3390/coatings11050533
10,20440,Annealing twins were detected by TEM and EBSD for the heated coatings but only a limited contribution to the evolution of the conductivity was considered.,"The Microstructure and Conductivity Evolution of Plasma-Sprayed (Mn, Co)3O4 Spinel Coatings during Conductivity Measurements at Elevated Temperature",10.3390/coatings11050533
11,20440,"Finally, we suggest a high flowrate of plasma gas and a high input energy to prepare spinel coatings with designed conductivity.","The Microstructure and Conductivity Evolution of Plasma-Sprayed (Mn, Co)3O4 Spinel Coatings during Conductivity Measurements at Elevated Temperature",10.3390/coatings11050533
