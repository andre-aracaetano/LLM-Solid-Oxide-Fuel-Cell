1,18569,"A simplified anodic solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system, Ni, H-2-H2O\YSZ, is investigated using the so-called state-space modeling (SSM) approach that combines experiments, modeling, and simulations.","State-space modeling of the anodic SOFC system Ni, H2-H2O|YSZ",10.1016/S0167-2738(01)01004-9
2,18569,The approach is first described in general.,"State-space modeling of the anodic SOFC system Ni, H2-H2O|YSZ",10.1016/S0167-2738(01)01004-9
3,18569,"Then, an electrochemical model is established for the Ni, H-2-H2O\YSZ system.","State-space modeling of the anodic SOFC system Ni, H2-H2O|YSZ",10.1016/S0167-2738(01)01004-9
4,18569,The kinetic constants necessary for the simulations are estimated on the basis of literature data.,"State-space modeling of the anodic SOFC system Ni, H2-H2O|YSZ",10.1016/S0167-2738(01)01004-9
5,18569,"The model is validated by fitting the simulated to the experimental impedance spectra, which were measured under well-defined operating conditions, simulated directly from the assumed electrochemical model and the estimated kinetic constants.","State-space modeling of the anodic SOFC system Ni, H2-H2O|YSZ",10.1016/S0167-2738(01)01004-9
6,18569,"Simulations were also carried out varying the triple phase boundary (TPB) length, the partial pressure of hydrogen and of water, and the overpotential.","State-space modeling of the anodic SOFC system Ni, H2-H2O|YSZ",10.1016/S0167-2738(01)01004-9
7,18569,A comparison of the simulated with the experimental data proves the feasibility of the approach for investigating the electrochemistry of SOFC anodes.,"State-space modeling of the anodic SOFC system Ni, H2-H2O|YSZ",10.1016/S0167-2738(01)01004-9
8,18569,"However, it comes out that the assumed model requires modifications.","State-space modeling of the anodic SOFC system Ni, H2-H2O|YSZ",10.1016/S0167-2738(01)01004-9
9,18569,An alternative model is proposed for further investigations.,"State-space modeling of the anodic SOFC system Ni, H2-H2O|YSZ",10.1016/S0167-2738(01)01004-9
