3,20106,"One sample of PD alloy with plasma-sprayed La0.9Sr0.1CrO3 and a contacting layer of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 exhibited little degradation, estimated to be 0.066 Ohm cm(2) after 10,000 h. Other samples of PD were coated by different spinel-forming slurries pretreated in H-2/H2O/Ar mixtures at 950 and 1000 degrees C. Coatings forming MnCr2O4 spinel and using La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 as a contacting layer showed a low estimated degradation of 0.04-0.06 Ohm cm(2) after 10,000 h. Another spinel (Co,Mn)(3)O-4 appeared to reduce Cr diffusion significantly, and when used together with a mixed perovskite made of 1:1 of LSM and La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 as a contacting layer, exhibited estimated degradation of 0.024 Ohm cm(2) for 10,000 h.
