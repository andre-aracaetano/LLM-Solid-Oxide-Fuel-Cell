1,13005,The oxygen incorporation/extraction kinetics of the potential solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode material Bi1-xSrxFeO3-delta with x = 0.5 and 0.8 was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on geometrically well-defined pore-free thin film electrodes.,Fast oxygen exchange kinetics of pore-free Bi1-xSrxFeO3-δ thin films,10.1039/c1cp21684h
2,13005,The oxygen exchange rate was found to be higher than that of La1-xSrxFeO3-delta and-among cobalt-free perovskites-only surpassed by Ba1-xSrxFeO3-delta which is however known to be unstable in a SOFC environment.,Fast oxygen exchange kinetics of pore-free Bi1-xSrxFeO3-δ thin films,10.1039/c1cp21684h
