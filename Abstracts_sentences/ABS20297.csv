2,20297,"However, new applications, such as solid oxide fuel cells require fine structured layers or very thin coatings, which can't be achieved by classical plasma spraying.",LIQUID JET AND PLASMA JET INTERACTION: A FIRST STEP IN THE STUDY OF FINE STRUCTURED COATINGS ELABORATION,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v14.i4.30
3,20297,"Actually, ultrafine powders (d < 5 mu m) can't penetrate inside the plasma jet, the carrier gas being unable to give enough momentum to very small particles, without perturbing drastically the plasma jet.",LIQUID JET AND PLASMA JET INTERACTION: A FIRST STEP IN THE STUDY OF FINE STRUCTURED COATINGS ELABORATION,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v14.i4.30
4,20297,This paper presents a new process using a d.c. plasma torch where a liquid precursor is injected in order to obtain layers which thickness is between 100nm and 101 mu m together with a fine structure involving grains of about 1 mu m and below.,LIQUID JET AND PLASMA JET INTERACTION: A FIRST STEP IN THE STUDY OF FINE STRUCTURED COATINGS ELABORATION,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v14.i4.30
