3,2529,"The morphology, catalytic activity and electrochemical performance for wet methane/coal-bed gas (CBG) are investigated.",Enhanced coking resistance of Ni cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells based on methane on-cell reforming by a redox-stable double-perovskite Sr2MoFeO6-δ,10.1002/er.4106
4,2529,A Ni-YSZ anode supported cell with SMFO generates a high power output of 1.77 W center dot cm(-2) and exhibits favorable stability operated on wet CH4 at 800 degrees C. Post-mortem micro-structural analyses of cells indicate the cell operated on CBG shows coking probably due to the heavy carbon compounds in CBG.,Enhanced coking resistance of Ni cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells based on methane on-cell reforming by a redox-stable double-perovskite Sr2MoFeO6-δ,10.1002/er.4106
