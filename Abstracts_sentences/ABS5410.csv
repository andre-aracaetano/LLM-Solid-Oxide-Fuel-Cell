4,5410,Powder X-ray diffraction patterns at 750 and 900 degrees C confirmed that PdO decomposition to Pd which normally occurred at 840 degrees C was suppressed for Co containing Pd alloys while thermal gravimetric analyses indicated improved redox reversibility of PdO <-> Pd conversion for alloys during the thermal cycling between 600 and 900 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy images supported these arguments.,Electrochemical performance and stability of nano-structured Co/PdO-co-impregnated Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.159
