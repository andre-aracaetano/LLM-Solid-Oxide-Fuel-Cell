1,7572,The electrolyte and electrode materials used in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) were synthesized by a new preparation method called nitrate-citrate process.,Electrolyte and electrode materials of intermedium-temperature SOFC prepared by nitrate-citrate combustion synthesis,
2,7572,"A single solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was assembled, in which Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC) was applied as the electrolyte, La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 doped with a certain amount of GDC was selected as the cathode material and a GDC-NiO composite powder was used as the anode material.",Electrolyte and electrode materials of intermedium-temperature SOFC prepared by nitrate-citrate combustion synthesis,
3,7572,"The performance of this single cell was investigated, The test results show that the output voltage and current of the single cell was increased with increasing operating temperature, while the open-circuit voltage decreased with increasing operating temperature.",Electrolyte and electrode materials of intermedium-temperature SOFC prepared by nitrate-citrate combustion synthesis,
4,7572,"Moreover, the maximum power density reached 85 mW/cm(2) at 750 degrees C when Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 was used as electrolyte for the single cell.",Electrolyte and electrode materials of intermedium-temperature SOFC prepared by nitrate-citrate combustion synthesis,
