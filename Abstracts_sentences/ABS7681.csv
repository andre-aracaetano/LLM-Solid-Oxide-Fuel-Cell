1,7681,The sulfur poisoning behavior of nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cermet anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was investigated under both potentiostatic and galvanostatic conditions.,Influence of cell voltage and current on sulfur poisoning behavior of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.07.052
2,7681,"While the observed relative drop in cell power output caused by sulfur poisoning decreases as the cell-terminal voltage is lowered potentiostatically (thus more current passing through the cell), it increases as more current is drawn from the cell galvanostatically (thus leading to lower terminal voltage).",Influence of cell voltage and current on sulfur poisoning behavior of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.07.052
3,7681,"The apparent contradictory trends in relative performance loss due to sulfur poisoning are explained using a simple equivalent circuit analysis, which was further validated by impedance measurements of cells before and after poisoning by trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) under different conditions.",Influence of cell voltage and current on sulfur poisoning behavior of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.07.052
4,7681,Results suggest that the relative increase in cell internal resistance caused by sulfur poisoning is smaller when more current is drawn from the cell (or the cell-terminal voltage is lowered) under either potentiostatic or galvanostatic conditions.,Influence of cell voltage and current on sulfur poisoning behavior of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.07.052
5,7681,"Thus, the increase in anode polarization resistance, not the drop in cell power output, should be used to describe the degree of sulfur poisoning in order to avoid any confusion.",Influence of cell voltage and current on sulfur poisoning behavior of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.07.052
