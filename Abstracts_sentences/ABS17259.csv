2,17259,"However, these properties suffer thermal deactivation under real operating conditions and accordingly thermal stability is a highly desirable property.",Self-assembly of one-pot synthesized CexZr1-xO2-BaO•nAl2O3 nanocomposites promoted by site-selective doping of alumina with barium,10.1039/c3ta01214j
3,17259,We report that highly dispersed and intimately intermixed CeO2-ZrO2-BaO-Al2O3 nanocomposites can be synthesized by direct one-pot synthesis.,Self-assembly of one-pot synthesized CexZr1-xO2-BaO•nAl2O3 nanocomposites promoted by site-selective doping of alumina with barium,10.1039/c3ta01214j
4,17259,"With an appropriate choice of dopant concentration, a self-assembly mechanism is triggered on calcination at high temperatures to form a network of inter-grown stabilized transition aluminas and CexZr1-xO2 nanocrystals anchored over barium hexaaluminate which show remarkable catalytic properties and an excellent stability against thermal and redox ageing.",Self-assembly of one-pot synthesized CexZr1-xO2-BaO•nAl2O3 nanocomposites promoted by site-selective doping of alumina with barium,10.1039/c3ta01214j
