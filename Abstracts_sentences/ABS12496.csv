1,12496,The insufficient thermal mechanical stability of sealing interface presents a challenge for the development of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Interaction between gadolinia-doped ceria electrolyte and sealing glass-ceramics,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.01.020
2,12496,"Here we report for the first time that the presence of gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte leads to the formation of two hardystonite phases, (Ca(0.9)Z(0.03))(2)(Al0.63Zn0.37)(Si0.69Al0.31)(2)O-7 and Ca2ZnSi2O7, in the reaction couples between boroaluminosilicate sealing glass ceramics and GDC powders held at 700 degrees C for 30 days.",Interaction between gadolinia-doped ceria electrolyte and sealing glass-ceramics,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.01.020
3,12496,"Similarly, the aggregation of these two hardystonite phases also occurs at the interface between GDC and sealing glass ceramics under identical heat-treatment.",Interaction between gadolinia-doped ceria electrolyte and sealing glass-ceramics,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.01.020
4,12496,"In particular, (Ca(0.9)Z(0.03))(2)(Al0.63Zn0.37)(Si0.69Al0.31)(2)O-7 becomes the dominant phase at the sealing interface when the heat-treatment time increases from 7 days to 30 days.",Interaction between gadolinia-doped ceria electrolyte and sealing glass-ceramics,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.01.020
5,12496,"Moreover, the sealing interface remains intact after thermal cycles for 100 times, indicating the excellent thermal mechanical stability of hardystonite phases.",Interaction between gadolinia-doped ceria electrolyte and sealing glass-ceramics,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.01.020
6,12496,"Finally, the possible mechanism on the phase evolution of glass ceramic at the sealing interface has been proposed.",Interaction between gadolinia-doped ceria electrolyte and sealing glass-ceramics,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.01.020
