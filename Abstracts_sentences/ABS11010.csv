1,11010,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that were capable of running on sour natural gas were fabricated and tested.,A solid oxide fuel cell running on H2S/CH4 fuel mixtures,10.1149/1.2137467
2,11010,"The electrolyte of the SOFCs was yttria- stabilized zirconia (YSZ), the anode material was a strontium- doped lanthanum vanadate with a nominal composition of La0.7Sr0.3VO3 (LSV), and the cathode was a porous composite of La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 (LSM) and YSZ.",A solid oxide fuel cell running on H2S/CH4 fuel mixtures,10.1149/1.2137467
3,11010,The observed peak power density at 950 degrees C was 280 mW/ cm(2) when 5% H2S/ 95% CH4 gas mixture was used as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant.,A solid oxide fuel cell running on H2S/CH4 fuel mixtures,10.1149/1.2137467
4,11010,"Analysis of the effluent gas from the SOFC indicated that, apart from being oxidized electrochemically to sulfur and SO2, a significant portion of the H2S was transformed to carbon disulfide (CS2), an important solvent currently used to dissolve heavy hydrocarbon deposits.",A solid oxide fuel cell running on H2S/CH4 fuel mixtures,10.1149/1.2137467
5,11010,"The results indicated that SOFCs with a LSV anode might be used for the processing of sour natural gas (containing CH4, H2S, etc.) in which both electricity and high value chemicals (i. e., sulfur and CS2) are produced simultaneously.",A solid oxide fuel cell running on H2S/CH4 fuel mixtures,10.1149/1.2137467
