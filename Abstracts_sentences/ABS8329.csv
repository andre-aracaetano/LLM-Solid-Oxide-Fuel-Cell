1,8329,"The relative importance of diffusion, reaction rates at the interfaces and ohmic losses is theoretically investigated for a porous perovskite cathode.",A mathematical model of the porous SOFC cathode,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00289-5
2,8329,Two models for the charge transfer mechanism at the cathode-electrolyte interface have been considered.,A mathematical model of the porous SOFC cathode,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00289-5
3,8329,The first model assumes direct passage of vacancies from the cathode to the electrolyte and predicts a sharp increase of the current density at high cathodic overpotentials.,A mathematical model of the porous SOFC cathode,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00289-5
4,8329,The second model assumes intermediate adsorbed oxygen atoms to be reduced at the cathode-electrolyte interface and predicts a limiting current behaviour in the cathodic direction.,A mathematical model of the porous SOFC cathode,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00289-5
5,8329,"By qualitative comparison of the results with available experimental data, possible mechanisms for the cathode behavior at high overpotentials are evaluated.",A mathematical model of the porous SOFC cathode,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00289-5
