3,9398,"It was utilized for coating specially developed anode (NiO + 8YSZ, 8YSZ: 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia) and electrolyte (8YSZ) suspensions on green and pre-sintered tape-cast anode supports (NiO + 8YSZ).",Preparation of functional layers for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells by the reverse roll coating process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.063
4,9398,"The layers formed were co-fired in a single step at 1400 degrees C for 5 h. As a result, the electrolyte exhibited a thickness of 14-18 mu m and sufficient gas tightness.",Preparation of functional layers for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells by the reverse roll coating process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.063
5,9398,Complete cells with a screen-printed and sintered La0.65Sr0.3MnO3-delta (LSM)/8YSZ cathode yielded a current density of 0.9-1.1 A cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and 0.7 V. which is lower than the performance of non-co-fired slip-cast or screen-printed Julich standard cells with thinner anode and electrolyte layers.,Preparation of functional layers for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells by the reverse roll coating process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.063
6,9398,The contribution of the cell components to the total area-specific resistance (ASR) was calculated by analyzing the distribution function of the relaxation times (DRTs) of measured electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and indicates the potential improvement in the cell performance achievable by reducing the thickness of the roll-coated layers.,Preparation of functional layers for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells by the reverse roll coating process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.063
