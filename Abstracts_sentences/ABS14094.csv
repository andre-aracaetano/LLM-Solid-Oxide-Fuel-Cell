4,14094,"A sensitivity analysis has been carried out in order to have a good insight into SOFC power plant performance, focusing on ethanol steam reformer temperature (823 < T-ESR < 973 K), SOFC stack unit cost (1500-400 $ kW) and fuel price (0.002 < ethanol price < 0.01 $ MJ(-1)).",Exergoeconomic evaluation of an ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell power plant,10.1016/j.energy.2015.10.036

6,14094,"A reduction in the investment cost and in exergy destruction within the stack may reduce the total production cost (Ctot), total investment costs (Ztot) and exergy destruction cost (C-D) by 18%, 73% and 19% respectively, as well as the electricity cost (TCOE) by 21%.",Exergoeconomic evaluation of an ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell power plant,10.1016/j.energy.2015.10.036
