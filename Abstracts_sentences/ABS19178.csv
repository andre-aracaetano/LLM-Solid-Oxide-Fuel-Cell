4,19178,"Whereas the Sr-free phases show a quasi linear thermal expansion behavior in all three directions up to their incongruent melting points, a discontinuity in the measured range is observed for the investigated strontium doped dibismuth-nonaoxotetrametallate(III) caused by the decomposition into Bi2M4O9, strontium metallates and bismuthoxide.","Synthesis and properties of mullite-type (Bi1-xSrx)2(M11-yM2y)4O9-x (M = Al, Ga, Fe)",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.04.004
