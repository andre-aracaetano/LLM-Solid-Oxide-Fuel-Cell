1,18536,"Currently, the cost of electricityfor electrolysis of producinghydrogen is about 70-90% of the total cost.",Analysis of Hydrogen Production Potential from Water Electrolysis in China,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00859
2,18536,"Scientists predictthat the share of renewable energy in total energy is expected toreach about 70% in 2050, as the cost of wind photovoltaic power generationin China is as low as 0.13 yen /(kW center dot h), and that the use ofrenewable energy sources, mainly photovoltaic and wind power, of producinghydrogen can effectively reduce the cost of electricity.",Analysis of Hydrogen Production Potential from Water Electrolysis in China,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00859
3,18536,"Meanwhile,with the improvement of technology, the cost of an electrolyzer usedin proton exchange membrane hydrogen production technology can bereduced by about 50%, which will reduce the cost of hydrogen productionby more than 20%.",Analysis of Hydrogen Production Potential from Water Electrolysis in China,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00859
