2,12133,This work increases the oxygen vacancy concentration through bismuth-doping and thus promotes the electrochemical performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in solid oxide fuel cells.,Oxygen-Deficient Ruddlesden-Popper-Type Lanthanum Strontium Cuprate Doped with Bismuth as a Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b05445
3,12133,X-ray diffraction shows that up to 10% A-site elements can be doped with bismuth.,Oxygen-Deficient Ruddlesden-Popper-Type Lanthanum Strontium Cuprate Doped with Bismuth as a Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b05445
4,12133,"The doping improves the catalytic activity through (1) increasing oxygen vacancy concentration by 87.5 and 65.5% at room temperature and 800 degrees C, respectively, as demonstrated by iodometric titration and thermogravimetric analysis, (2) greatly reducing the energy for oxygen vacancy formation as shown by density functional theory calculation, (3) forming additional reactive oxygen species at the near surface region as suggested with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and (4) enhancing the oxygen transport properties as exhibited with electrical conductivity relaxation.",Oxygen-Deficient Ruddlesden-Popper-Type Lanthanum Strontium Cuprate Doped with Bismuth as a Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b05445
5,12133,"In addition, bismuth doping reduces the thermal expansion coefficient to a level that could exactly match the thermal expansion behavior to the electrolytes.",Oxygen-Deficient Ruddlesden-Popper-Type Lanthanum Strontium Cuprate Doped with Bismuth as a Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b05445
6,12133,"Consequently, the interfacial polarization resistance for ORR is decreased by 43% at 800 degrees C for the cuprate-based composite electrodes.",Oxygen-Deficient Ruddlesden-Popper-Type Lanthanum Strontium Cuprate Doped with Bismuth as a Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b05445
7,12133,"The decrease is greatly attributed to the enhancement in the charge-transfer process, the rate-limiting step.",Oxygen-Deficient Ruddlesden-Popper-Type Lanthanum Strontium Cuprate Doped with Bismuth as a Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b05445
8,12133,"Further, the peak power density for a model cell is increased from 530 to 630 mW.cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Bismuth-doping is a promising strategy to modify the catalytic properties of unique cuprates toward ORR.",Oxygen-Deficient Ruddlesden-Popper-Type Lanthanum Strontium Cuprate Doped with Bismuth as a Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b05445
