1,2443,This study examines effects of the anode functional layer thickness on the performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Effect of anode thickness on impedance response of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.152
2,2443,"The SOFCs with different AFL thicknesses (8 mu m, 19 mu m, and 24 mu m) exhibit similar power densities at the measured current density range (0-2 A cm(-2)), but show different impedance responses.",Effect of anode thickness on impedance response of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.152
3,2443,"Further investigation on the spectra using the CNLS fitting method based on DRT-based equivalent circuit model helps us pinpoint two electrochemical processes directly affected by the AFL thickness changes, the charge transfer reaction in the AFL as well as the diffusion-coupled charge transfer reaction in the AFL.",Effect of anode thickness on impedance response of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.152
4,2443,"The combined effects of these two electrochemical processes probably forged a minimal impact on the overall fuel cell performance by offsetting each other, which offers a reasonable explanation of the seemingly little influence of the AFL thickness on the SOFC performance.",Effect of anode thickness on impedance response of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.152
