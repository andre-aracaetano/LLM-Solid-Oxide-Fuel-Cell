1,12251,"In this paper we investigated, by means of combined neutron and X-ray synchrotron diffraction, the structural properties of the BaCe0.85-xZrxY0.1.5O3-delta solid solution as a function of Zr-doping (0.1 <= x <= 0.4) and temperature.",Combined Neutron and Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction investigation of the BaCe0.85-xZrxY0.15O3-δ (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) Proton Conductors,10.1021/cm1034326
2,12251,Compositions within this system have been proposed as electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC) due to their significant proton conductivities.,Combined Neutron and Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction investigation of the BaCe0.85-xZrxY0.15O3-δ (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) Proton Conductors,10.1021/cm1034326
3,12251,"However, no systematic investigations of the crystal structure evolution as a function of temperature have been reported in the literature.",Combined Neutron and Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction investigation of the BaCe0.85-xZrxY0.15O3-δ (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) Proton Conductors,10.1021/cm1034326
4,12251,"In this paper, we could define the phase stability up to 800 degrees C for each member of the BaCe0.85-xZrxY0.1.5O3-delta solid solution showing that for lower Zr-doping levels (x = 0.1 and 0.2) four different crystal structures are found in the T-range investigated.",Combined Neutron and Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction investigation of the BaCe0.85-xZrxY0.15O3-δ (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) Proton Conductors,10.1021/cm1034326
5,12251,"For higher Zr-doping levels (x = 0.3 and 0.4), the samples show a more symmetric structure already at room temperature (rhombohedral symmetry) and pass through two phase transitions.",Combined Neutron and Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction investigation of the BaCe0.85-xZrxY0.15O3-δ (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) Proton Conductors,10.1021/cm1034326
6,12251,The exact knowledge of the structural features as a function of temperature is an essential piece of information in order to assess the possible use of these electrolyte materials in real devices.,Combined Neutron and Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction investigation of the BaCe0.85-xZrxY0.15O3-δ (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) Proton Conductors,10.1021/cm1034326
