1,16621,This article presents a detailed thermodynamic case study based on the Willem-Alexander Centrale (WAC) power plant in the Netherlands towards retrofitting SOFCs in existing IGCC power plants with a focus on near future implementation.,Towards retrofitting integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and CO2 capture - A thermodynamic case study,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.11.167
2,16621,Two systems with high percentage (up to 70%) biomass co-gasification (based on previously validated steady state models) are discussed: (I) a SOFC retrofitted IGCC system with partial oxy-fuel combustion CO2 capture (II) a redesigned highly efficient integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC) system with full oxy-fuel CO2 capture.,Towards retrofitting integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and CO2 capture - A thermodynamic case study,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.11.167
3,16621,It is concluded that existing IGCC power plants could be operated without major plant modifications and relatively high electrical efficiencies of more than 40% (LHV) by retrofitting SOFCs and partial oxy-combustion CO2 capture.,Towards retrofitting integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and CO2 capture - A thermodynamic case study,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.11.167
