1,13949,"ABSTRACT: Developing high-performance and cost-effective cathodes is ever-increasingly vital for the advancement of facilitate the popularization of nonprecious metallic and cobalt-free oxygen reduction electrodes, herein, we propose a novel perovskite-based BaFeO3-delta (BF) matrix, Ba0.75Sr0.25Fe0.875Y0.125O3-delta (BSFY), as a highly active cathode for IT-SOFCs.",Facile Approach to Enhance Activity and CO2 Resistance of a Novel Cobalt-Free Perovskite Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c06998
2,13949,"To our satisfaction, the BSFY electrode showcases a low area-specific resistance of 0.063 omega cm2, as well as a high peak power density of 1288 mW cm-2 at 600 degrees C, yielding a more than threefold improvement compared to that of its BF counterpart (371 mW cm-2).",Facile Approach to Enhance Activity and CO2 Resistance of a Novel Cobalt-Free Perovskite Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c06998
3,13949,The long-term durability test highlights its practicability under the IT operating condition.,Facile Approach to Enhance Activity and CO2 Resistance of a Novel Cobalt-Free Perovskite Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c06998
4,13949,"When tested in 10 vol % CO2containing air, the BSFY electrode exhibits impressive resistance against contaminants within 50 h (<0.4 omega cm2 with a deterioration rate of similar to 0.00011 omega cm2 min-1).",Facile Approach to Enhance Activity and CO2 Resistance of a Novel Cobalt-Free Perovskite Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c06998
5,13949,"Coupled with its reversible response between pure air and the contaminant, the BSFY cathode is expected to be a promising cobalt-free alternative with high CO2 resistance for IT-SOFCs.",Facile Approach to Enhance Activity and CO2 Resistance of a Novel Cobalt-Free Perovskite Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c06998
