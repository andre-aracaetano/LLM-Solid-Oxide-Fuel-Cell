1,17816,"The formation mechanism of the monoclinic ZrO2 phase at high temperature in the case of the contact between YSZ and CuO, which prevents the manufacturing of the copper-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells has been studied.",Formation mechanism of monoclinic ZrO2 at the contact of YSZ with CuO,10.1134/S0020168515060023
2,17816,"Based on the XRD and thermo-gravimetric data the following mechanism of the phase transformation, occurring in CuO-YSZ system, is proposed.",Formation mechanism of monoclinic ZrO2 at the contact of YSZ with CuO,10.1134/S0020168515060023
3,17816,At the temperatures higher than 900A degrees C the oxygen ion is transferred from CuO to the oxygen vacancy of YSZ surface that leads to the yttrium migration inward the lattice.,Formation mechanism of monoclinic ZrO2 at the contact of YSZ with CuO,10.1134/S0020168515060023
4,17816,"According to the phase diagram of YSZ, the monoclinic ZrO2 phase is formed in the region where the stabilizing additive is deficient.",Formation mechanism of monoclinic ZrO2 at the contact of YSZ with CuO,10.1134/S0020168515060023
5,17816,Based on the proposed mechanism it is suggested that the monoclinic phase should not be formed in the Cu2O-YSZ mixture in an inert atmosphere due to the higher bond energy between oxygen and copper in Cu2O in comparison with CuO.,Formation mechanism of monoclinic ZrO2 at the contact of YSZ with CuO,10.1134/S0020168515060023
