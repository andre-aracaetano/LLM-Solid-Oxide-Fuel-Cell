1,7317,"Cation transport behavior, diffusion and interface reaction were investigated for La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 (LSC) and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSF) perovskite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Cation transport behavior in SOFC cathode materials of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 with perovskite structure,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.07.001
2,7317,"Diffusion couples between two perovskite pellets were annealed around SOFC operating temperatures such as 1071 K, 1175 K, 1279 K and 1379 K. Mass transfer of the iron component from the LSF into the LSC was clearly observed by energy dispersed X-ray analysis (EDX) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).",Cation transport behavior in SOFC cathode materials of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 with perovskite structure,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.07.001
