5,15852,"In case where LaCoO3 was present as a powder, where surface reduction mechanism would prevail, the reduction starts as earlier as 375 degrees C with a formation of the metallic Co and La2O3 at 600 degrees C.","Thermal, mechanical and phase stability of LaCoO3 in reducing and oxidizing environments",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.063
6,15852,"In the bulk form, LaCoO3 undergoes a series of expansion and contractions due to phase transformations beginning around 500 degrees C with very intensive chemical/phase changes at 800 degrees C and above.","Thermal, mechanical and phase stability of LaCoO3 in reducing and oxidizing environments",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.063
7,15852,"These expansions and contractions are directly related to the formation of La3Co3O8, La2CoO4, La4Co3O10, La2O3, CoO, and other Co compounds in the reducing atmosphere.","Thermal, mechanical and phase stability of LaCoO3 in reducing and oxidizing environments",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.063
8,15852,"Although LaCoO3 is a good ionic and electronic conductor and catalyst, its high thermal expansion as well as structural, mechanical, and phase instability in reducing environments present a serious restriction for its application in solid oxide fuel cells, sensors or gas separation membranes.","Thermal, mechanical and phase stability of LaCoO3 in reducing and oxidizing environments",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.063
