1,18655,Scandium is a raw material with properties that promise considerable potential for application in alloys to enable aviation fuel savings and as dopants for use in sustainable energy production using solid oxide fuel cells.,Recovery of scandium from acidic waste solutions by means of polymer inclusion membranes,10.1016/j.hydromet.2022.105916
2,18655,"Despite these attractive properties, scandium is rarely used due to its scarcity and unreliable supply.",Recovery of scandium from acidic waste solutions by means of polymer inclusion membranes,10.1016/j.hydromet.2022.105916
3,18655,"Therefore, new strategies for scandium recovery are of economic priority.",Recovery of scandium from acidic waste solutions by means of polymer inclusion membranes,10.1016/j.hydromet.2022.105916
4,18655,"In this study, polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) consisting of PVDF-HFP, 2-NPOE and DEHPA, were optimised for selective scandium separation from real TiO2 production waste.",Recovery of scandium from acidic waste solutions by means of polymer inclusion membranes,10.1016/j.hydromet.2022.105916
5,18655,"With the optimised system, >60% of the scandium was recovered with high selectivity, resulting in scandium mole fraction at more than two orders of magnitude higher in the receiving phase than in the original waste.",Recovery of scandium from acidic waste solutions by means of polymer inclusion membranes,10.1016/j.hydromet.2022.105916
6,18655,"This suggests PIMs may be an effective way to recover scandium from bulk waste, thus easing the scarcity and insecurity that currently limit its bulk application.",Recovery of scandium from acidic waste solutions by means of polymer inclusion membranes,10.1016/j.hydromet.2022.105916
