1,8534,"Direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are the most energy-efficient and low-carbon technology for renewable power generation from biomass fuels, but they are hindered by carbon deposition on the Ni-based cermet anode.",Excessive Na-Doped La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.4Cu0.1O3-δ Perovskite as an Additional Internal Reforming Catalyst for Direct Carbon Dioxide-Ethanol Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/catal12121600
2,8534,"In this work, excessive Na+ dopant into La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.4Cu0.1O3-delta (LSCFC) perovskite was used as an additional internal reforming catalyst for direct carbon dioxide-ethanol SOFCs.",Excessive Na-Doped La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.4Cu0.1O3-δ Perovskite as an Additional Internal Reforming Catalyst for Direct Carbon Dioxide-Ethanol Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/catal12121600
3,8534,"Excessive Na+-doped LSCFC (N-LSCFC) demonstrated great potential in promoting electrochemical performance and internal reforming process fueled by carbon dioxide-ethanol mixture, because more oxygen vacancies and the precipitated Cu nano catalyst were helpful for the improvement of internal reforming and carbon tolerance.",Excessive Na-Doped La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.4Cu0.1O3-δ Perovskite as an Additional Internal Reforming Catalyst for Direct Carbon Dioxide-Ethanol Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/catal12121600
4,8534,"Electrochemical investigations proved that the vertical-microchannel anode supported the single cells using the N-LSCFC-Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (GDC) internal reforming catalyst, showing a peak power density of 1044.41 and 855.56 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C fueled by H-2 and 50% CO2-50% C2H5OH, respectively.",Excessive Na-Doped La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.4Cu0.1O3-δ Perovskite as an Additional Internal Reforming Catalyst for Direct Carbon Dioxide-Ethanol Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/catal12121600
5,8534,The preceding results indicate that excessive Na+ doping strategy into LSCFC as the additional internal reforming catalyst can improve the electrochemical performance and internal reforming process of direct carbon dioxide-ethanol SOFCs.,Excessive Na-Doped La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.4Cu0.1O3-δ Perovskite as an Additional Internal Reforming Catalyst for Direct Carbon Dioxide-Ethanol Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/catal12121600
