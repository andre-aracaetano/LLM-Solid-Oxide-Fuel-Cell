4,14037,"Moreover, the electronic conductivity and electrode polarization resistance of the reduced films increased and decreased, respectively, with increasing binder content.",The impact of ink rheology on the properties of screen-printed solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.03.108
5,14037,"The improved film properties can be related to the increased particle network strength within the inks, leading to improved film microstructures for application as SOFC anodes.",The impact of ink rheology on the properties of screen-printed solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.03.108
6,14037,"The study also confirmed that the properties of films were more significantly affected by the binder content than solvent type, which had only a minor effect.",The impact of ink rheology on the properties of screen-printed solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.03.108
7,14037,"Overall, from the perspective of ink rheology, screen-printability and performance, an ink with 3 wt% binder gave the best performance at the applied screen-printing condition.",The impact of ink rheology on the properties of screen-printed solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.03.108
