2,6620,"A standard cell design based on a porous nickel cermet has been established and tested with stationary conditions, for which a power density of more than 1.50 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C in H-2 was obtained.",Advances beyond traditional SOFC cell designs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.155
3,6620,"In order to broaden the field of possible applications, new cell designs have been developed.",Advances beyond traditional SOFC cell designs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.155
4,6620,"Among those are metal-supported SOFCs (MSC), which promise increased robustness against thermal-, mechanical and chemical stresses, as well as cheaper production costs.",Advances beyond traditional SOFC cell designs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.155
5,6620,While the MSC development may find an application in mobile devices another cell design concept aims at much lower operating temperatures.,Advances beyond traditional SOFC cell designs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.155
