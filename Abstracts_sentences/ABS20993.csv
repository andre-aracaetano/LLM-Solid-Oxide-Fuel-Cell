1,20993,Mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIEC) have presented great economical and environmental interests for these last years because of their potential applications for electrode materials in solid oxide fuel cell and for oxygen separation form air such as in catalytic membrane reactors for methane conversion into syngas (H-2-CO mixture),"Oxygen semi-permeation, oxygen diffusion and surface exchange coefficient of La(1-x)SrxFe(1-y)GayO3-δ perovskite membranes",10.1016/j.memsci.2010.03.001
