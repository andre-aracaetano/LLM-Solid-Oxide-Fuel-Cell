2,16103,"Phase reactions and crystallization of ceramic alloys in the binary systems ZrO2-Ln(2)O(3), HfO2-Ln(2)O(3), Y2O3-Ln(2)O(3) and phase equilibria in the series of ternary systems HfO2-Y2O3-Ln(2)O(3) and ZrO2-Y2O3-Ln(2)O(3) have been developed at high temperature.","Phase equilibria in the refractory oxide systems of zirconia, hafnia and yttria with rare-earth oxides",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.01.009
3,16103,The most general regularities of the phase reactions in liquid and solid states inherent in these systems have been considered dependent on lanthanide ion radii.,"Phase equilibria in the refractory oxide systems of zirconia, hafnia and yttria with rare-earth oxides",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.01.009
4,16103,"Taking into account literature data and newly developed results in binary and ternary systems, the analysis of the main regularities revealed in the constitution of phase diagrams, particularly its dependence on lanthanide ionic radius, was carried out.","Phase equilibria in the refractory oxide systems of zirconia, hafnia and yttria with rare-earth oxides",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.01.009
5,16103,"It was shown that temperature and composition of eutectic reaction, temperature of the pyrochlore phase decomposition, lattice parameters of solid solutions and other parameters of the binary phases linearly depend on ionic radius of lanthanide.","Phase equilibria in the refractory oxide systems of zirconia, hafnia and yttria with rare-earth oxides",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.01.009
6,16103,For the first time it has been found that the affiliation of lanthanide oxides to cerium or yttrium subgroups predetermines phase relations in the systems and topology of the ternary phase diagrams.,"Phase equilibria in the refractory oxide systems of zirconia, hafnia and yttria with rare-earth oxides",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.01.009
