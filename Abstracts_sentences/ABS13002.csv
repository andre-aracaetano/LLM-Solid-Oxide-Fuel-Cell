1,13002,"In this research, four multigeneration systems comprising of a syngas-fuelled solid oxide fuel cell, double-effect absorption chiller (first configuration), a thermoelectric generator unit (second system), solid oxide electrolyser cell (third configuration), and fuel synthesis unit (fourth configuration) are proposed for cooling, heating, electricity, and hydrogen/synthetic methane production.",Exergoeconomic and environmental optimisations of multigeneration biomass-based solid oxide fuel cell systems with reduced CO2 emissions,10.1002/er.6532
2,13002,"In Configurations 1 to 3, 25% of the discharged CO2 is reinjected into the gasifier, whereas an additional portion is reused in Configuration 4 for synthetic methane production.",Exergoeconomic and environmental optimisations of multigeneration biomass-based solid oxide fuel cell systems with reduced CO2 emissions,10.1002/er.6532
3,13002,"Energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and environmental (4E) analyses are conducted comprehensively.",Exergoeconomic and environmental optimisations of multigeneration biomass-based solid oxide fuel cell systems with reduced CO2 emissions,10.1002/er.6532
4,13002,"Besides, optimisation based on the genetic algorithm is applied to optimise the system through four different modes, for example, maximum efficiency, minimum product, cost, and cost-rate.",Exergoeconomic and environmental optimisations of multigeneration biomass-based solid oxide fuel cell systems with reduced CO2 emissions,10.1002/er.6532
5,13002,The results show that the second system has the highest exergy efficiency and power output while having the minimum product cost.,Exergoeconomic and environmental optimisations of multigeneration biomass-based solid oxide fuel cell systems with reduced CO2 emissions,10.1002/er.6532
