1,10435,"The Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 (SSC-LSF) composites were tested as cathode materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the half-cells with Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as the electrolyte and gold or silver current collectors, at 500,600 and 700 degrees C, in oxygen and oxygen-argon mixtures.",Composite cathode materials Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.10.011
2,10435,"The cathodes with 1:1 weight ratio of SSC and LSF revealed the lowest area specific resistance (ASR) and thermal expansion coefficient of 17.7 x 10(-6) K-1, in the range 30-700 degrees C. Half-cells with silver current collector showed lower ASR in comparison to the half-cells with gold one, which the suggests catalytic effect of silver in ORR.",Composite cathode materials Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.10.011
