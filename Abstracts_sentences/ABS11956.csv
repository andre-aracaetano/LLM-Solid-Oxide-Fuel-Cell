5,11956,The La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-delta (LCF) powder is pure cubic perovskite-type crystalline after fired at 850 degrees C for 2 h.,"Synthesis and electrical properties of La0.6M0.4FeO3-δ (M=Ca, Sr, Ba) as cathodes for SOFCs",
6,11956,"The XRD patterns of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta(LSF) powder shows a small quantity of SrO peaks sintered at 1050 degrees C for 2 h. The electrical conductivity of LCF and LSF at 500 similar to 800 degrees C is over 100 S(.)cm(-1), and the value of LCF is 1170 S(.)cm(-1) at 800 degrees C, which indicate that LCF and LSF may be used as a profitable cathode for IT-SOFCs.","Synthesis and electrical properties of La0.6M0.4FeO3-δ (M=Ca, Sr, Ba) as cathodes for SOFCs",
