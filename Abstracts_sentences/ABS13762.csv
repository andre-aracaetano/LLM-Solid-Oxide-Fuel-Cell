1,13762,The electrochemical performance of porous Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 (BICUVOX) and BICUVOX-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) composite backbones infiltrated with La0.6Sr0.4Co1.05O3-delta (LSC) has been evaluated.,Electrochemical characterization of infiltrated Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 cathodes for use in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.027
2,13762,LSC was introduced into the screen printed and sintered porous backbones by multiple infiltrations of aqueous nitrate solutions followed by firing.,Electrochemical characterization of infiltrated Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 cathodes for use in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.027
3,13762,"The polarization resistance at 500 degrees C in air, measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on symmetrical cells of BICUVOX backbones infiltrated with LSC, was approximately 100 times higher than the one obtained for a CGO backbone subjected to the same LSC infiltrations even though the conductivity of BICUVOX at 500 degrees C was significantly higher than that of CGO at this temperature.",Electrochemical characterization of infiltrated Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 cathodes for use in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.027
4,13762,"The poor performance of the infiltrated BICUVOX backbones is attributed to their coarse microstructure, brought about by the high temperature sintering of the BICUVOX backbone onto the dense CGO electrolyte and a possible reaction layer between the LSC infiltrate material and the BICUVOX backbone.",Electrochemical characterization of infiltrated Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 cathodes for use in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.027
5,13762,The poor chemical compatibility of BICUVOX with LSC even by using a low temperature processing for the LSC using the infiltration method greatly undermines the motivation to continue the exploration of the combination of these materials for use in solid oxide fuel cells.,Electrochemical characterization of infiltrated Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 cathodes for use in low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.027
