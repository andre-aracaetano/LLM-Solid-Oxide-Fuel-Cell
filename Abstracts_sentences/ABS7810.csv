1,7810,"Despite being commercially available, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology requires further study to understand its physicochemical processes for diagnostics, prognostics, and quality assurance purposes.",Developing an Automated Tool for Quantitative Analysis of the Deconvoluted Electrochemical Impedance Response of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en15103702
2,7810,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a widely used characterization technique for SOFCs, is often accompanied by the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) as a method for deconvoluting the contribution of each physicochemical process from the aggregated impedance response spectra.",Developing an Automated Tool for Quantitative Analysis of the Deconvoluted Electrochemical Impedance Response of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en15103702
3,7810,"While EIS yields valuable information for the operation of SOFCs, the quantitative analysis of the DRT and its shifts remains cumbersome.",Developing an Automated Tool for Quantitative Analysis of the Deconvoluted Electrochemical Impedance Response of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en15103702
4,7810,"To address this issue, and to create a replicable benchmark for the assessment of DRT results, a custom tool was developed in MATLAB to numerically analyze the DRT spectra, identify the DRT peaks, and assess their deviation in terms of peak frequency and DRT amplitude from nominal operating conditions.",Developing an Automated Tool for Quantitative Analysis of the Deconvoluted Electrochemical Impedance Response of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en15103702
5,7810,The preliminary validation of the tool was carried out by applying the tool to an extensive experimental campaign on 23 SOFC button-sized samples from three production batches in which EIS measurements were performed in parametric operating conditions.,Developing an Automated Tool for Quantitative Analysis of the Deconvoluted Electrochemical Impedance Response of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en15103702
6,7810,It was concluded that the results of the automated analysis via the developed tool were in accordance with the qualitative analysis of previous studies.,Developing an Automated Tool for Quantitative Analysis of the Deconvoluted Electrochemical Impedance Response of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en15103702
7,7810,It is capable of providing adequate additional quantitative results in terms of DRT shifts for further analysis and provides the basis for better interoperability of DRT analyses between laboratories.,Developing an Automated Tool for Quantitative Analysis of the Deconvoluted Electrochemical Impedance Response of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3390/en15103702
