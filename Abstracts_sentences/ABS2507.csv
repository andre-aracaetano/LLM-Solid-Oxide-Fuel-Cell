1,2507,"Composites consisting of strontium stabilized bismuth oxide (Bi(1.14)Sr(0.43)O(2.14), SSB) and silver were investigated as cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with doped ceria electrolyte.",Composite cathode Bi1.14Sr0.43O2.14-Ag for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11595-007-3350-0
2,2507,There were no chemical reactions between the two components.,Composite cathode Bi1.14Sr0.43O2.14-Ag for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11595-007-3350-0
3,2507,The microstructure of the interfaces between composite cathodes and Ce(0.8)Sm(0.20)O(1.9) (SDC) electrolytes was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).,Composite cathode Bi1.14Sr0.43O2.14-Ag for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11595-007-3350-0
4,2507,Impedance spectroscopy measurements show that the performance of cathode fired at 700 degrees C is the best.,Composite cathode Bi1.14Sr0.43O2.14-Ag for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11595-007-3350-0
5,2507,"When the content of A 920 is 70 wt%, polarization resistance values for the SSB-Ag cathodes are as low as 0.2 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C and 0.29 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C. These results are much smaller than some of other reported composite cathodes on doped ceria electrolyte and indicate that SSB-Ag composite is a potential cathode material for intermediate temperature SOFCs.",Composite cathode Bi1.14Sr0.43O2.14-Ag for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11595-007-3350-0
