2,20283,Electrochemical performances of the MoO2-based cathode are investigated with respect to a commercial Ni/YSZ-based cathode for both co-electrolysis (of H2O and CO2) and electrolysis of only CO2 at 750 degrees C.,MoO2-based cathode for CO2 and H2O electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.080
3,20283,"Under the co-electrolysis mode, the MoO(-)based cell and the Ni/YSZ cell show a similar electro-hemical performance, while in the CO2 electrolysis mode, the MoO2-based cell demonstrates a much improved electrocatalytic activity compared with the Ni/YSZ cell.",MoO2-based cathode for CO2 and H2O electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.080
4,20283,This improved electrochemical activity of the MoO2-based cathode under the CO2 electrolysis mode is further investigated by its electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study.,MoO2-based cathode for CO2 and H2O electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.080
5,20283,"According to our EIS study, the polarization resistance of the MoO2-based cell is 67% lower than that of the Ni/YSZ-based cell under the open circuit potential.",MoO2-based cathode for CO2 and H2O electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.080
6,20283,"A performance stability study indicates that the MoO2-based cell exhibits a relatively low performance degradation under the CO2 electrolysis mode during its 10-h constant voltage test, and low carbon amount (6.6 wt.%) is detected after the performance stability measurement.",MoO2-based cathode for CO2 and H2O electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.080
7,20283,These findings suggest the advantages of applying the MoO2-based cathode for the CO2 electrolysis.,MoO2-based cathode for CO2 and H2O electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.080
