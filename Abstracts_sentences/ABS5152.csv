1,5152,"Metallic Pd and PdO electrodes were prepared by using Pd and PdCl2 slurries, respectively, and their electrochemical performance as a cathode for oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and direct current polarization (DC polarization).",Comparative study of Pd and PdO as cathodes for oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.02.051
2,5152,"The electrochemical activity of metallic Pd was much higher than that of PdO for the reaction of oxygen reduction; below the decomposition temperature, a thin layer of PdO formed on the surface of metallic Pd electrode, which increased its polarization resistance.",Comparative study of Pd and PdO as cathodes for oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.02.051
3,5152,"The decomposition temperature of PdO decreased from 810 to 750 degrees C as oxygen partial pressure decreased from 20 to 5 kPa, and was further lowered under the influence of the applied current during DC polarization test.",Comparative study of Pd and PdO as cathodes for oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.02.051
4,5152,"The charge transfer resistance of PdO increased by decreasing oxygen partial pressure, while that of metallic Pd was less sensitive to it.",Comparative study of Pd and PdO as cathodes for oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.02.051
