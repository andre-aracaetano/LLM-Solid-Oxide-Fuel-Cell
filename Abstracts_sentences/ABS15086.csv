1,15086,A novel Ag/mica compressive seat was thermally cycled between 100 degreesC and 800 degreesC in air to evaluate its stability.,Novel silver/mica multilayer compressive seals for solid-oxide fuel cells: The effect of thermal cycling and material degradation on leak behavior,10.1557/JMR.2003.0313
2,15086,"The novel Ag/mica compressive seal was composed of a naturally cleaved Muscovite mica sheet and two thin silver layers, and was reported in a previous study to have very low leak rates at 800 degreesC. In the present study, we examined the thermal cycle stability of the Ag/mica-based compressive seals pressed between mating couples with large and small mismatch in thermal expansion.",Novel silver/mica multilayer compressive seals for solid-oxide fuel cells: The effect of thermal cycling and material degradation on leak behavior,10.1557/JMR.2003.0313
3,15086,"For comparison, thermal cycling also was conducted on plain mica as well as plain silver only.",Novel silver/mica multilayer compressive seals for solid-oxide fuel cells: The effect of thermal cycling and material degradation on leak behavior,10.1557/JMR.2003.0313
4,15086,"In addition, the results were compared with published data of a similar mica seal using glass instead of Ag as the interlayers.",Novel silver/mica multilayer compressive seals for solid-oxide fuel cells: The effect of thermal cycling and material degradation on leak behavior,10.1557/JMR.2003.0313
5,15086,"For mating materials of large mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient (CTE; Inconel/alumina), the Ag/mica seal showed lower leak rates than the plain mica.",Novel silver/mica multilayer compressive seals for solid-oxide fuel cells: The effect of thermal cycling and material degradation on leak behavior,10.1557/JMR.2003.0313
6,15086,"For mating materials of small mismatch in CTE (SS430/alumina), the leak rates were similar for both the Ag/mica and the plain mica seal.",Novel silver/mica multilayer compressive seals for solid-oxide fuel cells: The effect of thermal cycling and material degradation on leak behavior,10.1557/JMR.2003.0313
7,15086,Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the microstructure of the mica after thermal cycling.,Novel silver/mica multilayer compressive seals for solid-oxide fuel cells: The effect of thermal cycling and material degradation on leak behavior,10.1557/JMR.2003.0313
8,15086,"Microcracks, fragmentation, and wear-particle formation were observed on the mica and were correlated to the leak behavior.",Novel silver/mica multilayer compressive seals for solid-oxide fuel cells: The effect of thermal cycling and material degradation on leak behavior,10.1557/JMR.2003.0313
9,15086,"Overall, the novel Ag/mica seals present good thermal cycle stability for solid-oxide fuel cells, although the leak rates were greater than the corresponding mica seals with glass interlayers.",Novel silver/mica multilayer compressive seals for solid-oxide fuel cells: The effect of thermal cycling and material degradation on leak behavior,10.1557/JMR.2003.0313
