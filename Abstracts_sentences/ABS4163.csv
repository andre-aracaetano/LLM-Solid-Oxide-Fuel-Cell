1,4163,"This study investigates the effect of reforming reaction, water-shift reaction, and operating parameters on the transient performance of a solid oxide fuel cell unit, because the transient analysis is necessary and helpful for the applications of a SOFC with cross-flow configuration.",Transient analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with reforming and water-shift reaction and the building of neural network model for rapid prediction in electrical and thermal performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.165
2,4163,The primary results show that all properties approach the steady state at similar time except the cell temperature.,Transient analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with reforming and water-shift reaction and the building of neural network model for rapid prediction in electrical and thermal performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.165
3,4163,"The reforming and water-shift reaction obviously promote the average current density by 5%, and lower the maximum cell temperature by 20 K. The molar flow rate variation deduces about 15 K difference of maximum cell temperature.",Transient analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with reforming and water-shift reaction and the building of neural network model for rapid prediction in electrical and thermal performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.165
4,4163,The effect of inlet temperature and operating voltage on the average current density and maximum cell temperature is more obvious than the molar flow rate effect.,Transient analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with reforming and water-shift reaction and the building of neural network model for rapid prediction in electrical and thermal performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.165
5,4163,"Moreover, this study builds a neural network model to predict the steady average current density and maximum cell temperature rapidly and correctly, which is helpful for the control of a SOFC.",Transient analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with reforming and water-shift reaction and the building of neural network model for rapid prediction in electrical and thermal performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.165
