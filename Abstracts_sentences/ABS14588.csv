1,14588,Ni composite anodes for Ca-doped LaNbO4 (LCNO) based proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells were fabricated as screen-printed Ni-LCNO cermets on a dense self-supported LCNO electrolyte and as a semi-symmetrical cell consisting of a similar to 15 mu m thick LCNO electrolyte deposited on a tape-cast Ni-LCNO anode support.,Hydrogen Oxidation Kinetics and Performance of Ni-LaNbO4 Cermet Anodes for Proton Conducting SOFCs,10.1149/2.002404jes
2,14588,The influence of Ni content and sintering temperature on the polarization resistance of the Ni-LCNO interface was investigated.,Hydrogen Oxidation Kinetics and Performance of Ni-LaNbO4 Cermet Anodes for Proton Conducting SOFCs,10.1149/2.002404jes
3,14588,"The interface was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and the effects of temperature, pO(2) and pH(2)O on the area specific resistance (ASR) at open circuit were used to determine the rate limiting steps of the hydrogen kinetics of these anodes.",Hydrogen Oxidation Kinetics and Performance of Ni-LaNbO4 Cermet Anodes for Proton Conducting SOFCs,10.1149/2.002404jes
4,14588,"The total electrode response is 1.1 Omega cm(2) for 40/60 (vol) Ni/LCNO cermet support, at 800 degrees C in wet H-2, and the activation energy 0.5 eV. Three processes were suggested to contribute to the polarization resistance of Ni-LCNO cermet anodes, the most resistive believed to correspond to a charge transfer process at the interface between hydrogen atoms on or in Ni and protons in the electrolyte.",Hydrogen Oxidation Kinetics and Performance of Ni-LaNbO4 Cermet Anodes for Proton Conducting SOFCs,10.1149/2.002404jes
