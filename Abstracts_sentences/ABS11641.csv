7,11641,Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) experiment indicated that the plate-like crystallite particles (size 3-10 mm) were precipitated in a mother glass matrix heated at 800 degrees C and restructured into droplet-type morphology when nucleation was supported by Ti4+ ions.,Zr+4-controlled nucleation and microstructure in Si-Mg-Al-K-B-F glass-ceramic sealant (solid oxide fuel cell),10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100535
8,11641,The presence of Zr4+ ion results an interlocked type microstructure that is desirable for sealing application because of their capability to resist the growth of a microcrack caused due to thermal stress.,Zr+4-controlled nucleation and microstructure in Si-Mg-Al-K-B-F glass-ceramic sealant (solid oxide fuel cell),10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100535
