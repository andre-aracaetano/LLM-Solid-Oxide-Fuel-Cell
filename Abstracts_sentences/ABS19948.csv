4,19948,"Aiming to identify the influence of such an ordering on oxygen diffusion mechanism, we perform, in the present study, molecular dynamics simulations, through which we determine both macroscopic diffusion coefficients and also extract some information about atomic scale mechanisms for different structures.",Effect of A-site cation ordering on oxygen diffusion in NdBa2Fe3O8 through molecular dynamics,10.1016/j.jssc.2023.124148
5,19948,"Similarly to previous results on double cobaltites, we explore if the disordering of A-site cations favours or not oxygen diffusion in these ferrites.",Effect of A-site cation ordering on oxygen diffusion in NdBa2Fe3O8 through molecular dynamics,10.1016/j.jssc.2023.124148
6,19948,"We thus studied a fully disordered cubic perovskite structure, a quintuple perovskite structure with ordering on A-site, and a nano-ordered structure which present small domains of the quintuple perovskite phase.",Effect of A-site cation ordering on oxygen diffusion in NdBa2Fe3O8 through molecular dynamics,10.1016/j.jssc.2023.124148
7,19948,"We show that this nano-ordering, as observed experimentally, leads to a slight improvement of the oxygen ions diffusion process compared to the fully ordered structure, having still its oxygen diffusion coefficient much smaller than the one of the disordered structure.",Effect of A-site cation ordering on oxygen diffusion in NdBa2Fe3O8 through molecular dynamics,10.1016/j.jssc.2023.124148
