2,11173,X-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed that the molar ratio of OH-/NO3- = 1.5 in the precipitation stage is more appropriate for achieving MnCo2O4 phase.,Nanostructured MnCo2O4 synthesized via co-precipitation method for SOFC interconnect application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.216
3,11173,"The results of thermal analysis (TGA/DTA) along with the XRD results revealed that the MnCo2O4 phase remains stable up to 1050 degrees C. Morphological studies show that by increasing the calcination temperature from 350 to 550 and 1000 degrees C, morphology of the particles varies from plate-like to quasi spherical and polyhedral shape, respectively.",Nanostructured MnCo2O4 synthesized via co-precipitation method for SOFC interconnect application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.216
4,11173,"Density and porosity measurement of cold pressed and sintered samples showed that by employing un-calcined powder, a dense sample with 98% of the theoretical density could be obtained at the sintering temperature of 1000 degrees C. Selected synthesized powders were coated on the AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel coupons and the results demonstrated that using un-calcined powder, leads to the formation of a highly dense and adhesive coating layer due to the very high tendency of un-calcined powder for densification.",Nanostructured MnCo2O4 synthesized via co-precipitation method for SOFC interconnect application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.216
