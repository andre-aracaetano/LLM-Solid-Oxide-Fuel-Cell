1,9061,"The transient temperature distribution behavior of a planar, co-flow type anode supported solid oxide fuel cell is experimentally investigated under furnace temperatures of 670 degrees C, 720 degrees C, and 770 degrees C. An in-situ measurement is conducted by using a specially designed cell holder and a high-resolution infrared camera.",Measurement of transient temperature distribution behavior of a planar solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of instantaneous switching of power generation and direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229070
2,9061,The single and combined effects of electrochemical reactions and direct internal reforming (DIR) reactions are examined.,Measurement of transient temperature distribution behavior of a planar solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of instantaneous switching of power generation and direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229070
3,9061,The transient response of the cell temperature profile to a sudden change in the current density or reforming reaction rate is obtained.,Measurement of transient temperature distribution behavior of a planar solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of instantaneous switching of power generation and direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229070
4,9061,The results show the clear increase/decrease in the local temperature owing to the exothermic electrochemical reaction/endothermic reforming reaction.,Measurement of transient temperature distribution behavior of a planar solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of instantaneous switching of power generation and direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229070
5,9061,The analysis of the time constant shows that the response of the temperature distribution to a sudden change in the current density is faster than that to a change in the fuel gas composition.,Measurement of transient temperature distribution behavior of a planar solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of instantaneous switching of power generation and direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229070
6,9061,"The time constant is smaller in the upstream region, indicating that the new steady state is first achieved near the flow inlet and gradually propagates downstream.",Measurement of transient temperature distribution behavior of a planar solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of instantaneous switching of power generation and direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229070
7,9061,The maximum temperature gradient along the operating cell is found to be lower under the DIR condition than under the non-DIR condition regardless of the furnace temperature.,Measurement of transient temperature distribution behavior of a planar solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of instantaneous switching of power generation and direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229070
