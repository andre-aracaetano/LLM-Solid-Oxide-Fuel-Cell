2,4909,Two fuels were used to observe the effects that low hydrocarbons (over C1-hydrocarbons) in the reformate gas stream have on the SOFC anode.,Effects of low hydrocarbons on the solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1007/s10008-010-1078-9
3,4909,Methane or ethylene was supplied to the electrolyte-supported SOFC anode.,Effects of low hydrocarbons on the solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1007/s10008-010-1078-9
4,4909,"Using ethylene as a fuel, catastrophic degradation of SOFC performance was observed due to ethylene-induced carbon deposition onto the SOFC anode.",Effects of low hydrocarbons on the solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1007/s10008-010-1078-9
5,4909,"Thus, a new methodology, termed post-reforming, is introduced for the removal of low hydrocarbons (over C1-hydrocarbons) from the reformate gas stream.",Effects of low hydrocarbons on the solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1007/s10008-010-1078-9
6,4909,The CGO-Ru catalyst was selected as the post-reforming catalyst because of its high selectivity for removing low hydrocarbons (over C1-hydrocarbons) and for its long-term stability.,Effects of low hydrocarbons on the solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1007/s10008-010-1078-9
