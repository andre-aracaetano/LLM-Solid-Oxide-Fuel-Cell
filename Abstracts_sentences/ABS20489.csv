1,20489,The electrochemical properties of Pr2CuO4 (PCO) electrode screen-printed on Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) electrolyte were investigated.,Electrochemical characterization of Pr2CuO4 cathode for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.099
2,20489,"PCO was synthesized by a solid-state route from the stoichiometric mixture of oxides at 1273 K, 20 h. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PCO both in air and Ar demonstrated its stability up to 1173 K. X-ray powder diffraction study of the PCO-CGO mixture annealed in air at 1173 K for 100 h did not reveal chemical interaction between materials.",Electrochemical characterization of Pr2CuO4 cathode for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.099
3,20489,The oxygen reduction on porous PCO electrodes applied on CGO electrolyte was studied in a symmetrical cell configuration by AC impedance spectroscopy at OCV conditions at 773-1173 K and p(O2) =,Electrochemical characterization of Pr2CuO4 cathode for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.099

5,20489,Analysis of the data revealed that depending on temperature and oxygen partial pressure different rate-determining steps of the overall oxygen reduction reaction take place.,Electrochemical characterization of Pr2CuO4 cathode for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.099
6,20489,Calculated value of area specific resistance (ASR) of PCO electrode is 1.7 +/- 0.2 Omega cm(2) at 973 K in air and it is constant after 6 subsequent thermocycles.,Electrochemical characterization of Pr2CuO4 cathode for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.099
7,20489,We have found that oxygen reduction on PCO applied on CGO takes mainly place at the triple-phase boundary (TPB) since Adler-Lane-Steele (ALS) model is not valid.,Electrochemical characterization of Pr2CuO4 cathode for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.099
8,20489,Therefore electrochemical characteristics of PCO electrode can be improved by further optimization of both microstructure of the electrode and electrode/electrolyte interface and PCO can be considered as a promising cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC).,Electrochemical characterization of Pr2CuO4 cathode for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.099
