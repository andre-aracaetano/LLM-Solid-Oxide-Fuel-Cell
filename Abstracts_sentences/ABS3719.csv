1,3719,"The fuel cell arrangement air, La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3 parallel to Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.95)parallel to Ni/YSZ, fuel, incorporating either thick film (5-10 mu m) or self supported (similar to 300 mu m) Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolyte, was investigated at 650 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that a dense electrolyte layer in good contact with highly porous electrodes was achieved using either the thick him or self supported electrolyte.",Solid oxide fuel cells based on Ce(Gd)O-2-x electrolytes,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00294-9
2,3719,"Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics, using H-2/CO2/H2O fuel to simulate reformed methanol, showed that a higher terminal voltage was obtainable with the self supported electrolyte, but that the voltage dropped off quickly with increasing currents.",Solid oxide fuel cells based on Ce(Gd)O-2-x electrolytes,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00294-9
3,3719,Hence the thick film based arrangement was more suitable for the fuel cell and power outputs exceeding 100 mW/cm(2) were obtained.,Solid oxide fuel cells based on Ce(Gd)O-2-x electrolytes,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00294-9
