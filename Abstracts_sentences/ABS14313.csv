3,14313,"We confirm the deleterious impact of chromia on the performance of the model mixed conducting cathode material Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-delta by examining the oxygen exchange coefficient (k(chem)) via electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, and the area-specific resistance (ASR) by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",Reactivation of chromia poisoned oxygen exchange kinetics in mixed conducting solid oxide fuel cell electrodes by serial infiltration of lithia,10.1039/d1ee03975j
4,14313,Liquid Cr-infiltration decreases k(chem) 20-fold and the oxygen exchange component of ASR increases 20-fold while maintaining the same activation energy.,Reactivation of chromia poisoned oxygen exchange kinetics in mixed conducting solid oxide fuel cell electrodes by serial infiltration of lithia,10.1039/d1ee03975j
5,14313,"We then demonstrate the ability to not only recover initial k(chem) and ASR values, but improve properties above those exhibited by the pristine specimen through subsequent Li-infiltration, leading to enhancement of k(chem) by more than three orders of magnitude and reduction in oxygen exchange component of the ASR by over a factor 100.",Reactivation of chromia poisoned oxygen exchange kinetics in mixed conducting solid oxide fuel cell electrodes by serial infiltration of lithia,10.1039/d1ee03975j
6,14313,We attribute these dramatic changes to the depletion of electrons induced by the acidic Cr-infiltrant on the Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-delta surface and the recovery to accumulation of electrons from the basic Li-infiltrant.,Reactivation of chromia poisoned oxygen exchange kinetics in mixed conducting solid oxide fuel cell electrodes by serial infiltration of lithia,10.1039/d1ee03975j
7,14313,These results point to acidity as a key descriptor in addressing the long-standing challenge of reactive surface poisoning in applications reliant on rapid oxygen exchange and recovery behavior.,Reactivation of chromia poisoned oxygen exchange kinetics in mixed conducting solid oxide fuel cell electrodes by serial infiltration of lithia,10.1039/d1ee03975j
8,14313,The ability to achieve remarkable levels of recovery of electrocatalytic surfaces by controlling the relative acidity of surface species is demonstrated for the first time.,Reactivation of chromia poisoned oxygen exchange kinetics in mixed conducting solid oxide fuel cell electrodes by serial infiltration of lithia,10.1039/d1ee03975j
