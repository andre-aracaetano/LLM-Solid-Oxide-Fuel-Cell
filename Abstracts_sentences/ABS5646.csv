1,5646,"As an electrolyte, enough ionic conductivity, either proton (H+) or oxide (O2-) conduction, has demanded the better performance of low-temperature (especially below 550 degrees C) solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFCs).",Advanced fuel cell based on semiconductor perovskite La-BaZrYO3-δ as an electrolyte material operating at low temperature 550 °C,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.011
2,5646,"Notably, that either conductivity, higher performance, reliability, or higher cost is hampering the LT-SOFC marketing.",Advanced fuel cell based on semiconductor perovskite La-BaZrYO3-δ as an electrolyte material operating at low temperature 550 °C,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.011
3,5646,"In our current subject, we report the La-doped BZY proton conductor as an electrolyte has exhibited high ionic conductivity of 0.15 S/cm with a higher performance of 0.78 W/cm(2) at 550 degrees C. Also, the performance of LBZY is superior to the un-doped BZY electrolyte.",Advanced fuel cell based on semiconductor perovskite La-BaZrYO3-δ as an electrolyte material operating at low temperature 550 °C,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.011
