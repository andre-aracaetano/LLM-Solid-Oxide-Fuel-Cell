1,8508,Functionally graded electrodes have been fabricated from members of the (LaNiO3)(n)LaO Ruddlesden-Popper family.,Functionally graded composite La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.041
2,8508,"These consist of a thin compact layer of La2NiO4 (+) (delta) deposited on the electrolyte, topped by a thicker porous La2NiO4 (+) (delta) + La4Ni310 - delta composite layer, completed by a thin porous La4Ni3O10 - delta layer acting as a current collector.",Functionally graded composite La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.041
3,8508,The microstructure and electrochemical role of these layers are discussed in detail.,Functionally graded composite La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.041
4,8508,"It was found that using a 50:50 wt.% mix in the composite layer gave the best performance; ASRs at 500, 550, 600, 650, and 700 degrees C were 15.6, 5.53, 2.29, 1.06 and 0.53 Omega cm(2) respectively.",Functionally graded composite La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.041
5,8508,"This represents high performance for this class of material, particularly notable at the lower-end of the temperature range.",Functionally graded composite La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.041
6,8508,As such this grading process is an attractive proposition for further research towards lowering the operating temperature of SOFCs.,Functionally graded composite La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.041
