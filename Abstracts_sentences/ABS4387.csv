1,4387,Proton ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) as a new generation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has been an attractive and highly active research topic for directly converting chemical energy into electricity at intermediate to low temperatures.,High-performance and stable proton ceramic fuel cells prepared via a co-tape casting process,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.120
2,4387,"In this work, we co -tape cast anode support layer (ASL), anode functional layer (AFL) and electrolyte layer (EL) followed by co -sintering of the three layers at the same time.",High-performance and stable proton ceramic fuel cells prepared via a co-tape casting process,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.120
3,4387,"The peak power density (PPD) reaches to 1.06 W cm -2 at 650 degrees C and 0.6 W cm -2 at 600 degrees C under humidified H2 and static ambient air, which is comparable to previously reported high-performance die -pressed cells.",High-performance and stable proton ceramic fuel cells prepared via a co-tape casting process,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.120
4,4387,"After about 100 h' initial activation and stabilization process, the cell shows no sign of degradation (actually a slight increase in performance of 4 % kh-1) for remaining 500 h' continuous test which is among one of the best stability test results in PCFC particularly via tape casting process, making the co -tape casting a very promising and attractive process for large-scale PCFC fabrication.",High-performance and stable proton ceramic fuel cells prepared via a co-tape casting process,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.120
