2,3677,Operation of C-SOFC at 750 degrees C produced less CO and more CO2 than those predicted by thermodynamic calculation using total Gibbs free energy minimization method.,Analysis of gas products from direct utilization of carbon in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.020
3,3677,"The addition of CO2 to the anode chamber increased CO formation and maximum power density from 0.09W cm(-2) to 0.13W cm(-2), indicating the occurrence of Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C double left right arrow 2CO) coupling with CO electrochemical oxidation on the C-SOFC.",Analysis of gas products from direct utilization of carbon in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.020
4,3677,Analysis of CO and CO2 concentration as a function of current and voltage revealed that electricity was mainly produced from the electrochemical oxidation of carbon at low current density and produced from the electrochemical oxidation of CO at high current density.,Analysis of gas products from direct utilization of carbon in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.020
5,3677,The results suggest the electrochemical oxidation of solid carbon is more mass transfer limited than electrochemical oxidation of CO. (C) 2012,Analysis of gas products from direct utilization of carbon in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.020
