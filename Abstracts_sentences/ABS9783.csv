1,9783,Atom trapping of scarce precious metals onto a suitable support at high temperatures has emerged as an effective approach to build thermally stable single-atom catalysts.,Reversely trapping atoms from a perovskite surface for high-performance and durable fuel cell cathodes,10.1038/s41929-022-00764-9
2,9783,"Here, following a similar mechanism based on atom trapping through support effects, we demonstrate a reverse atom-trapping strategy to controllably extract strontium atoms from a rigid lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite ((La0.6Sr0.4)(0.)95Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta, LSCF) surface with ease.",Reversely trapping atoms from a perovskite surface for high-performance and durable fuel cell cathodes,10.1038/s41929-022-00764-9
3,9783,"The lattice oxygen redox activity of LSCF is accordingly fine-tuned, leading to enhanced cathode performance in a solid-oxide fuel cell.",Reversely trapping atoms from a perovskite surface for high-performance and durable fuel cell cathodes,10.1038/s41929-022-00764-9
4,9783,An over 30-70% increases in maximum power density of the single cells at intermediate temperatures is achieved by LSCF with surface strontium vacancies compared to the pristine surface.,Reversely trapping atoms from a perovskite surface for high-performance and durable fuel cell cathodes,10.1038/s41929-022-00764-9
5,9783,"In addition, the strontium-deficient surface excludes strontium segregation and formation of electrochemically inert SrO islands, thus improving the longevity of the cathode.",Reversely trapping atoms from a perovskite surface for high-performance and durable fuel cell cathodes,10.1038/s41929-022-00764-9
6,9783,"This development can be broadly applicable for modifying structurally stable oxide surfaces, and opens more possibilities of scalable single-atom extraction strategies.",Reversely trapping atoms from a perovskite surface for high-performance and durable fuel cell cathodes,10.1038/s41929-022-00764-9
