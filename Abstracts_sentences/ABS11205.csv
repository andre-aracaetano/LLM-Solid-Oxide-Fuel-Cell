4,11205,This promoted the phase transition to a cubic perovskite and led to substantial increase in the electrical conductivity and oxygen mobility of the electrode.,Development of high-performance cathodes for IT-SOFCs through beneficial interfacial reactions,10.1016/j.elecom.2009.09.034
5,11205,"By utilizing such phase reactions, the SrCoOx + SM0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite was developed into a high performance electrode with a low area specific resistance of 0.08 Omega cm(-2) at 650 degrees C. An anode-supported cell with such electrode delivered a peak power density of 795 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C.
