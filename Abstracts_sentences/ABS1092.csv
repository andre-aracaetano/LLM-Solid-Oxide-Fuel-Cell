1,1092,We report on the fabrication of thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) overlayers via atomic layer deposition (ALD) conformally coated on anodes of methane-fueled low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Atomic layer deposited YSZ overlayer on Ru for direct methane utilization in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.143
2,1092,Nano-granular ALD YSZ overlayers that are broken into porous films at elevated temperature improved not only the initial electrochemical performance (35% increase in the maximum power density) but also the thermal stability of the porous Ru anodes by suppressing coarsening.,Atomic layer deposited YSZ overlayer on Ru for direct methane utilization in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.143
