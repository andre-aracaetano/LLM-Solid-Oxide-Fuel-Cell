1,2162,Effect of the cathode/electrolyte interface modification by applying a porous BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) interlayer (PBI) on cathode performance in protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) is investigated to achieve a lower temperature operation with high power density.,Enhanced La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-based cathode performance by modification of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte surface in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.123
2,2162,"Here, in a PCFC with anode-supported configuration, a protonconducting oxide of BZCYYb is used as the material for both the interlayer and electrolyte, and demonstrates that this interlayer improves the cathode/electrolyte interfacial structure by increasing the electrochemically active triple-phase boundary (TPB).",Enhanced La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-based cathode performance by modification of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte surface in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.123
3,2162,This BZCYYb interlayer has a porous structure formed on the dense BZCYYb electrolyte.,Enhanced La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-based cathode performance by modification of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte surface in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.123
4,2162,"A cathode material that is a composite of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and BZCYYb fine particulates is impregnated into the submicrometer to single-micrometer pores within the PBI, yielding a threedimensionally extended TPB region.",Enhanced La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-based cathode performance by modification of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte surface in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.123
5,2162,"This structure effectively enhances the cathode performance, and the resulting maximum power density of an anode-supported PCFC with the PBI reaches 1.05, 0.81, 0.57, 0.38, and 0.24 W cm(-2) at 700, 650, 600, 550, and 550 degrees C, respectively.",Enhanced La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-based cathode performance by modification of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte surface in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.123
6,2162,"In conclusion, the modification of the cathode/ electrolyte structure by applying a PBI is a simple, yet very effective approach to improve PCFC performance even when the cathode is a conventional material such as LSCF.",Enhanced La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-based cathode performance by modification of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte surface in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.123
