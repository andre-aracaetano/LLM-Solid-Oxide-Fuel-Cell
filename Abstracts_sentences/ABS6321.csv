1,6321,"We have synthesised a range of niobium-based tetragonal tungsten bronze materials of the form (Ba, Sr, Ca, La)(0.6)MxNb1-xO3 (M=Ni, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cr, In, Sn) to include both known phases and new materials.","Synthesis and electrical characterisation of the tetragonal tungsten bronze type phases, (Ba/Sr/Ca/La)0 6MxNb1-xO3-δ (M = Mg, Ni, Mn, Cr, Fe, In, Sn):: evaluation as potential anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00127-7
2,6321,Electrical conductivity measurements over a wide range of oxygen partial pressures (p(O-2)= 10(-20) -1 atm.) have been performed at a temperature of 930 degrees C in order to evaluate their potential as anode materials in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells.,"Synthesis and electrical characterisation of the tetragonal tungsten bronze type phases, (Ba/Sr/Ca/La)0 6MxNb1-xO3-δ (M = Mg, Ni, Mn, Cr, Fe, In, Sn):: evaluation as potential anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00127-7
3,6321,"The compounds with M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sn appear not to be suitable for such a role, either because of poor oxygen exchange kinetics, possibly due to low oxide ion conductivity or because of partial decomposition on prolonged heat treatment (4 days) at 1000 degrees C in H-2-Ar (5%:95%) atmospheres.","Synthesis and electrical characterisation of the tetragonal tungsten bronze type phases, (Ba/Sr/Ca/La)0 6MxNb1-xO3-δ (M = Mg, Ni, Mn, Cr, Fe, In, Sn):: evaluation as potential anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00127-7
4,6321,"On the other hand, the compounds with M =Mg, In showed quite good conductivity characteristics and were stable under the prolonged reduction treatment.","Synthesis and electrical characterisation of the tetragonal tungsten bronze type phases, (Ba/Sr/Ca/La)0 6MxNb1-xO3-δ (M = Mg, Ni, Mn, Cr, Fe, In, Sn):: evaluation as potential anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00127-7
5,6321,"The observed conductivities were, however, slightly lower than those observed previously for the related system (Ba, Sr, Ca)(0.6)Ti0.2Nb0.8O3, and were found to decrease with increasing M content, x.
