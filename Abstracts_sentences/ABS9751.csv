1,9751,Electrode materials for intermediate temperature (500-700 degrees C) solid oxide fuel cells require electrical and mechanical stability to maintain performance during the cell lifetime.,Self-assembled dynamic perovskite composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/nenergy.2016.214
2,9751,"This has proven difficult to achieve for many candidate cathode materials and their derivatives with good transport and electrocatalytic properties because of reactivity towards cell components, and the fuels and oxidants.",Self-assembled dynamic perovskite composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/nenergy.2016.214
3,9751,"Here we present Ba0.5Sr0.5(Co0.7Fe0.3)(0.6875)W0.3125O3-delta(BSCFW), a self-assembled composite prepared through simple solid state synthesis, consisting of B-site cation ordered double perovskite and disordered single perovskite oxide phases, as a candidate cathode material.",Self-assembled dynamic perovskite composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/nenergy.2016.214
4,9751,"These phases interact by dynamic compositional change at the operating temperature, promoting both chemical stability through the increased amount of W in the catalytically active single perovskite provided from the W-reservoir double perovskite, and microstructural stability through reduced sintering of the supported catalytically active phase.",Self-assembled dynamic perovskite composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/nenergy.2016.214
5,9751,This interactive catalyst-support system enabled stable high electrochemical activity through the synergic integration of the distinct properties of the two phases.,Self-assembled dynamic perovskite composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/nenergy.2016.214
