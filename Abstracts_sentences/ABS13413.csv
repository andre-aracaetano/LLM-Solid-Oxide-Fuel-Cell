1,13413,Developing cost-effective methods to prepare dense ceramic interconnect membrane for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks is currently considered as a major technical obstacle.,"THREE-LAYER CO-FIRING FABRICATION OF LaCrO3-BASED CERAMIC INTERCONNECT, COMPOSITE ANODE SUPPORT AND YSZ ELECTROLYTE",10.3724/SP.J.1037.2012.00097
2,13413,"In order to improve the co-firing compatibility of LaCrO3-based interconnects with the traditional YSZ-based SOFC anode support NiO/YSZ, interconnect material of La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.97O3-delta (LCC) was introduced to NiO/YSZ anode.","THREE-LAYER CO-FIRING FABRICATION OF LaCrO3-BASED CERAMIC INTERCONNECT, COMPOSITE ANODE SUPPORT AND YSZ ELECTROLYTE",10.3724/SP.J.1037.2012.00097
3,13413,"Triple-phase composite NiO/YSZ/LCC was prepared, and then examined as novel anode support.","THREE-LAYER CO-FIRING FABRICATION OF LaCrO3-BASED CERAMIC INTERCONNECT, COMPOSITE ANODE SUPPORT AND YSZ ELECTROLYTE",10.3724/SP.J.1037.2012.00097
4,13413,"Sintering character, microstructure, electrical conductivity, and thermal expansion coefficient of the composite anode were investigated in detail as a function of LCC addition, respectively.","THREE-LAYER CO-FIRING FABRICATION OF LaCrO3-BASED CERAMIC INTERCONNECT, COMPOSITE ANODE SUPPORT AND YSZ ELECTROLYTE",10.3724/SP.J.1037.2012.00097
5,13413,Results indicated that the NiO/YSZ/LCC composite anode had excellent overall performance.,"THREE-LAYER CO-FIRING FABRICATION OF LaCrO3-BASED CERAMIC INTERCONNECT, COMPOSITE ANODE SUPPORT AND YSZ ELECTROLYTE",10.3724/SP.J.1037.2012.00097
6,13413,"Furthermore, by using a simple drop-coating process, LCC and YSZ wet membranes were prepared on the opposite surfaces of NiO/YSZ/LCC support, respectively.","THREE-LAYER CO-FIRING FABRICATION OF LaCrO3-BASED CERAMIC INTERCONNECT, COMPOSITE ANODE SUPPORT AND YSZ ELECTROLYTE",10.3724/SP.J.1037.2012.00097
7,13413,"Followed by three-layer co-firing at 1400 degrees C in air for 4 h, dense La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.97O3-delta interconnect and YSZ electrolyte thin membranes were both successfully prepared on the porous NiO/YSZ/LCC anode support.","THREE-LAYER CO-FIRING FABRICATION OF LaCrO3-BASED CERAMIC INTERCONNECT, COMPOSITE ANODE SUPPORT AND YSZ ELECTROLYTE",10.3724/SP.J.1037.2012.00097
