2,17081,The data has been analyzed by calculating the distribution function of relaxation times (DRTs).,Evaluation and modeling of the cell resistance in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2801372
3,17081,DRT computations enabled us to separate five different loss mechanisms occurring inside the cathode and anode without the need of an equivalent circuit.,Evaluation and modeling of the cell resistance in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2801372
4,17081,Two processes exhibit a systematic dependency on changes in the oxygen partial pressure of the cathode gas and thus can be attributed to diffusional and electrochemical losses on the cathode side.,Evaluation and modeling of the cell resistance in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2801372
5,17081,The remaining three processes are very sensitive to changes in the fuel gas but are not affected by variations of the cathode gas.,Evaluation and modeling of the cell resistance in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2801372
6,17081,"These resistances are classified as a gas diffusion polarization within the anode-substrate and as an electro-oxidation reaction at the triple-phase boundary, respectively.",Evaluation and modeling of the cell resistance in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2801372
