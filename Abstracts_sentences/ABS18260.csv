3,18260,This indicates that LaInO3 initially exhibits p-type behavior.,P-type electrical conduction of LaInO3 based ceramics and calculation of its density of states,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.216.65
4,18260,"In order to clarify the origin of the p-type conduction (hole generation), the effect of the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) on the electrical conductivity of pure and substituted LaInO3 was investigated, The conductivity of (La,Sr)InO3 was observed to increase in proportion to PO21/4, which is explained in terms of an oxygen defect model.",P-type electrical conduction of LaInO3 based ceramics and calculation of its density of states,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.216.65
5,18260,"The conductivity of La(In,Zn)O-3 was approximately proportional to PO21/2, whereas the conductivity of pure LaInO3 was not so dependent on PO2, The density of states for the (La7In8O36)(-27) cluster was calculated by the DVX alpha method, revealing that the In4d orbital leaks out near the Fermi energy level.",P-type electrical conduction of LaInO3 based ceramics and calculation of its density of states,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.216.65
