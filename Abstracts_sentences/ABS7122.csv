1,7122,"The present study was aimed at developing a new ethanol reforming process by integrating oxygen separation, partial oxidation and steam reforming in a membrane reactor.",Membrane-based catalytic partial oxidation of ethanol coupled with steam reforming for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.119032
2,7122,The reactor was constructed with the composite membrane of yttria-stabilized zirconia-La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-delta of effective area 5 cm(2) and Ni-Ru/Al2O3 catalyst of loading 5 wt%.,Membrane-based catalytic partial oxidation of ethanol coupled with steam reforming for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.119032
3,7122,"It attained ethanol conversion 99.9%, H-2 selectivity 90.8% and CO selectivity 74.6% with ethanol feed rate 30 mL min(-1) and steam 54 mL min(-1) at 800 degrees C. Running on the as-produced syngas fuel, a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) demonstrated a maximum power density of 999 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, which was just slightly lower than on pure hydrogen fuel.",Membrane-based catalytic partial oxidation of ethanol coupled with steam reforming for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.119032
4,7122,"Compared with the conventional fixed bed reactor, the membrane reactor explored in the present study showed clear advantages in terms of heat management and syngas concentration, promising for us as ethanol pre-reformer in SOFC.",Membrane-based catalytic partial oxidation of ethanol coupled with steam reforming for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2020.119032
