1,3494,A micro solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack with two series-wound single fuel cells was fabricated and operated successfully under single-chamber conditions.,Anode-supported micro-SOFC stacks operated under single-chamber conditions,10.1149/1.2724067
2,3494,"In this stack, the single cells were based on Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode-supported YSZ membrane and were arranged with an anode-facing-cathode configuration in diluted methane and oxygen mixture gas between 600 and 750 degrees C.",Anode-supported micro-SOFC stacks operated under single-chamber conditions,10.1149/1.2724067
3,3494,"The performances of the stack were affected by the flow rate, gas composition, and furnace temperature.",Anode-supported micro-SOFC stacks operated under single-chamber conditions,10.1149/1.2724067
4,3494,"The effects of the narrow path between two cells on the electrodes and cells were discussed in detail, according to the open-circuit voltages (OCVs) and impedance spectra of each cell.",Anode-supported micro-SOFC stacks operated under single-chamber conditions,10.1149/1.2724067
5,3494,"At 700 degrees C, the maximum OCV of the whole stack was larger than 2.0 V at CH4/O-2=1.75 and 2, while the maximum power output of stack was about 371 mW at CH4/O-2=1 with a mass specific power of 552 mW/g.",Anode-supported micro-SOFC stacks operated under single-chamber conditions,10.1149/1.2724067
6,3494,The performance indicates that such microstacks have potential for portable applications.,Anode-supported micro-SOFC stacks operated under single-chamber conditions,10.1149/1.2724067
