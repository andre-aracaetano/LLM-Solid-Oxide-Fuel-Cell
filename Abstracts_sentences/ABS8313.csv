1,8313,Component potential modeling based on solid-oxide electrochemistry is used to study a single-particle configuration where a hemispherical LSM particle sits on a YSZ electrolyte half-space.,TRIPLE PHASE BOUNDARIES IN SOLID-OXIDE CATHODES,10.1137/080722667
2,8313,The primary comparison is between two pathways: one where oxide ions travel on the particle surface; the other where these ions travel through the bulk particle interior.,TRIPLE PHASE BOUNDARIES IN SOLID-OXIDE CATHODES,10.1137/080722667
3,8313,"The systems that model each of the pathways are analyzed both mathematically and numerically, yielding insights into diffusion-reaction-conduction processes for this single-particle model.",TRIPLE PHASE BOUNDARIES IN SOLID-OXIDE CATHODES,10.1137/080722667
4,8313,"A broad range of parameter values are considered, particularly in regards to the least well-established value, the surface conductance for the surface pathway.",TRIPLE PHASE BOUNDARIES IN SOLID-OXIDE CATHODES,10.1137/080722667
5,8313,This work includes a number of case studies that indicate which pathway dominates for a variety of parameter choices.,TRIPLE PHASE BOUNDARIES IN SOLID-OXIDE CATHODES,10.1137/080722667
