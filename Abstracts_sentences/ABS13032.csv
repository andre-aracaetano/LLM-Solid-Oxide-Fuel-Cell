1,13032,"In order to improve the catalytic activity of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3 (SLT)-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) composite anodes, Pd was impregnated as a co-catalyst using a glycine mediated impregnation method.",Effect of Pd-impregnation on the electrochemical performance of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
2,13032,"When glycine was added into the Pd precursor solution, nanosized Pd particles with the average particle size being approximately 20 nm were homogeneously distributed onto the SLT-GDC backbone.",Effect of Pd-impregnation on the electrochemical performance of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
3,13032,"The polarization resistance (R-p) was significantly reduced by the impregnation of Pd due to the enlargement of the triple phase boundary (TPB) length, which promotes ionic exchange reactions at the anode/electrolyte interface, as well as the dissociation of H-2 molecules.",Effect of Pd-impregnation on the electrochemical performance of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
4,13032,The maximum power density of the single cell also increased significantly as the amount of Pd increased.,Effect of Pd-impregnation on the electrochemical performance of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
5,13032,"Moreover, the single cell with a Pd-impregnated SLT-GDC15 anode showed a comparable performance using both CH4 and H-2 fuel, which indicates that the Pd-impregnated SLT-GDC composite anode can be used for hydrocarbon-fueled SOFC as well.",Effect of Pd-impregnation on the electrochemical performance of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
