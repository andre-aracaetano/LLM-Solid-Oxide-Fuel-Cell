1,7451,"The microstructure of Ag thin films can be controlled by dispersing La(0.9)Sr(0.1)Ga(0.8)Mg(0.2)O(2.9) (LSGM) nanoparticles, and the Ag-LSGM-composite thin film serves as an excellent low operating temperature solid oxide fuel cells cathode.",Influence of Dispersed Ceramic Nanoparticles on Microstructure and Performance of the Ag Thin-Film Cathode in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3458868
2,7451,"Here, the microstructure of Ag thin films can also be controlled by dispersing ZrO(2) nanoparticles.",Influence of Dispersed Ceramic Nanoparticles on Microstructure and Performance of the Ag Thin-Film Cathode in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3458868
3,7451,"By comparing the Ag-ZrO(2) composite thin-film cathode (ZrO(2) nanoparticle-dispersed Ag) with the Ag-LSGM-composite thin-film cathode (LSGM nanoparticle-dispersed Ag), the electrochemical performance of the Ag thin-film cathode is directly related to the grain boundary density in the thin film.",Influence of Dispersed Ceramic Nanoparticles on Microstructure and Performance of the Ag Thin-Film Cathode in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3458868
