3,645,"The hybrid system consists of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), a gas processing unit (GP) and a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).","Methanol to power through high-efficiency hybrid fuel cell system: Thermodynamic, thermo-economic, and techno-economic (3T) analyses in Northwest China",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113899
4,645,"Thermodynamic analysis of the system shows that the energy conversion efficiency and exergy efficiency are both higher than the previously reported standalone or hybrid energy systems using methanol as fuel, which are 66.2% and 54.2% respectively.","Methanol to power through high-efficiency hybrid fuel cell system: Thermodynamic, thermo-economic, and techno-economic (3T) analyses in Northwest China",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113899
5,645,"Besides, no recirculation ratio of anode off-gas and moderate fuel utilization of about 0.5 are suggested for the SOFC component to balance the power distribution and improve the efficiency.","Methanol to power through high-efficiency hybrid fuel cell system: Thermodynamic, thermo-economic, and techno-economic (3T) analyses in Northwest China",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113899
6,645,"Afterwards, this hybrid fuel cell system is also investigated from thermo-economic and techno-economic perspectives.","Methanol to power through high-efficiency hybrid fuel cell system: Thermodynamic, thermo-economic, and techno-economic (3T) analyses in Northwest China",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113899
7,645,"Take Northwest China as a case, the 1 MWe methanol-fed power plant has a specific electric energy cost of 0.5594 CNY/kWh, much lower than the methanol steam reforming-PEMFC power plant (2.4 CNY/kWh).","Methanol to power through high-efficiency hybrid fuel cell system: Thermodynamic, thermo-economic, and techno-economic (3T) analyses in Northwest China",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113899
8,645,"At the same time, the sensitivity analyses reveal that the cost of the hybrid power system is not sensitive to the market price fluctuation.","Methanol to power through high-efficiency hybrid fuel cell system: Thermodynamic, thermo-economic, and techno-economic (3T) analyses in Northwest China",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113899
9,645,"With financial subsidies for existing renewable power plants, the payback period can be shortened to 1.4 year and the annual return on investment is about 3.58%.","Methanol to power through high-efficiency hybrid fuel cell system: Thermodynamic, thermo-economic, and techno-economic (3T) analyses in Northwest China",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113899
