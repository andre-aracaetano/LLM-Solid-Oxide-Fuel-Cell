3,9331,"The average thermal expansion coefficient of (La1-xSrx)(2)CoO4 +/-delta is relatively low and slightly increases with x, which can be ascribed to the sway of Sr doping on the spin-state transition of Co ions.","Structural, transport, thermal, and electrochemical properties of (La1-xSrx)2CoO4±δ cathode in solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10800-020-01514-0
4,9331,"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis show that Co ions exist in mixed oxidation states, but the lattice oxygen content considerably varies with x. Regarding transport property, (La1-xSrx)(2)CoO4 +/-delta behaves like a semiconductor in the temperature range of 200-800 degrees C, and the electrical conductivity significantly increases with x. As one of the most important results, electrochemical performance of (La1-xSrx)(2)CoO4 +/-delta cathode is affected by x in a complex manner, and x = 0.4 cathode, i.e., La1.2Sr0.8CoO4 +/-delta, has the most favored area-specific resistance of 0.062 omega cm(2) and the highest power density of 630 mW cm(-2) in an electrolyte-supported single cell at 800 degrees C, showing a rapid kinetics toward oxygen reduction reaction.","Structural, transport, thermal, and electrochemical properties of (La1-xSrx)2CoO4±δ cathode in solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10800-020-01514-0
