2,5202,"When manganese is present in zirconia solid solutions, they start to exhibit electronic conductivity due to the formation of some electronic defects related with the variable valence of manganese and, in consequence, activation losses that accompany the transfer of charge between electrolyte and cathode may be reduced.",Electrical conductivity of MnOx-Y2O3-ZrO2 solid solutions,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.11.018
3,5202,Powders from Mn-x(Y0.148Zr0.852)(1-x)O2-delta (with x ranging from 0 to 0.25) materials were prepared by means of the co-precipitation-calcination method and then sintered for 2 h at 1500 degrees C.,Electrical conductivity of MnOx-Y2O3-ZrO2 solid solutions,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.11.018
4,5202,"The compositional dependence of the lattice parameters complied with Vegard's rule up to about 18 mol% of manganese, which confirmed that cubic zirconia s.s. had been formed.",Electrical conductivity of MnOx-Y2O3-ZrO2 solid solutions,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.11.018
