1,5974,"A cobalt-free perovskite oxide, Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (BSZF), was investigated as a novel cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite oxide as a novel cathode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01930.x
2,5974,"Room-temperature nonstoichiometry of BSZF was as high as 0.412, which was favorable for oxygen-reduction reaction.",Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite oxide as a novel cathode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01930.x
3,5974,"At 700 degrees C, the polarization resistances were as low as 0.22 and 0.13 Omega.cm(2), respectively, for pure and impregnated BSZF cathodes under open-circuit conditions, suggesting that oxygen-deficient BSZF was a promising cathode candidate for IT-SOFCs.",Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskite oxide as a novel cathode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01930.x
