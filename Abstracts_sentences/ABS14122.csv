1,14122,"In an attempt to achieve desirable cell performance, the effects of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM)-based cathodes on the anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were investigated in the present study.",Development of LSM-based cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells based on YSZ films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.035
2,14122,"Three types of cathodes were fabricated on the anode-supported yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin films to constitute several single cells, i.e., pure LSM cathode, LSM/YSZ composite by solid mixing, LSNVSM0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) composite by the ion-impregnation process.",Development of LSM-based cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells based on YSZ films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.035
3,14122,"Among the three single cells, the highest cell output performance 1.25 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, was achieved by the cell using LSM/SDC cathode when the cathode was exposed to the stationary air.",Development of LSM-based cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells based on YSZ films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.035
4,14122,"Whereas, the most considerable cell performance of 2.32 W cm(-2) was derived from the cell with LSM/YSZ cathode, using 100 ml min(-1) oxygen flow as the oxidant.",Development of LSM-based cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells based on YSZ films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.035
5,14122,"At reduced temperatures down to 700 degrees C, the LSM/SDC cathode was the most suitable cathode for zirconia-based electrolyte SOFC in the present study.",Development of LSM-based cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells based on YSZ films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.035
6,14122,The variation in the cell performances was attributed to the mutual effects between the gas diffusing rate and three-phase boundary length of the cathode.,Development of LSM-based cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells based on YSZ films,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.035
