1,3488,A comprehensive model for detailed description of micro-scale transport and electro-chemical reaction in intermediate temperature SOFCs (solid oxide fuel cells) was developed by combining many relevant theoretical and experimental researches.,A comprehensive micro-scale model for transport and reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.09.041
2,3488,Dependence of electro-chemical performance of PEN (positive electrode/electrolyte/negative electrode) on micro-structural parameters of electrodes was investigated through numerical simulation.,A comprehensive micro-scale model for transport and reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.09.041
3,3488,Spatial distribution of transfer current density confirmed that TPBs (three phase boundaries) at electrode/electrolyte interface were most active for electro-chemical reaction and its contribution to overall reaction increased at higher current densities.,A comprehensive micro-scale model for transport and reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.09.041
4,3488,Spatial gradient of total pressure in cathode was found to facilitate oxygen transport while that in anode hinder hydrogen transport.,A comprehensive micro-scale model for transport and reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.09.041
5,3488,"Among various micro-structural parameters for electrodes, particle diameter was found to be the most important one that governs the PEN performance; smaller particle diameter decreased activation overpotential with larger TPB length, while increasing mass transport resistance and concentration overpotential with smaller pore diameter.",A comprehensive micro-scale model for transport and reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.09.041
6,3488,"The proposed micro-model was found successful in micro-structural characterization of PEN performance, and thus believed to serve as a bridge connecting micro-scale models and macro-scale calculations.",A comprehensive micro-scale model for transport and reaction in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.09.041
