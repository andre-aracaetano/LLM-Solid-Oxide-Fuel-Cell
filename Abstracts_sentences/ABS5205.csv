1,5205,"Lattice parameters, microstructures, thermal expansion coefficients and electrical conductivities of Ga-doped La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-y were investigated in order to characterize influences of interdiffusion of Ga from La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3-y electrolyte into La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-y cathode in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell.","Influences of Ga doping on lattice parameter, microstructure, thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-y",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.02.030
2,5205,Unknown phases were formed when the amount of Ga doped was beyond 20% of B-site cation in the perovskite structure.,"Influences of Ga doping on lattice parameter, microstructure, thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-y",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.02.030
3,5205,"In the single-phase region, the lattice parameters and thermal expansion coefficients were increased with the Ga doping.","Influences of Ga doping on lattice parameter, microstructure, thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-y",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.02.030
4,5205,The thermal expansion coefficient increases were much higher than those of La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3-y electrolyte.,"Influences of Ga doping on lattice parameter, microstructure, thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-y",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.02.030
5,5205,"The electrical conductivities decreased with an increase in the doped amount of Ga, and the electrical conduction changed from metallic to semiconductor-like with the Ga doping.","Influences of Ga doping on lattice parameter, microstructure, thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-y",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.02.030
6,5205,Those results clearly indicate that the interdiffusion of Ga into La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-y cathode has unfavorable influences on the physicochemical properties of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-y in the intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell.,"Influences of Ga doping on lattice parameter, microstructure, thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-y",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.02.030
