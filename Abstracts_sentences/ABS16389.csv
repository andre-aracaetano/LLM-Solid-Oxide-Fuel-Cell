3,16389,"The results show that LSM, LSCM and La2NiO4 cathodes are chemically and mechanically stable with the LBO electrolyte, and BSCF reacts with LBO after heat-treatment of their mechanical ground mixtures at T = 1150 degrees C. Symmetrical cell tests based on LBO demonstrated that the values of the cathode ASR (area specific resistance) are much lower in the case of the LSM and La2NiO4 cathodes than in the case of the LSCM cathode (in humidified air at 700 degrees C: ASR(LSM) =",Compatibility of La26O27(BO3)8 electrolyte with standard cathode materials for use in proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.04.041
