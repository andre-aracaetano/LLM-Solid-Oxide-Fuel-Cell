5,14185,"Depending on the temperature and residence time, two different ranges of carbon deposit reactivities were obtained, corresponding to disordered and ordered carbon states, respectively.",Pyrolytic carbon deposition on porous cathode tubes and its use as an interlayer for solid oxide fuel cell zirconia electrolyte fabrication,10.1149/1.1366620
6,14185,"Temperature-programmed oxidation, scanning electron microscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy analyses indicate that the creation of uniform and sufficiently thick films with the highest degree of atomic ordering occurs at temperatures between 725 and 775 degrees C and a gas residence of about 14 s. Notably, the same carbon deposition conditions produced crack-free and gastight YSZ films (15-20 mm) during the fabrication of SOFCs by EPD and subsequent sintering.",Pyrolytic carbon deposition on porous cathode tubes and its use as an interlayer for solid oxide fuel cell zirconia electrolyte fabrication,10.1149/1.1366620
