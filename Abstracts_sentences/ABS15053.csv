1,15053,A sealant-free solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) micro-stack was successfully operated inside a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) flame during cooking.,A direct flame solid oxide fuel cell for potential combined heat and power generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.02.161
2,15053,"This micro-stack consisted of 4 single cells with infiltrated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) based composite anodes, achieving an open circuit voltage of 0.92 V and a peak power density of 348 mW cm(-2).",A direct flame solid oxide fuel cell for potential combined heat and power generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.02.161
3,15053,This performance is significantly better than that of stack with its cathode operation outside flame.,A direct flame solid oxide fuel cell for potential combined heat and power generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.02.161
4,15053,"The results confirmed that the perovskite oxide anode showed good properties of carbon-free, redox-stability, quick-start (less than 1 min) and successful operation under a wide range of oxygen partial pressure.",A direct flame solid oxide fuel cell for potential combined heat and power generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.02.161
5,15053,"For comparison, the conventional Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) anode was prepared and tested under the same conditions, showing an open circuit voltage of 0.915 V and a peak power density of 366 mW cm(-2), but obvious carbon deposition, poor stability and slow/difficult-start.",A direct flame solid oxide fuel cell for potential combined heat and power generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.02.161
6,15053,The direct flame SOFC (DFFC) with a new configuration and design has a potential for combined heat and power generation for many applications.,A direct flame solid oxide fuel cell for potential combined heat and power generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.02.161
