1,6758,"Double perovskite PrBaCo2O5+delta (PBC) has received much attention as cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) due to its excellent catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), especially at intermediate temperature up to 800 degrees C.",Thermal cycling durability improved by doping fluorine to PrBaCo2O5+δ as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.065
2,6758,"However, its high thermal expansion coefficient (C-TE), about twice as the electrolytes, usually results in poor durability.",Thermal cycling durability improved by doping fluorine to PrBaCo2O5+δ as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.065
3,6758,This work presents the effect of C-TE reduction by doping fluorine ion to the oxygen-site of PrBaCo2O5+delta.,Thermal cycling durability improved by doping fluorine to PrBaCo2O5+δ as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.065
4,6758,"The fluorine doping, which is confirmed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations, can substantially reduce C-TE, from 24.03 x 10(-6) K-1 down to 16.78 x 10(-6) K-1 as determined with dilatometry while from 26.52 x 10(-6) K-1 to 17.46 x 10(-6) K-1 with high-temperature XRD.",Thermal cycling durability improved by doping fluorine to PrBaCo2O5+δ as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.065
5,6758,"Consequently, the durability is improved by a factor of similar to 3.0 when the electrodes are subjected to 200-800 degrees C thermal cycles.",Thermal cycling durability improved by doping fluorine to PrBaCo2O5+δ as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.065
