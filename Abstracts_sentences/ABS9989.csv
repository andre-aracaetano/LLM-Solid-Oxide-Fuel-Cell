1,9989,The compatibility of SrTi1-xCoxO3 perovskites (0 <= x <= 0.2) was evaluated for use as interconnect materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Evaluation of SrTi1-xCoxO3 Perovskites (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) as Interconnect Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003761
2,9989,"Although SrTi1-xCoxO3 perovskites have a single perovskite phase in the range of 0 <= x <= 0.2, it was observed for SrTi0.8Co0.2O3 that Co element agglomerated at the grain boundary during sintering.",Evaluation of SrTi1-xCoxO3 Perovskites (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) as Interconnect Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003761
3,9989,"The dense SrTi0.8Co0.2O3 sample was destroyed and included Sr2TiO4 as a secondary phase after reducing treatment at 1000 degrees C. As a result of Co doping, the linear thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) increased remarkably with increasing Co content, but the TEC of SrTi0.9Co0.1O3 was comparable with those of SOFC cathodes and anodes.",Evaluation of SrTi1-xCoxO3 Perovskites (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) as Interconnect Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003761
4,9989,"Co doping of SrTiO3 effectively increased electrical conductivity in air, whereas the conductivity of Co-doped SrTiO3 in a reducing atmosphere was much lower than that in air.",Evaluation of SrTi1-xCoxO3 Perovskites (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) as Interconnect Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003761
5,9989,"This suggests that the Co ions(3+/4+) in the perovskites were earlier reduced into Co2+ ions, compared to Ti4+ ions.",Evaluation of SrTi1-xCoxO3 Perovskites (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) as Interconnect Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003761
