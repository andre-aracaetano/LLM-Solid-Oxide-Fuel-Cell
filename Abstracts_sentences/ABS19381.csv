2,19381,"Herein, we rationally introduce pentavalent tantalum on the B-site of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta(LSF) to prepare novel perovskites La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.95Ta0.05O3-delta(LSFTa05) and La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.9Ta0.1O3-delta(LSFTa10), and evaluate their electrochemical performance as SOFC anodes.",Tailoring tantalum doping into a perovskite ferrite to obtain a highly active and stable anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta04857g
3,19381,The structural stability of LSF is notably improved but the oxygen vacancy content is decreased after Ta doping.,Tailoring tantalum doping into a perovskite ferrite to obtain a highly active and stable anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta04857g
4,19381,LSFTa05 is the most promising anode among the three candidates due to its best performance after 50 h of operation (441.7 mW cm(-2)at 800 degrees C in wet H-2) and considerable coking and sulfur resistance.,Tailoring tantalum doping into a perovskite ferrite to obtain a highly active and stable anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta04857g
