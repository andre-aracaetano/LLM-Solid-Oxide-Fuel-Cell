4,14603,"According to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cathodic polarization analysis, the LBCO-30Ag exhibited the best performance and the optimal BBP frit content was 2.5 wt.%.",Performance of LaBaCo2O5+δ-Ag with B2O3-Bi2O3-PbO frit composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.104
5,14603,"For LBCO-30Ag with 2.5 wt.% BBP frit, the area-specific resistance based on Sm(0.2)Ce(0.8)O(1.9) (SDC) electrolyte decreased by about 57.6% at 700 degrees C, 60.5% at 750 degrees C and 75.9% at 800 degrees C compared to LBCO, and its cathodic overpotential was 10.7 mV at a current density of 0.2 A cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, while the corresponding value for LBCO was 51.0 mV. The addition of Ag and BBP frit to LBCO had no significant effect on the thermal expansion.",Performance of LaBaCo2O5+δ-Ag with B2O3-Bi2O3-PbO frit composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.104
