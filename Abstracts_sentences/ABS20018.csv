3,20018,"La2-xSrxNiO4+delta (x = 0, 0.1) accommodates oxygen excess by oxygen interstitials rather than by the more usual cation vacancies, A high concentration of oxygen interstitials offers the possibility of rapid oxygen transport through the ceramic material and thus provide a new type of mixed ionic-electronic conductor.",La2-xSrxNiO4+δ ceramic powders prepared by combustion synthesis,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.206-213.155
4,20018,The fast oxide ion diffusion combined with its thermal stability indicate that these materials would be good candidates for use in Ceramic Oxygen Generators (COGs) and Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFCs).,La2-xSrxNiO4+δ ceramic powders prepared by combustion synthesis,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.206-213.155

9,20018,"showed much higher specific surface area than powders obtained via alternative routes and contained La2-xSrxNiO4+delta, as the major phase present, together with La2O3 and a small amount of NiO. La2-xSrxNiO4+delta single phase is achieved, respectively at 950 degreesC for x = 0.1 and at 975 degreesC for x = 0.",La2-xSrxNiO4+δ ceramic powders prepared by combustion synthesis,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.206-213.155
