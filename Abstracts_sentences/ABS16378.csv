1,16378,"To systematically investigate the influence of electrolyte substrates on Sr-segregation and SrSO4 formation in (LaSr)(CoFe)O-3 (LSCF) cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells, model thin films were grown on Gd-doped ceria (GDC) and on Y-doped BaZrO3 (BZY) electrolytes by pulsed laser deposition and heat treated at 800-1000 degrees C in synthetic air with a trace amount of SO2.",Influence of electrolyte substrates on the Sr-segregation and SrSO4 formation in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin films,10.1557/mrc.2018.208
2,16378,"A severe SrSO4 formation was observed in LSCF on GDC as compared with the BZY, especially at low temperature.",Influence of electrolyte substrates on the Sr-segregation and SrSO4 formation in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin films,10.1557/mrc.2018.208
3,16378,The difference in Sr-segregation and SrSO4 formation on the LSCF was discussed in relation to Sr diffusion and related elemental redistribution across the interfaces.,Influence of electrolyte substrates on the Sr-segregation and SrSO4 formation in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin films,10.1557/mrc.2018.208
