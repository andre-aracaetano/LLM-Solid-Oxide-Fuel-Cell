1,6260,"We describe methodologies for comprehensive and reduced-order modeling of solid-oxide-fuel-cell (SOFC) power-conditioning system (PCS) at the subsystem/component and system levels to resolve the interactions among SOFC, balance-of-plant subsystem, and power-electronics subsystem (PES) and application loads (ALs).",Solid-oxide-fuel-cell performance and durability: Resolution of the effects of power-conditioning systems and application loads,10.1109/TPEL.2004.833992
2,6260,"Using these models, we analyze the impacts of electrical-feedback effects (e.g., ripple-current dynamics and load transients) on the performance and reliability of the SOFC.",Solid-oxide-fuel-cell performance and durability: Resolution of the effects of power-conditioning systems and application loads,10.1109/TPEL.2004.833992
3,6260,"Subsequently, we investigate the effects of harmonies in the current, drawn from the SOFC by a PES, on the temperature and fuel utilization of the SOFC.",Solid-oxide-fuel-cell performance and durability: Resolution of the effects of power-conditioning systems and application loads,10.1109/TPEL.2004.833992
4,6260,"We explore the impacts of inverter space-vector modulation strategies on the transient response, flow parameters, and current density of the SOFC during load transients and demonstrate how these two traditionally known superior modulation/control methodologies may in fact have a negative effect on the performance and durability of the SOFC unless carefully implemented.",Solid-oxide-fuel-cell performance and durability: Resolution of the effects of power-conditioning systems and application loads,10.1109/TPEL.2004.833992
5,6260,"Further, we resolve the impacts of the current drawn by the PES from the SOFC, on its microcrack density and electrode/electrolyte degradation.",Solid-oxide-fuel-cell performance and durability: Resolution of the effects of power-conditioning systems and application loads,10.1109/TPEL.2004.833992
6,6260,"The comprehensive analytical models and interaction-analysis methodologies and the results provided in this paper lead to an improved understanding, and may yield realizations of cost-effective, reliable, and optimal PESs, in particular, and SOFC PCSs, in general.",Solid-oxide-fuel-cell performance and durability: Resolution of the effects of power-conditioning systems and application loads,10.1109/TPEL.2004.833992
