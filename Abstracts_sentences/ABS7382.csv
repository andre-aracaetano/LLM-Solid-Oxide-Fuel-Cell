1,7382,The behavior of silver as the solid oxide fuel cell SOFC cathode material was investigated.,Changes in the morphology and the composition of the Ag|Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 interface caused by polarization,10.1016/j.electacta.2013.01.117
2,7382,Ag vertical bar Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 half cells were cathodically polarized at the temperatures between 300 and 700 degrees C at the potential of -0.5 V. Changes in the morphology and electronic states of the electrolyte surface on the cathodic side were examined by the Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy.,Changes in the morphology and the composition of the Ag|Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 interface caused by polarization,10.1016/j.electacta.2013.01.117
