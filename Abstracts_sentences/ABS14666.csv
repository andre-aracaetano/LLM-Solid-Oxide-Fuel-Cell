1,14666,"In this work, two new perovskites of composition BaFe0.875Re0.125O3-delta and BaFe0.75Ta0.25O3-delta, designed from ab-initio calculations to fulfill different requisites of cathode materials for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC), were prepared and studied from the structural point of view from neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data.",BaFe0.875Re0.125O3-δ and BaFe0.75Ta0.25O3-δ as potential cathodes for solid-oxide fuel-cells: a structural study from neutron diffraction data,10.1515/zkri-2022-0027
2,14666,"They are both derivatives of BaFeO3 hexagonal perovskite (space group P6( 3 )/mmc), typified as the 6H polytype, stabilized when the perovskite tolerance factor slightly overpasses the unity.",BaFe0.875Re0.125O3-δ and BaFe0.75Ta0.25O3-δ as potential cathodes for solid-oxide fuel-cells: a structural study from neutron diffraction data,10.1515/zkri-2022-0027
3,14666,"Whereas BaFe0.875Re0.125O3-delta keeps this structural type, as demonstrated in this crystallographic study from NPD data at 295 and 4 K, with unit-cell parameters a = 5.70177(7); c = 14.0334(2) angstrom at 295 K, the second material, BaFe0.75Ta0.25O3-delta, is cubic and can be defined in the Pm-3m space group, corresponding of the perovskite arystotype, with a = 4.05876(3) angstrom.",BaFe0.875Re0.125O3-δ and BaFe0.75Ta0.25O3-δ as potential cathodes for solid-oxide fuel-cells: a structural study from neutron diffraction data,10.1515/zkri-2022-0027
