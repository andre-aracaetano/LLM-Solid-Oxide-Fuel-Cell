1,2124,Single solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a porous (36-41%) supporting Ni-cermet anode are manufactured and tested.,Single solid-oxide fuel cells with supporting ni-cermet anode,10.1134/S102319351112007X
2,2124,The effect of the thickness of the supporting Ni-cermet anode on the electrochemical characteristics of single SOFCs is studied.,Single solid-oxide fuel cells with supporting ni-cermet anode,10.1134/S102319351112007X
3,2124,It is shown that polarization losses on electrodes at the current density of 1.2 A/cm(2) increase by about 2 times from 0.13 to 0.25 V at an increase in the thickness of the supporting Ni-cermet anode from 0.40 to 1.27 mm.,Single solid-oxide fuel cells with supporting ni-cermet anode,10.1134/S102319351112007X
4,2124,The impedance spectroscopy method is used to identify relaxation processes responsible for the behavior of the fuel cell anode and cathode.,Single solid-oxide fuel cells with supporting ni-cermet anode,10.1134/S102319351112007X
5,2124,It is found that a significant percentage of polarization losses on the anode is due to transport limitations in fuel supply to the three-phase nickel/electrolyte/gas phase interface and removal of the reaction products away from it.,Single solid-oxide fuel cells with supporting ni-cermet anode,10.1134/S102319351112007X
