1,14157,In this investigation porous Ni/YSZ composite SOFC anode structures were produced by adding separate Ni and graphite (pore former) particles and/or by adding Ni coated graphite powder to a tape casting suspension.,Influence of porous composite microstructure on the processing and properties of solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.009
2,14157,The porous volume increased with an increase in graphite content in a similar manner regardless of low the graphite was added (i.e. separately or as the core of a coated powder).,Influence of porous composite microstructure on the processing and properties of solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.009
3,14157,The sintering shrinkage of the anodes decreased with an increase in the Ni content.,Influence of porous composite microstructure on the processing and properties of solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.009
4,14157,Both sintering behaviour and the CTE of sintered and reduced anodes were similar regardless of how the Ni was added.,Influence of porous composite microstructure on the processing and properties of solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.009
5,14157,However for a given Ni content the electrical conductivity was dramatically improved when Ni was added as a coating on a graphite powder.,Influence of porous composite microstructure on the processing and properties of solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.009
