1,15878,"The dimensional changes of doped lanthanum chromites (LaCrO3) upon reduction were investigated by thermal expansion measurements in oxidizing and reducing atmospheres; Judging from the crack formation in these experiments, an empirical guideline for materials selection of LaCrO3-based interconnectors in solid oxide fuel cells has been identified that materials showing relative linear expansions of less than 0.1% are to be used.",Lattice expansion of acceptor-doped lanthanum chromites under high-temperature reducing atmospheres,10.5796/electrochemistry.68.526
2,15878,It was also found that the lattice expansion increased with decrease of oxygen partial pressure (P (O-2)) and showed a trend to saturate at very low P (O-2).,Lattice expansion of acceptor-doped lanthanum chromites under high-temperature reducing atmospheres,10.5796/electrochemistry.68.526
3,15878,This trend has successfully been elucidated by a simple model derived by using Vegard's law.,Lattice expansion of acceptor-doped lanthanum chromites under high-temperature reducing atmospheres,10.5796/electrochemistry.68.526
