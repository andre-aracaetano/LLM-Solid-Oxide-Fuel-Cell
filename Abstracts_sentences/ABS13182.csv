3,13182,Ceria and acceptor-doped lanthanum chromite are given as typical examples for which relevant materials data have been published.,Chemically-induced stresses in ceramic oxygen ion-conducting membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00331-8
4,13182,"Analysis of the experimental data shows that although the lattice expansion on reduction, that gives rise to the stress, depends mainly on the deviation from stoichiometry in their oxide, the crystal structure and the dopant also have a significant influence.",Chemically-induced stresses in ceramic oxygen ion-conducting membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00331-8
5,13182,The induced stresses are predicted to be lowest for planar membranes that are free to bend in order to relax the stresses.,Chemically-induced stresses in ceramic oxygen ion-conducting membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00331-8
