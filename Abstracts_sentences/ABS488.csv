1,488,The paper presents the original results of thermal imaging of the anodic surface of a full-size solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) during operation.,In situ infrared thermography of full-scale solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227221
2,488,"In this work, a commercially available fuel cell with a circular shape and a diameter of 100 mm was used.",In situ infrared thermography of full-scale solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227221
3,488,It is new to determine the emissivity of the anode surface of the tested cell.,In situ infrared thermography of full-scale solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227221
4,488,The emissivity of the anodic surface of the fuel cell was determined to be from 0.95 to 0.48 in the temperature range 300-800 degrees C and the profile and temperature distribution of the anodic surface of the unloaded cell was given.,In situ infrared thermography of full-scale solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227221
5,488,The surface temperature of the cell was determined during operation and the polarity changes from OCV (open circuit voltage) to 0.0 V. It was found that the cell self-heating effect decreases with increasing temperature of the cell.,In situ infrared thermography of full-scale solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227221
