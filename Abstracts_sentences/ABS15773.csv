1,15773,"Oxide anodes composed of 60 wt% Gd0.1Ce0.8Ni0.1O2 (GDCN)- 40 wt% (Sr0.9La0.1)oiriasNi(0.1)O(3) (SLTN)composites were prepared and tested on (ZrO2)(0.89)(Sc2O3)(0.1)(CeO2)(0.01) (SSZ) electrolyte -supported SOFCcells utilizing a (La0.75Sr0.25)(0.98)MnO3 (ISM)-SSZ cathode, in 3%-humidified hydrogen fuel at 800 degrees C. Improved electrochemical performance was found compared to the cell using Ni-free 60 wt% Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 (GDC) - 40 wt % Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 (SLT) that was attributed to the exsolution of nano-sized Niparticles from the Ni-doped system.",Redox cycling induced Ni exsolution in Gd0.1Ce0.8Ni0.1O2 (Sr0.9La0.1)0.9Ti0.9Ni0.1O3composite solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.009
