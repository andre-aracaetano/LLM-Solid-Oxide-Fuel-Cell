1,11703,"In this work, we have developed solid oxide fuel cells with a bi-layered electrolyte of 2 mu m SSZ and 4 mu m SDC using tape casting, screen printing, and co-firing processes.",Solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte structure,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.021
2,11703,"The cell reached power densities of 0.54 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C and 0.85 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, with open circuit voltage (OCV) values larger than 1.02 V.",Solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte structure,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.021
3,11703,The electrical leaking between anode and cathode through an SDC electrolyte has been blocked in the bi-layered electrolyte structure.,Solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte structure,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.021
4,11703,"However, both the electrolyte resistance (R-el) and electrode polarization resistance (R-p,R-a+c) increased in comparison to cells with single-layered SDC electrolytes.",Solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte structure,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.021
5,11703,"The formation of a solid solution of (Ce, Zr)O2-x during sintering process and the flaws in the bi-layered electrolyte structure seem to be the main causes for the increase in the R-el value (0.32 Omega cm(2)) at 650 degrees C, which is almost one order of magnitude higher than the calculated value.",Solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte structure,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.021
