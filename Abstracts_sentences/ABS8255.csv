1,8255,The optimum composition ratio of the anode cermet (Ni-GDC) for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) varies because the electron-collecting mechanism is different depending on its applications.,A Self-Crystallized Nanofibrous Ni-GDC Anode by Magnetron Sputtering for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c22795
2,8255,A Co-sputtering method facilitates ratio control with sputtering power adjustment.,A Self-Crystallized Nanofibrous Ni-GDC Anode by Magnetron Sputtering for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c22795
3,8255,"However, there is a practical issue with fabricating anode cermet with various ratios attributed to the large sputtering yield gap of the metal target, Ni, and the ceramic target, gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC).",A Self-Crystallized Nanofibrous Ni-GDC Anode by Magnetron Sputtering for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c22795
4,8255,"Therefore, in this study, a Gd-Ce metal alloy was applied instead of GDC to match the sputtering rate with that of Ni, which enables a wide ratio range achievement.",A Self-Crystallized Nanofibrous Ni-GDC Anode by Magnetron Sputtering for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c22795

6,8255,"X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed its crystallinity, and the film deposited with various power ratios was sputtered on the ScSZ electrolyte pellet to clarify the optimum NiGDC ratio for thin-film SOFCs.",A Self-Crystallized Nanofibrous Ni-GDC Anode by Magnetron Sputtering for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c22795
7,8255,"Last, the Ni-GDC was applied to anodized aluminum oxide (AAO)-supported SOFCs to maximize the performance.",A Self-Crystallized Nanofibrous Ni-GDC Anode by Magnetron Sputtering for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c22795
