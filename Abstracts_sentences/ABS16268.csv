1,16268,The design of complex inorganic materials is a challenge because of the diversity of their potential structures.,Computationally Assisted Identification of Functional Inorganic Materials,10.1126/science.1226558
2,16268,We present a method for the computational identification of materials containing multiple atom types in multiple geometries by ranking candidate structures assembled from extended modules containing chemically realistic atomic environments.,Computationally Assisted Identification of Functional Inorganic Materials,10.1126/science.1226558
3,16268,"Many existing functional materials can be described in this way, and their properties are often determined by the chemistry and electronic structure of their constituent modules.",Computationally Assisted Identification of Functional Inorganic Materials,10.1126/science.1226558
4,16268,"To demonstrate the approach, we isolated the oxide Y2.24Ba2.28Ca3.48Fe7.44Cu0.56O21, with a largest unit cell dimension of over 60 angstroms and 148 atoms in the unit cell, by using a combination of this method and experimental work and show that it has the properties necessary to function as a solid oxide fuel-cell cathode.",Computationally Assisted Identification of Functional Inorganic Materials,10.1126/science.1226558
