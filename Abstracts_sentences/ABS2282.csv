2,2282,For these devices it would be convenient to directly use a liquid fuel such as methanol and ethanol rather than hydrogen.,"Thermodynamic analysis of solid oxide fuel cells operated with methanol and ethanol under direct utilization, steam reforming, dry reforming or partial oxidation conditions",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.043
3,2282,"The direct utilization of alcohol fuels in SOFC involves several processes, including the deposition of carbon, which can lead to irreversible deactivation of the fuel cell.","Thermodynamic analysis of solid oxide fuel cells operated with methanol and ethanol under direct utilization, steam reforming, dry reforming or partial oxidation conditions",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.043
4,2282,"Several publications have addressed the thermodynamic analysis of the reforming of methanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH) in SOFC, but none have considered the direct utilization of these fuels.","Thermodynamic analysis of solid oxide fuel cells operated with methanol and ethanol under direct utilization, steam reforming, dry reforming or partial oxidation conditions",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.043
