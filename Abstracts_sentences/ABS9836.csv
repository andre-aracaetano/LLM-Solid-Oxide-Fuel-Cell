2,9836,"(GDC vertical bar ESB) and Sm0.075Nd0.075Ce0.85O2-delta vertical bar ESB (SNDC vertical bar ESB) assembled with ESB-La0.74Bi0.1Sr0.16MnO3-delta (ESB-LBSM) cathode are evaluated based on anode supported single cells, in order to compare and investigate the influence of different ceria-based materials GDC and SNDC with different ionic conductivity on the performance of the ceria-bismuth bilayer electrolyte films for high performance low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (HPLT-SOFCs).",Different ceria-based materials Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ and Sm0.075Nd0.075Ce0.8O2-δ for ceria-bismuth bilayer electrolyte high performance low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.077
3,9836,"The single cell with GDC vertical bar ESB bilayer film outputs the maximum power density (MPD) of 895 mW cm(-2) with interfacial polarization resistance (Rp) of 0.079 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C. When SNDC is used, which has a much higher ionic conductivity with respect to GDC, the cell with SNDC vertical bar ESB bilayer film achieves the MPD of 930 mW cm(-2) and the Rp of 0.035 Omega cm(2) at the same conditions which shows better electrochemical performance.",Different ceria-based materials Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ and Sm0.075Nd0.075Ce0.8O2-δ for ceria-bismuth bilayer electrolyte high performance low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.077
4,9836,"Furthermore, the SNDC vertical bar ESB bilayer film cell shows higher power output in the entire operation temperature range compared with GDC vertical bar ESB-based cell and has the MPD of 271 mW cm(-2) at 500 degrees C which demonstrate the superiority of SNDC vertical bar ESB bilayer structure cell in LT-SOFC operations.",Different ceria-based materials Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ and Sm0.075Nd0.075Ce0.8O2-δ for ceria-bismuth bilayer electrolyte high performance low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.077
