1,14875,"La1-x Sr (x) VO3 (where x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1) exhibits a transition from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a paramagnetic metallic conductor and has been synthesized as a potential anode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Effect of Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Vanadate on Crystal Structure, Conductivity and Vanadium Valence State of a La1-x Sr x VO3 Anode in a Reducing Environment",10.1007/s11664-016-5268-9
2,14875,La1-x Sr (x) VO3 was synthesized by a solid-state reaction process followed by heat treatment under a reducing atmosphere (Ar:80/H-2:20).,"Effect of Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Vanadate on Crystal Structure, Conductivity and Vanadium Valence State of a La1-x Sr x VO3 Anode in a Reducing Environment",10.1007/s11664-016-5268-9
3,14875,X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that LaVO3 was substituted with various amounts of Sr2+ in the cation sublattice.,"Effect of Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Vanadate on Crystal Structure, Conductivity and Vanadium Valence State of a La1-x Sr x VO3 Anode in a Reducing Environment",10.1007/s11664-016-5268-9
4,14875,Pure LaVO3 shows an orthorhombic structure.,"Effect of Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Vanadate on Crystal Structure, Conductivity and Vanadium Valence State of a La1-x Sr x VO3 Anode in a Reducing Environment",10.1007/s11664-016-5268-9
5,14875,"After Sr2+ substitution, a more symmetrical cubic perovskite structure was obtained because the tolerance factor is close to 1.","Effect of Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Vanadate on Crystal Structure, Conductivity and Vanadium Valence State of a La1-x Sr x VO3 Anode in a Reducing Environment",10.1007/s11664-016-5268-9
6,14875,The valence state of the vanadium ions of the La1-x Sr (x) VO3 was further verified by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).,"Effect of Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Vanadate on Crystal Structure, Conductivity and Vanadium Valence State of a La1-x Sr x VO3 Anode in a Reducing Environment",10.1007/s11664-016-5268-9
7,14875,"According to the XPS results, when the lanthanum ion was substituted by a strontium ion, the negatively charged defect, Sr-La', was compensated for by changing the valence of vanadium from a trivalent to a tetravalent or pentavalent state.","Effect of Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Vanadate on Crystal Structure, Conductivity and Vanadium Valence State of a La1-x Sr x VO3 Anode in a Reducing Environment",10.1007/s11664-016-5268-9
8,14875,The dependence of conduction behavior of La1-x Sr (x) VO3 on the amount of Sr addition is discussed in terms of the hopping process with super/double exchange interaction and a charge transfer mechanism.,"Effect of Strontium-Doped Lanthanum Vanadate on Crystal Structure, Conductivity and Vanadium Valence State of a La1-x Sr x VO3 Anode in a Reducing Environment",10.1007/s11664-016-5268-9
