9,9184,"The cell area specific resistance (ASR) obtained by linear fitting I-V plot in the region of 0.6-0.7 V was higher than the ohmic resistance tested at OCV condition, and it was potentially attributed to the increased oxygen partial pressure at the anode as well as the contribution from polarization resistance, i.e. polarization of mass transport.",Effects of GDC interlayer on performance of low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.09.019
