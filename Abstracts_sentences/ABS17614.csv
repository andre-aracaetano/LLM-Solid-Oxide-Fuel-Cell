1,17614,"A general procedure based on the oxalate coprecipitation route was developed to produce very sinterable ceria (CeO2) powder doped with Gd2O3, Sm2O3 or Y2O3.","Low temperature fabrication of (Y,Gd,Sm)-doped ceria electrolyte",10.1016/0167-2738(96)00297-4
2,17614,"The method is simple, reliable and very reproducible.","Low temperature fabrication of (Y,Gd,Sm)-doped ceria electrolyte",10.1016/0167-2738(96)00297-4
3,17614,"Without any milling step, powder of 20 mol% GdO1.5, SmO1.5 or YO1.5-CeO2 could be fired translucent dense (97% relative to theoretical) at 1300 degrees C (4 h) already, as pressed compacts.","Low temperature fabrication of (Y,Gd,Sm)-doped ceria electrolyte",10.1016/0167-2738(96)00297-4
4,17614,This compares to typical values of 95% relative density obtained after firing at 1500-1600 degrees C in the standard literature.,"Low temperature fabrication of (Y,Gd,Sm)-doped ceria electrolyte",10.1016/0167-2738(96)00297-4
5,17614,"Cast tapes from the intensively milled powders were fired equally dense at 1400 degrees C (2 h), among the best results yet reported for tape cast doped ceria.","Low temperature fabrication of (Y,Gd,Sm)-doped ceria electrolyte",10.1016/0167-2738(96)00297-4
6,17614,"Owing to their high density, excellent ionic conductivity values were observed for the doped ceria electrolytes, on the order of 5-7 S m(-1) at 750 degrees C in air.","Low temperature fabrication of (Y,Gd,Sm)-doped ceria electrolyte",10.1016/0167-2738(96)00297-4
