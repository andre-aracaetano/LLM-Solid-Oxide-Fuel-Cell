2,10248,"In Japan, a compact SOFC system with rated alternative current (AC) power of 700 W has become available on the market, since the base load electricity demand for a standard home is said to be less than 700 W AC.",Studies on Effective Utilization of SOFC Exhaust Heat Using Thermoelectric Power Generation Technology,10.1007/s11664-012-2412-z
3,10248,"To improve the generating efficiency of SOFC systems in the 700-W class, we focused on thermoelectric generation (TEG) technology, since there are a lot of temperature gradients in the system.",Studies on Effective Utilization of SOFC Exhaust Heat Using Thermoelectric Power Generation Technology,10.1007/s11664-012-2412-z
4,10248,"Analysis based on simulations indicated the possibility of introducing thermoelectric generation at the air preheater, steam generator, and exhaust outlet.",Studies on Effective Utilization of SOFC Exhaust Heat Using Thermoelectric Power Generation Technology,10.1007/s11664-012-2412-z
5,10248,"Among these options, incorporating a TEG heat exchanger comprising multiple CoSb3/SiGe-based TEG modules into the air preheater had potential to produce additional output of 37.5 W and an improvement in generating efficiency from 46% to 48.5%.",Studies on Effective Utilization of SOFC Exhaust Heat Using Thermoelectric Power Generation Technology,10.1007/s11664-012-2412-z
6,10248,"Furthermore, by introducing thermoelectric generation at the other two locations, an increase in maximum output of more than 50 W and generating efficiency of 50% can be anticipated.",Studies on Effective Utilization of SOFC Exhaust Heat Using Thermoelectric Power Generation Technology,10.1007/s11664-012-2412-z
