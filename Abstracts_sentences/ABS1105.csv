2,1105,"This STO/CeO2 membrane demonstrated a high ionic conductivity of 0.24 S cm(-1) under fuel cell conditions at 550 degrees C, and also its fuel cell delivered a maximum power output of 745.6 mW cm(-2) at the same temperature.",Semiconductor Heterostructure SrTiO3/CeO2 Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0082005JES
3,1105,"Moreover, the high electronic conductivity of CeO2 is blocked by the STO/CeO2 semiconductor heterojunction, thus resulting in the open circuit voltage increasing from 0.90 to 1.09 V at 550 degrees C.",Semiconductor Heterostructure SrTiO3/CeO2 Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0082005JES
4,1105,The semiconductor heterointerface is found to play an important role in inhibiting the electron transfer between CeO2 particles.,Semiconductor Heterostructure SrTiO3/CeO2 Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0082005JES
5,1105,"Thus, this work makes it feasibility of using semiconductor materials as the electrolyte by constructing heterojunctions to suppress the electronic conductivity.",Semiconductor Heterostructure SrTiO3/CeO2 Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0082005JES
