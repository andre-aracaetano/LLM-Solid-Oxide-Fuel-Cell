1,5577,Designing highly active and thermally stable electrodes is crucial for realizing low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) with excellent performance.,Nanometer Yttria-doped Ceria Shell by Atomic Layer Deposition over Porous Pt for Improved Oxygen Reduction Reactions,10.1007/s40684-023-00506-7
2,5577,"In this study, we fabricated an yttria-doped ceria (YDC) shell layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD) over a Pt cathode by controlling the doping concentration of yttria in YDC film.",Nanometer Yttria-doped Ceria Shell by Atomic Layer Deposition over Porous Pt for Improved Oxygen Reduction Reactions,10.1007/s40684-023-00506-7
3,5577,"The exchange current density was enhanced by a factor of five when the ALD YDC shell layer was deposited onto the cathode surface compared to the bare Pt cathode, resulting in an 80% decrease in the activation resistance of the 19 mol%-doped ALD YDC-overcoated Pt cathode compared to that of the bare Pt cathode.",Nanometer Yttria-doped Ceria Shell by Atomic Layer Deposition over Porous Pt for Improved Oxygen Reduction Reactions,10.1007/s40684-023-00506-7
4,5577,"Furthermore, the thermal stability was enhanced in low-to-medium-doped (7-19 mol%) ALD YDC-coated Pt cathodes, whereas the highly doped (31 mol%) cathode showed a relatively marginal improvement in stability.",Nanometer Yttria-doped Ceria Shell by Atomic Layer Deposition over Porous Pt for Improved Oxygen Reduction Reactions,10.1007/s40684-023-00506-7
