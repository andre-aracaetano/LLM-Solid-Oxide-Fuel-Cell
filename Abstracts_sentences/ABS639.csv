1,639,The possibility of developing large solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks based upon 25cm2 ceramic oxide anode-supported cells is investigated.,Scale Up and Anode Development for La-Doped SrTiO3 Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1111/jace.12325
2,639,Planar fuel cells comprising strontium titanate-based anode support impregnated with active catalysts were prepared using a combination of deposition techniques.,Scale Up and Anode Development for La-Doped SrTiO3 Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1111/jace.12325
3,639,The fuel cell tests performed in a semisealed rig have shown power densities of 185mWcm-2 at 850 degrees C using humidified hydrogen as fuel and air as oxidant.,Scale Up and Anode Development for La-Doped SrTiO3 Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1111/jace.12325
4,639,"The structure and evolution of the catalytically active impregnated materials-10mol% Gd-doped CeO2 and nickel- are analysed using electron microscopy at the end of the fuel cell test, revealing that a ceria and nickel layer surrounds the titanate backbone grains while similar to 50-150nm spherical-like nickel particles uniformly decorate this top layer.",Scale Up and Anode Development for La-Doped SrTiO3 Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1111/jace.12325
