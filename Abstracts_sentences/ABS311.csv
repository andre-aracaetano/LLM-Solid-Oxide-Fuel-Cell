1,311,"With respect to solid oxide fuel cell power density it has been verified that 1-2m thick 8YSZ electrolytes have significant advantages, offering the potential to operate stacks at temperatures of 600 degrees C. However, reliability of the component depends on integrity and hence residual stress state.",Residual Stress Assessment for Thin 8YSZ Electrolytes Using Focused Ion Beam Milling and Digital Image Correlation,10.1002/fuce.201300154
2,311,"In this work, an advanced method is used to determine the electrolyte residual stress locally using stress relaxation tests by a combination of focused ion beam milling and digital image correlation.",Residual Stress Assessment for Thin 8YSZ Electrolytes Using Focused Ion Beam Milling and Digital Image Correlation,10.1002/fuce.201300154
