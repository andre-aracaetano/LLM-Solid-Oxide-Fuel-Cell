1,19853,The ionic configurational structure of the zirconia component in cermet anodes was investigated mainly by laser Raman spectroscopy.,Rapid phase transformation of zirconia in the Ni-ScSZ cermet anode under reducing condition,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.024
2,19853,"Two zirconia-based oxides, 10 mol% SC2O3 and 1 mol% CeO2 stabilized ZrO2 (10Sc1 CeSZ) and 8 mol% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (8ySZ), were used as oxide component in cermet anodes.",Rapid phase transformation of zirconia in the Ni-ScSZ cermet anode under reducing condition,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.024
3,19853,"Powders mixture with nickel oxide were applied on a dense 10Sc1CeSZ electrolyte disk, fired at 1673 K and then treated at 1173 K for 2 h in wet hydrogen to reduce the nickel oxide.",Rapid phase transformation of zirconia in the Ni-ScSZ cermet anode under reducing condition,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.024
4,19853,"In contradiction with XRD results, which indicate that all zirconia-based oxides were present in the cubic phase after treatment, Raman spectroscopy results indicate interesting differences: (1) 8YSZ in the cermets presented cubic symmetry, (2) 10Sc1 CeSZ in the fired mixture on the electrolyte presented both cubic and rhombohedral beta phase, (3) 10Sc1CeSZ in the reduced cermet anode was identified as tetragonal, and (4) the electrolyte presented the cubic phase before and after the reduction process.",Rapid phase transformation of zirconia in the Ni-ScSZ cermet anode under reducing condition,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.024
5,19853,It is clear that the 10Sc1CeSZ component in contact with nickel oxide undergoes rapid transformation from cubic or rhombohedral to tetragonal symmetry accompanying the reduction of nickel oxide to nickel metal.,Rapid phase transformation of zirconia in the Ni-ScSZ cermet anode under reducing condition,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.024
