2,11347,"Here, by adopting an A- and B-site co-doping strategy, we report a new perovskite-type oxide, Nd0.2Sr0.8Nb0.1Co0.9O3-delta (N0.2SNC), as an active and CO2-tolerant cathode material for IT-SOFCs.",A new highly active and CO2-stable perovskite-type cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells developed from A- and B-site cation synergy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227995
3,11347,"Compared with single-site doped Nd0.2Sr0.8Nb0.1CoO3-delta (N0.2SC, A-site doping) and SrNb0.1Co0.9O3-delta (SNC, B-site doping) and the parent oxide SrCoO3-delta (SC), N0.2SNC shows improved electrocatalytic activity for the ORR and superior resistance towards CO2 poisoning, achieving a low area specific resistance (ASR) of 0.037 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C.",A new highly active and CO2-stable perovskite-type cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells developed from A- and B-site cation synergy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227995
4,11347,"In addition, the ASR value of the N0.2SNC electrode only increases from 0.08 to 0.20 Omega cm(2) after operating for 300 min under an air atmosphere with 5% CO2.",A new highly active and CO2-stable perovskite-type cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells developed from A- and B-site cation synergy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227995
5,11347,"A- and B-site cation synergy is obtained through co-doping, leading to the improved performance.",A new highly active and CO2-stable perovskite-type cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells developed from A- and B-site cation synergy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227995
6,11347,A peak power density of 1563 mW cm(-2) is achieved at 650 degrees C.
