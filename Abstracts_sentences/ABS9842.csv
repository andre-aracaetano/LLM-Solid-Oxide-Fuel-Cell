1,9842,The anode material BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is prepared by solid state reaction method and its chemical compatibility with Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) is evaluated.,Enhanced electrochemical performance of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrodes for hydrogen and methane oxidation in solid oxide fuel cells by Pd or Cu0.5Pd0.5 impregnation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.082
2,9842,"The electrochemical performance of the pure and Pd- and Cu0.5Pd0.5-impreganated BZCYYb electrodes is characterized in the temperature range between 650 and 750 degrees C by AC impedance spectroscopy in H-2 and/or CH4 atmospheres, respectively, under the condition of open circuit.",Enhanced electrochemical performance of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrodes for hydrogen and methane oxidation in solid oxide fuel cells by Pd or Cu0.5Pd0.5 impregnation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.082
3,9842,It is confirmed that the BZCYYb is chemically compatible with the YSZ at temperatures below 1000 degrees C.,Enhanced electrochemical performance of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrodes for hydrogen and methane oxidation in solid oxide fuel cells by Pd or Cu0.5Pd0.5 impregnation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.082
4,9842,The polarization resistance of the BZCYYb anode in H-2 is decreased from 2.08 to 0.51 Omega cm(2) as the measuring temperature increases from 650 to 750 degrees C with an activation energy of 117 kJ mol(-1).,Enhanced electrochemical performance of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrodes for hydrogen and methane oxidation in solid oxide fuel cells by Pd or Cu0.5Pd0.5 impregnation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.082
5,9842,"With Pd- or Cu0.5Pd0.5-impregnation, the polarization resistance of the BZCYYb electrode in H-2 is reduced significantly to approximately 0.40 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C and 0.12 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C. With dry CH4 as the fuel, the polarization resistance of the Pd- and Cu0.5Pd0.5-impregnated BZCYYb anodes is obviously increased below 1.00 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C and 0.22 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C. Both Pd and Cu0.5Pd0.5 impregnations are equivalently effective in enhancing the electrochemical performance of the BZCYYb anode.",Enhanced electrochemical performance of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrodes for hydrogen and methane oxidation in solid oxide fuel cells by Pd or Cu0.5Pd0.5 impregnation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.082
