It was shown that the rate of electrode reaction at 700-degrees-C can be approximately expressed by I = kP(H-2)a(o)-k'P(H2O)1/2a(o)-1/2 (k, k': rate constant), where a(O) is the oxygen activity at the TPB which is related to the electrode potential E versus 1.01 3 X 10(5)Pa O-2(g) by RT ln a(O) = 2EF.",KINETIC-STUDIES OF THE REACTION AT THE NICKEL PATTERN ELECTRODE ON YSZ IN H2-H2O ATMOSPHERES,10.1016/0167-2738(94)90286-0
8,20810,"The rate of anodic reaction was found to be essentially determined by the reaction of H-2 (g) and the adsorbed oxygen on the nickel surface, while the rate of cathodic reaction seems to be determined by the first order reaction or surface diffusion process of adsorbed hydrogen, H(ad) which may take place after the reaction of H2O(g) --> H2O(ad) --> H(ad) + OH(ad).",KINETIC-STUDIES OF THE REACTION AT THE NICKEL PATTERN ELECTRODE ON YSZ IN H2-H2O ATMOSPHERES,10.1016/0167-2738(94)90286-0
