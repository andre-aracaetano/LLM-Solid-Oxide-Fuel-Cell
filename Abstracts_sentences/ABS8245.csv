1,8245,SOFCs with yttrium and lanthanum doped strontium titanate as anode materials were fabricated.,Performances of planar solid oxide fuel cells with doped strontium titanate as anode materials,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.005
2,8245,A comparison is made of the performances of SOFCs with different types of electrolyte and anode.,Performances of planar solid oxide fuel cells with doped strontium titanate as anode materials,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.005
3,8245,It was indicated that the SOFC with Y0.08Sr0.92TiO3 as anode showed better performance when using YSZ as electrolyte than the one using LSGM as electrolyte because of the high interfacial resistance between LSGM and Y0.08Sr0.92TiO3.,Performances of planar solid oxide fuel cells with doped strontium titanate as anode materials,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.005
4,8245,"Even Y0.08Sr0.92TiO3 shows a lower electrical conductivity, the SOFC with Y0.08BSr0.92TiO3 exhibited better performance than the one with La0.2Sr0.8TiO3 due to the high catalytic properties of Y0.08Sr0.92TiO3 towards oxidation of hydrogen.",Performances of planar solid oxide fuel cells with doped strontium titanate as anode materials,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.005
5,8245,The addition of electrolyte materials into the SrTiO3 based anode has the possibility to improve cell performance.,Performances of planar solid oxide fuel cells with doped strontium titanate as anode materials,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.005
6,8245,"A single cell with Y0.08Sr0.92TiO3 + 10 wt% YSZ as anode and YSZ as electrolyte exhibited a maximum power density of 12.4 and 21.5 mW/cm(2) at 800 and 900 degrees C, respectively.",Performances of planar solid oxide fuel cells with doped strontium titanate as anode materials,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.005
