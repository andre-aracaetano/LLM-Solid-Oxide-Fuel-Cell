1,20262,"The chemical reactivity between Pr4Ni3O10 +/-delta (3-PNO) electrodes and Y0.08Zr0.92O1.96 (YSZ), Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC), and La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 (LSGM) electrolytes was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.",Chemical compatibility of solid oxide fuel cell air electrode Pr4Ni3O10±δ with commercial electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.202300176
2,20262,"3-PNO powders were synthesized by two different chemical routes, one of them uses hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as a complexing agent (route A) while the other citrates (route B).",Chemical compatibility of solid oxide fuel cell air electrode Pr4Ni3O10±δ with commercial electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.202300176
3,20262,The samples observed by scanning electron microscopy presented different microstructures; route A powders present small submicronic grains with an open microstructure while route B powders are formed by larger well-connected grains.,Chemical compatibility of solid oxide fuel cell air electrode Pr4Ni3O10±δ with commercial electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.202300176
4,20262,The polarization resistance (R-P) values for 3-PNO/YSZ cells are one order of magnitude higher than those of 3-PNO/GDC and 3-PNO/LSGM cells.,Chemical compatibility of solid oxide fuel cell air electrode Pr4Ni3O10±δ with commercial electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.202300176
5,20262,The R-P for both cells 3-PNO/GDC and 3-PNO/LSGM and its evolution in time suggest that chemical reactivity takes place during the adhesion treatment and electrochemical measurements.,Chemical compatibility of solid oxide fuel cell air electrode Pr4Ni3O10±δ with commercial electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.202300176
6,20262,The microstructure plays a crucial role in R-P and the degradation rate; 3-PNO obtained by route A (3-PNO-HMTA) exhibits the best electrochemical performance since these powders present a well-loose morphology and a large exposed area.,Chemical compatibility of solid oxide fuel cell air electrode Pr4Ni3O10±δ with commercial electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.202300176
7,20262,"However, this fact makes them active chemically, so the increase of R-P with time is slower for 3-PNO electrodes prepared by route B (3-PNO-Cit), since the rate of chemical reactivity with the electrolyte is slower.",Chemical compatibility of solid oxide fuel cell air electrode Pr4Ni3O10±δ with commercial electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.202300176
