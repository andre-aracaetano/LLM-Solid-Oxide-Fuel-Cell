1,4662,"Doped lanthanum gallate (La1-xSrx)(Ga1-y-zMgyCOz)O3-(x+y+z)/2 (LSGMCO) perovskite oxide films were deposited on a quartz glass, LaAlO3 single-crystal substrate and porous anode electrode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) by pulsed laser deposition.",As-deposited (La1-xSrx)(Ga1-y-zMgyCoz)O3-(x+y+z)/2 crystallized thin films prepared by pulsed laser deposition for application to solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte,10.1143/JJAP.43.299
2,4662,It was necessary to increase the substrate temperature up to 800degreesC for a crystallization of the LSGMCO films.,As-deposited (La1-xSrx)(Ga1-y-zMgyCoz)O3-(x+y+z)/2 crystallized thin films prepared by pulsed laser deposition for application to solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte,10.1143/JJAP.43.299
3,4662,The film deposited on the LaAlO3 single-crystal substrate grew along the c-axis.,As-deposited (La1-xSrx)(Ga1-y-zMgyCoz)O3-(x+y+z)/2 crystallized thin films prepared by pulsed laser deposition for application to solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte,10.1143/JJAP.43.299
4,4662,The as-deposited LSGMCO thick film fabricated on the porous substrate at 800degreesC and at an oxygen pressure of 20Pa was formed from polycrystal columns and showed a high conductivity of 0.7S/cm at a measurement temperature of 800degreesC. The activation energies were 0.72 eV at 600-800degreesC and 1.05 eV at 400-600degreesC.,As-deposited (La1-xSrx)(Ga1-y-zMgyCoz)O3-(x+y+z)/2 crystallized thin films prepared by pulsed laser deposition for application to solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte,10.1143/JJAP.43.299
