4,13433,Stainless steel 430L (SS430L) powder is selected for producing the metal support due to its relatively low cost and good thermal expansion compatibility.,"Fabrication, property and performance evaluation of Stainless Steel 430L as porous supports for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.3389/fenrg.2023.1127900
5,13433,MS-SOFC button cells with the SS430L/YSZ|Ni/YSZ|YSZ|LSCF structure were successfully prepared by co-sintering and ultrasonic pyrolytic spraying.,"Fabrication, property and performance evaluation of Stainless Steel 430L as porous supports for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.3389/fenrg.2023.1127900
6,13433,"We found that the trace oxygen level in the dilute H-2/Ar gas mixture could play a drastic role in laboratory sintering of the SS430L support; local oxygen control is essential, particularly to avoid Cr oxidation.","Fabrication, property and performance evaluation of Stainless Steel 430L as porous supports for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.3389/fenrg.2023.1127900
7,13433,"The addition of no more than 10% YSZ as a second phase to SS430L substantially minimized over-sintering of the SS430L support, leading to a more porous metallic-type substrate, while the electrical conductivity and thermal expansion were not much affected.","Fabrication, property and performance evaluation of Stainless Steel 430L as porous supports for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.3389/fenrg.2023.1127900
8,13433,"The fabricated MS-SOFC button cells with the SS430L/YSZ|Ni/YSZ|YSZ|LSCF structure delivered a maximum power density of 180 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C with an open-circuit voltage of 1.13 V, using dry hydrogen as the fuel and ambient air as an oxidant.","Fabrication, property and performance evaluation of Stainless Steel 430L as porous supports for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.3389/fenrg.2023.1127900
9,13433,"A cell tested at 750 degrees C showed relatively good stability for a period of 140 h. While the performance still needs further optimization, the high OCV and good stability indicated that the reported powder metallurgy route is a promising method, and the relevant experimental details, particularly on producing metallic and oxidation-free porous supports, are critical for the preparation of MS-SOFCs.","Fabrication, property and performance evaluation of Stainless Steel 430L as porous supports for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.3389/fenrg.2023.1127900
