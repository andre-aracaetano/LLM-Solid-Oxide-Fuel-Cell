1,322,A simple and cost-effective method has been developed for the fabrication of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFCs).,Preparation of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells based on highly asymmetric structured electrolyte hollow fibers,10.1007/s11426-010-4220-8
2,322,Highly asymmetric electrolyte hollow fibers composed of a thin dense skin layer and a thick porous substrate are first prepared by a modified phase inversion/sintering technique.,Preparation of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells based on highly asymmetric structured electrolyte hollow fibers,10.1007/s11426-010-4220-8
3,322,The porous substrate is then formed into the anode by deposition of a Ni catalyst via an electroless plating method inside the pores while the thin dense skin layer serves directly as the electrolyte film of the fuel cells.,Preparation of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells based on highly asymmetric structured electrolyte hollow fibers,10.1007/s11426-010-4220-8
4,322,A porous cathode layer is produced on the outer surface of the Ni-deposited hollow fibers by slurry coating and subsequent sintering to form a complete micro tubular fuel cell.,Preparation of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells based on highly asymmetric structured electrolyte hollow fibers,10.1007/s11426-010-4220-8
5,322,The process has been employed to fabricate yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ) supported Ni-YSZ|YSZ|La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) microtubular fuel cells.,Preparation of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells based on highly asymmetric structured electrolyte hollow fibers,10.1007/s11426-010-4220-8
6,322,The maximum output of the resulting cells is 159.6 mW cm(-2) at 800 A degrees C when using H-2 as the fuel feed and air as the oxidant.,Preparation of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells based on highly asymmetric structured electrolyte hollow fibers,10.1007/s11426-010-4220-8
