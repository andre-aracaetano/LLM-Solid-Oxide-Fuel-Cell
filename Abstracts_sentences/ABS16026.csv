1,16026,"As the current density on a solid oxide fuel cell element increases, the voltage is reduced from that, close to the Nernst potential, obtained under open-circuit conditions due to loss mechanisms, the ohmic resistance of the materials and polarisation effects at the inter-faces, as well as any effect of fuel depletion.","Activation processes, electrocatalysis and operating protocols enhance SOFC performance",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00460-4
2,16026,"The ohmic losses are determined by the materials selected and the dimensions of the component, particularly the electrolyte thickness.","Activation processes, electrocatalysis and operating protocols enhance SOFC performance",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00460-4
3,16026,"Minimisation of polarisation effects requires detailed interface structural control, and advances in this aspect of SOFC engineering are reviewed.","Activation processes, electrocatalysis and operating protocols enhance SOFC performance",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00460-4
4,16026,Additionally note is taken of variation in performance of SOFC devices consequent on their operational history.,"Activation processes, electrocatalysis and operating protocols enhance SOFC performance",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00460-4
