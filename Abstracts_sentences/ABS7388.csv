1,7388,The development of anodes with highly efficient electrochemical catalysis and good durability is crucial for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Synergistically Promoting Coking Resistance of a La0.4Sr0.4Ti0.85Ni0.15O3-d Anode by Ru-Doping-Induced Active Twin Defects and Highly Dispersed Ni Nanoparticles,10.1021/acsami.2c15337
2,7388,This paper reports a superior Ru-doped La0.4Sr0.4Ti0.85Ni0.15O3-delta (L0.4STN) anode material with excellent catalytic activity and good stability.,Synergistically Promoting Coking Resistance of a La0.4Sr0.4Ti0.85Ni0.15O3-d Anode by Ru-Doping-Induced Active Twin Defects and Highly Dispersed Ni Nanoparticles,10.1021/acsami.2c15337
3,7388,"The doping of Ru can inhibit the agglomeration of in situ-exsolved Ni nanoparticles on the surface and induce the formation of abundant multiple-twinned defects in the perovskite matrix, which significantly increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies.",Synergistically Promoting Coking Resistance of a La0.4Sr0.4Ti0.85Ni0.15O3-d Anode by Ru-Doping-Induced Active Twin Defects and Highly Dispersed Ni Nanoparticles,10.1021/acsami.2c15337
4,7388,"The reduced L0.4STRN (R-L0.4STRN) anode shows an area-specific resistance (ASR) of 0.067 omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, which is only about one-third of that of stochiometric R-L0.6STN (0.212 omega cm(2)).",Synergistically Promoting Coking Resistance of a La0.4Sr0.4Ti0.85Ni0.15O3-d Anode by Ru-Doping-Induced Active Twin Defects and Highly Dispersed Ni Nanoparticles,10.1021/acsami.2c15337
5,7388,A single cell with the RL0.4STRN anode shows excellent stability (similar to 50 h at 650 degrees C) in both H-2 and CH4.,Synergistically Promoting Coking Resistance of a La0.4Sr0.4Ti0.85Ni0.15O3-d Anode by Ru-Doping-Induced Active Twin Defects and Highly Dispersed Ni Nanoparticles,10.1021/acsami.2c15337
6,7388,"Furthermore, R-L0.4STRN exhibits outstanding resistance to carbon deposition, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles and active twinned defects induced by Ru doping.",Synergistically Promoting Coking Resistance of a La0.4Sr0.4Ti0.85Ni0.15O3-d Anode by Ru-Doping-Induced Active Twin Defects and Highly Dispersed Ni Nanoparticles,10.1021/acsami.2c15337
