5,11328,The electrical conductivity measurements of the PSCF pellets were in the range of 100-1300 S cm(-1).,"Oxygen Reduction Reaction Mechanism on PrSrCo2-x Fe x O5+d (x=0, 1, 2) and Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/acsaem.3c01390
6,11328,The PSCF (x = 1) - Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite cathode yielded the lowest area specific resistance (ASR) value of 0.07 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C for ORR.,"Oxygen Reduction Reaction Mechanism on PrSrCo2-x Fe x O5+d (x=0, 1, 2) and Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/acsaem.3c01390
7,11328,DFRT and pO(2) studies showed that impedance arcs corresponding to the high frequency could be attributed to the oxygen ion transfer resistance while the medium-low frequency impedance arcs could be correlated with the charge transfer resistance at the cathode/gas interface followed by ion incorporation.,"Oxygen Reduction Reaction Mechanism on PrSrCo2-x Fe x O5+d (x=0, 1, 2) and Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/acsaem.3c01390
