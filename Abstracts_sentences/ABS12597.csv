1,12597,A cost-effective method was developed to fabricate dense doped LaCrO(3) bases interconnect membrane on anode substrate for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications.,A novel approach to co-sintering of doped lanthanum chromite interconnect on Ni-YSZ anode substrate for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.09.055
2,12597,"As conventional lanthanum chromite interconnect is difficult to be co-sintered with green anode, a simple and cost effective screen printing/co-sintering process was employed, and dense La(1-x-y)Sr(x)Ca(y)CrO(3-delta) interconnect membrane was successfully prepared on the anode support of NiO-YSZ.",A novel approach to co-sintering of doped lanthanum chromite interconnect on Ni-YSZ anode substrate for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.09.055
3,12597,In this method a base layer of doped lanthanum chromite (La(1-x)Sr(x)CrO(3-delta)) was applied on NiO-YSZ substrate and a top layer of CaCrO(4) was then coated and co-sintered to melt the top layer.,A novel approach to co-sintering of doped lanthanum chromite interconnect on Ni-YSZ anode substrate for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.09.055
4,12597,"By means of this method, not only CaCrO(4) melts and fills the open pores in the base layer, but it also dissolves in base layer forming La(1-x-y)Sr(x)Ca(y)CrO(3-delta) as a single layer.",A novel approach to co-sintering of doped lanthanum chromite interconnect on Ni-YSZ anode substrate for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.09.055
