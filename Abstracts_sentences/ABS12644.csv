2,12644,"Nevertheless, not many materials have been reported to work as cathodes in a LSAO apatite-based cell.",Suitability of strontium and cobalt-free perovskite cathodes with La9.67Si5AlO26 apatite electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0dt02987d
3,12644,"In the present work, eight different strontium and cobalt-free compounds with a perovskite-type structure and the general composition LaM1-xNxO3-delta (where M = Fe, Cr, Mn; N = Cu, Ni; and x = 0.2, 0.3) have been tested.",Suitability of strontium and cobalt-free perovskite cathodes with La9.67Si5AlO26 apatite electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0dt02987d
4,12644,"This study includes the synthesis and structural characterization of the compounds, as well as thermomechanical and chemical compatibility tests between them.",Suitability of strontium and cobalt-free perovskite cathodes with La9.67Si5AlO26 apatite electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0dt02987d
5,12644,Functional characterization of the individual components has been performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).,Suitability of strontium and cobalt-free perovskite cathodes with La9.67Si5AlO26 apatite electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0dt02987d
6,12644,Apatite/perovskite symmetrical cells were used to measure area-specific resistance (ASR) of the half cell in an intermediate temperature range (500-850 degrees C) both with and without DC bias.,Suitability of strontium and cobalt-free perovskite cathodes with La9.67Si5AlO26 apatite electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0dt02987d
7,12644,"According to its electrochemical behaviour, LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3-delta is the most promising material for IT-SOFC among the compositions tested since its ASR is similar to that of the traditional (LaxSr1-x)MnO3 (LSM) cathode.",Suitability of strontium and cobalt-free perovskite cathodes with La9.67Si5AlO26 apatite electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0dt02987d
