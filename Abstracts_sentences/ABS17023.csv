1,17023,Reversible solid oxide cells (RSOCs) are energy-conversion devices that can convert electricity into chemical energy and vice versa.,Sr-Doped PrCrO3 with Intelligent SrCrO x Cocatalyst for the Fuel Electrode of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07224
2,17023,The working environment of the fuel electrode would vary significantly between the two modes and the design of an efficient and durable fuel electrode is urgent and demanding.,Sr-Doped PrCrO3 with Intelligent SrCrO x Cocatalyst for the Fuel Electrode of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07224
3,17023,"In this work, Pr1-xSrxCrO3 (x = 0.2, 0.3) perovskites were explored, aiming to find proper fuel electrodes for a RSOC.",Sr-Doped PrCrO3 with Intelligent SrCrO x Cocatalyst for the Fuel Electrode of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07224
4,17023,A minor amount of SrCrO4 was produced in Pr0.8Sr0.2CrO3 (PS20C) and Pr0.7Sr0.3CrO3 (PS30C) under oxygenation and can be reduced to SrCrO3-delta by reduction in 5% H-2.,Sr-Doped PrCrO3 with Intelligent SrCrO x Cocatalyst for the Fuel Electrode of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07224
5,17023,The polarization resistance (R-p) value of PS30C was significantly lower than PS20C (0.15 Omega cm(2) versus 2.11 Omega cm(2)) at 800 degrees C and the higher performance of the PS30C fuel electrode could be related partially to the production of more metallic SrCrO3-delta.,Sr-Doped PrCrO3 with Intelligent SrCrO x Cocatalyst for the Fuel Electrode of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07224
6,17023,A high performance was obtained in either fuel cell mode or electrolysis mode using a PS30C fuel electrode with the intelligent SrCrOx and the additional Ni infiltration does not enhance the performance.,Sr-Doped PrCrO3 with Intelligent SrCrO x Cocatalyst for the Fuel Electrode of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07224
7,17023,"Ru infiltration into the PS30C further enhances the cell performance, imparting a peak power of 832 mW cm(-2) as fuel cell and a current density of 1.19 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V for steam electrolysis at 800 degrees C.",Sr-Doped PrCrO3 with Intelligent SrCrO x Cocatalyst for the Fuel Electrode of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07224
8,17023,"The reversible switching at 0.6 V for H-2 oxidation and 1.3 V for steam electrolysis was tested for 12 cycles, and insignificant performance degradation was found for the PS30C cell with Ru infiltration.",Sr-Doped PrCrO3 with Intelligent SrCrO x Cocatalyst for the Fuel Electrode of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07224
