1,8184,Quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics were used to evaluate the performance of solid oxide fuel cell anode materials in the presence of H-2 and H2S. The most common anode material Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) was used for the study.,Theoretical investigations of NiYSZ in the presence of H2S,10.1149/1.2165708
2,8184,It was found that the presence of H2S has an important effect on the oxidation of H-2.,Theoretical investigations of NiYSZ in the presence of H2S,10.1149/1.2165708
3,8184,Thermodynamics and transport limitations favor the oxidation of H-2 instead of H2S.,Theoretical investigations of NiYSZ in the presence of H2S,10.1149/1.2165708
4,8184,Furthermore it is predicted that the presence of H2S slows down the oxidation of the hydrogen due to transport limitations (the H2S molecules tend to be surrounded by H-2 molecules in the media).,Theoretical investigations of NiYSZ in the presence of H2S,10.1149/1.2165708
