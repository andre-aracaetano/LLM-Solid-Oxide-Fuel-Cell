6,20505,We demonstrate the mutual relationships between site fractions and order parameters using two types of practically important multicomponent phases as examples: perovskite La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSM) and LaxSr1-xCoyFe1-yO3 (LSCF) used as solid oxide fuel cell cathodes and the spinel Co-Fe-O system as a catalyst for CO oxidation.,Thermodynamic models of multicomponent nonstoichiometric solution phases using internal process order parameters,10.1016/j.actamat.2021.117462
7,20505,"We demonstrate that this proposed thermodynamic model can be directly incorporated in kinetic modeling, e.g., phase-field simulation, of diffusion-reaction and phase transformation processes involving nonstoichiometric phases as well as the kinetics of the internal processes within the nonstoichiometric compound under non-equilibrium conditions.",Thermodynamic models of multicomponent nonstoichiometric solution phases using internal process order parameters,10.1016/j.actamat.2021.117462
