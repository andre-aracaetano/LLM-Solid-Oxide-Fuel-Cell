2,3593,"Deposition of yttria-stabilized zirconia on Si/SiO2/Si3N4 substrates was optimized for both techniques in order to obtain high density and homogeneity, as well as a good crystallinity for film thicknesses ranging from 60 to 240 nm.",Residual Stress of Free-Standing Membranes of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia for Micro Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.1166/jnn.2010.1837
3,3593,"In addition, stabilized zirconia free-standing membranes were fabricated from the deposited films with surface areas between 50 x 50 mu m(2) and 820 x 820 mu m(2).",Residual Stress of Free-Standing Membranes of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia for Micro Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.1166/jnn.2010.1837
4,3593,"Particular emphasis was made on the analysis of the effect of the nature of the deposition technique and the different design and fabrication parameters (membrane area, thickness and substrate deposition temperature) on the residual stress of the membranes in order to control their thermomechanical stability for application as electrolyte in micro solid oxide fuel cells.",Residual Stress of Free-Standing Membranes of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia for Micro Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.1166/jnn.2010.1837
