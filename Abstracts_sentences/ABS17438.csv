4,17438,The crystallite zirconia growth was inhibited and the zirconia crystallization temperature was increased.,PREPARATION AND PROPERTIES EVALUATION OF ZIRCONIA-BASED AL2O3 COMPOSITES AS ELECTROLYTES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL SYSTEMS .1. POWDER PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION,10.1007/BF00353015
5,17438,This behaviour has been assumed to be due to the formation of a polycondensed chain of the type Zr-O-Al-O-Y-O-Al-O-Zr in which the diffusion distances were considerably augmented.,PREPARATION AND PROPERTIES EVALUATION OF ZIRCONIA-BASED AL2O3 COMPOSITES AS ELECTROLYTES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL SYSTEMS .1.
