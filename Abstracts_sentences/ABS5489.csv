1,5489,"For the first time, the perovskite lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) is demonstrated to exhibit catalytic activity for the direct electrochemical oxidation of CH4 in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode environment for more than 72 h with a steady state flow of CH4 at 900 degrees C, producing a maximum of 186 W/cm(2).",Investigating the CH4 reaction pathway on a novel LSCF anode catalyst in the SOFC,10.1016/j.catcom.2008.11.035
2,5489,"Results of the transient response studies suggested that the electrochemical oxidation of CH4 on the anode produced electricity, H2O, and CO2 via (i) CH4 decomposition, (ii) electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen to H2O, and (iii) electrochemical oxidation of carbon to CO2.",Investigating the CH4 reaction pathway on a novel LSCF anode catalyst in the SOFC,10.1016/j.catcom.2008.11.035
