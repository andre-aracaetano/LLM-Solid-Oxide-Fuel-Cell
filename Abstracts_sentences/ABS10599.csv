1,10599,"Different composite materials made of mixed protonic/electronic conductors, SrCe0.9Yb0.1O3-delta (10YbSC) or BaCe0.9Yb0.1O3-delta (10YbBC), and a mixed oxygen-ion/electronic conductor, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF), were investigated for cathode application in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCS) using a high temperature proton conducting BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta electrolyte.",Composite Cathodes for Proton Conducting Electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.200800126
2,10599,Only the LSCF/10YbBC composite was found to be chemically stable.,Composite Cathodes for Proton Conducting Electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.200800126
3,10599,"Area specific resistance (ASR) measurements were performed in wet air for LSCF/10YbBC cathodes, changing the weight ratio between the phases and the sintering procedure.",Composite Cathodes for Proton Conducting Electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.200800126
4,10599,"The best performance was obtained for the composite cathode containing 50 wt.-% of LSCF and 50 wt.-% of 10YbBC, sintered at 1,100 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the tested cathodes showed two depressed semicircles in the middle and low frequency range, respectively.",Composite Cathodes for Proton Conducting Electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.200800126
5,10599,"Performing ASR measurements at different po(2) allowed us to attribute the two semicircles to charge transfer and oxygen diffusion processes, respectively.",Composite Cathodes for Proton Conducting Electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.200800126
6,10599,The microstructure of the LSCF/10YbBC(1:1) composite cathode was optimised changing the ratio of the particle sizes between the two phases.,Composite Cathodes for Proton Conducting Electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.200800126
7,10599,The lowest ASR values (0.14 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C) were observed for the LSCF/10YbBC(1:1) composite cathode with different particle size (sub-micrometer particles for LSCF and nanometer particles for 10YbBC).,Composite Cathodes for Proton Conducting Electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.200800126
8,10599,Fuel cell polarisation curves demonstrated superior performance of the LSCF/10YbBC (1:1) cathode with respect to Pt.,Composite Cathodes for Proton Conducting Electrolytes,10.1002/fuce.200800126
