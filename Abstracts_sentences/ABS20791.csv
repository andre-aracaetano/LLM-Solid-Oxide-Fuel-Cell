1,20791,"With the scope to develop new electrode materials for Solid Oxide Cells, the (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-delta system has been studied by Pechini synthesis and heat-treatment in air.","Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part A: Synthesis and structure analysis in air",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.015
2,20791,"Only La2xSr1-2xTi1-xNixO3-delta (LSTN) and La7x/4Sr1-7x/4Ti1-xNixO3-delta (25LSTN) compounds can be prepared as pure phases after synthesis at the minimum temperature of 1000 degrees C for 12 h. All attempts to synthesize any materials of the La5x/3Sr1-5x/3Ti1-xNixO3-delta (33LSTN) and La3x/2Sr1-3x/2Ti1-xNixO3-delta (50LSTN) series were unsuccessful, due probably to a too high Ni3+ content that makes the structure unstable in those conditions.","Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part A: Synthesis and structure analysis in air",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.015
3,20791,Substoichiometric La2x-0.05Sr1-2xTi1-xNixO3 (5ssLSTN) compounds exhibit also NiO impurity.,"Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part A: Synthesis and structure analysis in air",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.015
4,20791,"For LTN50, the presence of an LaNiO3-type secondary phase is evidenced in the powder treated at 1300 degrees C for 12 h, present in higher amount for a synthesis at 1000 degrees C. LSTN (x < 0.5) and 25LSTN seem less sensitive to the synthesis temperature.","Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part A: Synthesis and structure analysis in air",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.015
5,20791,"However, significant weight losses in air have been observed for powders prepared at 1000 degrees C-12 h, attributed to the presence of carbonates and/or Ni3+ reduction with temperature.","Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part A: Synthesis and structure analysis in air",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.015
6,20791,"To obtain a stoichiometry that is close to the expected composition and to reach a better chemical and structural homogeneity of LSTN and 25LSTN compounds, the materials have to be ideally prepared at 1300 degrees C-12 h.","Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part A: Synthesis and structure analysis in air",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.015
