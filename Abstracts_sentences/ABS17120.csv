3,17120,Pure LSGM powders were achieved after heat treatment at 1100 degrees C for 12 h. 87% relative density was obtained after pressing of these powders under 1 MPa and sintering at 1250 degrees C for 12 h. Average particle size was calculated as 1.77-2.4 pal from SEM micrographs.,Preparation and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3 electrolyte by polyol method for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.02.122
4,17120,Overall conductivity of the LSGM pellet was found to be 0.0014 S/cm at 850 degrees C with impedance analysis and showed that the preparation process needs improvements.,Preparation and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3 electrolyte by polyol method for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.02.122
