1,18548,"The construction of the fluorite unit-cell from the ionic radii of the constitutive species is proposed with the use of our hybrid model, considering flexible anion and cation radii.",Ionic radii in fluorites,10.1016/j.mtla.2023.101934
2,18548,24 binary and stoichiometric compounds crystallizing in this structure were investigated to find an empirical correlation between the anion's radius as a function of the cation's size that can be used to evaluate the lattice parameter of new fluorite-structured ionic crystals.,Ionic radii in fluorites,10.1016/j.mtla.2023.101934
3,18548,This method was applied to the binary dioxides and difluorides that crystallize in the fluorite structure at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.,Ionic radii in fluorites,10.1016/j.mtla.2023.101934
4,18548,"The relevance of our model was also enlarged to complex oxide solid-solutions incorporating aliovalent cations, namely uranium dioxides doped with trivalent cations (U,M)O2 with M = Y(III), La(III), Pr(III), Nd(III), Sm(III), Eu(III), Gd(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III), and Lu(III).",Ionic radii in fluorites,10.1016/j.mtla.2023.101934
