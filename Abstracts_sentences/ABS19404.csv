1,19404,This paper presents a modularized simulation modelling framework for evaluating the impacts on economic cost and CO2 emissions resulting from the introduction of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system into the existing mix of centralized power generation technologies in Japan.,A modularized framework for solving an economic-environmental power generation mix problem,10.1002/er.992
2,19404,"The framework is comprised of three parts: a dual-objective linear programming model that solves the generation best-mix problem for the existing power generation technologies; a nonlinear SOFC system model in which the economic cost and CO2 emissions by the SOFC system can be calculated; and the Queuing Multi-Objective Optimizer (QMOO), a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) developed at the EPFL in Switzerland as the overall optimizer of the combined power supply system.",A modularized framework for solving an economic-environmental power generation mix problem,10.1002/er.992
3,19404,"Thus, the framework integrates an evolutionary algorithm that is more suitable for handling nonlinearities with a calculus-based method that is more efficient in solving linear programming problems.",A modularized framework for solving an economic-environmental power generation mix problem,10.1002/er.992
4,19404,Simulation experiments show that the framework is successful in solving the stated problem.,A modularized framework for solving an economic-environmental power generation mix problem,10.1002/er.992
5,19404,"Moreover, the three components of the modularized framework can be interconnected through a platform-independent model integration environment.",A modularized framework for solving an economic-environmental power generation mix problem,10.1002/er.992
6,19404,"As a result, the framework is flexible and scalable, and can potentially be modified and/or integrated with other models to study more complex problems.",A modularized framework for solving an economic-environmental power generation mix problem,10.1002/er.992
