4,2040,"The maximum power densities (Pmax) of YSZ-CeO2 based fuel cell can reach 680 mW cm-2 at 450 degrees C, 510 mW cm-2 at 430 degrees C, 330 mW cm-2 at 410 degrees C and even 200 mW cm-2 as the operational temperature was reduced to 390 degrees C. A series of characterizations indicates that the activation energy of the YSZ-CeO2 composite is significantly decreased, and the enhancement effect for ion conduction comes from interface transport.",A novel yttrium stabilized zirconia and ceria composite electrolyte lowering solid oxide fuel cells working temperature to 400 °C,10.1039/d3ra01507f
