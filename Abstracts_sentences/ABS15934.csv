2,15934,Impregnation of Cu into porous LSCM anode was found to significantly reduce the anodic overpotential.,Cu(Pd)-impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anodes for direct utilization of methane in SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.09.001
3,15934,The lowest overpotential was observed for the LSCM anode impregnated with 20 wt.% Cu.,Cu(Pd)-impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anodes for direct utilization of methane in SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.09.001
4,15934,"The maximum power density of a single cell with the LSCM+20 wt.% Cu composite anode reached 0.86 and 0.48 W/cm(2) in dry H-2 and CH4 at 850 degrees C, respectively.",Cu(Pd)-impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anodes for direct utilization of methane in SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.09.001
5,15934,"However, the cell with the LSCM anode appeared to be unstable when exposed to H-2+50 ppm H2S with the power density dropped precipitously in about 2 h. The cell performance was further improved with the impregnation of a small amount of Pd into the LSCM+20 wt.% Cu anode.",Cu(Pd)-impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anodes for direct utilization of methane in SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.09.001
6,15934,"With the addition of 1.5 wt.% Pd to the anode, the maximum power density at 850 degrees C increased from 0.86 to 0.89 W/cm(2) in H-2 and from 0.48 to 0.6 W/cm(2) in CH4, respectively.",Cu(Pd)-impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anodes for direct utilization of methane in SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.09.001
7,15934,The mechanism of methane oxidation on the LSCM and LSCM +Cu anodes is considered to involve direct electrochemical oxidation of methane.,Cu(Pd)-impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anodes for direct utilization of methane in SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.09.001
8,15934,"However, with Pd dispersed on the LSCM+Cu anode, methane might be firstly catalyzed to form C and H-2 which is followed by oxidation of the cracking products.",Cu(Pd)-impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anodes for direct utilization of methane in SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.09.001
