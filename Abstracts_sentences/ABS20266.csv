2,20266,"This review analyses lanthanum and cobalt leaching from waste materials (e-waste, batteries, spent catalysts), aiming to provide a starting point for SOC recycling, not yet investigated.",Analysis of Lanthanum and Cobalt Leaching Aimed at Effective Recycling Strategies of Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/su14063335
3,20266,"The literature was surveyed with a specific interest for leaching, the first phase of hydrometallurgy recycling.",Analysis of Lanthanum and Cobalt Leaching Aimed at Effective Recycling Strategies of Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/su14063335
4,20266,"Most references (86%) were published after 2012, with an interest higher (85%) for cobalt.",Analysis of Lanthanum and Cobalt Leaching Aimed at Effective Recycling Strategies of Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/su14063335
5,20266,"Inorganic acids were the prevailing (>80%) leaching agents, particularly for lanthanum, while leaching processes using organic acids mostly involved cobalt.",Analysis of Lanthanum and Cobalt Leaching Aimed at Effective Recycling Strategies of Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/su14063335
6,20266,The experimental conditions adopted more diluted organic acids (median 0.55 M for lanthanum and 1.4 M for cobalt) compared to inorganic acids (median value 2 M for both metals).,Analysis of Lanthanum and Cobalt Leaching Aimed at Effective Recycling Strategies of Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/su14063335
7,20266,"Organic acids required a higher solid to liquid ratio (200 g/L), compared to inorganic ones (100 g/L) to solubilize lanthanum, while the opposite happened for cobalt (20 vs. 50 g/L).",Analysis of Lanthanum and Cobalt Leaching Aimed at Effective Recycling Strategies of Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/su14063335
8,20266,"The process temperature didn't change considerably with the solvent (45-75 degrees C for lanthanum, and 75-88 degrees C for cobalt).",Analysis of Lanthanum and Cobalt Leaching Aimed at Effective Recycling Strategies of Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/su14063335
9,20266,The contact time was higher for lanthanum than for cobalt (median 3-4 h vs. 75-85 min).,Analysis of Lanthanum and Cobalt Leaching Aimed at Effective Recycling Strategies of Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/su14063335
