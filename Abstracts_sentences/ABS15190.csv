1,15190,A-site cation-ordered perovskite oxide LaBaCo2O5+delta (LBCO) was synthesized and evaluated as a cathode material of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Characterization of cation-ordered perovskite oxide LaBaCo2O5+δ as cathode of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.01.056
2,15190,LBCO was structurally stable when calcined at 850 degrees C in air but transformed into cation-disordered structure at 1050 degrees C. LBCO showed chemical compatibility with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) electrolyte at 850 degrees C and 1000 degrees C in air.,Characterization of cation-ordered perovskite oxide LaBaCo2O5+δ as cathode of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.01.056
3,15190,Conductivity of LBCO firstly increased slightly with higher temperature to a maximum of 470 S cm(-1) at similar to 250 degrees C and then decreased gradually with further increase in temperature.,Characterization of cation-ordered perovskite oxide LaBaCo2O5+δ as cathode of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.01.056
