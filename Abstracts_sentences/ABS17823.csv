1,17823,"Ca-substituted layered nickelates with a general Pr2-x Ca (x) NiO4 + delta composition (x = 0-0.7, Delta x = 0.1) were prepared in the present work and their structural and physic-chemical properties were investigated in order to select the most optimal materials, which can be used as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells.","Structure, stability, and thermomechanical properties of Ca-substituted Pr2NiO4+δ",10.1134/S1063783417040187
2,17823,"With an increase in Ca content in Pr2-x Ca (x) NiO4 + delta the following tendencies were observed: (i) a decrease in the concentration of nonstoichiometric oxygen (delta), (ii) a decrease in the unit cell parameters and volume, (iii) stabilization of the tetragonal structure, (iv) a decrease of the thermal expansion coefficients, and (v) enchancement of thermodynamic stability and compatibility with selected oxygen- and proton-conducting electrolytes.","Structure, stability, and thermomechanical properties of Ca-substituted Pr2NiO4+δ",10.1134/S1063783417040187
