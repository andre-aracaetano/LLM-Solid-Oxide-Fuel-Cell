3,3266,"The SOFCs with the different amounts of the La2Sn2O7 nano-powders in the Ni-GDC anodes are tested under dry CH4, and the 0.3 wt.% La2Sn2O7-Ni-GDC (0.3LNG) anodes show the highest cell performances of all anodes.",Coke-tolerant La2Sn2O7-Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 composite anode for direct methane-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-018-0133-2
4,3266,The maximum power density of the cell is approximately 0.55 W cm(-2) at 650 A degrees C.,Coke-tolerant La2Sn2O7-Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 composite anode for direct methane-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-018-0133-2
5,3266,"The durability of the 0.3LNG cell is significantly enhanced without any carbon formations, showing approximately 0.69 V over 600 h at 0.3 A cm(-2), whereas the conventional Ni-GDC cell is stopped only after 90 h.",Coke-tolerant La2Sn2O7-Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 composite anode for direct methane-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-018-0133-2
6,3266,It suggests that the 0.3LNG is a promising anode material to enhance coke-tolerances and durability of direct-methane fuel cells.,Coke-tolerant La2Sn2O7-Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 composite anode for direct methane-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-018-0133-2
