4,4402,"The results indicate that the Bi2O3-added silver paste cathode current collector artificially increases the power density and lowers the polarization resistance of single cell, which may be attributed to the observation of the improved cathode current collector surface morphology and enhanced contact at the cathode-current collector interface, as well as the migration of the Bi2O3 and silver into the cathode from the Bi2O3 contained silver paste cathode current collector.","Performance of (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode based solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of bismuth oxide sintering aid in silver paste cathode current collector",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.104
