1,7863,La2CoMnO6 has attracted intensive research interest because of its prospect for novel technological applications and rich fundamental physics.,First-principles study of La2CoMnO6: a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells due to intrinsic Co-Mn cation disorder,10.1007/s11581-014-1320-z
2,7863,"And, due to the similar radii size as well as small covalent difference (as large as 2) between Co and Mn, cation disorder should be intrinsic within this perovskite.",First-principles study of La2CoMnO6: a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells due to intrinsic Co-Mn cation disorder,10.1007/s11581-014-1320-z
3,7863,"We performed comprehensive first-principles calculations on both La2CoMnO6 (LCMO) and LCMO with Co-Mn-Mn-Co antisite defects (AD:LCMO), focusing on the formation of bulk oxygen vacancies, which plays a key role in oxygen ion diffusion process in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrodes.",First-principles study of La2CoMnO6: a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells due to intrinsic Co-Mn cation disorder,10.1007/s11581-014-1320-z
4,7863,"First, it is found that the covalent states are 2 and +4 for Co and Mn at their regular sites while they are both prone to be +3 in the antisites.",First-principles study of La2CoMnO6: a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells due to intrinsic Co-Mn cation disorder,10.1007/s11581-014-1320-z
5,7863,"The formation energies for oxygen vacancies are predicted to follow the trend Co2+-O-Mn4+ > Co2+-O-Co3+ > Mn3+-O-Mn4+, and the underlying microscopic mechanism is attributed to the more electron delocalization between mixed-covalent transition metals (Co2+-O-Co3+ and Mn3+-O-Mn4+), which is beneficial to diminish the electronic repulsion and help to stabilize the vacancy.",First-principles study of La2CoMnO6: a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells due to intrinsic Co-Mn cation disorder,10.1007/s11581-014-1320-z
6,7863,"Therefore, we could conclude that oxygen ionic conductivity should be enhanced in the compounds with higher degree of cation disorder.",First-principles study of La2CoMnO6: a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells due to intrinsic Co-Mn cation disorder,10.1007/s11581-014-1320-z
7,7863,Our results indicate that AD:LCMO should be a promising intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathode material.,First-principles study of La2CoMnO6: a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells due to intrinsic Co-Mn cation disorder,10.1007/s11581-014-1320-z
