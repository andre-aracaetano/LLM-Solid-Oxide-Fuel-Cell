5,4290,"The oxygen permeation fluxes in the electrolyte, which were deduced from the measured reduction in OCV during the operation of fuel shut-off, are shown to correlate well with the time elapsed from the shut-off of the fuel gas supply to the onset of mechanical damage monitored by acoustic emissions.",Effect of pinholes in electrolyte on re-oxidation tolerance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/fuce.202000062
6,4290,"The correlation indicates that the oxidation rate of the anode substrate is accelerated due to the presence of pinholes in the electrolyte, which can result in mechanical damages.",Effect of pinholes in electrolyte on re-oxidation tolerance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/fuce.202000062
