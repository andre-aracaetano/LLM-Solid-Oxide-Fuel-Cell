1,17833,Recently there has been substantial interest in optimising perovskite type ceramics as mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) for use in ceramic oxygen generators and solid oxide fuel cells.,A Comparison of The Transport Properties of La2-xSrxNi1-yFeyO4+δ where 0 < x < 0.2 and 0 < y < 0.2,10.1007/BF02375836
2,17833,However these materials suffer from thermomechanical deficiencies and therefore there is a need to develop alternative materials.,A Comparison of The Transport Properties of La2-xSrxNi1-yFeyO4+δ where 0 < x < 0.2 and 0 < y < 0.2,10.1007/BF02375836
3,17833,Using the IEDP/SIMS technique the La(2-x)Sr(x)Ni(1-y)Fe(y)O(4+delta) series of compounds has been investigated and the oxygen tracer diffusion and surface exchange coefficients determined.,A Comparison of The Transport Properties of La2-xSrxNi1-yFeyO4+δ where 0 < x < 0.2 and 0 < y < 0.2,10.1007/BF02375836
4,17833,It has been found that the oxide ion diffusivity of the x and y = 0 material is very close to that of the fast oxide ion conducting perovskites such as La(1-x)Sr(x)CoO(3) (LSC) but on acceptor doping with Sr a considerable decrease in the oxygen tracer diffusion coefficient was observed.,A Comparison of The Transport Properties of La2-xSrxNi1-yFeyO4+δ where 0 < x < 0.2 and 0 < y < 0.2,10.1007/BF02375836
5,17833,"Further studies on the effects of B site doping, where y > 0, indicate that this has very little effect on the transport properties.",A Comparison of The Transport Properties of La2-xSrxNi1-yFeyO4+δ where 0 < x < 0.2 and 0 < y < 0.2,10.1007/BF02375836
