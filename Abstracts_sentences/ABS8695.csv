1,8695,"To increase the performance of solid oxide fuel cells operated at intermediate temperatures (<700 degrees C), we used the electronic conductor La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and the mixed conductor La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) to modify the cathode in the electrode microstructure.",Modifying the cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with a Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 sol-gel coating,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.08.091
2,8695,"For both cathode materials, we employed a Sm0.2Ce0.8O2 (SDC) buffer layer as a diffusion barrier on the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte to prevent the inter-layer formation of SrZrO3 and La2Zr2O7, which have a poor ionic conductivity.",Modifying the cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with a Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 sol-gel coating,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.08.091
3,8695,"These interfacial reaction products were formed only minimally at the electrolyte-cathode interlayer after sintering the SDC layer at high temperature; in addition, the degree of cathode polarization also decreased.",Modifying the cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with a Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 sol-gel coating,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.08.091
4,8695,"Moreover to extend the triple phase boundary and improve cell performance at intermediate temperatures, we used sol-gel methods to coat an SDC layer on the cathode pore walls.",Modifying the cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with a Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 sol-gel coating,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.08.091
