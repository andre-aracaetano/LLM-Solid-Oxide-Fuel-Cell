1,1491,"Although the cermet consisting of nickel and zirconia is useful as the solid oxide fuel cell anode, the conventional cermet consisting of nickel and yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) is prone to be deactivated for a direct supply of hydrocarbon fuels.",Cobalt Alloying Effect on Improvement of Ni/YSZ Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operating with Dry Methane,10.2320/matertrans.MT-M2020355
2,1491,This paper describes a method to retard the deactivation of the Ni/YSZ-based cermet anode by being modified with appropriate incorporation of Co as the alloying element into Ni.,Cobalt Alloying Effect on Improvement of Ni/YSZ Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operating with Dry Methane,10.2320/matertrans.MT-M2020355
3,1491,"The single-type anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) consisting of the Ni0.75Co0.25/YSZ cermet anode, YSZ film electrolyte, and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode exhibited a prolonged stable SOFC performance at 750 degrees C for dry methane (CH4) feeding compared to the one using the Ni/YSZ anode.",Cobalt Alloying Effect on Improvement of Ni/YSZ Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operating with Dry Methane,10.2320/matertrans.MT-M2020355
4,1491,The microstructural modification of the cermet anode caused a carbon tolerance effect against CH4 accompanied by a low anodic polarization resistance.,Cobalt Alloying Effect on Improvement of Ni/YSZ Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operating with Dry Methane,10.2320/matertrans.MT-M2020355
