2,3941,"Herein, we propose a new strategy of quasi-symmetrical ceria-based buffer layers on electrolyte for SSOFCs, which can enhance both performance and long-term stability of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) fuel cells.",Enhancing performance and stability of symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells via quasi-symmetrical ceria-based buffer layers,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.044
3,3941,"Three typical buffer layers of Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (GDC), Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC), and Sm0.075Nd0.075Ce0.85O2-delta (SNDC) are fabricated on YSZ electrolyte by spin-coating method, the effects of which on electrochemical per-formance of fuel cells with Pr0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta (PSF) electrode are investigated in detail.",Enhancing performance and stability of symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells via quasi-symmetrical ceria-based buffer layers,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.044
4,3941,"It is surprising to find that when SNDC was applied as the buffer layer, it had the smallest polarization impedance (RP) of 0.189 omega cm2 at 800 degrees C in air; while SDC was utilized as the buffer layer, it possessed the smallest RP of 0.331 omega cm2 at 800 degrees C in H2.",Enhancing performance and stability of symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells via quasi-symmetrical ceria-based buffer layers,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.044
