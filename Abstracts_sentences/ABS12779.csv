2,12779,Two scenarios of power generation facilities have been analyzed in this study: the first scenario (existing) combines a bagasse cogeneration unit with a diesel combustion engines and the second scenario (future),Health external costs associated to the integration of solid oxide fuel cell in a sugar-ethanol factory,10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.08.090
3,12779,the diesel engines are substituted by a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) fed with ethanol and integrated into the sugar factory.,Health external costs associated to the integration of solid oxide fuel cell in a sugar-ethanol factory,10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.08.090
