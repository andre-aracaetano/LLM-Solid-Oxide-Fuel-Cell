1,4518,"We report first ever the rapid-continuous and one-pot synthesis of nanocrystalline perovskite strontium doped lanthanum manganite La(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3) (where, x = 0.1 similar to 0.3) nanomaterials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) cathode applications by using environmentally benign supercritical water (SCW).",Hydrothermal Synthesis of Strontium Doped Lanthanum Manganite Nanoparticles by a Supercritical Flow Reaction System,10.1166/nnl.2011.1184
2,4518,"The synthesis was performed from the starting solution of the nitrates of La, Sr and Mn metals in a flow reactor and the strontium doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) materials could be obtained at 390 similar to 410 degrees C and 30MPa without any aid of organic solvent within as short as less than a second of time.",Hydrothermal Synthesis of Strontium Doped Lanthanum Manganite Nanoparticles by a Supercritical Flow Reaction System,10.1166/nnl.2011.1184
3,4518,The XRD patterns revealed that the LSM material could be obtained only under the supercritical conditions of water.,Hydrothermal Synthesis of Strontium Doped Lanthanum Manganite Nanoparticles by a Supercritical Flow Reaction System,10.1166/nnl.2011.1184
4,4518,"The TEM and BET analysis proved shape, morphology and size of the materials.",Hydrothermal Synthesis of Strontium Doped Lanthanum Manganite Nanoparticles by a Supercritical Flow Reaction System,10.1166/nnl.2011.1184
5,4518,"Interestingly, the LSM materials were obtained around 6 nm in size with a very large specific surface area of 142 cm(2)/g with certainly a big hope of higher triple-phase-boundary (TPB) of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode materials.",Hydrothermal Synthesis of Strontium Doped Lanthanum Manganite Nanoparticles by a Supercritical Flow Reaction System,10.1166/nnl.2011.1184
6,4518,Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis was performed for the structural composition of the synthesized materials.,Hydrothermal Synthesis of Strontium Doped Lanthanum Manganite Nanoparticles by a Supercritical Flow Reaction System,10.1166/nnl.2011.1184
