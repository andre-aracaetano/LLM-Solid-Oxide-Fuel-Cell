5,4927,"A detailed comparison of the performance between the four cases of the fuel cell is provided in terms of power density, fluid flow, species concentration, temperature distributions, and electric fields at a variable current density and a fixed power density of 3000 W/m(2).",Numerical Analysis of the Effect of Trapezoidal Baffles Inside Fuel and Air Channels on the Performance of a Planar-Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4051689
6,4927,"The results show that the power density, the velocity, the availability of the hydrogen and oxygen species on the electrodes-electrolyte interfaces increases for case 2, case 3, and case 4, respectively, in comparison to case 1.",Numerical Analysis of the Effect of Trapezoidal Baffles Inside Fuel and Air Channels on the Performance of a Planar-Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4051689
7,4927,"Finally, the average temperature of the electrode-electrolyte interface is reduced with the baffles, and it is concluded that the configuration with baffles inside the air channel (case 3) shows better results in terms of the increment of the power density and the decrement of the average temperature.",Numerical Analysis of the Effect of Trapezoidal Baffles Inside Fuel and Air Channels on the Performance of a Planar-Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4051689
