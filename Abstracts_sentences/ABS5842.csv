1,5842,"A single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell made of Ni/YSZ anodes, YSZ electrolytes and SDC-impregnated LSM cathodes was tested in methane-oxygen mixture at furnace temperature equal to 700 degrees C. Two Ag wires were arranged on the anode surface to in situ measure the changes of the local anode resistance (R(s)) during testing.",Redox of Ni/YSZ anodes and oscillatory behavior in single-chamber SOFC under methane oxidation conditions,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.05.053
2,5842,Oscillations of the R(s) the cell voltage and the actual temperature of the cell were observed and attributed to Ni/NiO redox cycles.,Redox of Ni/YSZ anodes and oscillatory behavior in single-chamber SOFC under methane oxidation conditions,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.05.053
3,5842,"Steady-state tests of the cell showed the corresponding oscillation patterns mainly depended on methane-to-oxygen ratio (M= 1, 2).",Redox of Ni/YSZ anodes and oscillatory behavior in single-chamber SOFC under methane oxidation conditions,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.05.053
4,5842,Higher current density (J) to a certain extent could suppress NiO reduction and promote Ni oxidation.,Redox of Ni/YSZ anodes and oscillatory behavior in single-chamber SOFC under methane oxidation conditions,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.05.053
5,5842,Scanning electron micrographs confirmed that Ni/NiO redox cycles had occurred mainly near the anode surface.,Redox of Ni/YSZ anodes and oscillatory behavior in single-chamber SOFC under methane oxidation conditions,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.05.053
