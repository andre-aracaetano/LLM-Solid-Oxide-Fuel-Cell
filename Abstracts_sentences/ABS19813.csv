1,19813,Twenty mol% gadolinium doped ceria powders were prepared by citrate-nitrate combustion synthesis technique.,Nanocrystalline Gadolinium Doped Ceria: Combustion Synthesis and Electrical Characterization,10.1166/jnn.2009.dk26
2,19813,Two different sources of cerium viz. cerium nitrate and ammonium ceric nitrate were used in different oxidant-to-fuel ratios.,Nanocrystalline Gadolinium Doped Ceria: Combustion Synthesis and Electrical Characterization,10.1166/jnn.2009.dk26
3,19813,The crystallite size of the synthesized powders ranged 5-27 nm was obtained depending on the preparation conditions with average particle size in the range 0.64-1.26 mu m.,Nanocrystalline Gadolinium Doped Ceria: Combustion Synthesis and Electrical Characterization,10.1166/jnn.2009.dk26
4,19813,"Although, the powders were found to be agglomerated in nature, these powders were highly sinter-active as they showed very high sintered density (>= 95%) when sintered at 1250 degrees C having grain size in the range of 200-500 nm.",Nanocrystalline Gadolinium Doped Ceria: Combustion Synthesis and Electrical Characterization,10.1166/jnn.2009.dk26
5,19813,The electrical conductivity was found to depend on the temperature with two distinct regimes at a transition point of 350 degrees C.,Nanocrystalline Gadolinium Doped Ceria: Combustion Synthesis and Electrical Characterization,10.1166/jnn.2009.dk26
6,19813,The grain boundary showed a significant role in the total conductivity with its activation energy dependent on the material preparation conditions.,Nanocrystalline Gadolinium Doped Ceria: Combustion Synthesis and Electrical Characterization,10.1166/jnn.2009.dk26
7,19813,"The activation energy of total conduction was found to be significantly low (similar to 0.5 eV) in the temperature range of 400-700 degrees C, this property is unique for application as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell operating in the low temperature range.",Nanocrystalline Gadolinium Doped Ceria: Combustion Synthesis and Electrical Characterization,10.1166/jnn.2009.dk26
8,19813,It was found that a fuel-deficient combustion reaction using cerium nitrate as the oxidant yielded the best quality powder which showed a maximum electrical conductivity of similar to 1.74 x 10(-2),Nanocrystalline Gadolinium Doped Ceria: Combustion Synthesis and Electrical Characterization,10.1166/jnn.2009.dk26
