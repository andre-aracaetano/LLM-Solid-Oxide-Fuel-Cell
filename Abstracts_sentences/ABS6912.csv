1,6912,Perovskites based on alkaline-earth containing lanthanum cobaltites exhibit high electronic and ionic conductivities but their application as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) or gas separation membranes may be limited by thermal expansion and low stability of certain compositions.,Evaluation of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O perovskites for solid oxide fuel cells and gas separation membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00394-5
2,6912,"To identify the optimum composition regime, the following three series in the system La(1-x)Sr(x)Co(1-y)Fe(y)O(3-delta) were studied: (a) La(1-x)Sr(x)CoO(3-delta), (b) La(0.3)Sr(1-y)Co(1-y)Fe(y)O(3-delta) and (c) La(1-x)Sr(x)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta).",Evaluation of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O perovskites for solid oxide fuel cells and gas separation membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00394-5
3,6912,All samples were investigated by four probe de conductivity measurements and dilatometry.,Evaluation of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O perovskites for solid oxide fuel cells and gas separation membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00394-5
4,6912,"For samples in group (a), La(1-x)Sr(x)CoO(3-delta), the conductivity at 800 degreesC increases with Sr content to a peak value at x = 0.3 and then decreases continuously.",Evaluation of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O perovskites for solid oxide fuel cells and gas separation membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00394-5
5,6912,"The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) decreases first, then increases again.",Evaluation of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O perovskites for solid oxide fuel cells and gas separation membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00394-5
6,6912,A minimum of TEC with alpha (30-1000 degreesC) = 18.5 X 10(-6) K(-1) was obtained at x = 0.2.,Evaluation of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O perovskites for solid oxide fuel cells and gas separation membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00394-5
7,6912,"For samples of series (b), both the electrical conductivity and TEC decrease with iron content.",Evaluation of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O perovskites for solid oxide fuel cells and gas separation membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00394-5
8,6912,"Even though these materials have high electronic and ionic conductivities, it is difficult to utilize them as fuel cell cathode materials because their thermal expansion is not compatible with other cell components.",Evaluation of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O perovskites for solid oxide fuel cells and gas separation membranes,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00394-5
