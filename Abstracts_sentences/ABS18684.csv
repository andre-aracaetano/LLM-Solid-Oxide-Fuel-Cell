1,18684,This study explored the decomposition mechanism of a La2NiO4 (LNO) phase in the La2NiO4-La0.5Ce0.5O2-delta (LNO-LDC) oxygen electrode in a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) after testing at 800 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy examinations of the LNO-LDC oxygen electrode before and after testing were undertaken.,Role of phosphorus impurities in decomposition of La2NiO4-La0.5Ce0.5O2-δ oxygen electrode in a solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233748

4,18684,"The evolution of the LNO phase decomposition was noted beginning with the exsolution of Ni into the surrounding LNO matrix and GBs, forming La-rich and Ni-rich phases correspondingly, in the LNO.",Role of phosphorus impurities in decomposition of La2NiO4-La0.5Ce0.5O2-δ oxygen electrode in a solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233748
5,18684,"This study illustrates a detailed decomposition progress of the LNO phase at the atomic level under an SOEC operation condition, and sheds light on how to ameliorate the fabrication process of SOECs to enhance their performance and durability.",Role of phosphorus impurities in decomposition of La2NiO4-La0.5Ce0.5O2-δ oxygen electrode in a solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233748
