1,10161,"In order to reduce concentration polarisation from the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode and the internal stress originating from the thermal expansion mismatch between the anode and electrolyte, a NiO-YSZ coating with a graded composition distribution was prepared by electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) through adjusting the electron beam currents.",Graded Ni-YSZ anode coatings for solid oxide fuel cell prepared by EB-PVD,10.1179/174328408X322196
2,10161,Then the graded Ni-YSZ coating was obtained after a reduction treatment from this NiO-YSZ coating.,Graded Ni-YSZ anode coatings for solid oxide fuel cell prepared by EB-PVD,10.1179/174328408X322196
3,10161,A graded distribution in contents of both nickel and zirconium was found in this Ni-YSZ coating from the electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) result.,Graded Ni-YSZ anode coatings for solid oxide fuel cell prepared by EB-PVD,10.1179/174328408X322196
4,10161,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation exhibited a continuous variation in porosity and pore diameter along the direction across the coating thickness.,Graded Ni-YSZ anode coatings for solid oxide fuel cell prepared by EB-PVD,10.1179/174328408X322196
5,10161,"In this coating, a high porosity of up to 43% and an average pore diameter of about 1 mm were obtained in the part close to the substrate, while a low porosity of 10% and mean pore diameters of about tens of nanometres were achieved in the part close to the coating surface.",Graded Ni-YSZ anode coatings for solid oxide fuel cell prepared by EB-PVD,10.1179/174328408X322196
6,10161,"This pore structure not only could decrease the concentration polarisation, but also facilitate the following preparation of dense electrolyte films.",Graded Ni-YSZ anode coatings for solid oxide fuel cell prepared by EB-PVD,10.1179/174328408X322196
