1,9643,The Kansai Electric Power Co. Inc. (KEPCO) and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (MMC) have been developing intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) which are operable at a temperature range between 600 and 800 degrees C.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.088
2,9643,There are some significant features in ITSOFC of KEPCO-MMC: (1) highly conductive lanthanum gallate-based oxide is adopted as an electrolyte to realize high-performance disk-type electrolyte-supported cells; (2) the cell-stacks with seal-less structure using metallic separators allow residual fuel to burn around the stack and the combustion heat is utilized for thermally self-sustainable operation; (3) the separators have flexible arms by which separate compressive forces can be applied for manifold parts and interconnection parts.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.088
3,9643,We are currently participating in the project by New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) to develop 10kW-class combined heat and power (CHP) systems.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.088
4,9643,"In FY2006, a 10kW-class module was developed, with which the electrical efficiency of 50%HHV was obtained based on DC 12.6 kW.",Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.088
5,9643,"In the first quarter of FY2007, the 10 kW-class CHP system using the module gave the electrical efficiency of 41%HHV on AC 10kW and the overall efficiency of 82%HHV when exhaust heat was recovered as 60 degrees C hot water.",Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.088
6,9643,"Currently, the operation has been accumulated for about 2500 h to evaluate the long-term stability of the system.",Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.088
