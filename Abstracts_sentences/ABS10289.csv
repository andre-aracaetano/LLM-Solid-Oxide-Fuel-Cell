1,10289,Manipulation of oxygen vacancies (V-O) in single oxide layers by varying the electric field can result in significant modulation of the ground state.,Electric-Field Control of Oxygen Vacancies and Magnetic Phase Transition in a Cobaltite/Manganite Bilayer,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044007
2,10289,"However, in many oxide multilayers with strong application potentials, e.g., ferroelectric tunnel junctions and solid-oxide fuel cells, understanding V-O behavior in various layers under an applied electric field remains a challenge, owing to complex V-O transport between different layers.",Electric-Field Control of Oxygen Vacancies and Magnetic Phase Transition in a Cobaltite/Manganite Bilayer,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044007
3,10289,"By sweeping the external voltage, a reversible manipulation of V-O and a corresponding fixed magnetic phase transition sequence in cobaltite/manganite (SrCoO3-x/La0.45Sr0.55MnO3-y) heterostructures are reported.",Electric-Field Control of Oxygen Vacancies and Magnetic Phase Transition in a Cobaltite/Manganite Bilayer,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044007
4,10289,"The magnetic phase transition sequence confirms that the priority of electric-field-induced V-O formation or annihilation in the complex bilayer system is mainly determined by the V-O formation energies and Gibbs free-energy differences, which is supported by theoretical analysis.",Electric-Field Control of Oxygen Vacancies and Magnetic Phase Transition in a Cobaltite/Manganite Bilayer,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044007
5,10289,We not only realize a reversible manipulation of the magnetic phase transition in an oxide bilayer but also provide insight into the electric-field control of V-O engineering in heterostructures.,Electric-Field Control of Oxygen Vacancies and Magnetic Phase Transition in a Cobaltite/Manganite Bilayer,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044007
