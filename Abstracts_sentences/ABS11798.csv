1,11798,"By adding 1% Bi(2)O(3) (mol%) into LSCF (La(0.54)Sr(0.44)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta)), a layer of dense LSCF film is introduced to the upside of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte.",A high performance solid oxide fuel cells operating at intermediate temperature with a modified interface between cathode and electrolyte,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.01.035
2,11798,The dense film increases the interface contact area and reduces the interface ion transfer resistance between cathode and electrolyte remarkably.,A high performance solid oxide fuel cells operating at intermediate temperature with a modified interface between cathode and electrolyte,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.01.035
3,11798,"As a result, the cell performance is greatly elevated from 492 to 901 mW cm(-2) at 650 degrees C. Besides, on the basis of careful observation of the cathode surface by FE-SEM, the function of Bi(2)O(3) to promote the cathode sintering is speculated.",A high performance solid oxide fuel cells operating at intermediate temperature with a modified interface between cathode and electrolyte,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.01.035
