5,5117,"Such micro-structured cells, which is made from commercially-available materials Ni-YSZ vertical bar YSZ vertical bar YSZ-LSM, exhibit superior performance for hydrogen (H-2) fuel cell achieving 1.62 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Similarly, excellent performance for carbon dioxide (CO2) electrolysis has been demonstrated, achieving current densities up to 6.3 (3.1) A cm(-2) under 1.8 (1.5) V at 800 degrees C. To our knowledge, such high performances are one of the highest reported values for both H-2-fuel cell and CO2 electrolysis.",High performance micro-monolithic reversible solid oxide electrochemical reactor,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228026
