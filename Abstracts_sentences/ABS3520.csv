1,3520,"Novel metal supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) containing porous 430L support, yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and porous YSZ layer are fabricated by tape casting, tape lamination and subsequent cofiring in a reduced atmosphere.",Metal supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated nanoelectrodes,10.1179/1432891714Z.000000000657
2,3520,"Nano Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta (LSF) particles, which act as anode and cathode catalysts, individually, are infiltrated onto the internal surfaces of porous 430L and YSZ respectively.",Metal supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated nanoelectrodes,10.1179/1432891714Z.000000000657
3,3520,"Maximum power density of the single cell is 850 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Encouraging performances of the infiltrated electrodes are also achieved, e.g. 0.06 Omega cm(2) for the LSF infiltrated YSZ composite cathode and 0.075 Omega cm(2) for the Ni-SDC infiltrated 430L composite anode at 800 degrees C. Additionally, oxygen reduction kinetics over infiltrated LSF-YSZ composite cathodes is also studied.",Metal supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated nanoelectrodes,10.1179/1432891714Z.000000000657
