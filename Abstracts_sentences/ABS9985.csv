2,9985,"In order to facilitate analysis and interpretation, initial studies have been carried out with a simple system in which hydrogen is used as the fuel and the liquid metal electrode is operated in a potential region where it effectively behaves as an 'inert' solvent for dissolved gases.",Mechanistic Studies of Liquid Metal Anode SOFCs II: Development of a Coulometric Titration Technique to Aid Reactor Design,10.1016/j.ces.2016.05.018
3,9985,"A model for the processes taking place in a liquid tin anode (LTA) supplied with hydrogen has previously been reported which identified a key parameter, the Dynamic Oxygen Utilisation Coefficient, (z) over bar, important for understanding the operation and design of these systems.",Mechanistic Studies of Liquid Metal Anode SOFCs II: Development of a Coulometric Titration Technique to Aid Reactor Design,10.1016/j.ces.2016.05.018
