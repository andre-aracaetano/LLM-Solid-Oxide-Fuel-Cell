2,8220,"Samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) attached with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) system, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Pycnometer and impedance spectroscopy.","Structural, chemical, and electrochemical properties of co-doped fluorite oxides Ce0.8La0.2-xTlxO2-δ as electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.044
3,8220,Dense ceramics were prepared by sintering the pellets at 1400 degrees C for 7 h. The results show that the Tl content (x) affects the properties of Ce0.8La0.2-xTlxO2-delta.,"Structural, chemical, and electrochemical properties of co-doped fluorite oxides Ce0.8La0.2-xTlxO2-δ as electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.044
4,8220,The fluorite with x = 0.07 is suggested as the most promising composition for a solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte material since it has shown to have a high electrical conductivity (3 x 10(-2) Scm(-1) at 650 degrees C) and a low activation energy (0.69 eV).,"Structural, chemical, and electrochemical properties of co-doped fluorite oxides Ce0.8La0.2-xTlxO2-δ as electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.044
5,8220,The ionic conductivity is almost stable at functional temperature (550 degrees C) for an extended period of time.,"Structural, chemical, and electrochemical properties of co-doped fluorite oxides Ce0.8La0.2-xTlxO2-δ as electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.044
6,8220,It is therefore concluded that co-doping with the appropriate amount of Tl has a great potential to become a new important electrolyte for commercial IT-SOFCs.,"Structural, chemical, and electrochemical properties of co-doped fluorite oxides Ce0.8La0.2-xTlxO2-δ as electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.044
