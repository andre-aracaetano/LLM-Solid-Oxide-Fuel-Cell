1,18117,La4BaCu5-xMnxO13+delta materials have been synthesized by the sol-gel method in air and studied as possible electrode materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (S-SOFC).,Study of La4BaCu5-xMnxO13+δ materials as potential electrode for symmetrical-SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115031
2,18117,"Within the series, La4BaMn5O13+delta (LBMn) exhibits an excellent stability in reducing atmosphere and remarkable redox stability, although a structure transition from rhombohedral to cubic perovskite structure is found beyond 500 degrees C in air or wet diluted hydrogen.",Study of La4BaCu5-xMnxO13+δ materials as potential electrode for symmetrical-SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115031
3,18117,"The thermal expansion coefficients (TEC), deduced from HT-XRD study during redox cycling, make the manganite compatible with classical SOFC electrolytes at low temperature; however, relatively high values of 15.8(5) and 18.1(2) K-1 are found in cathode and anode conditions for T > 500 degrees C. With high electrical conductivities of 178 and 33.3 S cm(-1), in air and hydrogen at 800 degrees C, we demonstrate that the La0.8Ba0.2MnO3 +/-delta manganite fulfils all the preliminary requirements of an electrode material for symmetrical SOFC.",Study of La4BaCu5-xMnxO13+δ materials as potential electrode for symmetrical-SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115031
