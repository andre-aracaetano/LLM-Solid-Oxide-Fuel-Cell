1,993,"The detection and quantification of small quantities of Cr in (La,Sr)MnO3/Y-ZrO2 solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) is not straightforward as Cr X-ray emission lines overlap with La/Mn and 0 lines.",Rapid chromium quantification in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2010.06.046
2,993,This work proposes an empirical law correlating the La peak height ratio L-beta 2.15/L-alpha 1 to Cr concentrations determined on Cr-doped LSM-YSZ samples characterized by EDXS.,Rapid chromium quantification in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2010.06.046
