5,11910,"Sr2Co1.5Mo0.5O6 - delta has an area-specific polarization resistance (ASR) as low as 0.030 Q cm(2) in a symmetrical cell at 800 degrees C. First-principles calculations found that the sequence of the oxygen vacancy formation energy was Co-O*-Co < Co-O*-Mo, indicating that Co-doping facilitates formation of oxygen vacancy, which coincides well with experimental results.",Co-incorporating enhancement on oxygen vacancy formation energy and electrochemical property of Sr2Co1+ xMo1 - xO6 - δ cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.12.015
