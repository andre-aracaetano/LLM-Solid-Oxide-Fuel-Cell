1,6624,The widespread application of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells is mainly being hurdled by the cathode's low efficiency on oxygen reduction reaction and poor resistance to carbon dioxide impurity.,Hierarchical CO2-protective shell for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction,10.1038/srep00327
2,6624,Here we report the fabrication of a hierarchical shell-covered porous cathode through infiltration followed by microwave plasma treatment.,Hierarchical CO2-protective shell for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction,10.1038/srep00327
3,6624,"The hierarchical shell consists of a dense thin-film substrate with cones on the top of the substrate, leading to a three-dimensional (3D) heterostructured electrode.",Hierarchical CO2-protective shell for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction,10.1038/srep00327
4,6624,"The shell allows the cathode working stably in CO2-containing air, and significantly improving the cathode's oxygen reduction reactivity with an area specific resistance of similar to 0.13 Omega cm(2) at 575 degrees C.",Hierarchical CO2-protective shell for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction,10.1038/srep00327
