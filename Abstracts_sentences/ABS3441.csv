1,3441,"Based on the first principle total energy calculation method, the structural stability, electronic performance as well as mechanical properties of the 3rd-6th period metals and their oxides, potential to be used as anode material for solid oxide fuel cells, were studied.",Optimization Rule of Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
2,3441,"Considering anode working condition (high temperature and reduction atmosphere), transformation of anode structure and its performance were analyzed, and the tendencies of bulk modulus and band gap of metal/oxide were obtained.",Optimization Rule of Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
3,3441,"The results indicated that the metal/oxides stabilized in middle area of the formation tendency diagram would be easy to take part in oxidation/reduction reactions, and therefore suitable for anode working environment.",Optimization Rule of Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
4,3441,"The element which was close to metal region could introduce electronic conduction and improve the catalytic performance, while the ones near the oxides region could enhance the anode stability.",Optimization Rule of Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
5,3441,These results may benefit for selection of anode materials according to various anode working conditions.,Optimization Rule of Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
