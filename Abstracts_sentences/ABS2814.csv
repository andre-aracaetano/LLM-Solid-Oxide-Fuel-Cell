1,2814,The performance and the long-term operating properties of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using BaCeO0.8GdO0.2O3-alpha (BCG) ceramics as the electrolyte have been investigated.,Operating properties of solid oxide fuel cells using BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3-alpha electrolyte,10.1149/1.1836920
2,2814,A hydrogen-air fuel cell using BCG electrolyte with a thickness of 0.5 mm exhibited good performance at 800 degrees C.,Operating properties of solid oxide fuel cells using BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3-alpha electrolyte,10.1149/1.1836920
3,2814,"Its short-circuit current was 0.9 A cm(-2), and there was hardly any degradation of BCG electrolyte in 1600 h of operation.",Operating properties of solid oxide fuel cells using BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3-alpha electrolyte,10.1149/1.1836920
4,2814,"When a quasi-fuel gas containing 8% CO2, which was expected by the reformation of the city gas (CH4) at 800 degrees C, was supplied to this cell, its short-circuit current was 0.63 A cm(-2) and the cell worked stably under the discharge current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for 2500 h. Some sintered metals (Fe, Co, Ni) were examined as a anode material for this electrolyte.",Operating properties of solid oxide fuel cells using BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3-alpha electrolyte,10.1149/1.1836920
5,2814,Ni is a promising anode material for BCG electrolyte from the point of view of performance and durability.,Operating properties of solid oxide fuel cells using BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3-alpha electrolyte,10.1149/1.1836920
