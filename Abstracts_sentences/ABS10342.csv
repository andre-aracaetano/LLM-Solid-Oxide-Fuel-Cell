3,10342,YSZ and BCS coatings on SDC substrates were obtained by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) followed by sintering at 1300-1500 & DEG;C. Two methods are applied to ensure surface conductivity of the SDC substrates for successful EPD: by synthesizing a conducting polymer polypyrrole and by depositing a buffer layer of finely dispersed Pt.,Electrophoretic deposition of dense anode barrier layers of doped ZrO2 and BaCeO3 on a supporting Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-d solid electrolyte: Problems and search for solutions in SOFC technology,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.02.042

5,10342,It is shown that the use of a Pt buffer sublayer makes it possible to avoid delamination during sintering at a temperature of 1500 & DEG;C. The BCS barrier layers are shown to be completely compatible with SDC.,Electrophoretic deposition of dense anode barrier layers of doped ZrO2 and BaCeO3 on a supporting Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-d solid electrolyte: Problems and search for solutions in SOFC technology,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.02.042
6,10342,The influence of the YSZ and BCS barrier layers on the ohmic and polarization resistance values and the open circuit voltage (OCV) values is discussed. & COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.,Electrophoretic deposition of dense anode barrier layers of doped ZrO2 and BaCeO3 on a supporting Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-d solid electrolyte: Problems and search for solutions in SOFC technology,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.02.042
