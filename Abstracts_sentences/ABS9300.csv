1,9300,Use of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) as an anode in solid oxide fuel cells has attracted considerable research attention because of its excellent thermal stability.,Preparation of Mesoporous SrTiO3 Particles by Spray Pyrolysis Method,10.1166/jnn.2017.13061
2,9300,"Mesoporous SrTiO3 increases the specific surface area for fuel cell reaction, which in turn increases the fuel-to-electricity conversion efficiency.",Preparation of Mesoporous SrTiO3 Particles by Spray Pyrolysis Method,10.1166/jnn.2017.13061
3,9300,Spray pyrolysis (SP) is advantageous because it entails short processing times and continuous production.,Preparation of Mesoporous SrTiO3 Particles by Spray Pyrolysis Method,10.1166/jnn.2017.13061
4,9300,"In this study, we prepared mesoporous SrTiO3 particles through SP.",Preparation of Mesoporous SrTiO3 Particles by Spray Pyrolysis Method,10.1166/jnn.2017.13061
5,9300,"Because surfactants, as pore forming agents, may aggregate and reduce the specific surface area of particles, the stable surfactant concentration range was investigated.",Preparation of Mesoporous SrTiO3 Particles by Spray Pyrolysis Method,10.1166/jnn.2017.13061
6,9300,"In addition, the short calcination time of SP may cause incomplete decomposition and thus generate an unreacted phase; therefore, various calcination temperatures and an additional wash treatment were explored.",Preparation of Mesoporous SrTiO3 Particles by Spray Pyrolysis Method,10.1166/jnn.2017.13061
7,9300,"Finally, SrTiO3 powder with the high specific surface area of 103 m(2)/g was obtained.",Preparation of Mesoporous SrTiO3 Particles by Spray Pyrolysis Method,10.1166/jnn.2017.13061
