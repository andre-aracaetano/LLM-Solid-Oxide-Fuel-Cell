2,1755,"Initially, the Rolls Royce Fuel Cell IP-SOFC (Integrated Planar SOFC) single tube was investigated.",Cycling studies of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.060
3,1755,The objective was to cycle up to 100 times to check if degradation was occurring and to assess its extent.,Cycling studies of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.060
4,1755,In this paper the results of loading cycles at nominally constant operating temperature are reported.,Cycling studies of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.060
5,1755,"Work on two other kinds of cycles, i.e. thermal and redox, for this type of tube has commenced and the results will be reported in the follow-up paper.",Cycling studies of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.060
