1,8478,A composite Ni-Y doped ZrO2 (YSZ) composite was prepared by depositing a 1- 50 mu m thick coating of YSZ particles from a colloidal suspension (initial YSZ particle size similar to 100 nm) onto a sapphire substrate followed by impregnation by Ni polymer precursors into the coating and annealing at 800 degrees C.,Low-temperature processed anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1928237
2,8478,The electrical conductivity at 700 degrees C of the composite Ni-YSZ was 0.1 S cm(-)1 in air and above 100 S cm(-1) in reducing atmosphere.,Low-temperature processed anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1928237
3,8478,Redox cycle and life time testing showed stable performance and the conductivity at 800 degrees C was as high as 300 S cm(-1) after 800 h operation in reducing atmosphere.,Low-temperature processed anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1928237
4,8478,These results suggest that the Ni- YSZ composite can be a potential candidate for use as an anode in solid oxide fuel cells.,Low-temperature processed anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1928237
