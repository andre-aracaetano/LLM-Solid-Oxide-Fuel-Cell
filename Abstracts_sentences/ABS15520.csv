1,15520,The full oxidation of Ni-YSZ anode-supported cells at high temperatures (>700 degrees C) is shown here to lead to much more severe degradation (larger quantity and wider cracks in the electrolyte) than at lower temperatures.,Crack severity in relation to non-homogeneous Ni oxidation in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.002
2,15520,"This correlates with the linear mass gain/time profile observed in TGA experiments at high temperatures, indicative of diffusion controlled Ni oxidation and thus the presence of O-2 (and Ni/NiO) concentration gradients into the depth of the anode layer.",Crack severity in relation to non-homogeneous Ni oxidation in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.002
3,15520,"At low partial pressures of O-2, the severity of cracking also increases.",Crack severity in relation to non-homogeneous Ni oxidation in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.002
4,15520,"SEM studies of partially oxidized anode layers confirmed that Ni oxidation is non-homogeneous when carried out at either high temperatures or low pO(2), in which case the outer regions of the anode (near the anode/air interface) become almost fully oxidized, while the inner regions (near the electrolyte) remain metallic.",Crack severity in relation to non-homogeneous Ni oxidation in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.002
5,15520,"Under these conditions, the continued volume expansion associated with NiO formation can then only occur towards the electrolyte, increasing the compressive stress inside the anode as the Ni continues to be oxidized, leading to electrolyte cracking and warping (convex to the electrolyte).",Crack severity in relation to non-homogeneous Ni oxidation in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.002
6,15520,"To prevent severe degradation to the cell, efforts should therefore be made to avoid gradients in NiO/Ni content during oxygen exposure of Ni-YSZ anode-supported cells at high temperatures.",Crack severity in relation to non-homogeneous Ni oxidation in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.002
