1,15257,"By placing a galvanic-type steam sensor on the fuel electrode of a solid oxide fuel cell, water vapour pressure in the anode during discharge was successfully measured.",THE MEASUREMENT OF WATER-VAPOR PRESSURE IN AN SOFC ANODE DURING DISCHARGE,10.1007/BF00296681
2,15257,"The change in steam concentration in the anode, which was calculated from the e.m.f. of the sensor, was compared with the variation of anodic overvoltage measured by the usual d.c. interruption method.",THE MEASUREMENT OF WATER-VAPOR PRESSURE IN AN SOFC ANODE DURING DISCHARGE,10.1007/BF00296681
3,15257,"As a result, the water vapour pressure was confirmed to increase as the discharge current increased, and most of the anodic overvoltage could be ascribed to the hydrogen concentration overvoltage.",THE MEASUREMENT OF WATER-VAPOR PRESSURE IN AN SOFC ANODE DURING DISCHARGE,10.1007/BF00296681
