2,463,"In this study, a new p-n semiconductor heterojunction of NaCrO2-CeO2 is proposed as a potential electrolyte for IT-SOFC, which exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 0.173 S center dot cm(-1) and power density of 627.5 mW center dot cm(-2) at 600 degrees C. A substantial number of oxygen vacancies are revealed in the NaCrO2-CeO2 heterostructure, with protons as the primary charge carriers.",A p-n heterostructure composite of NaCrO2 and CeO2 for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.171169
