1,18865,Electricity storage is needed on an unprecedented scale to sustain the ongoing transition of electricity generation from fossil fuels to intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.,Large-scale electricity storage utilizing reversible solid oxide cells combined with underground storage of CO2 and CH4,10.1039/c5ee01485a
2,18865,"Today pumped hydro is the only commercially viable large-scale electricity storage technology, but unfortunately it is limited to mountainous regions and therefore difficult to expand.",Large-scale electricity storage utilizing reversible solid oxide cells combined with underground storage of CO2 and CH4,10.1039/c5ee01485a
3,18865,"Emerging technologies like adiabatic compressed air energy storage (ACAES) or storage using conventional power-to-gas (P2G) technology combined with underground gas storage can be more widely deployed, but unfortunately for long-term to seasonal periods these technologies are either very expensive or provide a very low round-trip efficiency.",Large-scale electricity storage utilizing reversible solid oxide cells combined with underground storage of CO2 and CH4,10.1039/c5ee01485a
4,18865,"Here we describe a novel storage method combining recent advances in reversible solid oxide electrochemical cells with sub-surface storage of CO2 and CH4, thereby enabling large-scale electricity storage with a round-trip efficiency exceeding 70% and an estimated storage cost around 3 (sic) kW(-1) h(-1), i.e., comparable to pumped hydro and much better than previously proposed technologies.",Large-scale electricity storage utilizing reversible solid oxide cells combined with underground storage of CO2 and CH4,10.1039/c5ee01485a
