5,1544,"Inkjet printing allows depositing nanostructured particles of LSM on Y-doped BaZrO3 (BZY) backbones as cathodes for proton-conducting SOFCs, which provides one of the highest power output for the BZY-based fuel cells below 600 degrees C.",Nanostructuring the electronic conducting La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode for high-performance in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells below 600°C,10.1007/s40843-017-9125-1
6,1544,This somehow changes the common knowledge that LSM can be applied as a SOFC cathode materials only at high temperatures (above 700 degrees C).,Nanostructuring the electronic conducting La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode for high-performance in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells below 600°C,10.1007/s40843-017-9125-1
