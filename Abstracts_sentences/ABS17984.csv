1,17984,"To develop higher protonic conductivity, we have been studying a new perovskite-type oxide and found that BaPrO3 based perovskite oxides showed high conductivity in a moist H-2 atmosphere.",Conductivity of BaPrO3 based perovskite oxides,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02813-9
2,17984,"Their conductivity was about 0.1 S/cm at a temperature of 500 degrees C and remained almost constant up to 700 degrees C, which is much higher than that of Ba(Ce0.8Gd0.2)O3-alpha.Ba(Pr1-xGdx)O3-alpha prepared by solid state reaction exhibited an orthorhombic and/or cubic perovskite structure and with a high Gd content was stable in a reducing atmosphere.",Conductivity of BaPrO3 based perovskite oxides,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02813-9
3,17984,"When Ba(Pr0.7Gd0.3)O3-alpha was used as an electrolyte, the open circuit voltage of the cell was about 1 V and this cell was able to operate at 500 degrees C.",Conductivity of BaPrO3 based perovskite oxides,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02813-9
