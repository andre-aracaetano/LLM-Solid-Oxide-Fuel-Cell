1,9325,"Here we report a photonic annealing process for yttria-stabilized zirconia films, which are one of the most well-known solid-state electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Rapid, cool sintering of wet processed yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic electrolyte thin films",10.1038/s41598-017-12438-9
2,9325,Precursor films were coated using a wet-chemical method with a simple metal-organic precursor solution and directly annealed at standard pressure and temperature by two cycles of xenon flash lamp irradiation.,"Rapid, cool sintering of wet processed yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic electrolyte thin films",10.1038/s41598-017-12438-9
3,9325,"The residual organics were almost completely decomposed in the first pre-annealing step, and the fluorite crystalline phases and good ionic conductivity were developed during the second annealing step.","Rapid, cool sintering of wet processed yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic electrolyte thin films",10.1038/s41598-017-12438-9
4,9325,These films showed properties comparable to those of thermally annealed films.,"Rapid, cool sintering of wet processed yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic electrolyte thin films",10.1038/s41598-017-12438-9
5,9325,"This process is much faster than conventional annealing processes (e.g. halogen furnaces); a few seconds compared to tens of hours, respectively.","Rapid, cool sintering of wet processed yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic electrolyte thin films",10.1038/s41598-017-12438-9
6,9325,The significance of this work includes the treatment of solid-state electrolyte oxides for SOFCs and the demonstration of the feasibility of other oxide components for solid-state energy devices.,"Rapid, cool sintering of wet processed yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic electrolyte thin films",10.1038/s41598-017-12438-9
