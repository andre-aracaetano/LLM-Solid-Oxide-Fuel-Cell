1,17330,"Single-crystalline epitaxial thin films of PrBaCo2O5.5+delta (PrBCO) were prepared, and their resistance R(t) under a switching flow of oxidizing and reducing gases were measured as a function of the gas flow time t in the temperature range of 200-800 degrees C.",Atomically layer-by-layer diffusion of oxygen/hydrogen in highly epitaxial PrBaCo2O5.5+δ thin films,10.1063/1.4937926
2,17330,"During the oxidation cycle under O-2, the PrBCO films exhibit fast oscillations in their dR(t)/dt vs. t plots, which reflect the oxidation processes, Co2+/Co3+ -> Co3+ and Co3+ -> Co3+/Co4+, that the Co atoms of PrBCO undergo.",Atomically layer-by-layer diffusion of oxygen/hydrogen in highly epitaxial PrBaCo2O5.5+δ thin films,10.1063/1.4937926
3,17330,"Each oscillation consists of two peaks, with larger and smaller peaks representing the oxygen/hydrogen diffusion through the (BaO)(CoO2)(PrO)(CoO2) layers of PrBCO via the oxygen-vacancy-exchange mechanism.",Atomically layer-by-layer diffusion of oxygen/hydrogen in highly epitaxial PrBaCo2O5.5+δ thin films,10.1063/1.4937926
4,17330,This finding paves a significant avenue for cathode materials operating in low-temperature solid-oxide-fuel-cell devices and for chemical sensors with wide range of operating temperature.,Atomically layer-by-layer diffusion of oxygen/hydrogen in highly epitaxial PrBaCo2O5.5+δ thin films,10.1063/1.4937926
