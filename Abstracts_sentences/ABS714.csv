1,714,"A series of (1-x) CuFe2O4-xGd(0.1)Ce(0.9)O(1.95) (GDC) (x = 50, 60, 70 wt%) composites are synthesized by the mechanical mixing method and calcination, as cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells.",Exploring (1-x) CuFe2O4-xGd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 composites as the cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132860
2,714,"All composites display the excellent chemical compatibility between CuFe2O4 and GDC, where 40CuFe(2)O(4)-60GDC cathode has the lowest polarization resistance of 1.17 Omega center dot cm(2) and largest power density of 384 mW.cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Introduction of the GDC phase brings a significant increase in triple phase boundaries and dramatically enhances the oxygen reduction reaction kinetics.",Exploring (1-x) CuFe2O4-xGd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 composites as the cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132860
3,714,It is reasonable to believe that CuFe2O4-GDC composite is a potential candidate cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells.,Exploring (1-x) CuFe2O4-xGd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 composites as the cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.132860
