2,9909,"The tool combines the versatility and efficiency of a commercial finite element analysis code, MARC((R)), with an in-house developed robust and flexible electrochemical (EC) module.","A finite element analysis modeling tool for solid oxide fuel cell development:: coupled electrochemistry, thermal and flow analysis in MARC®",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.074
3,9909,"Based upon characteristic parameters obtained experimentally and assigned by the user, the EC module calculates the current density distribution, heat generation, and fuel and oxidant species concentration, taking the temperature profile provided by MARC((R)) and operating conditions such as the fuel and oxidant flow rate and the total stack output voltage or current as the input.","A finite element analysis modeling tool for solid oxide fuel cell development:: coupled electrochemistry, thermal and flow analysis in MARC®",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.074
4,9909,MARC((R)) performs flow and thermal analyses based on the initial and boundary thermal and flow conditions and the heat generation calculated by the EC module.,"A finite element analysis modeling tool for solid oxide fuel cell development:: coupled electrochemistry, thermal and flow analysis in MARC®",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.074
5,9909,The main coupling between MARC((R)) and EC is for MARC((R)) to supply the temperature field to EC and for EC to give the heat generation profile to MARC((R)).,"A finite element analysis modeling tool for solid oxide fuel cell development:: coupled electrochemistry, thermal and flow analysis in MARC®",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.074
6,9909,"The loosely coupled, iterative scheme is advantageous in terms of memory requirement, numerical stability and computational efficiency.","A finite element analysis modeling tool for solid oxide fuel cell development:: coupled electrochemistry, thermal and flow analysis in MARC®",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.074
7,9909,The coupling is iterated to self-consistency for a steady-state solution.,"A finite element analysis modeling tool for solid oxide fuel cell development:: coupled electrochemistry, thermal and flow analysis in MARC®",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.074
8,9909,Sample results for steady states as well as the startup process for stacks with different flow designs are presented to illustrate the modeling capability and numerical performance characteristic of the simulation tool.,"A finite element analysis modeling tool for solid oxide fuel cell development:: coupled electrochemistry, thermal and flow analysis in MARC®",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.074
