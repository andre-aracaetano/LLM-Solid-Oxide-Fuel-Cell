1,13636,"Chromium poisoning phenomena of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were investigated using (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 (LSM), Pr0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (PrSM), Nd0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (NdSM), and Br0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF) for the cathode materials and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte material at 700 degrees C under constant cathode polarization conditions.",Comparison of chromium poisoning among solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.01.047
2,13636,"Deposition of chromium increased with increasing cathode polarization similarly for the four cathodes, although position of the deposition was different for the BSCF cathode.",Comparison of chromium poisoning among solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.01.047
3,13636,"Chromium deposited near the cathode/electrolyte interface for the LSM cathode, the PrSM cathode and the NdSM cathode.",Comparison of chromium poisoning among solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.01.047
4,13636,Chromium deposition on the surface of the zirconia electrolyte was observed for the PrSM cathode and the NdSM cathode as previously observed in the LSM cathode.,Comparison of chromium poisoning among solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.01.047
5,13636,"Oxygen deficiency in the deposited chromium on the surface of the zirconia electrolyte was also observed, thus the reaction mechanism of chromium vapor with the oxygen vacancy induced by cathode polarization was supported.",Comparison of chromium poisoning among solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.01.047
6,13636,The oxygen vacancy on the surface of the zirconia electrolyte seemed to be generated via metal oxides such as manganese oxide or neodymium oxide segregated from the cathode materials.,Comparison of chromium poisoning among solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.01.047

8,13636,Cathode polarization seems to increase reactivity of BSCF and enhance trapping of chromium vapor near the cathode surface.,Comparison of chromium poisoning among solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.01.047
