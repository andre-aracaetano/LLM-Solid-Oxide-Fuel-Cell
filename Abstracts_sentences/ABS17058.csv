2,17058,"SOFC FSS interconnects are used to stack individual cells into series, and are simultaneously exposed to air on the cathode side and fuel on the anode side, creating a dual atmosphere exposure.",Oxidation behavior of stainless steel 430 and 441 at 800°C in single (air/air) and dual atmosphere (air/hydrogen) exposures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.067
3,17058,The thermally grown oxide (TGO) layers on the air side of FSSs 430 and 441 were analyzed as a function of simulated dual atmosphere exposures (moist air/moist hydrogen) for up to 300h.,Oxidation behavior of stainless steel 430 and 441 at 800°C in single (air/air) and dual atmosphere (air/hydrogen) exposures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.067
4,17058,"FSS 430 showed some changes in oxidation behavior, with a slight Fe concentration increase and localized Fe2O3 nodule formation observed in the dual atmosphere TGO layer relative to its single atmosphere (air/air) counterpart.",Oxidation behavior of stainless steel 430 and 441 at 800°C in single (air/air) and dual atmosphere (air/hydrogen) exposures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.067
5,17058,Significantly accelerated and anomalous oxidation was observed with FSS 441 subjected to dual atmosphere exposures compared with air/air exposures.,Oxidation behavior of stainless steel 430 and 441 at 800°C in single (air/air) and dual atmosphere (air/hydrogen) exposures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.067
6,17058,"The TGO layer formed on the 441 exposed to air/air was comprised of Mn-rich, Cr and Fe-containing isomorphic spinel surface crystallites, with a Cr2O3 (eskolaite) -based bottom layer, having a total TGO layer thickness of < 2 mu m after 300 h.",Oxidation behavior of stainless steel 430 and 441 at 800°C in single (air/air) and dual atmosphere (air/hydrogen) exposures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.067
7,17058,"In contrast, the TGO layer formed on 441 during dual atmosphere exposure was much faster-growing (> 6 mu m in 20h) and exhibited a continuous, porous Fe2O3-rich surface layer with a relatively thin (< 2 mu m) sublayer of similar composition to the TGO layer formed during the air/air exposure.",Oxidation behavior of stainless steel 430 and 441 at 800°C in single (air/air) and dual atmosphere (air/hydrogen) exposures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.067
