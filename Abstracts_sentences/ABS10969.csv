1,10969,Sulfur poisoning is a crucial problem for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode leading to increasing research works on the development of the anode materials with high sulfur tolerance.,A theoretical study of sulfur poisoning tolerance at the interface of Mo doped Ni/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.199
2,10969,"By the first principle calculations of hydrogen sulfide dissociation and sulfur atoms diffusion at the interface between the Ni or Mo-doped-nickel and Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ), we find that Mo-doped-Ni/YSZ anode not only increases the hydrogen sulfide dissociation barriers, but also increases the barriers of the sulfur diffusion to the oxygen vacancy at the interface of Ni and YSZ, especially for YSZ in oxygen enriched conditions.",A theoretical study of sulfur poisoning tolerance at the interface of Mo doped Ni/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.199
