1,10286,"Lanthanum nickelates with Ruddlesden-Popper structure (La2NiO4, La3Ni2O7, and La4Ni3O10) and perovskite structure (LaNiO3) have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications such as solid oxide fuel cells.","Preparation of pure and fully dense lanthanum nickelates Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=2, 3, ∞) by post-sintering oxidation process",10.1111/jace.16611
2,10286,"Currently, the ionic and electronic conduction properties of La3Ni2O7, La4Ni3O10, and LaNiO3 are not fully understood because it is quite difficult to prepare their dense bodies required for the characterization.","Preparation of pure and fully dense lanthanum nickelates Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=2, 3, ∞) by post-sintering oxidation process",10.1111/jace.16611
3,10286,The difficulty arises from their narrow thermodynamic stable temperature and oxygen partial pressure ranges.,"Preparation of pure and fully dense lanthanum nickelates Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=2, 3, ∞) by post-sintering oxidation process",10.1111/jace.16611
