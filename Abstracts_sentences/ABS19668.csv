1,19668,"With the assumption that the Fermi level (electrochemical potential of electrons) is uniform across the thickness of a mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) electrode, the charge-transport model in the electrode domain can be reduced to the modified Fick's first law, which includes a thermodynamic factor A. A transient numerical solution of the Nernst-Planck theory was obtained for a symmetric cell with MIEC electrodes to illustrate the validity of the assumption of a uniform Fermi level.",Simulating Charge Transport in Solid Oxide Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors: Nernst-Planck Theory vs Modified Fick's Law,10.1149/2.0941613jes
2,19668,"Subsequently, an impedance numerical solution based on the modified Fick's first law is compared with that from the Nernst-Planck theory.",Simulating Charge Transport in Solid Oxide Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors: Nernst-Planck Theory vs Modified Fick's Law,10.1149/2.0941613jes
3,19668,The results show that Nernst-Planck charge-transport model is essentially the same as the modified Fick's first law model as long as the MIEC electrodes have a predominant electronic conductivity.,Simulating Charge Transport in Solid Oxide Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors: Nernst-Planck Theory vs Modified Fick's Law,10.1149/2.0941613jes
4,19668,"However, because of the invalidity of the uniform Fermi level assumption for a MIEC electrolyte with a predominant ionic conductivity, Nernst-Planck theory is needed to describe the charge transport behaviors.",Simulating Charge Transport in Solid Oxide Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors: Nernst-Planck Theory vs Modified Fick's Law,10.1149/2.0941613jes
