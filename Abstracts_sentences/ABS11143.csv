1,11143,"in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction and thermal gravimetric-differential thermal analysis on room-temperature powder, as well as X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy on quenched powder, were applied to study crystal structure and phase transformations in Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-x (BBSC).",Deactivation and Regeneration of Oxygen Reduction Reactivity on Double Perovskite Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-x Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm103534x
2,11143,"Heating BBSC in air to over 800 degrees C produces a pure cubic phase with space group Fm (3) over barm (no. 225), and cooling down below 800 degrees C leads to a mixture of three noncubic phases including an unknown phase between 200 and 650 degrees C, a 2H hexagonal BaCoO3 with space group P63/mmc (no. 194) between 600 and 800 degrees C, and an intermediate phase at 800 degrees C. These three phases exist concurrently with the major cubic phase.",Deactivation and Regeneration of Oxygen Reduction Reactivity on Double Perovskite Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-x Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm103534x

4,11143,The thermal expansion of BBSC was also examined by dilatometry.,Deactivation and Regeneration of Oxygen Reduction Reactivity on Double Perovskite Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-x Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm103534x
5,11143,BBSC has a highly temperature-dependent thermal expansion coefficient which relates well with its structure evolution.,Deactivation and Regeneration of Oxygen Reduction Reactivity on Double Perovskite Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-x Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm103534x

7,11143,The presence of hexagonal phase at 700 degrees C rarely affects the ORR performance of BBSC as evidenced by a slight increase of its area-specific resistance (ASR) value following 48 h of testing in this three-electrode configuration.,Deactivation and Regeneration of Oxygen Reduction Reactivity on Double Perovskite Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-x Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm103534x
8,11143,This observation is in contrast to the commonly held point of view that noncubic phase deteriorates performance of perovskite compounds (especially in oxygen transport applications).,Deactivation and Regeneration of Oxygen Reduction Reactivity on Double Perovskite Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-x Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm103534x

10,11143,The cubic structure seems to be retained on the cathodic polarization-the normal cathode operating mode in fuel cells.,Deactivation and Regeneration of Oxygen Reduction Reactivity on Double Perovskite Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-x Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm103534x
11,11143,"Stable 72-h performance of BBSC in cathodic polarization mode further confirms that despite the presence of phase impurities, BBSC still demonstrates good performance between 500 and 700 degrees C, the desired intermediate operating temperature in solid oxide fuel cells.",Deactivation and Regeneration of Oxygen Reduction Reactivity on Double Perovskite Ba2Bi0.1Sc0.2Co1.7O6-x Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm103534x
