2,14874,"During 100 h tests performed in flowing air (3% H2O) at 1023 K, the electrochemical performance of LSM/yttria doped zirconia (YSZ)/Pt half-cells exhibited a relatively faster degradation in current (I-t) at 0.5 V applied bias than the LSCF/gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC)/Pt half-cells.",Experimental and thermodynamic evaluation of La1-xSrxMnO3±δ and La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ cathodes in Cr-containing humidified air,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.040

6,14874,A linear programming approach coupled with first-principles thermodynamics suggests that the stoichiometric LSM remains stable and unreacted for the whole range of experimental P-CrO3 and temperature conditions whereas the formation of SrCrO4 on LSC cathode is energetically favored at 1023 K supporting the experimental findings.,Experimental and thermodynamic evaluation of La1-xSrxMnO3±δ and La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ cathodes in Cr-containing humidified air,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.040
