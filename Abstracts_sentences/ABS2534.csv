1,2534,"The state-of-the-art solid oxide fuel cell called the air electrode supported-solid oxide fuel cell (AES-SOFC), developed by Westinghouse, has shown substantially improved performance and reliability over the previous zirconia porous support tube (PST) design, This latest generation of cells has demonstrated the ability to thermally cycle over 100 times without any performance loss.",Performance and reliability of Westinghouse's air electrode supported solid oxide fuel cell at atmospheric and elevated pressures,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.602
2,2534,The AES-SOFC has also demonstrated the ability to operate in cell bundles (3 x 6) under generator conditions for over 6300 hours without any performance degradation.,Performance and reliability of Westinghouse's air electrode supported solid oxide fuel cell at atmospheric and elevated pressures,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.602
3,2534,The number of Electrochemical Vapor Deposition (EVD) steps used in the manufacturing of AES-SOFCs has been reduced from three to two in production and from three to one in the laboratory resulting in significant manufacturing cost reductions.,Performance and reliability of Westinghouse's air electrode supported solid oxide fuel cell at atmospheric and elevated pressures,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.602
4,2534,The focus of this paper is to describe the performance and reliability of this latest generation of cells under a variety of generator operating conditions.,Performance and reliability of Westinghouse's air electrode supported solid oxide fuel cell at atmospheric and elevated pressures,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.602
