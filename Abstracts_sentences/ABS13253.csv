1,13253,"Three compositions of SrO doped LaCrO3 (LSC) namely La1-xSrxCrO3 (x=0.05, 0.15 and 0.30) were synthesized by a novel microwave assisted technique and the thermodynamic activity of SrO (a(SrO)) in LSC for the three compositions was measured as a function of temperature over the range 890-1100 K by employing a solid electrolyte emf technique with SrF2 as the electrolyte.","Microwave assisted synthesis of La1-xSrxCrO3 (x=0.05, 0.15 and 0.30) and their thermodynamic characterization by fluoride emf method",10.1016/S0925-8388(03)00003-3

3,13253,"The SrO potential, DeltaG(SrO) and a(SrO) for the solid solutions were computed and these values were used to evaluate the compatibility of LSC with the other components of solid oxide fuel cells.","Microwave assisted synthesis of La1-xSrxCrO3 (x=0.05, 0.15 and 0.30) and their thermodynamic characterization by fluoride emf method",10.1016/S0925-8388(03)00003-3
4,13253,"The DeltaG(SrO) for these compositions could be represented as -131.6+0.05047T for 0.05 LSC, -85.2+0.01124T for 0.15 LSC and -66.7+0.00339T for 0.30 LSC in terms of kJ mol(-1).","Microwave assisted synthesis of La1-xSrxCrO3 (x=0.05, 0.15 and 0.30) and their thermodynamic characterization by fluoride emf method",10.1016/S0925-8388(03)00003-3
5,13253,The SrO potential thus seem to increase with increasing SrO content as expected.,"Microwave assisted synthesis of La1-xSrxCrO3 (x=0.05, 0.15 and 0.30) and their thermodynamic characterization by fluoride emf method",10.1016/S0925-8388(03)00003-3
