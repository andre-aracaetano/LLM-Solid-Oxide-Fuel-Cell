1,10124,Atomized silver spheres (approximate to 20-50 lint diameter) were coated with I mu m thick layers of (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.98)Co0.2Fe0.8O3 or SMO.5Sro.5CO03 via a mechanofusion dry processing method.,Silver-perovskite composite SOFC cathodes processed via mechanofusion,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.029
2,10124,The materials were subsequently assessed as solid oxide fuel cell cathodes on anode-supported YSZ electrolytes at 650-750 degrees C.,Silver-perovskite composite SOFC cathodes processed via mechanofusion,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.029
3,10124,"The materials were subject to significant electrochemical conditioning during initial cell operation, and factors, such as temperature and operating voltage, affecting the conditioning rate are discussed.",Silver-perovskite composite SOFC cathodes processed via mechanofusion,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.029
4,10124,"Post-conditioned power densities (at 0.7 V) were typically 550-650, 400-450 and 300-350 mW cm(-2) at 750, 700 and 650 degrees C, respectively.",Silver-perovskite composite SOFC cathodes processed via mechanofusion,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.029
5,10124,"Though power degradation rates of approximate to 7.5 and 4.5 % (per 1000 h) were observed at 750 and 700 degrees C, respectively, no degradation was detected over almost 2000h of testing at 650 degrees C.
