3,8617,All cells were tested at 850 degrees C with a constant current load of 14.3 A (current density of 0.20 A cm(-2)).,Effects of coal syngas and H2S on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells:: Single-cell tests,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.055
4,8617,The results from using syngas with no H2S indicated no degradation after 290 h of operation.,Effects of coal syngas and H2S on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells:: Single-cell tests,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.055
5,8617,"After immediately injecting CO (and water) in the H-2-N-2 mixture, there was a slight tendency of improving performance (power) and then the behavior remained steady.",Effects of coal syngas and H2S on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells:: Single-cell tests,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.055
6,8617,"On the other hand, results for the test with syngas in the presence of H2S (200-240 ppm) indicated good performance over 570 h (650 h total operation time) with 10-12.5% degradation.",Effects of coal syngas and H2S on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells:: Single-cell tests,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.055
7,8617,"The results suggest these cells can be used for extended periods of time for syngas applications, and in the presence of H2S the cells show no major degradation.",Effects of coal syngas and H2S on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells:: Single-cell tests,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.055
