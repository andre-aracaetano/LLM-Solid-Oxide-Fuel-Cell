1,10800,Effects of crystallization on the high-temperature mechanical properties of a newly developed silicate-based glass sealant (GC-9) are investigated for use in planar solid oxide fuel cell (pSOFC).,Effects of crystallization on the high-temperature mechanical properties of a glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.008
2,10800,"The aged, crystallized GC-9 glass is produced by heat treatment of the original GC-9 glass at 900 degrees C for 3 h. Not only crystalline phases are formed but the residual glass is also changed in the aged GC-9 glass after the heat treatment.",Effects of crystallization on the high-temperature mechanical properties of a glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.008
3,10800,Mechanical properties of the aged GC-9 glass are determined by four-point bending technique at temperature from 25 degrees C to 750 degrees C.,Effects of crystallization on the high-temperature mechanical properties of a glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.008
4,10800,The glass transition temperature of the given glass is reduced but the softening temperature is increased by such a crystallization heat treatment.,Effects of crystallization on the high-temperature mechanical properties of a glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.008
5,10800,The aged GC-9 glass exhibits a greater flexural strength and Young's modulus than the non-aged one at temperature below 650 degrees C due to the existence of crystalline phases.,Effects of crystallization on the high-temperature mechanical properties of a glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.008
6,10800,"At temperature of 700 degrees C and 750 degrees C, a greater extent of stress relaxation is found in the aged GC-9 glass such that its strength and stiffness are much lower than those of the non-aged one.",Effects of crystallization on the high-temperature mechanical properties of a glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.008
7,10800,The changes in the thermal and mechanical properties through the given aging treatment are favorable for application of the GC-9 glass sealant in pSOFC.,Effects of crystallization on the high-temperature mechanical properties of a glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.008
