1,3320,"One important factor limiting the development of solid oxide fuel cell is its high operational temperature (700-750 degrees C), significantly hindering its commercialization.",Synthesis and characterisation of a ceria-based cobalt-zinc anode nanocomposite for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs),10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142057
2,3320,"Here, for the first time, it is reported that nano -crystalline Co1-x-Znx-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (x = 0.50, and 0.65) anode powders can provide a practical solution toward Ni-free low temperature SOFCs (LT-SOFCs; 450-550 degrees C) by illustrating strikingly high redox capabilities at temperatures below 400 degrees C. An anode-electrolyte bilayer with tailored electrical conductivity is fabricated by co -sintering a Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 disc (as support) and the synthesized Co1-x-Znx-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 anode powder.",Synthesis and characterisation of a ceria-based cobalt-zinc anode nanocomposite for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs),10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142057
3,3320,"During co-sintering, the tunable internal Zn supply from the anode composite to the electrolyte support significantly decreases the densification temperature of the GDC electrolyte support (down to 1100-1200 degrees C), while pro-moting the cell efficiency (-7%) by drastically reducing the electron conductivity through the GDC electrolyte layer (open circuit voltage -0.91 V at 650 degrees C).",Synthesis and characterisation of a ceria-based cobalt-zinc anode nanocomposite for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs),10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142057
