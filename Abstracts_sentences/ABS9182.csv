4,9182,"Using this infiltration technique, nano LSCF particles (approximately 100 nm) can be uniformly coated on the LSGM scaffold surface.",Characteristics of nano La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ scaffold cathode for enhanced oxygen reduction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.087
5,9182,"Good nano particle adhesion was observed at the LSGM/LSCF interface, even at relatively low firing temperatures (850 degrees C).",Characteristics of nano La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ scaffold cathode for enhanced oxygen reduction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.087
6,9182,The cathode polarization resistance (R-p) of the nano LSCF infiltrated LSGM scaffold cathode was lower than that of a conventional LSCF cathode.,Characteristics of nano La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ scaffold cathode for enhanced oxygen reduction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.087
7,9182,The improvement in performance of the nano LSCF-infiltrated cathode was attributed to an increase in the number of triple phase boundaries (TPB) as a result of the nano LSCF coating.,Characteristics of nano La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ scaffold cathode for enhanced oxygen reduction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.087
8,9182,"In addition, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) paths were extended from the TPBs to the LSCF surface because LSCF particles are considerably smaller than the LSCF oxygen ion penetration depth (3-4 mu m) over the temperature range of 700 degrees C-800 degrees C.
