1,9418,The development of highly efficient cathode materials with durable performance and high resistance toward environmental impurity is crucial for realizing the practical applications of intermediate temperature -solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,LaBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+d cathode with superior CO2 resistance and high oxygen reduction activity for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.116
2,9418,"Since CO2 as the oxidation product of hydrocarbons is unavoidable in the surrounding air atmosphere for SOFCs operating on hydrocarbon fuels, CO2 tolerance of the air electrode is a big concern.",LaBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+d cathode with superior CO2 resistance and high oxygen reduction activity for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.116
3,9418,"Herein, LaBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+delta (LBCC) double perovskite is proposed as a promising cathode with superior CO2 tolerance and favourable oxygen reduction activity.",LaBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+d cathode with superior CO2 resistance and high oxygen reduction activity for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.116
4,9418,"It shows a relatively low area specific resistance of 0.128 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C in a CO2-free synthetic air atmosphere, tested based on a symmetrical cell configuration (LBCC | Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 | LBCC).",LaBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+d cathode with superior CO2 resistance and high oxygen reduction activity for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.116
5,9418,"In addition, under open-circuit voltage condition, it can run stably for more than 120 h in the air containing 1% CO2 (1% CO2, 21% O-2 and 78% N-2) at 650 degrees C. More attractively, the LBCC shows high reversibility in performance by removing CO2 from air.",LaBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+d cathode with superior CO2 resistance and high oxygen reduction activity for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.116
6,9418,An anode-supported single SOFC with thin film doped ceria electrolyte (similar to 25 mm) and LBCC cathode shows a favourable peak power density of 1063 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C by using ambient air as the cathode atmosphere and hydrogen as the fuel.,LaBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+d cathode with superior CO2 resistance and high oxygen reduction activity for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.116
