1,21067,In developing a new compositae air electrode for Solid Oxide Cells (SOCs) it is essential to fully understand the phase chemistry of all components.,Phase evolution and reactivity of Pr2NiO4+δ and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composites under solid oxide cell sintering and operation temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.011
2,21067,Ruddlesden-Popper type electrodes such as Pr2NiO4+delta have previously been proposed as attractive alternatives to conventional La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta/Ce1-xGdxO2-delta compositae air electrodes for both fuel cell and electrolyser modes of operation.,Phase evolution and reactivity of Pr2NiO4+δ and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composites under solid oxide cell sintering and operation temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.011
3,21067,"However, Pr2NiO4+delta have been shown to have limited stability, reacting with a Ce1-xGdxO2-delta interlayer to form a Ce1-x-yGdxPryO2-delta (CGPO) phase of unknown stoichiometry.",Phase evolution and reactivity of Pr2NiO4+δ and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composites under solid oxide cell sintering and operation temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.011
4,21067,"Additionally, Pr2NiO4+delta are known to decompose to Pr4Ni3O10 +/- delta under certain conditions.",Phase evolution and reactivity of Pr2NiO4+δ and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composites under solid oxide cell sintering and operation temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.011
5,21067,"In this work detailed understanding of the chemical reaction between Pr2NiO4+delta and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CG010) under normal solid oxide cell fabrication and operating temperatures was obtained, identifying the composition of the resulting CGPO phase reaction products.",Phase evolution and reactivity of Pr2NiO4+δ and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composites under solid oxide cell sintering and operation temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.011
6,21067,"It is shown that, in addition to the unreacted CGO10 present after sintering the compositae at 1100 degrees C for up to 12 h, a series of CGPO chemical compositions were formed with various Ce, Gd and Pr ratios depending on the relative distance of the doped ceria phases from the Pr2NiO4+delta phases.",Phase evolution and reactivity of Pr2NiO4+δ and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composites under solid oxide cell sintering and operation temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.011
7,21067,The extent of the chemical reaction was found to depend on the sintering time and the contact area of the two phases.,Phase evolution and reactivity of Pr2NiO4+δ and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composites under solid oxide cell sintering and operation temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.011
8,21067,"Further thermal treatment of the resulting products under SOC air electrode operating temperature (800 degrees C) resulted in the initiation of Pr2NiO4+delta decomposition, forming Pr4Ni3O10 +/- delta and Pr6O11 with no detectable change in the composition of previously formed Pr-substituted ceria phases.",Phase evolution and reactivity of Pr2NiO4+δ and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composites under solid oxide cell sintering and operation temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.011
9,21067,"It is apparent that the Pr2NiO4+delta/CGO10 compositae is unsuitable as an air electrode, but there is evidence that the decomposition products, Pr4Ni3O10 +/- delta and Ce1-x-yGdxPryO2-delta are stable and suitable candidates for SOC electrodes.",Phase evolution and reactivity of Pr2NiO4+δ and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composites under solid oxide cell sintering and operation temperatures,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.011
