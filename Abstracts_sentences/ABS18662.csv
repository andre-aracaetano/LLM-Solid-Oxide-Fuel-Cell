1,18662,"Cation diffusion was investigated in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSC) thin films on (100) yttria stabilized zirconia in the temperature range 625-800 degrees C. Isotopic (86Sr) and elemental tracers (Fe, Sm) were used to establish diffusion profiles of the cations in bi- and multi-layered thin films.",Cation diffusion in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ below 800 °C and its relevance for Sr segregation,10.1039/c3cp51906f
2,18662,The profiles were analyzed by time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS).,Cation diffusion in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ below 800 °C and its relevance for Sr segregation,10.1039/c3cp51906f
3,18662,Grain and grain boundary diffusion coefficients of the cations were determined for LSC thin films with columnar grains - diffusion along grain boundaries is shown to be about three orders of magnitude faster than in grains.,Cation diffusion in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ below 800 °C and its relevance for Sr segregation,10.1039/c3cp51906f
4,18662,This could be verified for thin films with different grain size.,Cation diffusion in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ below 800 °C and its relevance for Sr segregation,10.1039/c3cp51906f
5,18662,A- and B-site cations showed very similar temperature dependencies with activation energies of similar to 3.5 eV for bulk and similar to 4.1 eV for grain boundary diffusion.,Cation diffusion in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ below 800 °C and its relevance for Sr segregation,10.1039/c3cp51906f
6,18662,The importance of cation diffusivities for surface segregation of Sr and thus for a major degradation mechanism of LSC cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells is discussed.,Cation diffusion in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ below 800 °C and its relevance for Sr segregation,10.1039/c3cp51906f
