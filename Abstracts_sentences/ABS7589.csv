2,7589,The ultrafine BCF powder with grain size of about 200 nm consisted of dual phase BaCe0.15Fe0.85O3-delta and BaCe0.85Fe0.15O3-delta.,A novel dual phase BaCe0.5Fe0.5O3-δ cathode with high oxygen electrocatalysis activity for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.060
3,7589,Electrical conductivity relaxation measurement illustrates the low conductivity activation energy and the high oxygen surface exchange kinetics with oxygen surface exchange coefficient of 3.8 x 10(-5) cms(-1) at 600 degrees C. BCF cathode exhibits 1.04 Omega cm(2) on doped ceria electrolyte and remains stable in 400 h long term test at 600 degrees C. A single cell based on doped ceria electrolyte with BCF cathode shows a maximum power density of 228 mW cm(-2) at 650 degrees,A novel dual phase BaCe0.5Fe0.5O3-δ cathode with high oxygen electrocatalysis activity for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.060
