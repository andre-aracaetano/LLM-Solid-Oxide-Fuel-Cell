2,14161,"In this work, we have studied Sc2O3 (5-11mol%) stabilized ZrO2-CeO2 as a potential solid electrolyte for application in IT-SOFCs.","Oxygen-ion conduction in scandia-stabilized zirconia-ceria solid electrolyte (xSc2O3-1CeO2-(99-x)ZrO2, 5x11)",10.1111/jace.14595
3,14161,"Lower Sc2O3 doping range than the traditional 11mol% Sc2O3-stabilized ZrO2 is an interesting research topic as it could potentially lead to an electrolyte with reduced oxygen vacancy ordering, lower cost, and higher mechanical strength.","Oxygen-ion conduction in scandia-stabilized zirconia-ceria solid electrolyte (xSc2O3-1CeO2-(99-x)ZrO2, 5x11)",10.1111/jace.14595
4,14161,"XRD and Raman spectroscopy was used to study the phase equilibrium in ZrO2-CeO2-Sc2O3 system and impedance spectroscopy was done to estimate the grain, grain boundary, and total ionic conductivities.","Oxygen-ion conduction in scandia-stabilized zirconia-ceria solid electrolyte (xSc2O3-1CeO2-(99-x)ZrO2, 5x11)",10.1111/jace.14595
