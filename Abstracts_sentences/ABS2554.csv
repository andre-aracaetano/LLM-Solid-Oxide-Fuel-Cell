1,2554,"Here, stability of the metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell (MS-SOFC) with Ni-Ce0,8Sm0,202_6 (SDC) infiltrated 430L anode and La(0.6)Sro(4)Fe(0.9)Sc(0.1)O(3-delta) (LSFSc) infiltrated scandia-stabilized zirconia (SSZ) cathode is evaluated.",Long-term stability of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells employing infiltrated electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.114
2,2554,It is found that the degradation rate defined as the voltage loss during a fixed period is faster at higher operation temperatures and larger current densities.,Long-term stability of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells employing infiltrated electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.114
3,2554,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) analysis indicate that the degradation is mainly caused by the morphological change of the anode while metal element diffusion between Ni catalyst and 430L substrate contributes little.,Long-term stability of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells employing infiltrated electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.114
4,2554,A 1500 h durability test measured at 650 degrees C and 0.9 A cm(-2) shows a degradation rate of 1.3% kh(-1) and the voltage decrease is mainly found in the initial 500 h.
