1,1018,The La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-WO3 semiconductor composite was applied as an electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LTSOFCs).,LSCF-WO3 semiconductor composite electrolytes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2ra05665h
2,1018,"The study results revealed that the fuel cell could output a maximum power density (P-max) of 812 mW cm(-2) when the weight ratio of LSCF to WO3 was 8 : 2 (8LSCF-2WO(3)), and its open-circuit voltage (OCV) was higher than 1.0 V.",LSCF-WO3 semiconductor composite electrolytes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2ra05665h
3,1018,This indicated that there was no short circuit problem in this fuel cell device and 80 wt% LSCF existed in the electrolyte layer.,LSCF-WO3 semiconductor composite electrolytes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2ra05665h
4,1018,This was mainly due to the suppressed electronic conductivity and increased ionic conductivity of the composite as compared with LSCF due to the introduction of the WO3 wide band semiconductor.,LSCF-WO3 semiconductor composite electrolytes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2ra05665h
5,1018,"The oxygen ionic conductivity of the 8LSCF-2WO(3) electrolyte was 0.337 S cm(-1), which is much higher than that of the pure LSCF material.",LSCF-WO3 semiconductor composite electrolytes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2ra05665h
6,1018,"According to the XPS analysis results, a higher oxygen vacancy content at the heterointerface between LSCF and WO3 contributed to the increased ionic conductivity.",LSCF-WO3 semiconductor composite electrolytes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2ra05665h
