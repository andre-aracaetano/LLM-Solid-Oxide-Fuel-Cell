1,897,This paper describes a direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) based on a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system which has been used to assess the performance of a high surface area carbon fuel material.,A novel direct carbon fuel cell concept,10.1115/1.2743073
2,897,"The cell, consisting of a co-fired anode, electrolyte, and cathode, has been produced by standard tape casting methods and is of tubular geometry.",A novel direct carbon fuel cell concept,10.1115/1.2743073
3,897,The operating conditions of the cell require a 62 mol% Li2CO3 and 38 mol% K2CO3 eutectic secondary electrolyte and the operation of the cell is described over the temperature range 525-700 degrees C.,A novel direct carbon fuel cell concept,10.1115/1.2743073
4,897,The cell performance has been examined by standard electrochemical methods.,A novel direct carbon fuel cell concept,10.1115/1.2743073
