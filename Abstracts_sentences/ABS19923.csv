3,19923,"In this work, catalytic-active Ni nanoparticles were loaded on a La0.4Sr0.4TiO3-delta -Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta cathode (Ni-loaded LSTO-SDC) via an impregnation method to improve the electrode performances for direct steam electrolysis.",Composite cathode La0.4Sr0.4TiO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ impregnated with Ni for high-temperature steam electrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.107
4,19923,The synergetic effect of catalytically-active Ni nanoparticles and the redox-stable LSTO-SDC skeleton contributed to the improved performances and the excellent stability of the cathode for direct steam electrolysis.,Composite cathode La0.4Sr0.4TiO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ impregnated with Ni for high-temperature steam electrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.107
5,19923,"The current efficiency with a Ni-loaded cathode was enhanced by 3% and 17% compared to the values with a bare LSTO-SDC cathode under 2.0 V of applied voltage at 800 degrees C with a flow of 3% H2O/5% H-2/Ar and 3% H2O/Ar to cathodes, respectively.",Composite cathode La0.4Sr0.4TiO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ impregnated with Ni for high-temperature steam electrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.107
