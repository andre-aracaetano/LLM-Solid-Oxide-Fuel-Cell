5,5568,"A densified GDC interlayer-based anode-supported cell exhibited a maximum power density of approximately 1.11 W/cm(2) at 650 degrees C, 1.74-fold greater than that of a conventional GDC interlayer-based cell, with excellent electrochemical stability for 200 h. Our results demonstrated a simple and cost-effective process for fabricating highly densified GDC interlayers to develop SOFC with high performance and stability.",Precursor-driven facile densification of Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ interlayer for high-performance solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.8419
