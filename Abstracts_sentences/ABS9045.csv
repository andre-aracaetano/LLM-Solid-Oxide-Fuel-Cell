1,9045,This paper presents a stack concept that can be applied to both molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) internal reforming stacks.,A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
2,9045,"It employs anode recycle and allows the design of very simple system configurations, while giving enhanced efficiencies and high specific power densities.",A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
3,9045,The recycle of anode exit gas to the anode inlet has previously been proposed as a means of preventing carbon deposition in direct internal reforming (DIR) stacks.,A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
4,9045,When applied to a normal stack this reduces the Nernst voltages because the recycle stream is relatively depleted in hydrogen.,A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
5,9045,"In the concept proposed here, known as the 'Smarter' stack, there are two anode exit streams, one of which is depleted, while the other is relatively undepleted.",A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
6,9045,"The depleted stream passes directly to the burner, and the undepleted stream is recycled to the stack inlet.",A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
7,9045,By this means high Nernst voltages are achieved in the stack.,A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
8,9045,The concept has been simulated and assessed for parallel-flow and cross-flow MCFC and SOFC stacks and graphs are presented showing temperature distributions.,A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
9,9045,"The 'Smarter' stacks employ a high recycle rate resulting in a reduced natural gas concentration at the stack inlet, and this reduces or eliminates the unfavourable temperature dip.",A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
10,9045,Catalyst grading can further improve the temperature distribution.,A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
11,9045,The concept allows simple system configurations in which the need for fuel pre-heat is eliminated.,A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
12,9045,Efficiencies are up to 10 percentage points higher than for conventional stacks with the same cell area and maximum stack temperature.,A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
13,9045,"The concept presented here was devised in a project part-funded by the EU, and has been adopted by the European Advanced DIR-MCFC development programme led by BCN.",A novel configuration for direct internal reforming stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02723-7
