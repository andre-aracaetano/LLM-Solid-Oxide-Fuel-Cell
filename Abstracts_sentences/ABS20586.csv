1,20586,The ionic conductivity of sintered pellets of tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (TZP) was found to be higher than that of cubic stabilized zirconia (CSZ) below about 700-degrees-C in spite of the lower concentration of defects.,TETRAGONAL ZIRCONIA POLYCRYSTALS - A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXYGEN ION CONDUCTOR,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90087-6
2,20586,At 400-degrees-C the bulk conductivity is 1.2 X 10(-4)OMEGA--1 cm-1 with an activation enthalpy of 0.92 eV.,TETRAGONAL ZIRCONIA POLYCRYSTALS - A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXYGEN ION CONDUCTOR,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90087-6
3,20586,This shows that the mobility of the defects in TZP is about one order of magnitude higher than in CSZ.,TETRAGONAL ZIRCONIA POLYCRYSTALS - A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXYGEN ION CONDUCTOR,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90087-6
4,20586,TZP pellets show high thermo-mechanical stability and may be readily sealed into glass tubes to provide gastight separate electrode compartments.,TETRAGONAL ZIRCONIA POLYCRYSTALS - A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXYGEN ION CONDUCTOR,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90087-6
5,20586,Such an arrangement shows a fast response to variations of the oxygen partial pressure even at temperatures as low as 150-degrees-C. The correct Nernstian voltage is observed within about 1 s under reducing conditions and within a few minutes under oxidizing conditions.,TETRAGONAL ZIRCONIA POLYCRYSTALS - A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXYGEN ION CONDUCTOR,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90087-6
6,20586,It may be assumed that the fast response even at low temperatures is related to the electronic properties of TZP.,TETRAGONAL ZIRCONIA POLYCRYSTALS - A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXYGEN ION CONDUCTOR,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90087-6
7,20586,Investigations of the electronic behavior of the surface by work function measurements and of the minority charge carrier conductivities are reported as a function of the temperature and oxygen partial pressure.,TETRAGONAL ZIRCONIA POLYCRYSTALS - A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXYGEN ION CONDUCTOR,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90087-6

9,20586,It appears that TZP is very useful for fuel cells in view of both its thermo-mechanical stability and its favorable electrical properties at lower temperatures.,TETRAGONAL ZIRCONIA POLYCRYSTALS - A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXYGEN ION CONDUCTOR,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90087-6
10,20586,Limiting-current oxygen sensors have been developed on the basis of this material which show superior performance compared with CSZ.,TETRAGONAL ZIRCONIA POLYCRYSTALS - A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXYGEN ION CONDUCTOR,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90087-6
