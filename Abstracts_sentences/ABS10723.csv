4,10723,"In this study, electric performance of a SOFC with different interconnect designs under different operating conditions, such as operating voltage, channel inlet temperature, pre-reforming rate of methane, and inlet fuel and air velocity, has been investigated by use of a three-dimensional model considering complicated systems of equations: species mass conservation, first law of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and non-linear electrochemical models including multi-specious diffusion.",A comprehensive three-dimensional modeling of an internal reforming planar solid oxide fuel cell with different interconnect designs,10.1007/s10008-021-05030-9
5,10723,"It has been concluded that at a given voltage, inlet temperature, inlet air and fuel velocity, and pre-reforming rate, wider gas channels help to more uniform distribution and better penetration of reactant gases.",A comprehensive three-dimensional modeling of an internal reforming planar solid oxide fuel cell with different interconnect designs,10.1007/s10008-021-05030-9
