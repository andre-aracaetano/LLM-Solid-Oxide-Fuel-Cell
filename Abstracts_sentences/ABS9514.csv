2,9514,The current peaks corresponding to the reduction of LSM electrode materials and oxygen on the LSM surface were observed in the forward and backward scan.,"Cyclic voltammetry of (La,Sr)MnO3 electrode on YSZ substrate",10.1016/j.ssi.2003.08.006
3,9514,"The electrochemical process for the reduction of Mn3+ and the concomitant formation of oxygen vacancies is reversible (or quasi-reversible), which has become irreversible at low temperature or fast scan rate.","Cyclic voltammetry of (La,Sr)MnO3 electrode on YSZ substrate",10.1016/j.ssi.2003.08.006
4,9514,The improvement of LSM electrode performance under cathodic polarization and its gradual degradation after removal of applied potential were found to be related to two sequential reactions: reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+ and recombination of Mn2+ with the formed oxygen vacancies in the presence of oxygen.,"Cyclic voltammetry of (La,Sr)MnO3 electrode on YSZ substrate",10.1016/j.ssi.2003.08.006
5,9514,"The oxygen reduction processes are strongly dependent on oxygen vacancies on the LSM electrode surface, which extend the reaction zone for oxygen reduction from three-phase boundary (TPB) to its vicinity under cathodic polarization.","Cyclic voltammetry of (La,Sr)MnO3 electrode on YSZ substrate",10.1016/j.ssi.2003.08.006
