1,7157,NiO-YSZ anodes and CeO2-PrO2 cathodes dedicated to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on YSZ electrolyte have been realized by pressing powders synthesized using self assembling method associated with hydrothermal treatment and by RF assisted Pulsed Laser Deposition techniques.,RF assisted pulsed laser deposition of electrodes for YSZ based SOFCs,
2,7157,"The obtained materials have been characterized by XRD, XPS, AFM, SNMS and SEM techniques which revealed their structure, composition and morphology.",RF assisted pulsed laser deposition of electrodes for YSZ based SOFCs,
3,7157,The anode/electrolyte/cathode assemblies used in SOFC's based on thin films grown by RF-assisted PLD show superior electrocatalytic activity as compared to thick based SOFC in respect with the operating temperature (as low as 450 degrees C) and the fuel conversion efficiency.,RF assisted pulsed laser deposition of electrodes for YSZ based SOFCs,
