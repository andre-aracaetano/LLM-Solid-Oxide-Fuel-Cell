4,15393,Ni/YSZ pattern anodes with 0.5 mu m thick Ni was tested in dry H-2 at 550 degrees C without significantly changing the TPB line.,Ni/YSZ pattern anodes fabrication and their microstructure and electrochemical behavior changes in H2-H2O environments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.10.053
5,15393,Ni/YSZ pattern anodes with Ni thickness of 0.8 mu m were tested at 550 degrees C under dry and humidified H-2 (3-50% H2O) conditions without TPB line change.,Ni/YSZ pattern anodes fabrication and their microstructure and electrochemical behavior changes in H2-H2O environments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.10.053
6,15393,"At 700 degrees C, and for 0.8 mu m thick patterns, the TPB length showed pronounced change in H-2 with 10-50% H2O. Significant increase in TPB length due to holes formation was observed at 800 degrees C with 3% and 10% H2O. Ni/YSZ pattern anodes with 1.0 mu m thick Ni was stable in H-2 with 3% H2O in the range 550-800 degrees C, with TPB line only slightly modified.",Ni/YSZ pattern anodes fabrication and their microstructure and electrochemical behavior changes in H2-H2O environments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.10.053
7,15393,"However, distinct change of TPB line and Ni microstructure was observed with 10-70% H2O above 700 degrees C. Stabilization of the polarization resistance depends on temperature.",Ni/YSZ pattern anodes fabrication and their microstructure and electrochemical behavior changes in H2-H2O environments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.10.053
