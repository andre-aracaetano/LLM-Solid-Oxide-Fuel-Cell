1,10072,Thermal imaging and vibrational spectroscopy have become important tools for examining the physical and chemical changes that occur in real time in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,In Situ Optical Studies of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1146/annurev.anchem.111808.073641
2,10072,Imaging techniques can resolve temperature differences as fine as 0.1 degrees C across a SOFC electrode at temperatures higher than 600 degrees C. Vibrational spectroscopy can identify molecular species and changes in material phases in operating SOFCs.,In Situ Optical Studies of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1146/annurev.anchem.111808.073641
3,10072,This review discusses the benefits and challenges associated with directly observing processes that are important to SOFC performance and durability.,In Situ Optical Studies of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1146/annurev.anchem.111808.073641
4,10072,"In situ optical methods can provide direct insight into reaction mechanisms that can be inferred only indirectly from electrochemical measurements such as voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and from kinetic models and postmortem, ex situ examinations of SOFC components.",In Situ Optical Studies of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1146/annurev.anchem.111808.073641
5,10072,"Particular attention is devoted to recent advances that, hopefully, will spur the development of new generations of efficient, versatile energy-producing devices.",In Situ Optical Studies of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1146/annurev.anchem.111808.073641
