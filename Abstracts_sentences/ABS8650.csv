2,8650,Such applications are characterised by dynamic load profiles.,Accelerated testing of solid oxide fuel cell stacks for micro combined heat and power application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.054
3,8650,"In order to shorten the needed testing time and to investigate potential acceleration of degradation, the profiles are executed faster than required for real applications.",Accelerated testing of solid oxide fuel cell stacks for micro combined heat and power application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.054
4,8650,"Operation with fast load cycling, both using hydrogen and methane/steam as fuels, does not accelerate degradation compared to constant operation, which demonstrates the maturity of SoA stacks and enables transferring knowledge from testing at constant conditions to dynamic operation.",Accelerated testing of solid oxide fuel cell stacks for micro combined heat and power application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.054
5,8650,"7.5 times more cycles than required for 80,000 h lifetime as micro CHP are achieved on one-cell-stack level.",Accelerated testing of solid oxide fuel cell stacks for micro combined heat and power application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.054
6,8650,"The results also suggest that degradation mechanisms that proceed on a longer time-scale, such as creep, might have a more dominating effect for long life-times than regular short time changes of operation.",Accelerated testing of solid oxide fuel cell stacks for micro combined heat and power application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.054
7,8650,"In order to address lifetime testing it is suggested to build a testing program consisting of defined modules that represent different application profiles, such as one module at constant conditions, followed by modules at one set of dynamic conditions etc. (C) 2015",Accelerated testing of solid oxide fuel cell stacks for micro combined heat and power application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.054
