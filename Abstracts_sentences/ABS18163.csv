1,18163,A stable and catalytically active cathode consisting of homogeneously dispersed nano-socketed Fe-Ni particles has been elegantly fabricated in single-step treatment for solid oxide steam electrolysis cells via the in situ reduction of the Sr2Fe1.3Ni0.2Mo0.5O6 (SFMNi) material in a humidified H-2 (3 vol% H2O) atmosphere at 800 degrees C.,Exsolved Fe-Ni nano-particles from Sr2Fe1.3Ni0.2Mo0.5O6 perovskite oxide as a cathode for solid oxide steam electrolysis cells,10.1039/c6ta06078a
2,18163,"The SFMNi-SDC/LCO/LSGM/SDC-LSCF electrolysis cell exhibits a high electrolysis current density of 1257 mA cm(-2) and a high hydrogen production rate of 525 mL cm(-2) h(-1) at an applied voltage of 1.3 V at 850 degrees C. Moreover, the in situ grown nano-structured cathode shows a good short-term stability at a constant electrolysis current of -300 mA cm(-2), resulting from the strong interface between the exsolved particles and the parent perovskite.",Exsolved Fe-Ni nano-particles from Sr2Fe1.3Ni0.2Mo0.5O6 perovskite oxide as a cathode for solid oxide steam electrolysis cells,10.1039/c6ta06078a
