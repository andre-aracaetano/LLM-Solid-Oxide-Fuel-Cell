1,3524,"Cathode materials Nd2-xSrxNiO4 were prepared by the glycine-nitrate process and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), AC impendence spectroscopy and DC polarization method, respectively.",Preparation and electrochemical properties of Sr-doped Nd2NiO4 cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.001
2,3524,The results show that 110 reaction occurred between the electrode and the CGO electrolyte at 1100 C and the electrode formed good contact with the electrolyte after being sintered at 1000 C for 4 h. The rate-limiting step for oxygen reduction reaction oil Nd1.6Sr0.4NiO4 electrode changed with oxygen partial pressure and measurement temperature.,Preparation and electrochemical properties of Sr-doped Nd2NiO4 cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.001
3,3524,"The Nd1.6Sr0.4NiO4 electrode gave a polarization resistance of 0.93 Omega cm(2) at 700 C in air, which indicates that Nd2-xSrxNiO4 electrode is a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC).",Preparation and electrochemical properties of Sr-doped Nd2NiO4 cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.001
