1,4401,"A Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode and a Cu-CeO2/Ni-YSZ multi-layer anode have been fabricated for use in anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), and their performances and stabilities in H-2-CO syngas have been studied at 750 degrees C. A high CO content has been found to cause carbon deposition and crack formation in the Ni-YSZ anode after long-term operation, but the Cu-CeO2 catalyst layer on the Ni-YSZ anode surface improves its stability in syngas with high CO content by facilitating the water gas shift reaction.",Application of a Cu-CeO2/Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia multi-layer anode for anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells operating on H2-CO syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.053
2,4401,"The optimized single cell has run in syngas with a composition of 48.5%H-2-48.5%C0-3%H2O for 460 h without obvious degradation of its performance, however, its performance decreases after 630 h due to carbon deposition in the anode functional layer and subsequent crack formation on the anode and electrolyte.",Application of a Cu-CeO2/Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia multi-layer anode for anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells operating on H2-CO syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.053
