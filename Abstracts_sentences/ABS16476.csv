4,16476,"The CGO-coated cathodes exhibit improved stability and performance, with Rp values varying from 0.27 to 0.30 Omega cm(2) at an annealing temperature of 600 C-circle for 400 h. On the contrary, the uncoated cathode shows a faster degradation rate, with a continuous increase of Rp from 2.8 to 8.5 Omega cm(2).",Stability and performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ nanostructured cathodes with Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 surface coating,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.02.045
