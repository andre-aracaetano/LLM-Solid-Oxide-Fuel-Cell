1,19704,The short-term changes in the electrical conductivity of Ni-YSZ composites (cermets) suitable for use in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) were measured by an in-situ 4-point DC technique.,Electrical conductivity of Ni-YSZ composites: Degradation due to Ni particle growth,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.02.001
2,19704,"The isothermal reduction was carried out in dry, humidified or wet hydrogen at temperatures from 600 to 1000 C. While the cermets reduced at 600 degrees C showed a stable conductivity of 1000-1200 S/cm, rapid initial conductivity loss was observed at elevated temperatures.",Electrical conductivity of Ni-YSZ composites: Degradation due to Ni particle growth,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.02.001
