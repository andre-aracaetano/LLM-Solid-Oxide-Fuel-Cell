4,13018,"In this work, the Ca12Al14O33-based materials with Y, In, and Cu-doping on the Ca or Al sites were fabricated through a traditional solid-state reaction method (for Y-doping on Ca and Cu-doping on Al) or a glass-crystallization method (for In-doping on Al), with their electrical conductivities being studied.",Cation-doping effects on the conductivities of the mayenite Ca12Al14O33,10.1515/htmp-2022-0295
5,13018,"The results revealed that the solid solution regions of Ca12-x Y x Al14O33+delta , Ca12Al14-x In x O33, and Ca(12)Al(14-x )Cu( x )O(33-delta )were 0 <= x <= 0.15, 0 <= x <= 0.1, and 0 <= x <= 0.3, respectively.",Cation-doping effects on the conductivities of the mayenite Ca12Al14O33,10.1515/htmp-2022-0295
