1,20450,"Strategic priorities in the field of hydrogen energy include the design of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells capable of highly efficient operation in the temperature range of 573-973 K. Consequently, attempts are being made to replace the widely applied cubic zirconia electrolyte with an electrolyte consisting of tetragonal zirconia.",Electrical and Mechanical Properties of ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3 Composite Solid Electrolytes,10.1007/s11664-021-09125-x
2,20450,The rationale for this approach is that 3Y-TZP exhibits higher mechanical strength and higher electrical conductivity at temperatures below 973 K.,Electrical and Mechanical Properties of ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3 Composite Solid Electrolytes,10.1007/s11664-021-09125-x
3,20450,The addition of Al2O3 in an amount that exceeds its solubility limit in 3Y-TZP has been found to result in increased electrical conductivity and improved mechanical properties.,Electrical and Mechanical Properties of ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3 Composite Solid Electrolytes,10.1007/s11664-021-09125-x
4,20450,The aim of the study was to synthesize 3-YSZ powder via co-precipitation and use it to obtain composites with a 3Y-TZP matrix and 0.5 mol.% or 1.0 mol.% of Al2O3 inclusions.,Electrical and Mechanical Properties of ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3 Composite Solid Electrolytes,10.1007/s11664-021-09125-x
5,20450,"The correlation between these samples' electrical conductivity and resistance to brittle fracture and their phase composition and microstructure was investigated by means of X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Vickers indentation tests.",Electrical and Mechanical Properties of ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3 Composite Solid Electrolytes,10.1007/s11664-021-09125-x
6,20450,"For comparison, the properties of composites with an 8-YSZ matrix and Al2O3 inclusions were also investigated.",Electrical and Mechanical Properties of ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3 Composite Solid Electrolytes,10.1007/s11664-021-09125-x
7,20450,It was determined that the composite based on the 3Y-TZP matrix and containing 0.5 mol.% of Al2O3 inclusions can be considered a viable alternative for 8-YSZ electrolytes in IT-SOFC applications.,Electrical and Mechanical Properties of ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3 Composite Solid Electrolytes,10.1007/s11664-021-09125-x
