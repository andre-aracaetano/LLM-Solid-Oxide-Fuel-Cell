4,5547,Impedance spectroscopy revealed that the contribution of grain boundary resistance is higher than that of the bulk.,Synthesis and characterization of nanocrystalline dysprosia stabilized zirconia based electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.07.135
5,5547,"Furthermore, conductivity analysis evidenced an Arrhenius type thermally activated ionic conduction above 300 degrees C. Thus, DySZ appears a possible alternative to yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells due to its lower thermal and comparable ionic conductivity as YSZ.",Synthesis and characterization of nanocrystalline dysprosia stabilized zirconia based electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.07.135
