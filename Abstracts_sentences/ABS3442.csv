1,3442,A perovskite-type oxide La0.4Ba Fe-0.6 Zn-0.8 O-0.2 (3-) (LBFZ) was investigated as the cathode material for simultaneous NO reduction and electricity generation in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-δ as cathode in solid oxide fuel cells for simultaneous NO reduction and electricity generation,10.1080/09593330.2013.856953
2,3442,The microstructure of LBFZ was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.,La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-δ as cathode in solid oxide fuel cells for simultaneous NO reduction and electricity generation,10.1080/09593330.2013.856953
3,3442,"The results showed that a single cubic perovskite LBFZ was formed after calcined at 1100 degrees C. Meanwhile, the solid-state reaction between LBFZ and Ce0.8Sm O-0.2 (1.9) (SDC) at 900 degrees C was negligible.",La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-δ as cathode in solid oxide fuel cells for simultaneous NO reduction and electricity generation,10.1080/09593330.2013.856953
4,3442,"To measure the electrochemical properties, SOFC units were constructed with Sm0.9Sr Cr-0.1 Fe-0.5 O-0.5 (3) as the anode, SDC as the electrolyte and LBFZ as the cathode.",La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-δ as cathode in solid oxide fuel cells for simultaneous NO reduction and electricity generation,10.1080/09593330.2013.856953
