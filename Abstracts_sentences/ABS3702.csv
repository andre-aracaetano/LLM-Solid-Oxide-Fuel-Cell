2,3702,"PEALD YSZ-based bi-layered thin film electrolyte was employed for thin film solid oxide fuel cells on nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide substrates, whose electrochemical performance was compared to the cell with sputtered YSZ-based electrolyte.",PEALD YSZ-based bilayer electrolyte for thin film-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/0957-4484/27/41/415402
3,3702,"The cell with PEALD YSZ electrolyte showed higher open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.0 V and peak power density of 182mWcm(-2) at 450 degrees C compared to the one with sputtered YSZ electrolyte(0.88 V(OCV), 70mWcm(-2)(peak power density)).",PEALD YSZ-based bilayer electrolyte for thin film-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/0957-4484/27/41/415402
4,3702,High OCV and high power density of the cell with PEALD YSZ-based electrolyte is due to the reduction in ohmic and activation losses as well as the gas and electrical current tightness.,PEALD YSZ-based bilayer electrolyte for thin film-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/0957-4484/27/41/415402
