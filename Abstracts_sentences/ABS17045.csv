7,17045,"This interesting phenomenon for CH4 fed SOFCs can be explained that the rate of MSR and WGSR increases with increasing temperature, leading to high rate of H-2 production inside the porous anode and a high molar ratio of H-2 to H2O- More simulation results were conducted to investigate the electrode's microstructural effects on the performance of CH4 fed SOFCs.",Electrochemical modeling and parametric study of methane fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.enconman.2008.09.028
8,17045,It is found that increasing electrode porosity or pore size decreases concentration overpotential but increases activation overpotential of CH4 fed SOFcs.,Electrochemical modeling and parametric study of methane fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.enconman.2008.09.028
9,17045,"At low current densities, low porosity and pore size are desirable to reduce the electrode total overpotentials as concentration overpotential is insignificant compared with activation overpotential.",Electrochemical modeling and parametric study of methane fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.enconman.2008.09.028
