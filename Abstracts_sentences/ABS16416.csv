1,16416,The polarization resistance of La(0.6)Sr(0.4)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) (LSCF)-infiltrated Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.95),Prediction of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathode polarization resistance,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.10.006
2,16416,"cathodes was quantitatively explained using a simple model where the resistance scaled directly with the LSCF surface area, as estimated from cross-sectional fracture surfaces.",Prediction of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathode polarization resistance,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.10.006
3,16416,"The Tanner, Fung, Virkar composite cathode model was also applied and showed that ionic transport in these 25-mu m-thick cathodes was not a significant limitation at 600 degrees C, but became more limiting at 700 degrees C. Calculated polarization resistances were within similar to 40% (without fitting parameters) of reported values.",Prediction of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathode polarization resistance,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.10.006
