1,8779,"Apatite ceramics, known for their good electrical conductivities, have garnered substantial attention as an alternative electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",DopedGermanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte forUse inSolidOxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300093
2,8779,"However, studies focusing on the electrochemical performances of SOFCs with apatities as electrolytes remain rare, partly due to their high sintering temperature.",DopedGermanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte forUse inSolidOxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300093
3,8779,"In this study, the effects of Mg2+, Al3+, Ga3+, and Sn4+ dopants on the characteristics of La9.5Ge6O26 +/- are examined and their potential for use as SOFC electrolytes evaluated.",DopedGermanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte forUse inSolidOxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300093
4,8779,"The results indicate that La9.5Ge5.5Al0.5O26 is stabilized into a hexagonal structure, while the La9.5Ge5.5Sn0.5O26.25, La9.5Ge5.5Ga0.5O26, and La9.5Ge5.5Mg0.5O25.75 ceramics reveal triclinic cells accompanied with the second phase La2Sn2O7 or La2GeO5.",DopedGermanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte forUse inSolidOxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300093
5,8779,"The study further demonstrates that a high sintering temperature is needed for both the La9.5Ge5.5Mg0.5O25.75 and the La9.5Ge5.5Sn0.5O26.25 ceramics, and the worst electrical conductivity among the examined systems appears in the La9.5Ge5.5Ga0.5O26 ceramic.",DopedGermanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte forUse inSolidOxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300093
6,8779,"The La9.5Ge5.5Al0.5O26 ceramic is accordingly selected for cell evaluation due to its ability to reach densification at 1,350 degrees C, its good electrical conductivity of 0.026Scm(-1) at 800 degrees C, and its acceptable thermal expansion coefficient of 10.1x10(-6)K(-1).",DopedGermanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte forUse inSolidOxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300093
7,8779,"The maximum power densities of the NiO-SDC/La9.5Ge5.5Al0.5O26/LSCF-SDC single cell are found to be respectively 0.22, 0.16, 0.11, and 0.07Wcm(-2) at 950, 900, 850, and 800 degrees C.",DopedGermanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte forUse inSolidOxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300093
