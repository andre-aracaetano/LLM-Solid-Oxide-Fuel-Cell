1,1654,The electrochemical characteristics of composite cathodes consisting of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (LSM) and Yttria Stabilised Zirconia (YSZ) have been analysed in order to emphasise the opportunity offered by these electrodes in the attempt to reduce the temperature of solid oxide fuel cells.,Analysis of the oxygen reduction process on SOFC composite electrodes,10.1007/s10800-005-0791-z
2,1654,Impedance analysis and potentiodynamic polarisation have been used as tools to evaluate the main electrochemical parameters and the results show that a volume ratio between LSM and YSZ close to 1 gives the best electrochemical activity because of the extension of the three phase boundary (TPB) in the electrode.,Analysis of the oxygen reduction process on SOFC composite electrodes,10.1007/s10800-005-0791-z
3,1654,Electrodes of this composition were subjected to high current load to verify the stability of the electrochemical performance and the results confirmed good cathode reliability.,Analysis of the oxygen reduction process on SOFC composite electrodes,10.1007/s10800-005-0791-z
