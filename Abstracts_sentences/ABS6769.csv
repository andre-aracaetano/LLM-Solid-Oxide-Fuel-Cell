1,6769,"The reactivity of Fe-18 mass% Cr-7 mass% W-R (R = La and/or Ce) alloys with the cathode material, La0.85Sr0.15MnO3, of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was examined in air at 1273 and 1373 K to evaluate the performance of these alloys as separator materials for SOFCs.",Effect of La and Ce on the reactivity of Fe-18 mass % Cr-7 mass %W alloy with La0.85Sr0.15MnO3,10.2320/matertrans1989.41.317
2,6769,"In every reaction couple annealed, a Cr-diffusion zone formed in the La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 and a duplex layer consisting of a thick Cr-Mn spinel layer and a thin Cr2O3 layer formed at the alloy/La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 interface as the products of oxidation and solid-state reactions.",Effect of La and Ce on the reactivity of Fe-18 mass % Cr-7 mass %W alloy with La0.85Sr0.15MnO3,10.2320/matertrans1989.41.317
3,6769,The addition of a small amount of La or Cc strongly inhibited the growth of the Cr-Mn spinel layer.,Effect of La and Ce on the reactivity of Fe-18 mass % Cr-7 mass %W alloy with La0.85Sr0.15MnO3,10.2320/matertrans1989.41.317
4,6769,The Cr-diffusion zone and the Cr-Mn spinel layer were found to be formed by the counter diffusion of Mn ions from the La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 side and Cr ions from the Cr2O3 side.,Effect of La and Ce on the reactivity of Fe-18 mass % Cr-7 mass %W alloy with La0.85Sr0.15MnO3,10.2320/matertrans1989.41.317
5,6769,The increase in the electrical resistivity of the alloy/La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 interface was attributed to the increasing thickness of the Cr2O3 layer in the duplex product layer formed at the interface during the reaction.,Effect of La and Ce on the reactivity of Fe-18 mass % Cr-7 mass %W alloy with La0.85Sr0.15MnO3,10.2320/matertrans1989.41.317
