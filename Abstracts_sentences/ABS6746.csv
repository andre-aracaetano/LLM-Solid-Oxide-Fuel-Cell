5,6746,A-site excessive Gd1.05Ba1.05Co2O5+delta (GBC1.05) is well compatible with Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta at 1000 degrees C for 10 h. The electrical conductivity of GBC1.05 increases dramatically owing to the higher concentration of electron hole and the lower oxygen vacancy concentration.,A new A-site excessive strategy to improve performance of layered perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.066
