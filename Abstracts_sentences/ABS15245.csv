5,15245,"It is found that despite the low ionic conductivity of LSM, the cathode reaction of the oxide cathode materials is a two-step process including: (i) charge transfer with activation energy of the resistivity E-a increasing with the temperature and (ii) transport of oxygen ions through the bulk of the electrode (rate-limiting stage) with E-a independent oil the temperature.",Impedance studies of cathode/electrolyte behaviour in SOFC,10.1016/j.electacta.2007.11.037
