2,15422,"Jacobsen and Mogensen have shown, however, that this is not the case for thin zirconia membranes in solid oxide electrochemical cells.",Oxygen potential transition in mixed conducting oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.06.014
3,15422,"Here we demonstrate that there is a ubiquitous oxygen potential transition rooted in the p-type/n-type transition of electronic conductivity inside mixed conducting oxides, and that the transition is extremely sensitive to electrode potential and current density.",Oxygen potential transition in mixed conducting oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.06.014
4,15422,"It is also remarkably sensitive to the conductivity ratio of electrons and holes, as well as their association with lattice oxygens and vacancies, which tends to increase the oxygen flow.",Oxygen potential transition in mixed conducting oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.06.014
