2,8592,"Up to now, great efforts have been devoted to decorate the microstructure of SOFC cathode, such as changing synthesis method, infiltration, electrospinning and so on.",In-situ surface reconstruction induced-significant performance promotion of Ca3Co4O9+δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231203
3,8592,"Herein, we report an effective and feasible method to reconstruct the surface of Ca3Co4O9+delta (CCO) cathode by reduction and re-oxidation process, during which remarkable morphology change is observed as the surface is wrinkled with the formation of numerous small particles.",In-situ surface reconstruction induced-significant performance promotion of Ca3Co4O9+δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231203
4,8592,"ORR activity of CCO cathode is notably improved after surface reconstruction, since area specific resistance (ASR) of CCO cathode significantly decreases from 0.48 Omega cm(2) to 0.19 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Specific surface area of CCO increased and calcium and cobalt oxide nanoparticles are generated after the redox treatment.",In-situ surface reconstruction induced-significant performance promotion of Ca3Co4O9+δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231203
5,8592,"The oxygen adsorption ability of the CCO is largely enhanced, which contributes to the performance promotion of CCO cathode after the redox treatment.",In-situ surface reconstruction induced-significant performance promotion of Ca3Co4O9+δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231203
6,8592,"Overall, we propose a feasible method to reconstruct CCO surface to promote the ORR activity effectively and study the corresponding mechanism thoroughly, all of which make valuable improvements on the development of SOFC cathode.",In-situ surface reconstruction induced-significant performance promotion of Ca3Co4O9+δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231203
