1,3464,A hierarchically porous Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6--Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (SFM-GDC) ceramic anode-supported solid-oxide fuel cell with a GDC electrolyte film was fabricated by freeze-drying tape-casting and drop coating.,Sulfur-Tolerant Hierarchically Porous Ceramic Anode-Supported Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells with Self-Precipitated Nanocatalyst,10.1002/celc.201402411
2,3464,"3D X-ray computed tomography analysis indicated that the SFM-GDC anode has a high porosity and low tortuosity factor, facilitating gas diffusion in the anode during fuel cell operation.",Sulfur-Tolerant Hierarchically Porous Ceramic Anode-Supported Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells with Self-Precipitated Nanocatalyst,10.1002/celc.201402411
3,3464,Peak power density of cells with a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-GDC (LSCF-GDC) cathode can reach 0.22 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C when using H-2 as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant.,Sulfur-Tolerant Hierarchically Porous Ceramic Anode-Supported Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells with Self-Precipitated Nanocatalyst,10.1002/celc.201402411
4,3464,The SFM-GDC anode shows excellent sulfur tolerance when using H-2 with 50 ppm H2S. SEM analysis demonstrates that the nanocatalyst (iron) can precipitate from the parent SFM phase upon reduction and iron nanoparticles can react with sulfur species to form needle-like nanosulfide.,Sulfur-Tolerant Hierarchically Porous Ceramic Anode-Supported Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells with Self-Precipitated Nanocatalyst,10.1002/celc.201402411
5,3464,"Both the nanocatalyst and sulfide show a graded distribution along the thickness direction, owing to a graded local oxygen chemical potential within the anode.",Sulfur-Tolerant Hierarchically Porous Ceramic Anode-Supported Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells with Self-Precipitated Nanocatalyst,10.1002/celc.201402411
