3,12112,No interaction between the BCIYb electrolyte and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode was observed during the cathode fabrication process.,Novel BaCe0.7In0.2Yb0.1O3-δ proton conductor as electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.04.036
4,12112,"Further, no detectable impurity phase was found when the BCIYb-LSCF mixed powders were calcined at 700 degrees C for 50 h. BCIYb dense samples sintered at 1450 degrees C for 5 h showed acceptable conductivities of 7.2 x 10(-3), 8 x 10(-3), 4.5 x 10(-3) and 3.1 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C in dry air, wet air, wet H-2 and wet N-2, respectively.",Novel BaCe0.7In0.2Yb0.1O3-δ proton conductor as electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.04.036
5,12112,"The maximum cell power outputs of single cells with the configuration of Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY)|BCIYb|BZCY-LSCF were 0.15, 0.218 and 0.28 W cm(-2) at 600, 650 and 700 degrees C, respectively.",Novel BaCe0.7In0.2Yb0.1O3-δ proton conductor as electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.04.036
