2,15130,"Fed by syngas converted from medical waste through plasma gasification, the new design is a SOFC-GT hybrid system benefiting from super-critical CO2 cycle to enhance its performance.","Techno-economic assessment of a conceptual waste-to-energy CHP system combining plasma gasification, SOFC, gas turbine and supercritical CO2 cycle",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114622
3,15130,"Besides, the waste heat carried by the low-temperature exhaust gasses and CO2 stream is further exploited for providing domestic hot water to residents.","Techno-economic assessment of a conceptual waste-to-energy CHP system combining plasma gasification, SOFC, gas turbine and supercritical CO2 cycle",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114622
4,15130,"The benefits of the suggested system were examined based on a 3 t/h plasma gasifier in the thermodynamic and economic aspects, and the effects of the main parameters were also investigated.","Techno-economic assessment of a conceptual waste-to-energy CHP system combining plasma gasification, SOFC, gas turbine and supercritical CO2 cycle",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114622
5,15130,It is found that the net power output of the studied system could reach up to 14.02 MW with a net waste-to-electricity efficiency of 59.30% and an exergy efficiency of 57.56%.,"Techno-economic assessment of a conceptual waste-to-energy CHP system combining plasma gasification, SOFC, gas turbine and supercritical CO2 cycle",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114622
6,15130,"The main source of irreversibility can be traced to three components, gasifier, cell stacks, and afterburner, accounting for 62.45% of the total exergy destruction.","Techno-economic assessment of a conceptual waste-to-energy CHP system combining plasma gasification, SOFC, gas turbine and supercritical CO2 cycle",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114622
7,15130,Only 3.77 years is required to recover the initial investment of the proposed system and a net present value of 109815.39 k$ can be attained by the waste-to-energy project during its 20-year lifespan.,"Techno-economic assessment of a conceptual waste-to-energy CHP system combining plasma gasification, SOFC, gas turbine and supercritical CO2 cycle",10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114622
