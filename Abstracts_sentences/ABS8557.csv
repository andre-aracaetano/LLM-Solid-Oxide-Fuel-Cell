2,8557,Concentration of nickel was varied between 7.23 and 64.99 wt%.,Electrical behavior of nickel coated YSZ cermet prepared by electroless coating technique,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2005.07.025
3,8557,"Bulk samples were prepared using these nickel coated YSZ powders by uniaxial pressing followed by sintering in the temperature range 1200-1350 degrees C with a soaking time of 2-6 h. A thorough investigation on the electrical characteristics of the samples has been performed and an attempt has been made to study the effect of starting YSZ particle size, matrix density on the temperature dependence of conductivity of the cermet.",Electrical behavior of nickel coated YSZ cermet prepared by electroless coating technique,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2005.07.025
