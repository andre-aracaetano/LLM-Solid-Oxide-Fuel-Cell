1,2268,"BaCe0.7Ta0.1Y0.2O3- (delta) (BCTY) and BaCe0.8Y0.2O3- (delta) (BCY) were synthesized by solid-state reaction method at 1,300 A degrees C for 20 h. After being exposed in 3% CO2 + 3% H2O + 94% N-2 at 700 A degrees C for 20 h, the BCTY exhibited adequate chemical stability against carbonations while BCY decomposed into BaCO3 and CeO2.",A novel anode-supported stable BaCe0.7Ta0.1Y0.2O3- δ membrane prepared by all-solid-state process for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-008-0297-x
2,2268,"The BCTY showed the similar thermal expansion behavior to BCY from room temperature to 1,000 A degrees C in air.",A novel anode-supported stable BaCe0.7Ta0.1Y0.2O3- δ membrane prepared by all-solid-state process for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-008-0297-x
3,2268,"The BCTY displayed a conductivity of 0.007 S/cm at 700 A degrees C in humid hydrogen, lower than that of BCY (0.009 S/cm).",A novel anode-supported stable BaCe0.7Ta0.1Y0.2O3- δ membrane prepared by all-solid-state process for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-008-0297-x
