2,17904,The technological interest is largely due to the behavior of oxygen vacancies in this material.,Electron-beam damage and point defects near grain boundaries in cerium oxide,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.02.017
3,17904,"Grain boundaries play an important role in oxygen vacancy diffusion and, although not completely understood, the influence of grain boundaries has been attributed to both a space charge effect and the segregation of impurities.",Electron-beam damage and point defects near grain boundaries in cerium oxide,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.02.017
4,17904,"In this paper, results from spatially resolved electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) near grain boundaries in doped CeO2 in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) are reported.",Electron-beam damage and point defects near grain boundaries in cerium oxide,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.02.017
5,17904,The data are interpreted as the result of beam damage that varies as the electron beam is scanned across grain boundaries and suggest a spatially varying concentration of oxygen vacancies near the grain boundaries.,Electron-beam damage and point defects near grain boundaries in cerium oxide,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.02.017
