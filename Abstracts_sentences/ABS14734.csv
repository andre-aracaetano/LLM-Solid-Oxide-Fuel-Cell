1,14734,Porous La0 8Sr0 2MnO3 (LSMO) films have been prepared by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications LSMO samples have been deposited on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte pellets The adopted in situ strategy involves a molten mixture consisting of the La(hfa)(3) diglyme Sr(hfa)(2) tetraglyme and Mn(tmhd)(3),A novel MOCVD strategy for the fabrication of cathode in a solid oxide fuel cell Synthesis of La0 8Sr0 2MnO3 films on YSZ electrolyte pellets,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2010.08.023
