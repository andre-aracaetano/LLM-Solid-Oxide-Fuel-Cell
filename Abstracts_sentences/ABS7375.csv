1,7375,The double perovskite Sr2CoMoO6-delta was investigated as a candidate anode for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC),Sr2CoMoO6 anode for solid oxide fuel cell running on H2 and CH4 fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.007
2,7375,Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the canon array is retained to 800 degrees C in H-2 atmosphere with the introduction of a limited concentration of oxide-ion vacancies Stoichiometric Sr2CoMoO6 has an antiferromagnetic Neel temperature T-N approximate to 37 K but after reduction in H-2 at 800 C fort h long-range magnetic order appears to set in above 300K In H-2 the electronic conductivity increases sharply with temperature in the interval 400 C < T < 500 C due to the onset of a loss of oxygen to make Sr2CoMoO6-delta a good mixed oxide-ion/electronic conductor (MIEC) With a 300-mu m-thick La0 8Sr0 12Ga0 83MB017O2,Sr2CoMoO6 anode for solid oxide fuel cell running on H2 and CH4 fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.007
3,7375,(815()LSGM) as oxide-ion electrolyte and SrCo08Fe02O3-delta as the cathode the Sr2CoMoO6-delta anode gave a maximum power density of 1017 mWcm(-2) in H-2 and 634 mW cm(-2) in wet CH4 A degradation of power in CH4 was observed which could be attributed to coke build up observed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (C) 2010,Sr2CoMoO6 anode for solid oxide fuel cell running on H2 and CH4 fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.007
