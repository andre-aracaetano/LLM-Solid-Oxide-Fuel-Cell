1,19927,"Glasses of the SiO2-Al2O3-BaO-MgO and SiO2-Al2O3-ZrO2-CaO-Na2O systems were synthesized in the perspective to apply them as sealants in SOFC at operating temperatures of 700-900 degrees C. Thermal properties of the chosen glass compositions and their compatibility with the SOFC materials (YSZ-electrolyte and alloy-interconnector Crofer22APU, 15X25T) were investigated by means of synchronic thermal analysis and high-temperature dilatometry.",High-temperature glassy-ceramic sealants SiO2-Al2O3-BaO-MgO and SiO2-Al2O3-ZrO2-CaO-Na2O for solid oxide electrochemical devices,10.1016/S1003-6326(16)64421-7
