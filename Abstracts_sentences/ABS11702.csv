4,11702,Single cells with dimensions of 50 mm x 50 mm and with an active cathode area of 40 mm x 40 mm were manufactured and tested in an alumina housing with air as oxidant and hydrogen with 3% water vapour as the fuel gas.,"Influence of anode thickness on the power output of solid oxide fuel cells with (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)-type cathode",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.030
5,11702,Results have shown that SOFCs with anodes between 1 and 13 mu m have slightly better performance than those with thicker anodes (similar to 1.7A cm(-2) versus 1.5 A cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and 0.7 V).,"Influence of anode thickness on the power output of solid oxide fuel cells with (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)-type cathode",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.030
