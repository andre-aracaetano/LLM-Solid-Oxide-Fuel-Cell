1,17288,"A colloidal deposition without any binder was developed to prepare a dense La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.85Mg0.15O3-delta (LSGM) film on porous NiO/YSZ substrates, using an incompletely crystallized LSGM powder as starting material.",Doped lanthanum gallate film solid oxide fuel cells fabricated on a Ni/YSZ anode support,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01105.x
2,17288,"Both the dense LSGM film with a thickness of 15 mu m and the required phase composition of the LSGM were achieved simultaneously by sintering at 1400 degrees C for 6 h. The conductivity of the supported LSGM film attained 0.102 S/cm at 800 degrees C, which was comparable with those of the self-supported LSGM films.",Doped lanthanum gallate film solid oxide fuel cells fabricated on a Ni/YSZ anode support,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01105.x
3,17288,"The maximum power density of the LSGM film cell was 480 at 800 degrees C and 614 mW/cm(2) at 850 degrees C, respectively.",Doped lanthanum gallate film solid oxide fuel cells fabricated on a Ni/YSZ anode support,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01105.x
