1,11786,"LaCrO3-based nanocrystalline thin films, substituted with Sr and Zn and coated onto a Fe-26 atom % Cr Ebrite alloy were evaluated at 750-900 degrees C as potential enhancers of oxide properties in ferritic alloy interconnects of a solid oxide fuel cell.",Effects of surface-deposited nanocrystalline chromite thin films on the performance of a ferritic interconnect alloy,10.1149/1.2756368
2,11786,"It was found that at 750 degrees C the coatings provided (i) lower oxidation rates, (ii) increased electrical conductivity, (iii) protection during 24 h cycling and at least 2375 h of isothermal oxidation, and (iv) a fine-grained and uniform oxide microstructure.",Effects of surface-deposited nanocrystalline chromite thin films on the performance of a ferritic interconnect alloy,10.1149/1.2756368
3,11786,"Although after oxidation at 850 S C the grains grew substantially and the scale seemed to be overgrowing the film, conductivity and oxidation rates still matched that of the uncoated sample.",Effects of surface-deposited nanocrystalline chromite thin films on the performance of a ferritic interconnect alloy,10.1149/1.2756368
4,11786,"Tensile tests showed that the coating improved scale adhesion after a 100 h oxidation at 850 degrees C. At 900 degrees C, the film was still capable of blocking 70% of the Cr that evaporated from an uncoated Ebrite substrate.",Effects of surface-deposited nanocrystalline chromite thin films on the performance of a ferritic interconnect alloy,10.1149/1.2756368
