2,19938,The microstructural and physical characteristics of composite cathode powders have been explored in terms of SSC loading and calcination temperature.,Effect of SSC Loading and Calcination Temperature on The Phase and Microstructure Formation of SSC-SDCC Cathode,
3,19938,"SSC-SDCC composite powders were intimately mixed by employing fast high energy ball milling (HEBM) method with three different SSC loadings which includes of 50, 60 and 70 wt. % and subjected to various calcination temperatures from 600 degrees C to 750 degrees C. Subsequently, the calcined cathode powders were then used to fabricate composite pellets using a uniaxial press and undergo sintering process at a temperature of 600 degrees C. Microstructural behavior of the composite cathode powders was examined using X- Ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS).",Effect of SSC Loading and Calcination Temperature on The Phase and Microstructure Formation of SSC-SDCC Cathode,
4,19938,The physical properties sintered composite pellets were also investigated from the observation on Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).,Effect of SSC Loading and Calcination Temperature on The Phase and Microstructure Formation of SSC-SDCC Cathode,
