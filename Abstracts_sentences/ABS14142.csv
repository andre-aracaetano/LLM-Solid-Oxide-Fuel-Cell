6,14142,We also report a unique dimer-mediated cooperative mechanism of the high oxide-ion conduction of Ba7Nb3.8Mo1.2O20.1 (bulk conductivities in dry air: 10 mS cm(-1) at 593 degrees C and 1.1 mS cm(-1) at 306 degrees C).,Dimer-Mediated Cooperative Mechanism of Ultrafast-Ion Conduction in Hexagonal Perovskite-Related Oxides,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c02378
7,14142,"Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, neutron-diffraction experiments at 800 degrees C, and neutron scattering length density analyses of Ba7Nb3.8Mo1.2O20.1 indicated that the excess oxygen atoms are incorporated by the formation of both 5-fold coordinated (Nb/Mo)O-5 monomer and its (Nb/Mo)(2)O-9 dimer with a corner-sharing oxygen atom and that the breaking and reforming of the dimers lead to the high oxide-ion conduction in the oxygen-deficient BaO2.1 c ' layer.",Dimer-Mediated Cooperative Mechanism of Ultrafast-Ion Conduction in Hexagonal Perovskite-Related Oxides,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c02378
