1,19617,The state-of-the-art materials for SOFCs are yttria-stabilized zirconia as electrolyte and lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite as cathode.,Multi-scale analysis of the diffusion barrier layer of gadolinia-doped ceria in a solid oxide fuel cell operated in a stack for 3000 h,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.109
2,19617,"However, the formation of insulating phases between them requires the use of diffusion barriers, typically made of gadolinia doped ceria.",Multi-scale analysis of the diffusion barrier layer of gadolinia-doped ceria in a solid oxide fuel cell operated in a stack for 3000 h,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.109
3,19617,The study of the stability of this layer during the fabrication and in operando is currently one of the major goals of the SOFC industry.,Multi-scale analysis of the diffusion barrier layer of gadolinia-doped ceria in a solid oxide fuel cell operated in a stack for 3000 h,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.109
4,19617,"In this work, the cation inter-diffusion at the cathode/barrier layer/electrolyte region is analysed for an anode-supported cell industrially fabricated by conventional techniques, assembled in a short-stack and tested under real operation conditions for 3000 h. A comprehensive study of this cell, and an equivalent non-operated one, is performed in order to understand the inter-diffusion mechanisms with possible effects on the final performance.",Multi-scale analysis of the diffusion barrier layer of gadolinia-doped ceria in a solid oxide fuel cell operated in a stack for 3000 h,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.109
