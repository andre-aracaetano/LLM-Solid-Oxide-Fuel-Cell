1,10438,"A novel method of fabricating NiO-YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) anode substrates is developed using a composite pore former, i.e., PMMA (polymethyl-methacrylate) and carbon black or zirconium hydroxide Zr(OH)(4).",Fabrication of anode support for solid oxide fuel cell using zirconium hydroxide as a pore former,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.109
2,10438,"By utilizing a composite pore former, both the shrinkage and porosity, which must be compatible with that of the electrolyte film and sufficient for the fuel supply and exhaust, are easily tailored.",Fabrication of anode support for solid oxide fuel cell using zirconium hydroxide as a pore former,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.109
3,10438,"Carbon black and the inorganic pore former (Zr(OH)(4)) affect the shrinkage of the anode substrate more effectively than its porosity, while the polymer spheres (PMMA) adjust the porosity more effectively.",Fabrication of anode support for solid oxide fuel cell using zirconium hydroxide as a pore former,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.109
4,10438,"In particular, the successful use of zirconium hydroxide as a fine pore former, instead of carbon black, suggests that other zirconium or nickel compound derivatives may be used as pore formers.",Fabrication of anode support for solid oxide fuel cell using zirconium hydroxide as a pore former,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.109
