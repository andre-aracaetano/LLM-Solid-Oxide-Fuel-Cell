1,4418,We propose an enhanced integrated hydrogen production system that includes biological processes.,"Enhanced hydrogen production from indirectly heated, gasified biomass, and removal of carbon gas emissions using a novel biological gas reformer",10.1016/S0360-3199(03)00135-6
2,4418,"Biomass gasification, achieved through the periodic combustion and pyrolysis of solid organic waste (under anaerobic conditions), results in a producer-gas stream consisting predominantly of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen.","Enhanced hydrogen production from indirectly heated, gasified biomass, and removal of carbon gas emissions using a novel biological gas reformer",10.1016/S0360-3199(03)00135-6
3,4418,This producer gas is typically used as a fuel in high temperature combustion.,"Enhanced hydrogen production from indirectly heated, gasified biomass, and removal of carbon gas emissions using a novel biological gas reformer",10.1016/S0360-3199(03)00135-6
4,4418,"In the modified process, the producer gas is used to generate electricity using a combination of high-temperature (Solid oxide) and low-temperature (Proton exchange membrane) fuel cells.","Enhanced hydrogen production from indirectly heated, gasified biomass, and removal of carbon gas emissions using a novel biological gas reformer",10.1016/S0360-3199(03)00135-6
5,4418,"Carbon monoxide is reformed to additional H-2 using a biological system; an anaerobic bacterium, Rubrivivax gelatinosus CBS that can enzymatically convert CO and H2O into CO2 and H-2.","Enhanced hydrogen production from indirectly heated, gasified biomass, and removal of carbon gas emissions using a novel biological gas reformer",10.1016/S0360-3199(03)00135-6
6,4418,R. gelatinosus CBS can also sequester CO2 as biomass.,"Enhanced hydrogen production from indirectly heated, gasified biomass, and removal of carbon gas emissions using a novel biological gas reformer",10.1016/S0360-3199(03)00135-6
7,4418,"While the heating value does not vary significantly between the two streams, we propose that a larger hydrogen fraction can increase the value of this fuel, especially in the context of fuel cell applications.","Enhanced hydrogen production from indirectly heated, gasified biomass, and removal of carbon gas emissions using a novel biological gas reformer",10.1016/S0360-3199(03)00135-6
