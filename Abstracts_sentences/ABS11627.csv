2,11627,"In order to enhance the oxygen transfer in-plane, the interconnector with sinusoidal wavy channel is proposed for SOFC, termed the sinusoidal wavy interconnector (SWI).",A novel sinusoidal wavy interconnector for improved performance of SOFC,10.1007/s11581-023-04972-6
3,11627,The effect of SWI is evaluated by numerical method.,A novel sinusoidal wavy interconnector for improved performance of SOFC,10.1007/s11581-023-04972-6
4,11627,"The oxygen transfer in-plane is promoted, especially at trough position, where the rib width is minimum.",A novel sinusoidal wavy interconnector for improved performance of SOFC,10.1007/s11581-023-04972-6
5,11627,"For SWI, the maximum oxygen concentration achieves 0.21 mol/m(3) on the center line of the cathode/electrolyte interface, which is almost zero for the conventional interconnector.",A novel sinusoidal wavy interconnector for improved performance of SOFC,10.1007/s11581-023-04972-6
6,11627,"Finally, the effect of amplitude and cycle number on SOFC performance is investigated in detail.",A novel sinusoidal wavy interconnector for improved performance of SOFC,10.1007/s11581-023-04972-6
7,11627,The result shows that the average oxygen concentration enhances with the increase of amplitude (A) and cycle number (Pe).,A novel sinusoidal wavy interconnector for improved performance of SOFC,10.1007/s11581-023-04972-6
8,11627,"When A is 0.4 mm, the average oxygen concentration is 1.51 mol/m(3), an increase of 14.39 % from the conventional interconnector (A = 0 mm) of 1.32 mol/m(3).",A novel sinusoidal wavy interconnector for improved performance of SOFC,10.1007/s11581-023-04972-6
9,11627,"In addition, for A = 0.25 mm, the average oxygen on the cathode/electrolyte interface is improved by 18% when Pe increases from 0 to 16.",A novel sinusoidal wavy interconnector for improved performance of SOFC,10.1007/s11581-023-04972-6
10,11627,"On the other hand, if the amplitude or cycle number is too large, the hindrance caused by the undulating side surface of SWI results in remarkable power consumption.",A novel sinusoidal wavy interconnector for improved performance of SOFC,10.1007/s11581-023-04972-6
11,11627,"Hence, when cycle number is 16, the effective power achieves the maximum at A = 0.35 mm, which increases by 18.3% compared to the conventional interconnector (A = 0).",A novel sinusoidal wavy interconnector for improved performance of SOFC,10.1007/s11581-023-04972-6
