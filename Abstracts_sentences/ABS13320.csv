1,13320,This study focuses on development of Nickel-Yttira Stabilized Zirconia (Ni/YSZ) based anode material by solid-state synthesis using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in varying weight concentrations (3 wt.% and 6 wt.%) both as a binder and as a pore-former.,"Synthesis of Ni/YSZ based anode and investigation of effect of PVA as pore-former upon porosity, microstructure and thermal behavior for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)",10.3139/146.111713
2,13320,Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction based structural and morphological analyses were performed and the synthesis of a homogeneous NiO/YSZ phase was confirmed after sintering at 1000 degrees C. Microscopic study investigating effects of PVA concentration upon pore density in pellets pressed under the same conditions was conducted.,"Synthesis of Ni/YSZ based anode and investigation of effect of PVA as pore-former upon porosity, microstructure and thermal behavior for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)",10.3139/146.111713
3,13320,Thermo-gravimetric/differential thermal analysis of the powders pre-dried at around 120 degrees C was carried out up to 1000 degrees C to investigate the phase change and the thermal decomposition behavior.,"Synthesis of Ni/YSZ based anode and investigation of effect of PVA as pore-former upon porosity, microstructure and thermal behavior for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)",10.3139/146.111713
4,13320,Findings on reduction of NiO/YSZ in a mixed atmosphere of H-2/Ar at 550 degrees C are also discussed in detail.,"Synthesis of Ni/YSZ based anode and investigation of effect of PVA as pore-former upon porosity, microstructure and thermal behavior for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)",10.3139/146.111713
5,13320,"The results demonstrated that areal porosity of 12% and 24% was achieved with 3 wt.% and 6 wt.% of PVA, respectively.","Synthesis of Ni/YSZ based anode and investigation of effect of PVA as pore-former upon porosity, microstructure and thermal behavior for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)",10.3139/146.111713
