5,351,"The operation of a fuel-cell system requires not merely one or more fuel-cell stacks, but also sub-systems to condition the process flows and utilise the residual heat.",ENERGY ANALYSIS OF A FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,
6,351,"Earlier studies have shown that a high degree of integration significantly improves the efficiency of fuel-cell systems; at the same time, however, it makes systems more complex.",ENERGY ANALYSIS OF A FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,
7,351,"Calculations of the efficiency of Various configurations and system options can be made, but they offer only limited insight into losses and the possibilities of raising system efficiency.",ENERGY ANALYSIS OF A FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,
8,351,"Based on the system calculations, therefore, an exergy analysis has been made to determine the cause of losses and to assess the potential for improving the system.",ENERGY ANALYSIS OF A FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,
9,351,A 1 MW system with solid oxide fuel cells for the production of heat and power was modelled.,ENERGY ANALYSIS OF A FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,
10,351,The analysis shows that heat-transfer is the cause of large losses.,ENERGY ANALYSIS OF A FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,
11,351,Exergy losses are greatly reduced if the amount of heat transferred in the system is reduced-for example by the use of internal reforming.,ENERGY ANALYSIS OF A FUEL-CELL SYSTEM,
