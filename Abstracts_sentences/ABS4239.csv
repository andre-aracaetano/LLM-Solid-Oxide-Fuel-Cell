1,4239,"Lanthanum-based iron- and cobalt-containing perovskite is a promising cathode material because of its electrocatalytic activity at a relatively low operating temperature in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), i.e., 700-800 degrees C. To enhance the electrocatalytic reduction of oxidants on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF), nanocrystalline LSCF materials are successfully fabricated using a complexing method with chelants and inorganic nano dispersants.",Nano-structured cathodes based on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.029
2,4239,"When inorganic dispersants are added to the synthesis process, the surface area of the LSCF powder increases from 18 to 88 m(2) g(-1), which results in higher electrocatalytic activity of the cathode.",Nano-structured cathodes based on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.029
3,4239,"The performance of a unit cell of a SOFC with nanocrystalline LSCF powders synthesized with nano dispersants is increased by 60%, from 0.7 to 1.2 W cm(-2).",Nano-structured cathodes based on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.029
