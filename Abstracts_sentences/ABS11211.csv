3,11211,"According to the direction of inlet flow and outlet flow, the designs of the stack can be divided into U-type structure and Z-type structure, and stacks with two structural characteristics should have some similar flow characteristics.",Simulation of two types fuel cell stack models to investigate the relationship between air flow distribution and structure,10.1007/s11581-019-03059-5
4,11211,"Researchers generally have different degrees of understanding of Z- or U-type characteristics, but there are few intuitive experiments and reports on these two types of structures at a larger stack scale.",Simulation of two types fuel cell stack models to investigate the relationship between air flow distribution and structure,10.1007/s11581-019-03059-5
