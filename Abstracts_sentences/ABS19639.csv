2,19639,"In cathode supported SOEC, the main structural component is the Ni(O)-YSZ support.",Mechanical Properties of Supports and Half-Cells for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Influenced by Alumina-Zirconia Composites,10.1002/fuce.201600036
3,19639,But the strength of the half-cell or cell is also determined by the strength of other weaker components and by the residual stress state induced by the thermal expansion mismatch.,Mechanical Properties of Supports and Half-Cells for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Influenced by Alumina-Zirconia Composites,10.1002/fuce.201600036
4,19639,"In this study, the mechanical properties of Ni(O)-3YSZ supports with a reference composition and with substitution of 3YSZ by 20A3YSZ (3YSZ with 20 wt.% Al2O3) have been tested and compared.",Mechanical Properties of Supports and Half-Cells for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Influenced by Alumina-Zirconia Composites,10.1002/fuce.201600036
5,19639,The initial interest of this substitution are a decrease of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch within the half-cell and the fact that 20A3YSZ is stronger than 3YSZ.,Mechanical Properties of Supports and Half-Cells for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Influenced by Alumina-Zirconia Composites,10.1002/fuce.201600036
6,19639,"The influence of the process on the composition, strength, elastic properties and electrical conductivity of the supports have been measured and analyzed.",Mechanical Properties of Supports and Half-Cells for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Influenced by Alumina-Zirconia Composites,10.1002/fuce.201600036
