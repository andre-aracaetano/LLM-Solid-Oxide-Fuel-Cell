1,18897,A cyclic reduction and oxidation of Ni/YSZ-cermet anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) resulted in an increase of the polarization resistance.,Kinetics of oxidation and reduction of Ni/YSZ cermets,10.1007/BF02376545
2,18897,"Therefore, investigations concerning kinetics of oxidation/reduction and the impact of redox cycles on the mi-crostructure of Ni/YSZ bulk ceramics were made.",Kinetics of oxidation and reduction of Ni/YSZ cermets,10.1007/BF02376545
3,18897,The reaction process of the basic system Ni/NiO was compared with cermet bulk samples and the influence of NiO and YSZ particle sizes and sintering temperatures on kinetics and microstructure was studied using thermo-gravimetry and dilatometry.,Kinetics of oxidation and reduction of Ni/YSZ cermets,10.1007/BF02376545
4,18897,"The investigations on bulk ceramics indicated that no length change occurred during reduction, whereas reoxidation led to an increase in the length of the samples which strongly depended on the microstructure.",Kinetics of oxidation and reduction of Ni/YSZ cermets,10.1007/BF02376545
5,18897,It was shown that bulk samples sintered at temperatures below 1300 degreesC can withstand redox cycles much better than those sintered at higher temperatures.,Kinetics of oxidation and reduction of Ni/YSZ cermets,10.1007/BF02376545
6,18897,"Furthermore, it was found that by decreasing the NiO particle size and using a NiO/YSZ particle size ratio of aproximately 3:2, a smaller length increase after reoxidation was achieved.",Kinetics of oxidation and reduction of Ni/YSZ cermets,10.1007/BF02376545
7,18897,An increase of the polarization resistance could be ascribed to the formation of cracks within the bulk sample which interrupt current paths and therefore reduce the amount of the active triple phase boundary.,Kinetics of oxidation and reduction of Ni/YSZ cermets,10.1007/BF02376545
