1,20551,"In co-ionic conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), both oxygen ion (O2-) and proton (H+) can transport through the electrolyte, generating steam in both the anode and cathode.",Mathematical analysis of SOFC based on co-ionic conducting electrolyte,10.1007/s10409-013-0040-3
2,20551,Thus the mass transport phenomenon in the electrodes is quite different from that in conventional SOFC with oxygen ion conducting electrolyte (O-SOFC) or with proton conducting electrolyte (H-SOFC).,Mathematical analysis of SOFC based on co-ionic conducting electrolyte,10.1007/s10409-013-0040-3
3,20551,The generation of steam in both electrodes also affects the concentration over-potential loss and further the SOFC performance.,Mathematical analysis of SOFC based on co-ionic conducting electrolyte,10.1007/s10409-013-0040-3
4,20551,"However, no detailed modeling study on SOFCs with co-ionic electrolyte has been reported yet.",Mathematical analysis of SOFC based on co-ionic conducting electrolyte,10.1007/s10409-013-0040-3
5,20551,"In this paper, a new mathematical model for SOFC based on co-ionic electrolyte was developed to predict its actual performance considering three major kinds of overpotentials.",Mathematical analysis of SOFC based on co-ionic conducting electrolyte,10.1007/s10409-013-0040-3
6,20551,"Ohm's law and the Butler-Volmer formula were used to model the ion conduction and electrochemical reactions, respectively.",Mathematical analysis of SOFC based on co-ionic conducting electrolyte,10.1007/s10409-013-0040-3
7,20551,The dusty gas model (DGM) was employed to simulate the mass transport processes in the porous electrodes.,Mathematical analysis of SOFC based on co-ionic conducting electrolyte,10.1007/s10409-013-0040-3
8,20551,Parametric simulations were performed to investigate the effects of proton transfer number (t(H)) and current density (j(total)) on the cell performance.,Mathematical analysis of SOFC based on co-ionic conducting electrolyte,10.1007/s10409-013-0040-3
9,20551,It is interesting to find that the co-ionic conducting SOFC could perform better than O-SOFC and H-SOFC by choosing an appropriate proton transfer number.,Mathematical analysis of SOFC based on co-ionic conducting electrolyte,10.1007/s10409-013-0040-3
10,20551,"In addition, the co-ionic SOFC shows smaller difference between the anode and cathode concentration overpotentials than O-SOFC and H-SOFC at certain t(H) values.",Mathematical analysis of SOFC based on co-ionic conducting electrolyte,10.1007/s10409-013-0040-3
