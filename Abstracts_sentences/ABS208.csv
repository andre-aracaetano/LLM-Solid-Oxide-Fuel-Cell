1,208,"A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrochemically converts chemical energy of a fuel into electricity at temperatures from about 650 to 1000 degrees C. SOFCs offer certain advantages over lower temperature fuel cells, notably ability to use CO as a fuel rather than being poisoned by it, and high grade exhaust heat for combined heat and power, or combined cycle gas turbine applications.","Solid oxide fuel cells: status, challenges and opportunities",
2,208,"This paper reviews the operating principle, materials for different cell and stack components, cell designs, and applications of SOFCs.","Solid oxide fuel cells: status, challenges and opportunities",
3,208,"Among different designs of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), the electrical resistance of tubular SOFCs is high, and areal power density (W/cm(2)) and volumetric power density (W/cm(3)) low.","Solid oxide fuel cells: status, challenges and opportunities",
4,208,"Planar SOFCs, in contrast, are capable of achieving very high power densities.","Solid oxide fuel cells: status, challenges and opportunities",
