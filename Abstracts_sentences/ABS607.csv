2,607,"The triode cell configuration entails the introduction of a third electrode in addition to the anode and cathode, driven by an auxiliary circuit which is run in electrolytic mode.",Enhanced Carbon Deposition Tolerance of SOFC Anodes Under Triode Operation,10.1007/s11244-015-0498-2
3,607,"In this way the cell is forced to operate at controlled potential differences that are inaccessible under standard operation, and thus introduces a controllable variable into fuel cell operation.",Enhanced Carbon Deposition Tolerance of SOFC Anodes Under Triode Operation,10.1007/s11244-015-0498-2
4,607,"In the present study, the effectiveness of the triode approach was evaluated for the in situ control of the rate of carbon deposition in commercial multilayer NiO-GDC and NiOYSZ SOFC anodes.",Enhanced Carbon Deposition Tolerance of SOFC Anodes Under Triode Operation,10.1007/s11244-015-0498-2
5,607,"The study involved typical and triode operation of SOFC button cells under CH4 steam reforming conditions, and it was found that the application of a small electrolytic current under triode operation resulted in significantly less carbon built-up on the anode compared to the standard SOFC operation.",Enhanced Carbon Deposition Tolerance of SOFC Anodes Under Triode Operation,10.1007/s11244-015-0498-2
