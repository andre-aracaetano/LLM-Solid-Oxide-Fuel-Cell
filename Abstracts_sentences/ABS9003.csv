3,9003,The fuel cell showed relatively high initial performance (0.49 Watt/cm(2) at 800 degrees C) for the given electrolyte thickness (similar to 170 mu m).,Stability and Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Nanocomposite Electrodes,10.1149/2.050206jes
4,9003,Long term stability tests showed that the power density dropped to 0.41 Watt/cm(2) in the first 60 hours of operation in short circuit conditions and no further change in the power density was observed.,Stability and Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Nanocomposite Electrodes,10.1149/2.050206jes
5,9003,Low electrode polarization resistance was obtained (similar to 0.080 Ohm.cm(2) for combined anode and cathode at 800 degrees C) which showed no significant change with prolonged time.,Stability and Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Nanocomposite Electrodes,10.1149/2.050206jes
6,9003,The slight drop in power density was related to the change in ohmic resistance which was attributed to the increase in current collection resistance.,Stability and Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Nanocomposite Electrodes,10.1149/2.050206jes
7,9003,The fact that the majority of the resistance was due to the electrolyte resistance (similar to 80%) suggests that stable SOFCs with high power densities could be achieved with thinner electrolytes.,Stability and Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Nanocomposite Electrodes,10.1149/2.050206jes
