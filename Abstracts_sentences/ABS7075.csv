2,7075,"Partial oxidation reforming (POX) can be used to simplify the SOFC system structure, but its lower hydrogen production rate deteriorates the system performance.",Influence of Off Gas Recirculation on the Intermediate Temperature SOFC With Partial Oxidation Reformer,10.1115/1.4055393
3,7075,A wise method may be combining anode off gas recirculation (AOGR) and cathode off gas recirculation (COGR) with POX.,Influence of Off Gas Recirculation on the Intermediate Temperature SOFC With Partial Oxidation Reformer,10.1115/1.4055393
4,7075,"Thus, their influence on the coupled system of intermediate temperature SOFC and POX is researched in detail in this paper.",Influence of Off Gas Recirculation on the Intermediate Temperature SOFC With Partial Oxidation Reformer,10.1115/1.4055393
5,7075,Results show that the reforming process gradually changes from exothermic to endothermic as AOGR rate increases.,Influence of Off Gas Recirculation on the Intermediate Temperature SOFC With Partial Oxidation Reformer,10.1115/1.4055393
6,7075,"Meanwhile, its oxygen demand declines sharply and the process can even be self-sustained without external air input at the AOGR rate of 0.5 and 0.6.",Influence of Off Gas Recirculation on the Intermediate Temperature SOFC With Partial Oxidation Reformer,10.1115/1.4055393
7,7075,"The application of AOGR can improve electrical efficiency by up to 51%, but at the expense of thermal efficiency.",Influence of Off Gas Recirculation on the Intermediate Temperature SOFC With Partial Oxidation Reformer,10.1115/1.4055393
8,7075,"Excessive AOGR rates will result in decreased cell voltage and insufficient energy supply to the after-burner, so it should be restricted within a reasonable range and the best recommended value is 0.5.",Influence of Off Gas Recirculation on the Intermediate Temperature SOFC With Partial Oxidation Reformer,10.1115/1.4055393
9,7075,"The application of COGR has little effect on fuel line parameters, so it causes little deterioration in electrical efficiency while improving thermal efficiency.",Influence of Off Gas Recirculation on the Intermediate Temperature SOFC With Partial Oxidation Reformer,10.1115/1.4055393
10,7075,"Besides, the cell voltage is also insensitive to it.",Influence of Off Gas Recirculation on the Intermediate Temperature SOFC With Partial Oxidation Reformer,10.1115/1.4055393
11,7075,"The combination of AOGR and COGR can obtain better fuel economy and larger cogeneration scale simultaneously at the cost of a tiny electrical output power, while an optimal balance between three efficiencies is also achieved.",Influence of Off Gas Recirculation on the Intermediate Temperature SOFC With Partial Oxidation Reformer,10.1115/1.4055393
