1,23,"It is common knowledge that efficiency of fuel cells is highest when no electric current is produced while when the fuel cell is really working, the efficiency is reduced by dissipation.",Detailed thermodynamic analysis of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell efficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.03.149
2,23,In this paper the relation between efficiency and dissipation inside the fuel cell is formulated within the framework of classical irreversible thermodynamics of mixtures.,Detailed thermodynamic analysis of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell efficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.03.149
3,23,It is shown that not only dissipation influences the efficiency but that there are also some other terms which become important if there are steep temperature gradients inside the fuel cell.,Detailed thermodynamic analysis of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell efficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.03.149
4,23,"Indeed, we show that the new terms are negligible in polymer-electrolyte membrane fuel cells while they become important in solid oxide fuel cells.",Detailed thermodynamic analysis of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell efficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.03.149
5,23,"In summary, this paper presents a formulation of non-equilibrium thermodynamics of fuel cells and provides analysis of efficiency in terms of processes inside the fuel cells, revealing some new terms affecting the efficiency.",Detailed thermodynamic analysis of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell efficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.03.149
