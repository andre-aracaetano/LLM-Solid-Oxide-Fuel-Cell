1,5529,"Compared with planar-type solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), mono-block-layer build (MOLB)-type SOFCs have additional three-phase boundaries per unit volume, and their performance is severely limited by their longer current path.",Performance Investigation on Mono-Block-Layer Build Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with a Vertical Rib Design,10.3390/en15030979
2,5529,"To resolve this issue, a vertical rib design, which was evaluated using a numerical method, was proposed.",Performance Investigation on Mono-Block-Layer Build Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with a Vertical Rib Design,10.3390/en15030979
3,5529,"Compared with the conventional design, the power density for the vertical rib design increased by 12.32%.",Performance Investigation on Mono-Block-Layer Build Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with a Vertical Rib Design,10.3390/en15030979
4,5529,"This is because the vertical rib design provides another short path for current, which not only reduces the ohmic loss in the cathode, but also decreases the ohmic polarization caused by the contact resistance.",Performance Investigation on Mono-Block-Layer Build Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with a Vertical Rib Design,10.3390/en15030979
5,5529,"However, the vertical rib design hinders the transport of oxygen in the cathode and increases the concentration loss.",Performance Investigation on Mono-Block-Layer Build Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with a Vertical Rib Design,10.3390/en15030979
6,5529,"Therefore, the vertical rib size design is crucial.",Performance Investigation on Mono-Block-Layer Build Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with a Vertical Rib Design,10.3390/en15030979
7,5529,"Based on the influence of the vertical rib width, the vertical rib widths on the cathode and anode sides of 0.7 and 1 mm are recommended for different contact resistances, respectively.",Performance Investigation on Mono-Block-Layer Build Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with a Vertical Rib Design,10.3390/en15030979
