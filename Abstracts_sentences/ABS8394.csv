1,8394,Chromium contamination of metal oxides and SOFC cathode catalysts is studied in the range 700-1000 degrees C. Samples are exposed to a moist air atmosphere saturated with volatile Cr species in the presence and absence of direct contact between the sample and ferritic stainless steel powder.,A fundamental study of chromium deposition on solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.017
2,8394,Chromium contamination of the samples is observed to occur via two separate pathways: surface diffusion from the stainless steel surface and vapor deposition from the atmosphere.,A fundamental study of chromium deposition on solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.017
3,8394,Surface diffusion dominates in all cases.,A fundamental study of chromium deposition on solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.017
4,8394,"Surface diffusion is found to be a significant source of Cr contamination for LSM and LSCF at 700, 800, and 1000 degrees C. Vapor deposition of Cr onto LSCF was observed at each of these temperatures, but was not observed for LSM at 700 or 800 degrees C. Comparison of the behavior for LSM, LSCF, and single metal oxides suggests that Mn and Co, respectively, are responsible for the Cr contamination of these catalysts.",A fundamental study of chromium deposition on solid oxide fuel cell cathode materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.017
