1,1660,We compare the environmental side effects of power plants based on fuel cell technology with the side effects of conventional electric power plants based on coal and natural gas.,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ENERGY FACILITIES - FUEL-CELL TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH COAL AND CONVENTIONAL GAS TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/0378-7753(91)80003-G
2,1660,The environmental impact of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) plant is very much less than that of a coal-fired plant (a factor of 1/300 for air pollution and a factor of 1/5 for water pollution).,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ENERGY FACILITIES - FUEL-CELL TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH COAL AND CONVENTIONAL GAS TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/0378-7753(91)80003-G
3,1660,"Compared with a conventional gas plant, impact is reduced by between 50 and 98%.",ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ENERGY FACILITIES - FUEL-CELL TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH COAL AND CONVENTIONAL GAS TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/0378-7753(91)80003-G
4,1660,Damage to cultural monuments and buildings is negligible from a fuel cell plant.,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ENERGY FACILITIES - FUEL-CELL TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH COAL AND CONVENTIONAL GAS TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/0378-7753(91)80003-G
5,1660,Socioeconomic negative impacts are reduced by about 30% relative to conventional gas plants (aesthetics and noise) whereas employment is unaltered.,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ENERGY FACILITIES - FUEL-CELL TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH COAL AND CONVENTIONAL GAS TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/0378-7753(91)80003-G
6,1660,Impact on health and safety is greatly reduced compared with that from coal-fired plants and is about 70% of that from conventional gas plants.,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ENERGY FACILITIES - FUEL-CELL TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH COAL AND CONVENTIONAL GAS TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/0378-7753(91)80003-G
7,1660,"Preliminary results suggest that society's willingness to pay (WTP) for clean air, and thereby better health, matches the cost of installing emission-reducing equipment on conventional power plants.",ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ENERGY FACILITIES - FUEL-CELL TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH COAL AND CONVENTIONAL GAS TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/0378-7753(91)80003-G
8,1660,"There is probably an additional WTP for other benefits (e.g., decreased risk of global warming).",ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ENERGY FACILITIES - FUEL-CELL TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH COAL AND CONVENTIONAL GAS TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/0378-7753(91)80003-G
9,1660,"Thus, the utility of very small emissions, lower CO2 discharges, and other benefits from SOFC generators may compensate for the increased cost incurred in producing electricity by SOFC generators.",ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ENERGY FACILITIES - FUEL-CELL TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH COAL AND CONVENTIONAL GAS TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/0378-7753(91)80003-G
