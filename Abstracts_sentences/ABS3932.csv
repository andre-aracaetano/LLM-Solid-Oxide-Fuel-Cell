1,3932,"Structure stability and electrical conductivity of La1-xSrxFe0.8Cu0.2O3-delta with x = 0.2, 0.4 were investigated both in air and in hydrogen to explore their potential applications as symmetric electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells.",Copper-doped lanthanum ferrites for symmetric SOFCs,10.1016/j.actamat.2016.04.015
2,3932,La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.5Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte supported symmetric fuel cells were fabricated and tested in air/hydrogen ambient in 650-800 degrees C temperature range achieving a maximum power density of 162 mW cm(-2).,Copper-doped lanthanum ferrites for symmetric SOFCs,10.1016/j.actamat.2016.04.015
3,3932,"To improve the cell performance, a composite electrode (70 wt% La1-xSrxFe0.8Cu0.2O3-delta-30 wt% Gd0.2Ce0.8O3-delta) was successfully evaluated both at the anode and the cathode sides decreasing the cell polarization resistance to 0.454 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C and reaching a single cell maximum power density of 294 mW cm(-2).",Copper-doped lanthanum ferrites for symmetric SOFCs,10.1016/j.actamat.2016.04.015
