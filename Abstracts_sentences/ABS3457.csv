1,3457,"An increased interest in using hydrocarbons in solid oxide fuel cells for the production of power has led to research into operation on synthesis (syn) gas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.",The effect of synthesis gas composition on the performance of Ni-based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cherd.2015.07.008
2,3457,"Hydrocarbons are typically reformed, either internally or in an external reformer prior to the fuel cell, producing syngas with various H-2:CO ratios depending on the hydrocarbon used.",The effect of synthesis gas composition on the performance of Ni-based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cherd.2015.07.008
3,3457,This paper examines the effect of varying the H-2:CO ratio with respect to C-1 to C-4 steam reforming reactions and additionally a mixture containing a higher ratio of carbon monoxide.,The effect of synthesis gas composition on the performance of Ni-based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cherd.2015.07.008
4,3457,It was found that there was no significant relationship between cell performance and H-2 :CO ratio when a high feed rate was employed.,The effect of synthesis gas composition on the performance of Ni-based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cherd.2015.07.008
5,3457,"For low flow rates, however, the high carbon monoxide concentration resulted in a significant decrease in cell performance.",The effect of synthesis gas composition on the performance of Ni-based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cherd.2015.07.008
6,3457,It was determined that this was caused by reversible carbon deposition as opposed to a decrease in carbon monoxide reactivity.,The effect of synthesis gas composition on the performance of Ni-based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cherd.2015.07.008
