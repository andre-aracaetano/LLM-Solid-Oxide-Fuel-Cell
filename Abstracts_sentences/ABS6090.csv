9,6090,"At the early stage of the heat-treatment, lanthanum-containing oxides such as La2O3 and La2CrO6 formed, and as the heat-treatment temperature was increased, an oxidation protective perovskite-type LaCrO3 layer was produced by the reaction between the lanthanum-containing oxide and the Cr2O3 scale on the SUS substrate.",Lanthanum oxide-coated stainless steel for bipolar plates in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.12.053
