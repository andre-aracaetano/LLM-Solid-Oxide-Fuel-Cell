1,8433,Ceres Power Ltd (Ceres Power) has been spun-out from Imperial College London (Imperial) after more than 10 years fundamental research.,Spinning-out a fuel cell company from a UK University - 2 years of progress at Ceres Power,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.077
2,8433,"The studies have shown that is possible to combine ceramic materials, based around doped cerium oxide, with stainless-steel to produce a robust intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) capable of operating at 500-600 degreesC. Ceres Power has been formed to exploit this technology commercially.",Spinning-out a fuel cell company from a UK University - 2 years of progress at Ceres Power,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.077
