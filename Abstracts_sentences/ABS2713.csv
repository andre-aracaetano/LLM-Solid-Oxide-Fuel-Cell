1,2713,A low temperature densification process of an electrolyte for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has been developed by utilizing controlled electrode microtubular support shrinkage.,Low temperature densification process of solid-oxide fuel cell electrolyte controlled by anode support shrinkage,10.1039/c1ra00189b
2,2713,"This technology enables reduction of the co-sintering temperature for the electrolyte and the electrode (anode) support to temperatures as low as 1250 degrees C, resulting in the realization of a new anode microstructure using conventional, commercially available materials, NiO and Sc stabilized ZrO(2).",Low temperature densification process of solid-oxide fuel cell electrolyte controlled by anode support shrinkage,10.1039/c1ra00189b
3,2713,"The new microtubular SOFC has shown high fuel cell performances from 0.36, 0.52, and 0.56W cm(-2) and energy efficiencies of 31, 44 and 47% (lower heating value) at 600, 650, and 700 degrees C respectively.",Low temperature densification process of solid-oxide fuel cell electrolyte controlled by anode support shrinkage,10.1039/c1ra00189b
4,2713,"Impedance analysis has also shown that the main contributing factor of the cell performance varies depending upon the operating temperatures, which is of importance for further optimization of the cell structures.",Low temperature densification process of solid-oxide fuel cell electrolyte controlled by anode support shrinkage,10.1039/c1ra00189b
