3,5090,The synthesized SrTiO3-delta and Al-SrTiO3-delta electrolytes are sandwiched between two symmetrical electrodes (Ni foam pasted NCAL).,Perovskite Al-SrTiO3 semiconductor electrolyte with superionic conduction in ceramic fuel cells,10.1039/d2se00643j
4,5090,"Ni-NCAL/SrTiO3-delta/NCAL-Ni and Ni-NCAL/Al-SrTiO3-delta/NCAL-Ni structures delivered a maximum power density of 0.52 W and 0.692 W and high ionic conductivity of 0.11 S cm(-1) and 0.153 S cm(-1), respectively, under H-2/Air atmosphere at low operational temperature of 520 degrees C. Highways of ion transport along the surface and grain boundary (interface) are identified as the main reason for good oxygen ion conduction.",Perovskite Al-SrTiO3 semiconductor electrolyte with superionic conduction in ceramic fuel cells,10.1039/d2se00643j
5,5090,"X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), UV visible (UV), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed to investigate the structural, electrochemical, morphological, surface and interfacial properties of Al-SrTiO3-delta.",Perovskite Al-SrTiO3 semiconductor electrolyte with superionic conduction in ceramic fuel cells,10.1039/d2se00643j
6,5090,The obtained results suggest that a certain amount of Al (20%) doping into SrTiO3 (SrTi0.8Al0.2O3-delta) improves the fuel cell performance and is a promising electrolyte candidate for LT-SOFC.,Perovskite Al-SrTiO3 semiconductor electrolyte with superionic conduction in ceramic fuel cells,10.1039/d2se00643j
