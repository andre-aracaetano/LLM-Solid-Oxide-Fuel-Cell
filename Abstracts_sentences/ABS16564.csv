1,16564,The effect of the presence of sulfide in scales grown on the Crofer 22APU steel in the air + 1% SO2 gas mixture at 1073 K on their area specific resistance has been investigated.,Area specific resistance of the scale formed on Crofer 22APU ferritic steel in atmospheres containing SO2,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.001
2,16564,"Three types of samples were studied: non-pre-oxidized steel exposed to oxidation in the gas mixture of air + 1% SO2 for 300 h, pre-oxidized steel oxidized in air for 200 h and then for 100 h in the gas mixture of air + 1% SO2, and steel oxidized in pure air for 300 h at 1073 K as reference.",Area specific resistance of the scale formed on Crofer 22APU ferritic steel in atmospheres containing SO2,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.001
3,16564,"The structure and microstructure of the scales were characterized by means of XRD, SEM-EDS and TEM-EDX.",Area specific resistance of the scale formed on Crofer 22APU ferritic steel in atmospheres containing SO2,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.001
4,16564,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and dc 2-probe methods were used to determine electrical resistance.,Area specific resistance of the scale formed on Crofer 22APU ferritic steel in atmospheres containing SO2,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.001
5,16564,"TEM-EDX analyses indicate that the scales grown in the mixture of air + 1% SO2 are two-layered and consist of an outer MnCr2O4 spinel containing a small amount of sulfide, probably in the form of MnS, and an inner chromium oxide layer, which is the main oxidation product formed on the Crofer 22APU steel.",Area specific resistance of the scale formed on Crofer 22APU ferritic steel in atmospheres containing SO2,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.001
6,16564,"Since the thickness of both scales is approximately equal, the ASR difference may be attributed to the manganese sulfide content in the studied scales.",Area specific resistance of the scale formed on Crofer 22APU ferritic steel in atmospheres containing SO2,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.001
7,16564,"The reference scale formed on the studied steel in pure air after 300 h of oxidation at 1073 K is thinner than the above scales, and subsequently exhibits a lower resistance.",Area specific resistance of the scale formed on Crofer 22APU ferritic steel in atmospheres containing SO2,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.001
8,16564,The long-term test of ASR for scales formed on the Crofer 22APU steel in the atmosphere containing SO2 showed that they meet the requirements set for interconnect materials in SOFCs.,Area specific resistance of the scale formed on Crofer 22APU ferritic steel in atmospheres containing SO2,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.001
