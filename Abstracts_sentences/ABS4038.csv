1,4038,The 02% hydrogen sulfide (H2S) poisoning of Ni/YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is investigated by varying water content in fuel The degradation extent of the cell voltage decreases with increasing water content (from 0% to 10%),Sulfur-poisoned Ni-based solid oxide fuel cell anode characterization by varying water content,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.015
2,4038,Water can be generated at the anode side through an electrochemical reaction and the content of water product augments upon the addition of fuel However our results indicate that an increase in fuel utilization significantly aggravates H2S poisoning behavior The results of X-ray analysis suggest that the presence of water in fuel cannot affect the final forms of nickel sulfides but microstructural inspection reveals different attack modes upon the injection of vapor (from 0 to 10%) into fuel containing 02% H2S (c) 2010,Sulfur-poisoned Ni-based solid oxide fuel cell anode characterization by varying water content,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.015
