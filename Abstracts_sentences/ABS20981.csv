1,20981,"Ag-CuO is a broadly used reactive air brazing (RAB) system for effectively bonding ceramics and metal interfaces, especially for sealing yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) to metals in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCS).",Computational design of metal oxides to enhance the wetting and adhesion of silver-based brazes on yttria-stabilized-zirconia,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.04.024
2,20981,"To understand the superior performance of this braze, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate two mechanisms that can potentially increase the work of adhesion (W-adh) and hence reduce the wetting angle of Ag on YSZ.",Computational design of metal oxides to enhance the wetting and adhesion of silver-based brazes on yttria-stabilized-zirconia,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.04.024
3,20981,"It was found while the formation of Ag dissolved O clusters at the Ag YSZ interface can promote wetting, a much greater wetting angle reduction comes from the formation of CuO interlayers between Ag and YSZ.",Computational design of metal oxides to enhance the wetting and adhesion of silver-based brazes on yttria-stabilized-zirconia,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.04.024
4,20981,"Further, the W-adh of an Ag/CuO and CuO/YSZ interface was found to be significantly higher than that of an Ag/YSZ interface.",Computational design of metal oxides to enhance the wetting and adhesion of silver-based brazes on yttria-stabilized-zirconia,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.04.024
5,20981,"Based on simulation obtained insights into metal to oxide bond formation, a simple descriptor was developed to predict the Ag/oxide interface energies, the Ag/oxide W-adh, and to search for potential oxide interlayers capable of promoting the wetting and adhesion of Ag on YSZ.",Computational design of metal oxides to enhance the wetting and adhesion of silver-based brazes on yttria-stabilized-zirconia,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.04.024
6,20981,"Many simple metal oxides (single cation) were examined, however their W-adh with Ag were less than that of an Ag/CuO interface.",Computational design of metal oxides to enhance the wetting and adhesion of silver-based brazes on yttria-stabilized-zirconia,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.04.024
7,20981,"Expanding the search to multi-cation oxides led to several promising candidates, such as CulO(2), CuCaO2, and Cu3TiO4; all of which are also stable in the reducing SOFC conditions.",Computational design of metal oxides to enhance the wetting and adhesion of silver-based brazes on yttria-stabilized-zirconia,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.04.024
8,20981,"Depending upon their solubility in molten Ag, these newly-identified oxides could either be pre-applied as wetting promoting interlayers or directly incorporated into Ag to form new reactive air brazes.",Computational design of metal oxides to enhance the wetting and adhesion of silver-based brazes on yttria-stabilized-zirconia,10.1016/j.actamat.2018.04.024
