1,13171,The slow rate of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode side has been considered as a scientific challenge to improve the overall performance of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Suppressing cation segregation on lanthanum-based perovskite oxides to enhance the stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/c6ra15253h
2,13171,"Unfortunately, dopant cation enrichment on the surface of perovskite-type cathode materials often leads directly to the reduction in activity and stability of ORR.",Suppressing cation segregation on lanthanum-based perovskite oxides to enhance the stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/c6ra15253h
3,13171,"For this reason, we quantitatively assessed the main driving force of dopant segregation on LaBO3(001) surfaces (B = Cr0.50Mn0.50, Mn, Fe, Co0.25Fe0.75, Co, and Ni) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",Suppressing cation segregation on lanthanum-based perovskite oxides to enhance the stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/c6ra15253h
4,13171,"Based on our findings, the minimization of elastic energy, which is closely related to the size of both A-site and B-site cations, plays an important role on the A-site dopant segregation.",Suppressing cation segregation on lanthanum-based perovskite oxides to enhance the stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/c6ra15253h
5,13171,The degree of dopant segregation can be controlled by the proper choice of cations contained in LaBO3-type perovskite oxides.,Suppressing cation segregation on lanthanum-based perovskite oxides to enhance the stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/c6ra15253h
6,13171,We therefore suggest a valuable principle that can be applied to design high performance cathode materials by suppressing the dopant cation enrichment at the surface.,Suppressing cation segregation on lanthanum-based perovskite oxides to enhance the stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/c6ra15253h
