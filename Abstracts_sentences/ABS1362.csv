1,1362,A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy.,Flow and reaction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1017/S0022112099008150
2,1362,"The essential difference between a fuel cell and a battery is that the fuel and oxidant are continually supplied to a fuel cell whereas a battery has a finite amount of fuel stored within it which eventually becomes exhausted, after which the battery has to be recharged or replaced.",Flow and reaction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1017/S0022112099008150
3,1362,We consider here a tubular cell which is run on methane.,Flow and reaction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1017/S0022112099008150
