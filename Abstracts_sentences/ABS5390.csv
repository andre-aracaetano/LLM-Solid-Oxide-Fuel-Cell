1,5390,The partial substitution of Co atoms for Ni atoms in the Ni-based cermet anode resulted in a decrease in the anodic overvoltage and interfacial resistance between the anode and electrolyte.,Enhancement of Methane Oxidation at the Cermet Anode Consisting of Nickel-Cobalt and Samaria-Doped Ceria in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
2,5390,This effect has been confirmed for single solid oxide fuel cells using a samaria-doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte.,Enhancement of Methane Oxidation at the Cermet Anode Consisting of Nickel-Cobalt and Samaria-Doped Ceria in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
3,5390,"The results of electrochemical measurements and a product analysis by gas chromatography revealed that the direct oxidation of CH, is enhanced by the modification of the microstructure in the cermet anode, the effect of which is combined with a sufficient oxide ion supply through the electrolyte.",Enhancement of Methane Oxidation at the Cermet Anode Consisting of Nickel-Cobalt and Samaria-Doped Ceria in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
