1,6116,"A micro-tubular, solid oxide fuel cell stack has been developed and operated under single-chamber conditions.","Micro-tubular, solid oxide fuel cell stack operated under single-chamber conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.057
2,6116,"The stack, made of three single-cells, arranged in triangular configuration, was operated between 500 and 700 degrees C with varying methane/air mixtures.","Micro-tubular, solid oxide fuel cell stack operated under single-chamber conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.057
3,6116,The results show that the operating conditions for the stack differ significantly than the single-cell operation reported in our earlier study.,"Micro-tubular, solid oxide fuel cell stack operated under single-chamber conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.057
4,6116,"The stack operated at 600 degrees C with methane/oxygen mixture of 1.0 gives stable performance for up to 48 h, whereas for the single-cell, this mixing ratio was not suitable.","Micro-tubular, solid oxide fuel cell stack operated under single-chamber conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.057
5,6116,"The increase in the inert gas flow rate improves the stack performance up to a certain extent, beyond that; the power output by the stack reduces due to extensive dilution of the reactants.","Micro-tubular, solid oxide fuel cell stack operated under single-chamber conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.057
6,6116,"It is concluded that both, the operating conditions and the addition of inert gas, need to be tuned according to the number of cells present within the stack.","Micro-tubular, solid oxide fuel cell stack operated under single-chamber conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.057
