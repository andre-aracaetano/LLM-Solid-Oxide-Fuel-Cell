3,7333,"Compared with the LSCF nanostructure, the LSCF@PrO2-delta nanofibers with a 3D core-shell heterostructure effectively suppress the segregation of Sr on the surface and improve the stability of the cathode.",New SOFC Cathode: 3D Core-Shell-Structured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d@PrO2-d Nanofibers Prepared by Coaxial Electrospinning,10.1021/acsaem.2c01782
4,7333,"Due to the unique microstructure, large specific surface area, and porosity, the LSCF@ PrO2-delta nanofibers provide a continuous path for charge transfer and extend the three-phase interface that help to improve the ORR activity of the SOFC cathode.",New SOFC Cathode: 3D Core-Shell-Structured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d@PrO2-d Nanofibers Prepared by Coaxial Electrospinning,10.1021/acsaem.2c01782
5,7333,"At 700 ?, the area specific resistance of LSCF@PrO2-delta nanofibers reaches 0.076 omega.cm(2), which is reduced by 35 and 60%, compared with 0.117 omega.cm(2) of LSCF nanofibers and 0.192 omega.cm(2) of the LSCF powder.",New SOFC Cathode: 3D Core-Shell-Structured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d@PrO2-d Nanofibers Prepared by Coaxial Electrospinning,10.1021/acsaem.2c01782
6,7333,"When LSCF@ PrO2-delta nanofibers are used as a single-cell cathode, the peak power density reaches 1.17 W.cm(-2) at 700 ?, and the voltage decay rate of the single cell is only 0.03% per hour after 100 h of long-term stability test.",New SOFC Cathode: 3D Core-Shell-Structured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d@PrO2-d Nanofibers Prepared by Coaxial Electrospinning,10.1021/acsaem.2c01782
7,7333,"Therefore, the 3D core-shell LSCF@PrO2-delta nanofibers provide an alternative approach for obtaining the high-performance SOFC cathode.",New SOFC Cathode: 3D Core-Shell-Structured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d@PrO2-d Nanofibers Prepared by Coaxial Electrospinning,10.1021/acsaem.2c01782
