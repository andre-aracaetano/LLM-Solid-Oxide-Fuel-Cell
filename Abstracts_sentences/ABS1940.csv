1,1940,A new proton conducting Ba0.95K0.05Ce0.6Zr0.2Gd0.16Zn0.04O3-delta electrolyte membrane was prepared on NiO-based anode support by suspension spray followed by a co-sintering at 1400 degrees C for 4 h. Chemical stability test shows that this new proton conductor displays adequate chemical stability against CO2 at intermediate temperatures.,A novel proton conducting Ba0.95K0.05Ce0.6Zr0.2Gd0.16Zn0.04O3-δ for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.06.166
2,1940,"The conductivity Of Ba0.95K0.05Ce0.6Zr0.2Gd0.16Zn0.04O3-delta in humidified H-2 is about 50% higher than that of BaCe0.6Zr0.2Gd0.16Zn0.04O3-delta from 500 to 800 degrees C. With La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta cathode, fuel cell with Ba0.95K0.05Ce0.6Zr0.2Gd0.16Zn0.04O3-delta electrolyte shows 1.02 V of OCV and 354 mW/cm(2) of maximum power density at 700 degrees C. respectively.",A novel proton conducting Ba0.95K0.05Ce0.6Zr0.2Gd0.16Zn0.04O3-δ for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.06.166
