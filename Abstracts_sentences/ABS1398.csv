5,1398,It is interesting to see that part of the carbonate and alkali ions are not formed into the stoichiometric carbonate in sample materials under the typical electrical field condition from the EDS and XPS analysis.,Electrochemical impact of the carbonate in ceria-carbonate composite for low temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.065
6,1398,"Instead, carbonate (CO32-) and alkali ions accumulate in the cathode side, which we believe, was caused by the electrochemical catalyst of CO2 and alkali ions that accelerated the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, while the CO32- ions as one of the charge carriers which diffuse from fuel cell cathode to anode are on account of the concentration gradient.",Electrochemical impact of the carbonate in ceria-carbonate composite for low temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.065
