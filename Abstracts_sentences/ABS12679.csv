5,12679,"As a main anode component, it shows good catalytic activity towards the oxidation of ethane, causing the power density to considerably increase from 158.4 mW cm(-2) to 320.9 mW cm(-2) and the ethane conversion to significantly rise from 12.6% to 30.9%, when the temperature increases from 650 degrees C to 750 degrees C. These changes agree well with the polarization resistance which dramatically decreases from 0.346 Omega cm(2) to 0.112 Omega cm(2).",A-site deficient La0.2Sr0.7TiO3-δ anode material for proton conducting ethane fuel cell to cogenerate ethylene and electricity,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.032
