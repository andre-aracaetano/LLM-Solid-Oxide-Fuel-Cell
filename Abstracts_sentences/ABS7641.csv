2,7641,"In particular, the increase of ceramic fibers production capacity (up to one order of magnitude) has been demonstrated through the replacement of a single injector by a multiple injector (equipped with 10 needles).",Use of multi-injector for electrospinning of ceramic fibers in energy applications,10.1016/j.bsecv.2019.01.003
3,7641,"Moreover, the diameters, lengths, glass sizes and surface area of the obtained fibers indicate that these fibers could be used to manufacture highly porous electrodes that can be easily infiltrated, having micro-structure where the oxygen reduction reaction region takes place is maximized and also the gases and charges transportations properties are improved.",Use of multi-injector for electrospinning of ceramic fibers in energy applications,10.1016/j.bsecv.2019.01.003
