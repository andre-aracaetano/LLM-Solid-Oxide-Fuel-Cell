1,13192,Developing cost-effective methods to prepare dense ceramic interconnect membrane for tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks is currently considered as a major technical obstacle.,Fabrication of Dense La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.97O3-δ Interconnect Membrane on Novel SOFC Composite Support by Co-firing,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2012.11727
2,13192,"In order to improve the co-firing compatibility of SOFC support with both LaCrO3-based interconnects and Ni-based anodes, double-phase composite NiO/La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.97O3-delta(LCC97) was designed and then examined as novel SOFC support.",Fabrication of Dense La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.97O3-δ Interconnect Membrane on Novel SOFC Composite Support by Co-firing,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2012.11727
3,13192,"Sintering character, microstructure, porosity, electrical conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient of the NiO/LCC97 composites were investigated in detail as a function of NiO content (5wt%, 25wtgo, 50wt% and 75wt%).",Fabrication of Dense La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.97O3-δ Interconnect Membrane on Novel SOFC Composite Support by Co-firing,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2012.11727
4,13192,Results indicate that the interconnect material LCC97 has desirable chemical and sintering compatibility with NiO. The NiO/LCC97 composite with weight ratio of 1:1 has excellent overall performance which can sufficiently meet the requirements for tubular SOFC support.,Fabrication of Dense La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.97O3-δ Interconnect Membrane on Novel SOFC Composite Support by Co-firing,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2012.11727
