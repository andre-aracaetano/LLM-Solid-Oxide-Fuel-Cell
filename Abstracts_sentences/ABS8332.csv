2,8332,"With La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-d (LSCF-SDC) as a cathode, the maximum power densities of the cell reached 38, 104, and 168 similar to mW/cm2 at 500 degrees C, 550 degrees C, and 600 degrees C, respectively; and the corresponding open-circuit voltages (OCVs) were 0.74, 0.73, and 0.71 similar to V. Furthermore, the OCVs could be significantly improved by way of brush painting a BaZr0.1Ce0.8Y0.1O3-d-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-d (BZCY-SDC) layer on the SDC electrolyte membrane, achieving 0.81, 0.80, and 0.76 similar to V at 500 degrees C, 550 degrees C, and 600 degrees C, respectively.",Fabrication and Electrochemical Characterization of Anode-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-d Electrolytes,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02737.x
