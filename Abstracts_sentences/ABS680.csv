2,680,"Ag-Pr2O2SO4 was studied in terms of synthesis, stability of Pr2O2SO4 in CO2, and electrochemical behavior as a cathode.",Silver-praseodymium oxy-sulfate cermet: A new composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.098
3,680,The performance of the composite cathode was assessed as a function of temperature by A.C. impedance using a symmetrical cell arrangement in oxygen.,Silver-praseodymium oxy-sulfate cermet: A new composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.098
4,680,"The global performance of an anode-supported fuel cell Ag-Pr2O2SO4/CGO/NiO-CGO was also assessed, the highest power density being 1.5 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. A longevity test of this cell performed at 800 degrees C under load for 24 days demonstrated high stability with Ag-Pr2O2SO4 cathode.",Silver-praseodymium oxy-sulfate cermet: A new composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.098
