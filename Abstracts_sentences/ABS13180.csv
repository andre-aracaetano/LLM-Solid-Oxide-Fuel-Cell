5,13180,Moreover the optimal suspension composition and the conditions for achieving successful electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of CNTs/LSCF composite nanoparticles were evaluated.,Electrophoretic Codeposition of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ and Carbon Nanotubes for Developing Composite Cathodes for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02413.x
6,13180,"Experimental results showed that the CNTs were homogeneously distributed and mixed with LSCF nanoparticles forming a mesh-like structure, which resulted in a highly porous LSCF film when the CNTs were burned out during heat treatment in air at 800 degrees C for 2 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were employed to characterize the microstructure of the precursors and of the composite films.",Electrophoretic Codeposition of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ and Carbon Nanotubes for Developing Composite Cathodes for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02413.x
