4,2515,Sintering of the crack-free green film at 1450 degrees C yielded a dense layer of BCY with the thickness of about 9.2 +/- 0.3 mu m after sintering at 1450 degrees C. The BCY thin film on the NiO-BCY substrate exhibited conductivity of 1.6 x 10(12)S.cm(-1) at 600 degrees C and its activation energy was 0.35 eV.,Anode-supported SOFC with thin film of proton-conducting BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-α by electrophoretic deposition,10.2109/jcersj2.17048
