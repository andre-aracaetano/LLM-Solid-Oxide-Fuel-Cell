1,9459,"Intermediate temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs)), as one of the energy conversion devices, have attracted worldwide interest for their great fuel efficiency, low air pollution, much reduced cost and excellent longtime stability.",A high performance cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta00391a
2,9459,"In the intermediate temperature range (500-700 degrees C), SOFCs based on proton conducting electrolytes (PSOFCs) display unique advantages over those based on oxygen ion conducting electrolytes.",A high performance cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta00391a
3,9459,A key obstacle to the practical operation of past P-SOFCs is the poor stability of the traditionally used composite cathode materials in the steam-containing atmosphere and their low contribution to proton conduction.,A high performance cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta00391a
4,9459,Here we report the identification of a new Ruddlesden-Popper-type oxide Sr3Fe2O7-delta that meets the requirements for much improved long-term stability and shows a superior single-cell performance.,A high performance cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta00391a
5,9459,"With a Sr3Fe2O7-delta-5 wt% BaZr0.3Ce0.5Y0.2O3-delta cathode, the P-SOFC exhibits high power densities (683 and 583 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C and 650 degrees C, respectively) when operated with humidified hydrogen as the fuel and air as the cathode gas.",A high performance cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta00391a
6,9459,"More importantly, no decay in discharging was observed within a 100 hour test.",A high performance cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta00391a
