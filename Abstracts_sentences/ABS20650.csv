3,20650,"Comparing with the pure LSC cathode, the interfacial resistance decreased upon the addition of LDC and the optimum content of LDC was 50 wt.%.",Electrochemical evaluation of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-La0.45Ce0.55O2 composite cathodes for anode-supported La0.45Ce0.55O2-La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 bilayer electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.10.012
4,20650,The variation in ohmic resistance suggests that the composite cathode can suppress Co diffusion from the cathode into the LSGM electrolyte during the firing of the composite cathode onto the electrolyte.,Electrochemical evaluation of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-La0.45Ce0.55O2 composite cathodes for anode-supported La0.45Ce0.55O2-La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 bilayer electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.10.012
5,20650,The composite cathode with 50 wt.% LDC showed an ohmic resistance near to the calculated resistance of an electrolyte film.,Electrochemical evaluation of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-La0.45Ce0.55O2 composite cathodes for anode-supported La0.45Ce0.55O2-La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 bilayer electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.10.012
6,20650,"For the pure LSC cathode, the optimum firing temperature was about 1150 degreesC, at which both the electrolyte resistance and interface resistance were the smallest.",Electrochemical evaluation of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-La0.45Ce0.55O2 composite cathodes for anode-supported La0.45Ce0.55O2-La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 bilayer electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.10.012
7,20650,"The cathodic interfacial resistance was effectively reduced for the composite cathodes, especially for the cathode with 50 wt.% LDC, which might be due to the suppressing of sintering and the growth of LSC particles from LDC particles during the firing onto the electrolyte.",Electrochemical evaluation of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-La0.45Ce0.55O2 composite cathodes for anode-supported La0.45Ce0.55O2-La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 bilayer electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.10.012
8,20650,"The complicated effects of the composite cathode on the interfacial resistance and ohmic resistance resulted in the best single cell performance at 650 degreesC with a 50 wt.% LDC composite cathode, and the best cell performance above 700 degreesC on the single cell with pure LSC cathode.",Electrochemical evaluation of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-La0.45Ce0.55O2 composite cathodes for anode-supported La0.45Ce0.55O2-La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 bilayer electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.10.012
