3,10144,"The electrolyte-supported (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9, SDC) symmetrical cell with SSFTR electrodes possesses a peak power density of 271 mW.cm(-2) at 800 degrees C in wet H-2.",Highly Stable and Efficient Perovskite Ferrite Electrode for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b04286
4,10144,"Moreover, the peak power density is remarkably improved to 417 mW.cm(-2) when applying A-site-deficient perovskite oxide Sm0.7Sr0.2Fe0.8Ti0.15Ru0.05O3-delta as the symmetrical electrode, benifiting by the in situ-exsolved Ru nanoparticles with excellent electrocatalytic activity, since A-site deficiency can provide additional driving force for the exsolution of B-site cations upon reduction.",Highly Stable and Efficient Perovskite Ferrite Electrode for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b04286
5,10144,"As an ingenious approach, this exsolution of electrocatalytically active nanoparticles on the surface of electrode may be applicable to the development of other excellent performance electrodes for symmetrical SOFCs and other electrochemical systems.",Highly Stable and Efficient Perovskite Ferrite Electrode for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b04286
