2,20893,"Here, we propose a synergistic approach involving the introduction of A-site defects and anion doping in the perovskite La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) oxide to enhance its electrochemical oxidation/reduction kinetics as an electrode material in single-component SOFCs/SOECs.",Improving Electrochemical Oxidation/Reduction Kinetics in Single-Component Solid Oxide Cells through Synergistic A-Site Defects and Anion Doping,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02794
3,20893,"By creating an A-site deficient and F-doped oxyfluoride, designated as (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.95)Co0.2Fe0.8F0.1O2.9-delta (F-(LS)(0.95)CF), we effectively lower the valence state of both Co and Fe elements, leading to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies.",Improving Electrochemical Oxidation/Reduction Kinetics in Single-Component Solid Oxide Cells through Synergistic A-Site Defects and Anion Doping,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02794
4,20893,"This synergistic approach yields a remarkable approximately 5-fold increase in the oxygen surface exchange coefficient (k(chem)) and a 50% increase in the bulk diffusion coefficient (D-chem) at 700 degrees C, when compared with LSCF.",Improving Electrochemical Oxidation/Reduction Kinetics in Single-Component Solid Oxide Cells through Synergistic A-Site Defects and Anion Doping,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02794
5,20893,The resulting F-(LS)(0.95)CF-based single cell demonstrates approximately a 100% higher maximum power density for SOFC operation and a 60% higher current density at 1.3 V for SOEC operation.,Improving Electrochemical Oxidation/Reduction Kinetics in Single-Component Solid Oxide Cells through Synergistic A-Site Defects and Anion Doping,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02794
6,20893,These improvements are further supported by lower polarization resistances observed in symmetrical cells with F-(LS)(0.95)CF.,Improving Electrochemical Oxidation/Reduction Kinetics in Single-Component Solid Oxide Cells through Synergistic A-Site Defects and Anion Doping,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02794
7,20893,"Furthermore, detailed investigations into the reaction kinetics reveal distinctive behaviors for the hydrogen oxidation reaction when comparing LSCF to F-(LS)(0.95)CF as the electrode material.",Improving Electrochemical Oxidation/Reduction Kinetics in Single-Component Solid Oxide Cells through Synergistic A-Site Defects and Anion Doping,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02794
8,20893,"Specifically, for LSCF, the rate-limiting step is the adsorption and dissociation of H-2, while for F-(LS)(0.95)CF, it primarily involves a charge-transfer reaction.",Improving Electrochemical Oxidation/Reduction Kinetics in Single-Component Solid Oxide Cells through Synergistic A-Site Defects and Anion Doping,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02794
9,20893,"Conversely, for the oxygen reduction reaction, regardless of the electrode material being LSCF or F-(LS)(0.95)CF, the rate-limiting step consistently involves the reduction of oxygen atoms to O-.",Improving Electrochemical Oxidation/Reduction Kinetics in Single-Component Solid Oxide Cells through Synergistic A-Site Defects and Anion Doping,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02794
