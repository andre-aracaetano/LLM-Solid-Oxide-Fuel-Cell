1,2509,The crystallization processes that occur in alkaline earth silicate glasses designed for sealing solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) have been investigated using differential thermal analysis (DTA) and hot-stage microscopy (HSM).,Crystallization and processing of SOFC sealing glasses,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2010.02.028
2,2509,HSM experiments revealed that glass powders with particle sizes <45 mu m crystallized before viscous sintering was complete.,Crystallization and processing of SOFC sealing glasses,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2010.02.028
3,2509,This behavior is consistent with the effects of glass particle size on the characteristic temperatures measured by DTA.,Crystallization and processing of SOFC sealing glasses,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2010.02.028
4,2509,The importance and role of the specific crystallization process on the effectiveness of glasses for SOFC sealing applications are discussed.,Crystallization and processing of SOFC sealing glasses,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2010.02.028
