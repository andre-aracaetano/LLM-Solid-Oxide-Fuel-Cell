5,2119,SOFC performance with oxygen electrode-LSM is a better option while SOFC/SOEC recycling with oxygen electrode-LSM/YSZ is more durable.,Study of reversible solid oxide fuel cell with different oxygen electrode materials,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.190
6,2119,Identical material composition and no obvious weak connection between oxygen electrode-LSM/YSZ and electrolyte after SOFC/SOEC cycling tests are the main reasons leading to minor performance drops compared to that with electrode LSM.,Study of reversible solid oxide fuel cell with different oxygen electrode materials,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.190
