2,3467,In this study amorphous gadolinia-doped ceria (Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9-x) thin film electrolytes were fabricated by spray pyrolysis and their crystallization to nanocrystalline microstructures was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.,Crystallization of amorphous ceria solid solutions,10.1016/j.actamat.2007.02.002
3,3467,At temperatures higher than 500 degrees C the amorphous films crystallize to a biphasic ceramic that is amorphous and nanocrystalline.,Crystallization of amorphous ceria solid solutions,10.1016/j.actamat.2007.02.002
4,3467,The driving force for the crystallization is the reduction of the free enthalpy resulting from the transformation of amorphous into crystalline material.,Crystallization of amorphous ceria solid solutions,10.1016/j.actamat.2007.02.002
5,3467,Self-limited grain growth kinetics prevail for the nanocrystalline grains where stable microstructures are established after short dwell times.,Crystallization of amorphous ceria solid solutions,10.1016/j.actamat.2007.02.002
6,3467,A transition to classical curvature-driven grain growth kinetics occurs when the fully crystalline state is reached for average grain sizes larger than 140 nm and annealing temperatures higher than 1100 degrees C.
