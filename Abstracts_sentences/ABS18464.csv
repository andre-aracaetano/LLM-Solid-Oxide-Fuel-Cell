1,18464,Homogeneous Bi2O3-V2O5 powder mixtures with different amounts of V2O5 content (<= 15 mol%) were prepared by colloidal dispersion and sintering to high density.,"Synthesis and Study on Ionic Conductive (Bi1-x,Vx)O1.5-δ Materials with a Dual-Phase Microstructure",10.3390/ma9110863
2,18464,"The sintered and annealed samples were studied by thermal analysis, quantitative X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.","Synthesis and Study on Ionic Conductive (Bi1-x,Vx)O1.5-δ Materials with a Dual-Phase Microstructure",10.3390/ma9110863
3,18464,The electrical and ionic conductivities of the conductors were also measured by a four-probe direct current (DC) method.,"Synthesis and Study on Ionic Conductive (Bi1-x,Vx)O1.5-δ Materials with a Dual-Phase Microstructure",10.3390/ma9110863
4,18464,The results of the samples prepared at 600-800 degrees C and annealed for as long as 100 h show that the sintered samples consisting of a pure gamma phase or delta + gamma binary phase perform differently in conductivity.,"Synthesis and Study on Ionic Conductive (Bi1-x,Vx)O1.5-δ Materials with a Dual-Phase Microstructure",10.3390/ma9110863
5,18464,The highly conductive delta phase in the composition of Bi0.92V0.08O1.5-delta enhances the electric conductivity 10-times better than that of the pure gamma-sample (Bi0.94V0.06O1.5-delta) between 400 and 600 degrees C.,"Synthesis and Study on Ionic Conductive (Bi1-x,Vx)O1.5-δ Materials with a Dual-Phase Microstructure",10.3390/ma9110863
6,18464,"The compatible regions of the gamma phase with the alpha- or delta phase are also reported and discussed, so a part of the previously published Bi2O3-V2O5 phase diagram below 800 degrees C is revised.","Synthesis and Study on Ionic Conductive (Bi1-x,Vx)O1.5-δ Materials with a Dual-Phase Microstructure",10.3390/ma9110863
