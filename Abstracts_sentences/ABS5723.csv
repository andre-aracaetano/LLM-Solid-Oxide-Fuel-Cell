1,5723,"To study possible failure modes of the Hexis Galileo solid oxide fuel cell stack, various stack components such as nickel/yttria stabilised zirconia anodes, lanthanum strontium manganese cathodes, 3 mol%-yttria stabilised zirconia electrolytes and chromium alloy metallic interconnectors have been characterised with respect to their thermo-mechanical properties.",Simulation and Validation of Thermo-mechanical Stresses in Planar SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000040
2,5723,"Specifically, coefficients of thermal expansion, Young's moduli, bending strengths, Poisson's ratios and fracture toughnesses have been measured.",Simulation and Validation of Thermo-mechanical Stresses in Planar SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000040
3,5723,"Furthermore, the temperature-dependent warpage of complete cells has been investigated by video analysis.",Simulation and Validation of Thermo-mechanical Stresses in Planar SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000040
4,5723,All experimental data were taken as input parameters for a set of finite element models to analyse various thermo-mechanical phenomena on different length scales.,Simulation and Validation of Thermo-mechanical Stresses in Planar SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000040
5,5723,The simulations offer an explanation for the often observed 'saddle-like` deformations of cells at room temperature.,Simulation and Validation of Thermo-mechanical Stresses in Planar SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000040
6,5723,They also show that cracks that first develop within the anode induce local tensile stresses within the electrolyte and hence represent a weakening mechanism for the cells.,Simulation and Validation of Thermo-mechanical Stresses in Planar SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000040
7,5723,It is shown that the induced electrolyte stresses depend on the anode crack density.,Simulation and Validation of Thermo-mechanical Stresses in Planar SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000040
8,5723,The electrolyte stresses decrease as the distances between the anode cracks become smaller.,Simulation and Validation of Thermo-mechanical Stresses in Planar SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000040
