1,9023,Different approaches have been suggested for the waste heat recovery of high-temperature exhausted gas of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,4E Study and Best Performance Analysis of a Hydrogen Multi-Generation Layout by Waste Energy Recovery of Combined SOFC-GT-ORC,10.3390/en17112791
2,9023,"In such systems, mostly gas turbine (GT) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) are added as bottoming systems to the SOFC (Configuration 1).",4E Study and Best Performance Analysis of a Hydrogen Multi-Generation Layout by Waste Energy Recovery of Combined SOFC-GT-ORC,10.3390/en17112791
3,9023,"However, the SOFC-GT-ORC has a considerable amount of waste energy which can be recovered.",4E Study and Best Performance Analysis of a Hydrogen Multi-Generation Layout by Waste Energy Recovery of Combined SOFC-GT-ORC,10.3390/en17112791
4,9023,"In the present research, the waste energy of ORC in the heat rejection stage and the residual exhausted gas of the system were recovered by a thermoelectric generator (TEG) and a hot water unit, respectively.",4E Study and Best Performance Analysis of a Hydrogen Multi-Generation Layout by Waste Energy Recovery of Combined SOFC-GT-ORC,10.3390/en17112791
5,9023,"Then, the extra produced power in the TEG was directed to a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer and a reverse osmosis desalination unit (RODU) for hydrogen and potable water outputs.",4E Study and Best Performance Analysis of a Hydrogen Multi-Generation Layout by Waste Energy Recovery of Combined SOFC-GT-ORC,10.3390/en17112791
6,9023,"The performance of SOFC-GT, Configuration 1, and Configuration 2 was compared through a 4E (energy, exergy, exergy-economic, and environmental) analysis.",4E Study and Best Performance Analysis of a Hydrogen Multi-Generation Layout by Waste Energy Recovery of Combined SOFC-GT-ORC,10.3390/en17112791
7,9023,"In the best performance point, the exergy efficiency and unit cost of product (UCOP) of SOFC-GT were obtained as 69.41% and USD 26.53/GJ.",4E Study and Best Performance Analysis of a Hydrogen Multi-Generation Layout by Waste Energy Recovery of Combined SOFC-GT-ORC,10.3390/en17112791
8,9023,"The exergy efficiency increased by 2.56% and 2.86%, and the UCOP rose by 0.45% and 12.25% in Configurations 1 and 2.",4E Study and Best Performance Analysis of a Hydrogen Multi-Generation Layout by Waste Energy Recovery of Combined SOFC-GT-ORC,10.3390/en17112791
9,9023,"So, the overall performance of Configuration 1 was acceptable and Configuration 2 led to the highest exergy efficiency, while its economic performance was not competitive because of the high investment cost of RODU.",4E Study and Best Performance Analysis of a Hydrogen Multi-Generation Layout by Waste Energy Recovery of Combined SOFC-GT-ORC,10.3390/en17112791
