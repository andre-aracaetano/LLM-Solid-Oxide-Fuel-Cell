1,9948,Creep properties of sandwich joint specimens made of a newly developed BaO-B2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic sealant (GC-9) and a ferritic-stainless-steel interconnect (Crofer 22 H) for planar solid oxide fuel cells (pSOFCs) are investigated at 800 degrees C under constant shear and tensile loadings.,Creep rupture of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.047
2,9948,The creep rupture time of Crofer 22 H/GC-9/Crofer 22 H joint specimens is increased with a decrease in applied load for both shear and tensile loading modes.,Creep rupture of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.047
3,9948,"The given metal/sealant/metal joint has a greater degradation of joint strength at 800 degrees C under prolonged, constant tensile loading as compared to shear loading.",Creep rupture of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.047
4,9948,"The tensile creep strength at a rupture time of 1000 h is about 9% of the average tensile joint strength, while the shear creep strength at 1000 h is about 23% of the average shear joint strength.",Creep rupture of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.047
5,9948,Failure patterns of both shear and tensile joint specimens are similar regardless of the creep rupture time.,Creep rupture of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.047
6,9948,"In general, creep cracks initiate at the interface between the (Cr,Mn)(3)O-4 spinel layer and the BaCrO4 chromate layer, penetrate through the BaCrO4 layer, and propagate along the interface between the chromate layer and glass-ceramic substrate until final fracture.",Creep rupture of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.047
