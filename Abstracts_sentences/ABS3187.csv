1,3187,"To stabilize solid oxide fuel cell cathodes prepared by infiltration of La(0.8)Sr(0.2)CoO(3) (LSCo) into porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), a coating of Sm-doped ceria (SDC) was first deposited onto the YSZ scaffold.",Doped-Ceria Diffusion Barriers Prepared by Infiltration for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3432253
2,3187,"The dense SDC coating was prepared by infiltration with aqueous solutions of Sm(NO(3))(3) and Ce(NO(3))(3), followed by calcination to 1473 K.",Doped-Ceria Diffusion Barriers Prepared by Infiltration for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3432253
3,3187,"The SDC coating prevented solid-state reactions between LSCo and YSZ at 1373 K. LSCo-SDC/YSZ electrodes exhibited low cathode impedances, similar to 20 m Omega cm(2), at 973 K, with acceptable degradation after heating to 1373 K.
