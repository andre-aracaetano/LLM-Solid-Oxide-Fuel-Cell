1,14775,"High temperature annealing test results indicate that B site dopant of LST and corresponding doping concentration have strong impact on the inter-diffusion behaviors at A-site deficient LST and ScSZ interface, which provides solid evidence for the improvement of the long term stability of LST anode.",Investigation of chemical compatibility between B-site doped La substituted SrTiO3 anode and stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.08.024
2,14775,"First principle calculation results indicate that B site doping of Al, Ga and Sc can enhance the neighboring Ti-O bonding which increases the VFE of Ti in LST that stabilizes the material and blocks the ion diffusion path at the same time.",Investigation of chemical compatibility between B-site doped La substituted SrTiO3 anode and stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.08.024
3,14775,"To minimize B site cation vacancy concentration, a threshold doping concentration exists at which the resulting VFE of Ti can overwhelm that of Sc which effectively suppresses the Sc/Ti ion exchange at the LST/ScSZ interface.",Investigation of chemical compatibility between B-site doped La substituted SrTiO3 anode and stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.08.024
4,14775,But introduction of the B-site dopant may deteriorate the stability due to the lower VFE of dopant itself which becomes new source of instability at high doping concentration.,Investigation of chemical compatibility between B-site doped La substituted SrTiO3 anode and stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.08.024
5,14775,Appropriate doping to balance the improvement and drawback of the dopant is the key for the overall stability of the material.,Investigation of chemical compatibility between B-site doped La substituted SrTiO3 anode and stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.08.024
