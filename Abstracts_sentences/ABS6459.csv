1,6459,The effects of a V2O5 additive on the low-temperature sintering and ionic conductivity of strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM: La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8) are studied.,Low-temperature sintering and electrical properties of strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate with V2O5 additive,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.082
2,6459,The LSGM powders prepared by the glycine nitrate method are mixed with 0.5-2 at.% of VO5/2 and then sintered at 1100-1400 degrees C in air for 4 h. The apparent density and phase purity of the LSGM specimens are increased with increasing sintering temperature and VO5/2 concentration due to the enhanced sintering and mass transfer via the intergranular liquid phase.,Low-temperature sintering and electrical properties of strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate with V2O5 additive,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.082
3,6459,"The 1 at.% VO5/2-doped LSGM specimen sintered at 1300 degrees C exhibits a high oxide ion conductivity of similar to 0.027 S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C over a wide range of oxygen partial pressure (P-O2 = 10(-27) - 1 atm), thereby demonstrating its potential as a useful electrolyte for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) without the requirement for any buffer layer between the electrolyte and anode.",Low-temperature sintering and electrical properties of strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate with V2O5 additive,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.082
