1,4061,Strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM) has been considered as a promising electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems in recent years.,"All-Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, Synthesis and Characterization",10.1115/1.3080554
2,4061,"In this work synthesis, electrochemical properties, phase evolution, and microstructure of an all-perovskite electrolyte-supported SOFC based on La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 (LSCM) porous anode, La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.7Mg0.3O2.8 (LSGM-2030) electrolyte, and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode at intermediate temperatures are studied.","All-Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, Synthesis and Characterization",10.1115/1.3080554
3,4061,"The phase evolution of synthesized LSGM and LSCM powders has been investigated, and it validates that there is no reaction between LSGM and LSCM at sintering temperature.","All-Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, Synthesis and Characterization",10.1115/1.3080554
4,4061,"The characterization study of the synthesized LSGM also indicates that sintering at 1500 degrees C gives higher electrical conductivity compared with the currently published results, while for the pellets sintered at 1400 degrees C and 1450 degrees C the conductivity would be slightly lower.","All-Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, Synthesis and Characterization",10.1115/1.3080554
5,4061,The effects of the firing temperature on the bulk and grain boundary resistivities are also discussed.,"All-Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, Synthesis and Characterization",10.1115/1.3080554
