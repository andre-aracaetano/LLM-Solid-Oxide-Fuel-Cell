1,16852,"The crystal structure of SrCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O2.72 was determined using a combination of precession electron diffraction (PED), high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS).",Layered oxygen vacancy ordering in Nb-doped SrCo1-xFexO3-δ perovskite,10.1524/zkri.2013.1556
2,16852,"The structure has a tetragonal P4/mmm symmetry with cell parameters a = b = a(p), c = 2a(p) (a(p) being the cell parameter of the perovskite parent structure).",Layered oxygen vacancy ordering in Nb-doped SrCo1-xFexO3-δ perovskite,10.1524/zkri.2013.1556
