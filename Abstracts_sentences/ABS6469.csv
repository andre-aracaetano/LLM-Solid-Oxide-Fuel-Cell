1,6469,Apatite-type lanthanum silicate (La10Si6O27; LS) nanopowders are synthesized using a hydrothermal process and used for the electrolyte applications in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Hydrothermal Synthesis and Characterization of an Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicate Ceramic for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte Applications,10.1002/ente.201700867
2,6469,"The synthesized nanopowders are characterized by Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, SEM-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), TEM, and dialotometry.",Hydrothermal Synthesis and Characterization of an Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicate Ceramic for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte Applications,10.1002/ente.201700867
3,6469,"The prepared nanopowders can be sintered to near theoretical density at sintering temperature of 1500 degrees C. Reactivity studies between the synthesized La10Si6O27 material and cathode materials such as La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF), Nd2NiO4 (NNO), and Pr2NiO4 (PNO), are carried out by XRD analysis revealing that they do not react.",Hydrothermal Synthesis and Characterization of an Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicate Ceramic for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte Applications,10.1002/ente.201700867

5,6469,"The area specific resistances for LSCF, NNO, PNO, and PNO-LS (1:1 (wt%)) measured at 900C, are 100, 2.2, 1.8, and 0.5 Omega cm(2), respectively.",Hydrothermal Synthesis and Characterization of an Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicate Ceramic for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte Applications,10.1002/ente.201700867
6,6469,"EDS analysis shows that interdiffusion of cations at the cathode-electrolyte interface is not detected for LS/PNO, which is attributed to the low area-specific resistance values.",Hydrothermal Synthesis and Characterization of an Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicate Ceramic for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte Applications,10.1002/ente.201700867
7,6469,The results demonstrate that Pr2NiO4 and the composites are promising cathode materials for the apatite-type lanthanum silicate electrolyte for SOFC applications.,Hydrothermal Synthesis and Characterization of an Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicate Ceramic for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte Applications,10.1002/ente.201700867
