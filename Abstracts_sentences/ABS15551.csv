1,15551,"Technology was investigated to control cyclic fluctuations in an independent microgrid powered with unstable renewable energy by use of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC, 1 MW) in a triple combined cycle (SOFC-TCC) that included a gas turbine (G/T, 0.8 MW) and a steam turbine (S/T, 0.2 MW).",Control of cyclic fluctuations in an independent microgrid by an SOFC triple combined cycle inertia system,10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.12.029
2,15551,A large-scale solar power system (0.8 MW) and a wind farm (0.8 MW) were interconnected with the electrical power network through an inverter.,Control of cyclic fluctuations in an independent microgrid by an SOFC triple combined cycle inertia system,10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.12.029
3,15551,The cyclic fluctuations ingredient of the network was controlled by a suitably designed inertia system and by governor-free control of the G/T and SIT.,Control of cyclic fluctuations in an independent microgrid by an SOFC triple combined cycle inertia system,10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.12.029
4,15551,"The SOFC-TCC's control block diagram was submitted to MATLAB/Simulink R 2013a, and the deviation of electrical power and frequency in the independent microgrid caused by the SOFC-TCC and renewable energy interconnection was clarified.",Control of cyclic fluctuations in an independent microgrid by an SOFC triple combined cycle inertia system,10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.12.029
5,15551,"As a result, a range of suitable inertial constants for G/T and S/T and the electrical output characteristics were determined.",Control of cyclic fluctuations in an independent microgrid by an SOFC triple combined cycle inertia system,10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.12.029
6,15551,"Selecting a small inertial constant for the simulation resulted in a large frequency deviation of G/T and SIT, with frequency stabilized for a short time.",Control of cyclic fluctuations in an independent microgrid by an SOFC triple combined cycle inertia system,10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.12.029
7,15551,"On the other hand, selecting a large inertial constant resulted in a controlled frequency deviation, although the unstable frequency of the power grid continued for a long time.",Control of cyclic fluctuations in an independent microgrid by an SOFC triple combined cycle inertia system,10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.12.029
