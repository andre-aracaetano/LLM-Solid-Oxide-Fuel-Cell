1,10689,"Stainless steel 441 was oxidized in water vapor containing atmospheres at 1,000 degrees C to study the contrary effects of water vapor on the oxidization process.","Corrosion Process of Stainless Steel 441 with Heated Steam at 1,000 °C",10.1515/htmp-2015-0238
2,10689,The steel in 3.5 vol.% H2O containing atmosphere exhibited an relatively strong protective behavior.,"Corrosion Process of Stainless Steel 441 with Heated Steam at 1,000 °C",10.1515/htmp-2015-0238
3,10689,The reason was that the densification of the chromium oxide scale was promoted due to the sintering of the oxide grains via Cr-containing species vapor.,"Corrosion Process of Stainless Steel 441 with Heated Steam at 1,000 °C",10.1515/htmp-2015-0238
4,10689,But the oxidation of the steel in 11.5 similar to 15.6 vol.% H2O containing atmosphere followed a non-protective breakaway oxidation due to the breakage of the dense scale by bubbles and the formation of iron-rich oxides layer.,"Corrosion Process of Stainless Steel 441 with Heated Steam at 1,000 °C",10.1515/htmp-2015-0238
5,10689,Experimental result shows that the growth stress increased about 2 GPa during the first 70 ks in wet oxidizing atmosphere.,"Corrosion Process of Stainless Steel 441 with Heated Steam at 1,000 °C",10.1515/htmp-2015-0238
6,10689,The relatively slow increase of the oxides scale growth stress could be release in water vapor containing atmosphere.,"Corrosion Process of Stainless Steel 441 with Heated Steam at 1,000 °C",10.1515/htmp-2015-0238
