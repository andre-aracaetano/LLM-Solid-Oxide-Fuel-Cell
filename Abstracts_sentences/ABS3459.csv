3,3459,The results obtained show that the hydrogen fed SOFC(H+) has an essential advantage as compared to the hydrogen fed SOFC based on an oxygen ion electrolyte (SOFC (O2-)) regarding the efficiency of chemical energy to electrical power transformation.,Thermodynamic analysis of a hydrogen fed solid oxide fuel cell based on a proton conductor,10.1016/S0360-3199(01)00043-X
4,3459,"It was established that the maximum SOFC(H+) efficiency in the range between 1000 and 1300 K exceeds 80%, which is significantly higher than that of the SOFC(O2-).",Thermodynamic analysis of a hydrogen fed solid oxide fuel cell based on a proton conductor,10.1016/S0360-3199(01)00043-X
5,3459,"It was also estimated that the SOFC(H+) efficiency at 1000 K is about 70% when it runs at 60% of its maximum power, whereas the practically reachable SOFC (O2-) efficiency under the above-mentioned conditions is less than 55%.",Thermodynamic analysis of a hydrogen fed solid oxide fuel cell based on a proton conductor,10.1016/S0360-3199(01)00043-X
