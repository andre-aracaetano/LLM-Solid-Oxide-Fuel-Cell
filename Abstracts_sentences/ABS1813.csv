1,1813,Electrochemical performance and sulfur (SO2) tolerance were studied on pristine La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and BaCeO3-impregnated LSCF (BaCeO3-LSCF) composite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Highly sulfur poisoning-tolerant BaCeO3-impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/1361-6463/aadf4c
2,1813,"Compared to pristine LSCF electrodes, BaCeO3-LSCF composite electrodes exhibited reduced electrode polarization resistance and significantly lower activation energy for the O-2 reduction reaction, indicating that BaCeO2 impregnation is effective at promoting the electrocatalytic activity of LSCF electrodes at low temperatures.",Highly sulfur poisoning-tolerant BaCeO3-impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/1361-6463/aadf4c
3,1813,"Most significantly, BaCeO3-LSCF cathodes show remarkable tolerance and resistance towards sulfur via the formation of BaSO4 instead of SrSO4 on the electrode surface, preventing excess Sr deficiency at the A-site of LSCF perovskite and thus mitigating the sulfur poisoning effect.",Highly sulfur poisoning-tolerant BaCeO3-impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/1361-6463/aadf4c
4,1813,BaCeO3-LSCF cathodes show potential as highly active and excellent anti-sulfur oxygen electrodes for SOFCs.,Highly sulfur poisoning-tolerant BaCeO3-impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/1361-6463/aadf4c
