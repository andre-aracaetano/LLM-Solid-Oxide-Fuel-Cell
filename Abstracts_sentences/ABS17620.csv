5,17620,"Microstructural, structural and electrical conductivity of sintered samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopy, respectively.","Microstructural development and oxygen ion mobility in Sr, Ba, and Ca-doped LaAlO3 perovskites",10.1590/S1517-707620200003.1101
6,17620,"Among the different kinds of dopants, Sr-doped sample presented the higher conductivity, for both the grain (at 800 degrees C) and total (at 800 degrees C) conductivity.","Microstructural development and oxygen ion mobility in Sr, Ba, and Ca-doped LaAlO3 perovskites",10.1590/S1517-707620200003.1101
7,17620,"In all doped samples, the total conductivity is controlled by the grain boundary, i.e., the grain boundary is more resistive than the grain, and the microstructures are heterogeneous and the degree of heterogeneity is determined by the dopant.","Microstructural development and oxygen ion mobility in Sr, Ba, and Ca-doped LaAlO3 perovskites",10.1590/S1517-707620200003.1101
