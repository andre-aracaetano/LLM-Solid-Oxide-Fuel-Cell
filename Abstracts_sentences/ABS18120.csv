3,18120,Herein we report an in-situ and non-contact method to monitor the working condition of SOFCs and it is potential to become a promising optical temperature sensor to detect the working temperature of electrolyte materials.,Probing oxide-ion conduction in low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.05.026
4,18120,"With the combinative protocol between density functional theory calculation and up-conversion (UC) luminescence, the entanglement between thermal-driven formed O-ion Frenkel pair (native solubilizer) and Bi3+ dopant (competitive inhibitor) in La2Mo2O9 derivatives has been unraveled, especially at a lower temperature required by a future SOFCs device.",Probing oxide-ion conduction in low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.05.026
5,18120,It is a potential route for screening and characterizing the candidate electrolyte onsets in lower temperature without sacrificing electrical performance.,Probing oxide-ion conduction in low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.05.026
