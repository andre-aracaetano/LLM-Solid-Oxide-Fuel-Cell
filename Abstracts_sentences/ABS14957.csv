2,14957,anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) has been investigated.,Effect of synthesis conditions on the performance of Cu-CeO2-YSZ anodes in SOFCs,10.1149/1.1614268
3,14957,"Using a fixed concentration of 20 wt % Cu and 10 wt % CeO2, impregnated into a porous YSZ matrix using metal salts, it is shown that the methods used to prepare CeO2 and Cu have a large effect on the cell performance.",Effect of synthesis conditions on the performance of Cu-CeO2-YSZ anodes in SOFCs,10.1149/1.1614268
4,14957,"Direct reduction of Cu(NO3)(2) to Cu, without intermediate calcination to CuOx, results in Cu films that have better electrical connectivity, but this does not enhance the final cell performance after exposure to n-butane.",Effect of synthesis conditions on the performance of Cu-CeO2-YSZ anodes in SOFCs,10.1149/1.1614268
5,14957,"The calcination temperature for preparing CeO2 from Ce(NO3)(3) has a much more significant effect, with the area-specific resistance (ASR) of the anode in H-2 at 973 K increasing from 0.8 Omega cm(2) at 723 K to >1.8 Omega cm(2) at 1273 K and >2.6 Omega cm(2) at 1523 K. X-ray diffraction results indicate that most of the ceria has not formed a solid solution, even at 1523 K.",Effect of synthesis conditions on the performance of Cu-CeO2-YSZ anodes in SOFCs,10.1149/1.1614268
