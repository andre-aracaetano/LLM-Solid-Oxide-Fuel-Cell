3,17726,Both X-ray diffraction and Raman results have also indicated the presence of local lattice distortion with net cell contraction upon Sc3+ incorporation in these solid solutions.,Improved ionic conductivity in NdGdZr2O7: Influence of Sc3+ substitution,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.03.038
4,17726,Micro structural studies have revealed highly dense end products with uniform grain distribution and homogeneous compositions at grain size level.,Improved ionic conductivity in NdGdZr2O7: Influence of Sc3+ substitution,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.03.038
5,17726,Ionic conductivity characterization of system been carried out from 473 to 573 K. A significant improvement in the total ionic conductivity of this series has been observed which has been explained in terms of additional oxygen vacancies created upon Sc3+ incorporation and enhanced lattice disorder.,Improved ionic conductivity in NdGdZr2O7: Influence of Sc3+ substitution,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.03.038
