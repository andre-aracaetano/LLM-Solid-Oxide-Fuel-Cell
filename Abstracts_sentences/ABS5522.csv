1,5522,This paper compares the effects of Ni and Ru dopants in lanthanum chromite anodes by correlating structural characterization and electrochemical measurements in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Nickel- and Ruthenium-Doped Lanthanum Chromite Anodes: Effects of Nanoscale Metal Precipitation on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance,10.1149/1.3269993
2,5522,"Transmission electron microscope observations showed that nanoclusters of Ni or Ru metal precipitated onto lanthanum chromite (La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-yXyO3-delta, X=Ni,Ru) surfaces, respectively, after exposure to hydrogen at 750-800 degrees C. Ni nanoclusters were typically similar to 10 nm in diameter immediately after reduction and coarsened to similar to 50 nm over similar to 300 h at 800 degrees C.",Nickel- and Ruthenium-Doped Lanthanum Chromite Anodes: Effects of Nanoscale Metal Precipitation on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance,10.1149/1.3269993

4,5522,SOFC tests were done with the doped lanthanum chromite anodes on La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta electrolyte-supported cells.,Nickel- and Ruthenium-Doped Lanthanum Chromite Anodes: Effects of Nanoscale Metal Precipitation on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance,10.1149/1.3269993
5,5522,"Ni nanocluster nucleation improved cell performance and reduced anode polarization resistance compared to cells with undoped (La0.8Sr0.2CrO3-delta) anodes, but the improvement was much less than that for Ru.",Nickel- and Ruthenium-Doped Lanthanum Chromite Anodes: Effects of Nanoscale Metal Precipitation on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance,10.1149/1.3269993
6,5522,This comparison suggests that the smaller size of the Ru nanoclusters played an important role in enhancing anode electrochemical kinetics.,Nickel- and Ruthenium-Doped Lanthanum Chromite Anodes: Effects of Nanoscale Metal Precipitation on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance,10.1149/1.3269993
