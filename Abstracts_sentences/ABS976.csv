3,976,Heavy hydrocarbon fuel (dodecane) and liquid oxygen (LOX) are chosen as the preferred reactants.,System modeling of an air-independent solid oxide fuel cell system for unmanned undersea vehicles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.042
4,976,A maximum efficiency of 45% based on the lower heating value of dodecane was calculated for a system that provides 2.5 kW for 40 h. Heat sources and sinks have been coupled to show viable means of thermal management.,System modeling of an air-independent solid oxide fuel cell system for unmanned undersea vehicles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.042
5,976,The critical design issues involve proper recycling of exhaust steam from the fuel cell back into the reformer and effective use of the SOFC stack radiant heat for steam reformation of the hydrocarbon fuel.,System modeling of an air-independent solid oxide fuel cell system for unmanned undersea vehicles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.042
