1,12533,Spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques were used to examine the benefits of adding small amounts of aluminum titanate (Al2TiO5 or ALT) to standard NiO-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based solid oxide fuel cell anodes operating with methane at 800 degrees C. Combining small amounts (4% by mass) of ALT with NiO-YSZ leads to the formation of secondary phases that improve anode carbon tolerance via multiple reaction mechanisms.,Mitigating Carbon Formation with Al2TiO5-Enhanced Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b00964
2,12533,Raman data show that carbon forms on both ALT-doped and undoped anodes at open-circuit voltage and with applied bias as evidenced by the vibrational band of highly ordered graphite at 1560 cm(-1).,Mitigating Carbon Formation with Al2TiO5-Enhanced Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b00964
3,12533,"However, ALT-doped anodes limited the amount of carbon that forms on both the surface and within the bulk, resulting in improved performance for up to 12 h of exposure to CH4.",Mitigating Carbon Formation with Al2TiO5-Enhanced Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b00964
4,12533,Results show that ALT-enhanced anodes accumulate similar to 25% less carbon on the surface under open-circuit conditions and that increasing polarizations to 50% of the maximum current and beyond results in no observable carbon accumulation.,Mitigating Carbon Formation with Al2TiO5-Enhanced Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b00964
5,12533,These observations are used to deduce possible mechanisms that describe how secondary phases suppress carbon accumulation.,Mitigating Carbon Formation with Al2TiO5-Enhanced Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b00964
