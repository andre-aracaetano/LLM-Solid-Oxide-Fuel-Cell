3,11740,"The total conductivity of 10Sc1CeSZ electrolytes at 600 degrees C varied from 0.019 to 0.046 S/cm depending on the initial powder, and for 8YSZ it was 0.059 S/cm.",Joint Impedance Spectroscopy Analysis of 10Sc1CeSZ and 8YSZ Solid Electrolytes for SOFC,10.1007/s11106-019-00037-4

5,11740,The grain boundary conductivity prevails in YSZ electrolytes due to higher association enthalpy of the grain at temperatures below 560 degrees C which depends on the dopant size.,Joint Impedance Spectroscopy Analysis of 10Sc1CeSZ and 8YSZ Solid Electrolytes for SOFC,10.1007/s11106-019-00037-4
6,11740,In 10Sc1CeSZ electrolytes the charge transfer passes mainly through the grains: the main contribution to the grain boundary resistivity is given by SiO2 segregations at the grain boundaries in technically pure materials; and grain-to-grain contacts in highly pure materials.,Joint Impedance Spectroscopy Analysis of 10Sc1CeSZ and 8YSZ Solid Electrolytes for SOFC,10.1007/s11106-019-00037-4
7,11740,The grain boundary resistivity drops twice due to presence of Al2O3 admixtures known for their scavenging effect on SiO2 segregations.,Joint Impedance Spectroscopy Analysis of 10Sc1CeSZ and 8YSZ Solid Electrolytes for SOFC,10.1007/s11106-019-00037-4
