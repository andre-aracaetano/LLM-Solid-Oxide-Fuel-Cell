8,16223,"The catalytic activity of these potential anode materials was investigated for the following propane reforming processes: steam reforming (SR), autothermal reforming (ATR) and partial oxidation (POX) at 600,700 and 800 degrees C. Very high propane conversion rates were observed under POX and ATR conditions at 700 and 800 degrees C for both the LSCM and Ru/LSCM compounds (>92 at 700 degrees C and >98% at 800 degrees C), whereas in the steam reforming environment, a satisfactory conversion was achieved only at 800 degrees C. The ruthenium presence was found to strongly improve the selectivity for H-2 and syngas production for all of the experiments performed, reaching an approximately 90% syngas yield.",Novel Ru/La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ catalysts for propane reforming in IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.002
