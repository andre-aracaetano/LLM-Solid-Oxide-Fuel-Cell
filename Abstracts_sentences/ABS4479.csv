1,4479,"As the cathode material (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), plasma was sprayed on mild steel by a DC thermal plasma spray as a high-speed process depositing thin films of SOFCs components.",Porous lanthanum strontium manganite coating layer prepared by DC thermal spray,
2,4479,"The results showed that a La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 coating layer with a certain porosity could be obtained directly using both La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and mixed raw materials (La2O3, SrCO3 and MnO or MnCO3) with or without a pore former.",Porous lanthanum strontium manganite coating layer prepared by DC thermal spray,
3,4479,"Especially, the heat treatment of the coating layer from the mixed raw materials at 800degreesC for 3hrs significantly enhanced the desired crystallization of the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 from the incomplete reaction of the raw materials.",Porous lanthanum strontium manganite coating layer prepared by DC thermal spray,
