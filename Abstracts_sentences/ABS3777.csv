2,3777,Nickel dopant concentration variation with the distance from the centre of the particle can be approximated as linear with a higher concentration of nickel found closer to the centre.,Mechanism of dopant distribution: An example of nickel-doped ceria nanoparticles,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2009.07.008
3,3777,It is suggested that the dopant distribution is mainly controlled by the difference in the diffusion rates of the precursors from the centre to the surface of the particle.,Mechanism of dopant distribution: An example of nickel-doped ceria nanoparticles,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2009.07.008
