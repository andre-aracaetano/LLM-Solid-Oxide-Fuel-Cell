4,6916,"However, in this study, we report a novel technique to produce the nano-tailored film of Sm0.5Sr0.5CO3-5 (SSC) active catalyst on to La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-5 (LSC) cathode of SOFC through controlling the drying rate during the infiltration process which resulted in a continous film like coating of SSC.",Boosting performance of the solid oxide fuel cell by facile nano-tailoring of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.109
5,6916,The SOFC with LSC cathode containing SSC film-like nanostructure showed a two-fold performance increment and an excellent durability compared to the LSC cathode prepared through conventional methods.,Boosting performance of the solid oxide fuel cell by facile nano-tailoring of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.109
6,6916,"The higher performance of the film-like nanostructured LSC-SSC cathode is attributed to the remarkable reduction in the area-specific ohmic and polari-zation resistance due to the extension of cathode reaction sites and shorter diffusion lengths, thus, facilitating the ORR.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.",Boosting performance of the solid oxide fuel cell by facile nano-tailoring of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.109
