1,15982,"To directly use hydrocarbon fuel without a reforming process, a new microstructure for Ni/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (Ni/SDC) anodes, in which the Ni surface of the anode is covered with a porous Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta thin film, was investigated as an alternative to conventional Ni/YSZ anodes.",Effect of Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 on the carbon coking in Ni-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells running on methane fuel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.148
2,15982,The porous SDC thin layer was coated on the pores of the anode using the sol gel coating method.,Effect of Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 on the carbon coking in Ni-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells running on methane fuel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.148
3,15982,The cell performance was improved by 20%-25% with the Ni/SDC anode relative to the cell performance with the Ni/YSZ anode due to the high ionic conductivity of the Ni/SDC anode and the increase of electrochemical reaction sites.,Effect of Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 on the carbon coking in Ni-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells running on methane fuel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.148
4,15982,"For the SDC-coated Ni/SDC anode operating with methane fuel, no significant degradation of the cell performance was observed after 180 h due to the surface modification with the SDC film on the Ni surface, which opposes the severe degradation of the cell performance that was observed for the Ni/YSZ anode, which results from carbon deposition by methane cracking.",Effect of Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 on the carbon coking in Ni-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells running on methane fuel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.148
5,15982,Carbon was hardly detected in the SDC-coated Ni/SDC anode due to the catalytic oxidation of the deposited carbon on the SDC film as well as the electrochemical oxidation of methane in the triple-phase-boundary.,Effect of Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 on the carbon coking in Ni-based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells running on methane fuel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.148
