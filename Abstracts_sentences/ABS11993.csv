2,11993,Recent results suggest that strained interfaces and thin films may offer new mechanisms for achieving enhanced ionic transport.,Epitaxial Strain-Induced Chemical Ordering in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Films on SrTiO3,10.1021/cm102657v
3,11993,"In this work, we investigate strained 40-nm films of perovskite La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta, which is an important material for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes and oxygen separation membranes.",Epitaxial Strain-Induced Chemical Ordering in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Films on SrTiO3,10.1021/cm102657v
4,11993,We demonstrate that a strained thin film of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta on SrTiO3 can have dramatically different anion and cation thermodynamics and kinetics than bulk La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta.,Epitaxial Strain-Induced Chemical Ordering in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Films on SrTiO3,10.1021/cm102657v
5,11993,We use synchrotron X-ray diffraction to show that La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta thin films form an ordered phase at 650 K.,Epitaxial Strain-Induced Chemical Ordering in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Films on SrTiO3,10.1021/cm102657v
6,11993,The ordered phase consists of La and Sr cations in planes parallel to the surface and is associated with coherent expansion in the c-direction of similar to 5%.,Epitaxial Strain-Induced Chemical Ordering in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Films on SrTiO3,10.1021/cm102657v
7,11993,"This chemical ordering is not observed in the bulk material and is ascribed to the interplay between the epitaxial strain imposed by the substrate, changes in oxygen vacancy content and cation mobility, and the ordering of oxygen vacancies.",Epitaxial Strain-Induced Chemical Ordering in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Films on SrTiO3,10.1021/cm102657v
