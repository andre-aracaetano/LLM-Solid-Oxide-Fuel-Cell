2,3665,A seal-less in-house ceramic housing was specifically designed and built to test the fuel cells and characterize their electrical performance as well as the thermal field established across the anode surface area.,Analysis of the thermal field of a seal-less planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.12.004
3,3665,The housing design we used allowed us to measure the temperature in 8 different positions along the cell radius.,Analysis of the thermal field of a seal-less planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.12.004
4,3665,"Our experimental sessions were thus dedicated to observe the electrochemical performance and the established temperature field across the SOFC active area under several operating conditions, obtained by varying the inlet fuel composition, the fuel utilization factor and the current density, respectively.",Analysis of the thermal field of a seal-less planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.12.004
5,3665,"The fuel composition was varied by feeding the SOFC with hydrogen fuel, diluted-hydrogen and finally methane, in a direct internal steam reforming configuration.",Analysis of the thermal field of a seal-less planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.12.004
6,3665,"During each experiment, the temperature field across the cell was measured while varying the current density: results were compared together among the different fuel compositions used, showing a consistent thermal gradient established even with relatively small-sized cells.",Analysis of the thermal field of a seal-less planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.12.004
