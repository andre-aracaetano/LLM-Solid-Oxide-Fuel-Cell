1,9752,This paper reports a new study where relatively long-term tests of about a 1000 h are performed on several planar anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells.,Long-Term SOFCs Button Cell Testing,10.1115/1.4025924
2,9752,"The cell electrochemical behaviors are studied by using voltage-current density measurement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.",Long-Term SOFCs Button Cell Testing,10.1115/1.4025924
3,9752,The cell total polarization obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results is shown to be consistent with the area-specific resistance calculated from the voltage-current density curve over the course of the test.,Long-Term SOFCs Button Cell Testing,10.1115/1.4025924
4,9752,"In addition, a four-constant phase element model is used to analyze the cell components resistances at different intervals over the lifetime of the test.",Long-Term SOFCs Button Cell Testing,10.1115/1.4025924
5,9752,Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are used postmortem to determine if any damages occurred to the cells and to determine if any change in composition occurred to the lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite cathode.,Long-Term SOFCs Button Cell Testing,10.1115/1.4025924
6,9752,This study shows that the tested cells remain stable with a relatively small increase in the cell total polarization but with no increase in ohmic resistance.,Long-Term SOFCs Button Cell Testing,10.1115/1.4025924
