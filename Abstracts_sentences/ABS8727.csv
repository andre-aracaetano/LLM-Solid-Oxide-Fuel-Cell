1,8727,This contribution describes the development of tape casting for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) anode supports starting with the characterization of the powders and ending with manufacturing of cells for stack testing.,Tape Casting of Anode Supports for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells at Forschungszentrum Julich,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02839.x
2,8727,"After casting the support, full cells were prepared by screen printing and sintering of the functional layers.",Tape Casting of Anode Supports for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells at Forschungszentrum Julich,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02839.x
3,8727,The results of single-cell and stack tests of the novel SOFC will be discussed.,Tape Casting of Anode Supports for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells at Forschungszentrum Julich,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02839.x
4,8727,"The new cell showed excellent electrochemical performance in single-cell tests with more than 1.5A/cm(2) (800 degrees C, 0.7 V).",Tape Casting of Anode Supports for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells at Forschungszentrum Julich,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02839.x
