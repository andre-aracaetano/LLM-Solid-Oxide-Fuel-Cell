1,7106,"Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (CCO) cermet anodes of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) were prepared by the iso-static pressing method, which were sintered at 1450 degrees C and successively reduced at 700 degrees C with H-2 diluted by 80% He.",Anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
2,7106,"The resulting anodes were characterized by the pore structure measurements, SEM, XRD and EDS as well.",Anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
3,7106,The conductivity and the electrical performance in corresponding cells were also measured.,Anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
4,7106,The prepared Ni-CGO cermet anodes mainly possess the pores of 1 similar to 2 mu m in diameter and the porosity of up to 30% that increases with the content of NiO.,Anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
5,7106,It can be observed by the SEM measurements that the metal phase is well amalgamated with the ceramic phase and that the anode combines with the electrolyte tightly.,Anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
6,7106,NiO in the anodes can be reduced to Ni completely by the mixture of 20%H-2 similar to 80%He at 700'C without the phase transformation of CGO.,Anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
7,7106,The conductivity of the reduced anode increases as the NiO content increases.,Anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
8,7106,"The threshold value of the NiO content is 40% in weight, over which the remarkable increase in conductivity is not available.",Anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
9,7106,"The fuel cells composed of Ni-CGO as the anode, CGO as the electrolyte and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-alpha (LSCF) as the cathode provide with the power density of up to 0.14W/cm(2) at 650 degrees C.",Anode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
