2,20916,The first one (model-I) takes into account the solid-state diffusion in LSCF coupled with a global reaction of oxygen exchange while the second one (model-II) is based on a detailed elementary description of the reaction mechanism.,A physically-based modelling to predict the cyclic voltammetry response of LSCF-type electrodes: Impact of the Ohmic Losses and Microstructure,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115765
3,20916,The relevance of model-II to predict the voltammograms has been checked with experimental data obtained at different operating temperatures and imposed scan rates.,A physically-based modelling to predict the cyclic voltammetry response of LSCF-type electrodes: Impact of the Ohmic Losses and Microstructure,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115765
4,20916,The CV response of porous and quasi-dense electrodes has been studied with the two models and has been discussed in the frame of the zone diagram method.,A physically-based modelling to predict the cyclic voltammetry response of LSCF-type electrodes: Impact of the Ohmic Losses and Microstructure,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115765
5,20916,It has been shown that the peaks of the voltammograms are due to the transient change of the oxygen stoichiometry in LSCF.,A physically-based modelling to predict the cyclic voltammetry response of LSCF-type electrodes: Impact of the Ohmic Losses and Microstructure,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115765
6,20916,"As this evolution is mainly governed by the oxygen diffusion in the material coupled to the reaction of oxygen exchange, it has been established that model-I can provide a satisfactory approximation of the CV curves if the exchange rate constant k(chem) is determined far from equilibrium.",A physically-based modelling to predict the cyclic voltammetry response of LSCF-type electrodes: Impact of the Ohmic Losses and Microstructure,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115765
7,20916,"It has been also shown that the voltammograms are strongly distorted by the Ohmic losses making their interpretation impossible in practice, under the classical operating conditions of the solid oxide cells.",A physically-based modelling to predict the cyclic voltammetry response of LSCF-type electrodes: Impact of the Ohmic Losses and Microstructure,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115765
8,20916,"To overcome this limitation, a methodology based on the modelling approach has been proposed to remove the Ohmic losses from the voltammograms and hence to reveal the voltammetry peaks.",A physically-based modelling to predict the cyclic voltammetry response of LSCF-type electrodes: Impact of the Ohmic Losses and Microstructure,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115765
9,20916,"Finally, the impact of the LSCF decomposition on the CV response has been estimated with model-II.",A physically-based modelling to predict the cyclic voltammetry response of LSCF-type electrodes: Impact of the Ohmic Losses and Microstructure,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115765
10,20916,It has been established that the surface passivation and the decrease of the chemical diffusivity can substantially affect the shape of the voltammograms.,A physically-based modelling to predict the cyclic voltammetry response of LSCF-type electrodes: Impact of the Ohmic Losses and Microstructure,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115765
