1,9424,"When a Ni-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is exposed to air at high temperatures, the outcome can be catastrophic cell degradation (primarily YSZ electrolyte cracking), resulting from the 70% volume expansion of Ni as it forms NiO. Earlier work showed that the damage is less severe under conditions when no gradient in the NiO content into the Ni-YSZ support layer was allowed to develop during the oxidation process (e.g., oxidation at 600 degrees C).",The effect of pre-oxidation treatments on the oxidation tolerance of Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.174
2,9424,"This was correlated with qualitative scanning electron microscopy observations, showing that NiO particles are ejected out of the Ni-YSZ/air surface.",The effect of pre-oxidation treatments on the oxidation tolerance of Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.174
3,9424,"In the present work, XPS analysis confirmed the enrichment of NiO at the outer anode surface, suggesting that it may be possible to pre-oxidize the Ni-YSZ support layer at 600 degrees C to force some NiO out onto the anode surface and thus enhance cell oxidation tolerance.",The effect of pre-oxidation treatments on the oxidation tolerance of Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.174
4,9424,"It is shown here that, following pre-oxidation at 600 degrees C, the amount of Ni oxidation tolerated prior to electrolyte cracking at 600 degrees C increased from 75% to 80%.",The effect of pre-oxidation treatments on the oxidation tolerance of Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.174
5,9424,"For oxidation at 800 degrees C, following pre-oxidation at 600 degrees C, electrolyte cracking was less severe, but cracks still appeared before 50% of the Ni in the anode was oxidized.",The effect of pre-oxidation treatments on the oxidation tolerance of Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.174
