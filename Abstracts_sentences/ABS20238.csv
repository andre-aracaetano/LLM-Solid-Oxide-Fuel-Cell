4,20238,"This value also accounts for experimental incidents, e.g. contact deterioration due to mechanical shocks or a supply failure of feed gas.",Nine Thousand Hours of Operation of a Solid Oxide Cell in Steam Electrolysis Mode,10.1149/2.076202jes
5,20238,Degradation during the initial 5600 h was 2.5% /1000,Nine Thousand Hours of Operation of a Solid Oxide Cell in Steam Electrolysis Mode,10.1149/2.076202jes
6,20238,"h. It was even lower during the incident-free period of the experiment, i.e. 1.7%/1000 h from 2000 to 5600 h, close to the technical target for an electrolyser system.",Nine Thousand Hours of Operation of a Solid Oxide Cell in Steam Electrolysis Mode,10.1149/2.076202jes
7,20238,"The low cell voltage (initial U-cell = 1.06 V) together with the known nearly ideal faradaic efficiency mean an (electrical-to-chemical) energy-conversion efficiency eta(el) above the one achieved with electrolysis at low temperature, with eta(el) >",Nine Thousand Hours of Operation of a Solid Oxide Cell in Steam Electrolysis Mode,10.1149/2.076202jes
