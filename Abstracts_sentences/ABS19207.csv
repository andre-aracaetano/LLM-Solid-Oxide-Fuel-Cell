Mn(V), Co(IV), Ni(III), Cu(III)] present a metastable character and, given the difficulty of their synthesis, have been relatively little studied.",HIGH-PRESSURE SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NEW METASTABLE OXIDES,10.1142/S1793604711002123

6,19207,"This technique has allowed us to access the structural details typically related to the octahedral tilting in perovskite structures, the oxygen stoichiometry and order-disorder of the oxygen sublattice, the distinction between close elements in the Periodic Table, the resolution of magnetic structures and, in general, the establishment of a correlation between the structure and the properties of interest.",HIGH-PRESSURE SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NEW METASTABLE OXIDES,10.1142/S1793604711002123
7,19207,This letter is organized around the binomial high-pressure synthesis and characterization by neutron diffraction and illustrated with some selected examples among the metastable materials above mentioned.,HIGH-PRESSURE SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NEW METASTABLE OXIDES,10.1142/S1793604711002123
