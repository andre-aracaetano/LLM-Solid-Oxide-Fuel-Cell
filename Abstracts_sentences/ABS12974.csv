1,12974,Ag-CuO is a widely used air braze sealant for joining ceramic electrolytes and stainless-steel interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Electrochemically enhanced wetting of 3YSZ and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 by Ag-CuO and their application in flash joining,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.08.207
2,12974,Balancing the amount of CuO in a braze is challenging because it enhances wettability and also aggravates steel surface degradation.,Electrochemically enhanced wetting of 3YSZ and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 by Ag-CuO and their application in flash joining,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.08.207
3,12974,Manganese cobaltite spinel (MCO) is widely used as a protective coating for SOFC steel interconnects.,Electrochemically enhanced wetting of 3YSZ and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 by Ag-CuO and their application in flash joining,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.08.207
4,12974,"Therefore, we herein propose a strategy for enhancing the wetting of an Ag-CuO alloy with a low concentration of CuO (4 mol%) on 3 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (3YSZ) and MCO by applying a direct current to the 3YSZ/Ag-CuO/MCO system.",Electrochemically enhanced wetting of 3YSZ and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 by Ag-CuO and their application in flash joining,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.08.207
5,12974,"It was discovered that the wetting of 3YSZ improved regardless of the current polarity; however, the wetting of MCO was selectively improved by the current flowing from MCO to 3YSZ.",Electrochemically enhanced wetting of 3YSZ and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 by Ag-CuO and their application in flash joining,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.08.207
6,12974,The underlying mechanisms are discussed based on the current-induced interfacial electrochemical reactions and dissolution.,Electrochemically enhanced wetting of 3YSZ and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 by Ag-CuO and their application in flash joining,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.08.207
7,12974,"Furthermore, the flash joining of 3YSZ to MCO-coated Crofer22APU was achieved, and an optimized shear strength of 62 +/- 11 MPa was obtained.",Electrochemically enhanced wetting of 3YSZ and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 by Ag-CuO and their application in flash joining,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.08.207
8,12974,"A correlation between the interfacial microstructure, mechanical properties, current polarity and current intensity was also established.",Electrochemically enhanced wetting of 3YSZ and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 by Ag-CuO and their application in flash joining,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.08.207
