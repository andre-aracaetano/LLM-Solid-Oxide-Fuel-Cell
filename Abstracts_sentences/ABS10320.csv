2,10320,A detailed comparative investigation is conducted on various transport characteristics and electrical performance of the SOFC stacks with conventional straight channel interconnectors (SCIs) or with novel interconnectors.,Performance enhancement of a beam and slot interconnector for anode-supported SOFC stack,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114277
3,10320,Results show that the peak power density of a SOFC stack with BSIs is 24.8% higher than it with SCIs at 700 degrees C and a fuel-air flow rate of 16-40 Nml/(min.cm(2)).,Performance enhancement of a beam and slot interconnector for anode-supported SOFC stack,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114277
4,10320,"Moreover, BSI can reduce the fuel-air feeding and enhance the fuel-air utilization while maintaining high output power density.",Performance enhancement of a beam and slot interconnector for anode-supported SOFC stack,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114277
5,10320,"Compared with SCI, BSI promotes the gas disturbance, significantly increases the gas velocity and vorticity, and leads the gas to flow in the direction perpendicular to the channel.",Performance enhancement of a beam and slot interconnector for anode-supported SOFC stack,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114277
6,10320,BSI eliminates the limitation of SCIs on gas diffusion in the electrode and transfers sufficient reactant gas into the electrode function layers for electrochemical reactions.,Performance enhancement of a beam and slot interconnector for anode-supported SOFC stack,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114277
7,10320,BSI shortens the charge transfer path in SOFC and almost avoids the adverse effects of the electrode-interconnector contact resistance.,Performance enhancement of a beam and slot interconnector for anode-supported SOFC stack,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114277
8,10320,"Compared with the conventional SOFC stack, the novel SOFC stack with BSIs significantly reduces various overpotentials.",Performance enhancement of a beam and slot interconnector for anode-supported SOFC stack,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114277
9,10320,At 700.,Performance enhancement of a beam and slot interconnector for anode-supported SOFC stack,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114277
10,10320,"C and 0.5 A/cm(2), the activation, concentration, and contact overpotentials are reduced by 8.5%, 47.4%, and 96.4% respectively, and the total overpotential finally drops by 20.0%.",Performance enhancement of a beam and slot interconnector for anode-supported SOFC stack,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114277
11,10320,"Overall, the electrical performance of the SOFC stack with novel interconnectors significantly exceeds the one with conventional interconnectors under the same operating conditions.",Performance enhancement of a beam and slot interconnector for anode-supported SOFC stack,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114277
