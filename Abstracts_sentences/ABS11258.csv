2,11258,"The composition and sintering temperature of LSM-ScSZ were controlled to determine the optimized microstructure of the LSM-ScSZ electrode layer, considering its length of triple-phase boundaries (TPBs), and transfer of oxygen for cathode reaction.",Electrochemical characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM)-scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) composite cathode,10.1007/s43207-022-00200-5
3,11258,The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method with an equivalent circuit model was introduced to characterize the specific impedance of each sample.,Electrochemical characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM)-scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) composite cathode,10.1007/s43207-022-00200-5
4,11258,"The results demonstrated that volume ratio of LSM:ScSZ = 6:4 sintered at 1200 degrees C sample showed the lowest total impedance of 0.031 omega cm(2) at 900 degrees C operating temperature, compensating slightly increased high-frequency impedance (R-HF) of TPBs region with drastically improved the active surface of LSM area and their connectivity, which correspond to middle- and low-frequency impedance (R-MF and R-LF) value, respectively.",Electrochemical characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM)-scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) composite cathode,10.1007/s43207-022-00200-5
