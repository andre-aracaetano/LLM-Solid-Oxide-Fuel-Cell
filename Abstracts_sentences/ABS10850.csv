5,10850,Rhombohedral-type La0.7Sr0.3Mn1-xNixO3-delta cannot undergo hydration because the oxygen vacancy concentration required for water association is lower than the cubic phase concentration.,Mixed proton-electron-oxide ion triple conducting manganite as an efficient cobalt-free cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta03899g
6,10850,The cathode performances of various PCFCs are examined by fabricating thin-film cells based on a Ba(Zr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2)O-3 electrolyte.,Mixed proton-electron-oxide ion triple conducting manganite as an efficient cobalt-free cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta03899g
7,10850,"The peak power density of the PCFCs with the cubic-type LSMN7373 cathode is 386 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, which is much higher than the reported values for Zr-rich side electrolytes.",Mixed proton-electron-oxide ion triple conducting manganite as an efficient cobalt-free cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta03899g
8,10850,"Moreover, the cathodic polarization resistance is lower than that of a cell with the widely used La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode below 550 degrees C.",Mixed proton-electron-oxide ion triple conducting manganite as an efficient cobalt-free cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta03899g
