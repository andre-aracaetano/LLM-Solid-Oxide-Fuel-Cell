1,8720,Thin film yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte was fabricated on a rigid anode substrate by multiple spin coating of a chemical solution and low-temperature sintering.,Thin Film Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) Electrolyte Fabricated by a Novel Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) Process for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs),10.1166/jno.2012.1377
2,8720,Differential densification resulted in reduced densification and microstructural heterogeneity due to the global constraint of the rigid substrate.,Thin Film Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) Electrolyte Fabricated by a Novel Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) Process for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs),10.1166/jno.2012.1377
3,8720,Microstructural heterogeneity and pore anisotropy were greatly diminished by incorporating YSZ nanoparticles into the chemical solution; these act as local constraints in the precursor powder matrix.,Thin Film Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) Electrolyte Fabricated by a Novel Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) Process for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs),10.1166/jno.2012.1377
4,8720,"The resulting YSZ electrolyte had a residual porosity of 10-15% in the closed state, a thickness of about 500-700 nm, and grain/pore sizes less than 100 nm.",Thin Film Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) Electrolyte Fabricated by a Novel Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) Process for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs),10.1166/jno.2012.1377
5,8720,"A thin-film electrolyte cell showed a stable open-circuit voltage value of about 1.07 V with fairly good gas tightness, and exhibited a maximum power density of 427 mW/cm(2) at 600 degrees C, demonstrating that YSZ is a potential alternative to vacuum deposition techniques.",Thin Film Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) Electrolyte Fabricated by a Novel Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) Process for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs),10.1166/jno.2012.1377
