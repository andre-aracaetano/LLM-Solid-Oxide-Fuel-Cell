1,17985,Solid Oxide Electrolysis (SOE) can be used to produce hydrogen with very high efficiencies at remarkable hydrogen production rates.,Communication-Electrolysis at High Efficiency with Remarkable Hydrogen Production Rates,10.1149/2.0341605jes
2,17985,"Through microstructural and compositional modification, conventional low cost Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) materials have been used to create a Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) that can achieve remarkable current density at cell voltages allowing higher conversion efficiency than current commercial electrolysers.",Communication-Electrolysis at High Efficiency with Remarkable Hydrogen Production Rates,10.1149/2.0341605jes
3,17985,Current densities in excess of 6 A/cm(2) have been achieved at 800 degrees C with a cell voltage of < 1.67 V. This cell shows a more than 3-fold increase in hydrogen production rate at higher efficiency than established commercial electrolysers.,Communication-Electrolysis at High Efficiency with Remarkable Hydrogen Production Rates,10.1149/2.0341605jes
