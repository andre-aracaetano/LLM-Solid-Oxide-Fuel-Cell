1,14306,A man-portable solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system integrated with desulfurized JP8 partial oxidation (POX) reformer was demonstrated to supply a continuous power output of 50 W. This paper discusses some of the design paths chosen and challenges faced during the thermal integration of the stack and reformer in aiding the system startup and shutdown along with balance of plant and power management solutions.,"Design, integration and demonstration of a 50 W JP8/kerosene fueled portable SOFC power generator",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.060
