1,8103,"In an effort to develop alternative anode materials based on mixed conducting ceramics capable of offering high mixed ionic-electronic conductivity, stability to redox cycles, and limited activity for carbon formation to Ni/YSZ cermets, CaMoO3 ceramics for application as a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode material were synthesized as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)).",Chemical stability and electrochemical properties of CaMoO3-δ for SOFC anode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.155
2,8103,"CaMoO3 perovskitedominant powders were obtained by reducing the CaMoO4 showing a structure of orthorhombic unit cells with the following lattice parameters: a = 5.45 angstrom, b = 5.58 angstrom, and c = 7.78 angstrom.",Chemical stability and electrochemical properties of CaMoO3-δ for SOFC anode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.155
3,8103,"The equilibrium total conductivity of CaMoO3, measured by DC 4-probe method in 5% H-2/balance N-2 condition (pO(2) approximate to 10(-22) atm) at various temperatures, decreased with increasing temperature below 400 degrees C, indicating metallic properties with an activation energy of 0.028 eV. Between 400 degrees C and 600 degrees C, the equilibrium total conductivity slightly increased, and finally sharply decreased at 800 degrees C.",Chemical stability and electrochemical properties of CaMoO3-δ for SOFC anode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.155

5,8103,"Finally, a fuel cell with CaMoO3 anode exhibited poor performance with a maximum power density of only 14 mW/cm(2) at 900 degrees C, suggesting that further research is needed to enhance the ionic conductivity and thus improve the catalytic properties.",Chemical stability and electrochemical properties of CaMoO3-δ for SOFC anode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.155
