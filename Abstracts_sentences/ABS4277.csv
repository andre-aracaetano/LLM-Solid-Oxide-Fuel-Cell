1,4277,Decreasing the electrolyte thickness is an effective approach to improve solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) performance for intermediate temperature applications.,Anode-supported SOFCs based on Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte thin-films fabricated by co-pressing using microwave combustion synthesized powders,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.105
2,4277,"Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) powders with low apparent density of 32 +/- 0.3 mg cm(-3) are synthesized by microwave combustion method, and SDC electrolyte films as thin as 10 pm are fabricated by co-pressing the powders onto a porous NiO-SDC anode substrate.",Anode-supported SOFCs based on Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte thin-films fabricated by co-pressing using microwave combustion synthesized powders,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.105
3,4277,Dense SDC electrolyte thin films with grain size of 300-800 nm are achieved at a low co-firing temperature of 1200 degrees C. Single cells based on SDC thin films show peak power densities of 0.86 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C using 3 vol% humidified H-2 as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.,Anode-supported SOFCs based on Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte thin-films fabricated by co-pressing using microwave combustion synthesized powders,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.105
4,4277,Both the thin thickness of electrolyte films and ultra -fine grained anode structure make contributions to the improved cell performance.,Anode-supported SOFCs based on Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ electrolyte thin-films fabricated by co-pressing using microwave combustion synthesized powders,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.11.105
