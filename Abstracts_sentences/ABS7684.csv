6,7684,The increased MPD by an inserting the porous LSGM layer can be explained by an increase in mechanical contact and cathodic reaction area.,Reversible Operation of Tubular Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte Porous Layer on Dense Film Prepared by Dip-Coating Method,10.1149/2.1491714jes
7,7684,"In addition, the electrolysis operation of the prepared LSGM tubular cell with an atmosphere of 20% steam and 30% H-2 was examined and it was found that the prepared tubular type LSGM cell showed a reasonably large electrolysis current.",Reversible Operation of Tubular Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte Porous Layer on Dense Film Prepared by Dip-Coating Method,10.1149/2.1491714jes
8,7684,"The current density of the cell with and without LSGM porous layer was 1.47 and 1.11 A/cm(2) at the applied potential of 1.5 V, 973 K. As a result, it was found that the prepared LSGM electrolyte cell can be used as a reversible type cell with reasonable power density in SOFC operation and high H-2 formation rate in electrolysis operation by deposition of an LSGM porous layer on the Air electrode side.",Reversible Operation of Tubular Type Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte Porous Layer on Dense Film Prepared by Dip-Coating Method,10.1149/2.1491714jes
