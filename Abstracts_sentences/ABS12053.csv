1,12053,"Thin elemental coatings of Y, Co, and Y/Co on a commercial ferritic stainless steel (AISI444) were investigated for their effects on the growth kinetics and;nee specific resistance (ASR) of the scale formed at 800 degrees C After oxidation for 1000 h, the ASR value of the Y-coated AISI444 was less than that of the corresponding uncoated sample by the factor of two, because of a significant retardation of scale growth The Co coating also resulted in a decrease of the ASR value even though it significantly accelerated the scale growth The effects of the Y and Co coatings on scale growth were associated with the growth kinetics of the chromia sublayer in the scale The Y coating was most effective for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) interconnect applications because of the relatively low and stable ASR value with the lapse of oxidation time (C) 2009","Thin elemental coatings of yttrium, cobalt, and yttrium/cobalt on ferritic stainless steel for SOFC interconnect applications",10.1016/j.cap.2009.11.049
