1,20705,Gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) sols were synthesized by the controlled hydrolysis and condensation of cerium(IV) isopropoxide with each gadolinia doping agent to make a dense GDC diffusion barrier for solid oxide electrolyte cells (SOECs) and intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Densification of gadolinia-doped ceria diffusion barriers for SOECs and IT-SOFCs by a sol-gel process,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.143
2,20705,The crystallinity of a GDC sol using gadolinium(111) isopropoxide as the doping agent was five to six times stronger than that when using gadolinium(BI) nitrate hydrate as the doping agent.,Densification of gadolinia-doped ceria diffusion barriers for SOECs and IT-SOFCs by a sol-gel process,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.143

4,20705,The performance of a cell was highly improved from 0.60 W/cm(2) to 0.92 W/cm(2) at 750 degrees C by densification of the diffusion bather.,Densification of gadolinia-doped ceria diffusion barriers for SOECs and IT-SOFCs by a sol-gel process,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.143
5,20705,"EIS results suggest that the improved performance is mainly due to the reduced ohmic resistance through the composite electrolyte (i.e., YSZ/GDC).",Densification of gadolinia-doped ceria diffusion barriers for SOECs and IT-SOFCs by a sol-gel process,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.143
6,20705,"Finally, the degradation of a single cell with a dense GDC was maintained below 1.72%/1000 h, which was lower than that of a cell with a porous GDC (7.69%/1000 h).",Densification of gadolinia-doped ceria diffusion barriers for SOECs and IT-SOFCs by a sol-gel process,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.143
7,20705,"Based on these results, it can be concluded that the enhancement of the performance and durability of a single cell with a dense GDC was the result of reduced ohmic resistance through the composite electrolyte.",Densification of gadolinia-doped ceria diffusion barriers for SOECs and IT-SOFCs by a sol-gel process,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.143
