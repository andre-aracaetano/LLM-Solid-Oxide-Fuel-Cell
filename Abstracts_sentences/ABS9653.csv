1,9653,Nb2O5 is added to a borosilicate sealing system to improve the thermo-mechanical stability of the sealing interface between the glass and Fe-Cr metallic interconnect (Crofer 22APU) in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Effect of Nb2O5 doping on improving the thermo-mechanical stability of sealing interfaces for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/s41598-017-05725-y
2,9653,The thermo-mechanical stability of the glass/metal interface is evaluated experimentally as well as by using a finite element analysis (FEA) method.,Effect of Nb2O5 doping on improving the thermo-mechanical stability of sealing interfaces for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/s41598-017-05725-y
3,9653,"The sealing glass doped with 4 mol.% Nb2O5 shows the best thermo-mechanical stability, and the sealing couple of Crofer 22APU/glass/GDC (Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9) remains intact after 50 thermal cycles.",Effect of Nb2O5 doping on improving the thermo-mechanical stability of sealing interfaces for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/s41598-017-05725-y
4,9653,"In addition, all sealing couples show good joining after being held at 750 C-omicron for 1000 h. Moreover, the possible mechanism on the thermo-mechanical stability of sealing interface is investigated in terms of stress-based and energy-based perspectives.",Effect of Nb2O5 doping on improving the thermo-mechanical stability of sealing interfaces for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/s41598-017-05725-y
