2,18484,An enhancement in the electrochemical activity of oxygen reduction and a unique cathodic current hysteresis in cyclic voltammograms were observed.,The spillover of oxygen vacancies over strontium doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) cathode catalysts,10.1016/S0167-2991(97)80862-2
3,18484,The hysteresis became increasingly marked with the increase of oxygen partial pressure or the decrease of potential scan rate.,The spillover of oxygen vacancies over strontium doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) cathode catalysts,10.1016/S0167-2991(97)80862-2

6,18484,"The unique hysteresis in cyclic voltammograms and the increase of the cathodic currents in potential step measurements were found to be related to the formation and spillover of oxygen vacancies at high temperatures, the kinetics of which is determined by temperature, oxygen partial pressure and the cathodic potential applied.",The spillover of oxygen vacancies over strontium doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) cathode catalysts,10.1016/S0167-2991(97)80862-2
