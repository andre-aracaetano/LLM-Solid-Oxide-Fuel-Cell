1,19982,A B S T R A C T The synthesis of a Substitute Natural Gas (SNG) that is compatible with the gas grid composition requirements by using surplus electricity from renewable energy sources looks a favourable solution to store large quantities of electricity and to decarbonise the gas grid network while maintaining the same infrastructure.,Life Cycle Assessment of Substitute Natural Gas production from biomass and electrolytic hydrogen,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.033
2,19982,The most promising layouts for SNG production and the conditions under which SNG synthesis reduces the environmental impacts if compared to its fossil alternative is still largely untapped.,Life Cycle Assessment of Substitute Natural Gas production from biomass and electrolytic hydrogen,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.033
3,19982,"In this work, six different layouts for the production of SNG and electricity from biomass and fluctuating electricity are compared from the environmental point of view by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology.",Life Cycle Assessment of Substitute Natural Gas production from biomass and electrolytic hydrogen,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.033
4,19982,"Global Warming Potential (GWP), Cumulative Energy De-mand (CED) and Acidification Potential (AP) are selected as impact indicators for this analysis.",Life Cycle Assessment of Substitute Natural Gas production from biomass and electrolytic hydrogen,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.033
5,19982,The influence of key LCA methodological aspects on the conclusions is also explored.,Life Cycle Assessment of Substitute Natural Gas production from biomass and electrolytic hydrogen,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.033
6,19982,"In particular, two different functional units are chosen: 1 kg of SNG produced and 1 MJ of output energy (SNG and electricity).",Life Cycle Assessment of Substitute Natural Gas production from biomass and electrolytic hydrogen,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.033
7,19982,"Furthermore, different approaches dealing with co-production of electricity are also applied.",Life Cycle Assessment of Substitute Natural Gas production from biomass and electrolytic hydrogen,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.033
8,19982,The results show that the layout based on hydrogasification has the lowest impacts on all the considered cases apart from the GWP and the CED with SNG mass as the functional unit and the avoided burden approach.,Life Cycle Assessment of Substitute Natural Gas production from biomass and electrolytic hydrogen,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.033
9,19982,"Finally, the selection of the multifunctionality approach is found to have a significant in-fluence on technology ranking.",Life Cycle Assessment of Substitute Natural Gas production from biomass and electrolytic hydrogen,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.033
