1,17503,Exsolution has been intensively studied in the fields of energy conversion and storage as a method for the preparation of catalytically active and durable metal nanoparticles.,Cation-swapped homogeneous nanoparticles in perovskite oxides for high power density,10.1038/s41467-019-08624-0
2,17503,"Under typical conditions, however, only a limited number of nanoparticles can be exsolved from the host oxides.",Cation-swapped homogeneous nanoparticles in perovskite oxides for high power density,10.1038/s41467-019-08624-0
3,17503,"Herein, we report the preparation of catalytic nanoparticles by selective exsolution through topotactic ion exchange, where deposited Fe guest cations can be exchanged with Co host cations in PrBaMn1.7Co0.3O5+delta.",Cation-swapped homogeneous nanoparticles in perovskite oxides for high power density,10.1038/s41467-019-08624-0
4,17503,"Interestingly, this phenomenon spontaneously yields the host PrBaMn1.7Fe0.3O5+delta, liberating all the Co cations from the host owing to the favorable incorporation energy of Fe into the lattice of the parent host (Delta E-incorporation = -0.41 eV) and the cation exchange energy (Delta E-exchange = -0.34 eV).",Cation-swapped homogeneous nanoparticles in perovskite oxides for high power density,10.1038/s41467-019-08624-0
5,17503,"Remarkably, the increase in the number of exsolved nanoparticles leads to their improved catalytic activity as a solid oxide fuel cell electrode and in the dry reforming of methane.",Cation-swapped homogeneous nanoparticles in perovskite oxides for high power density,10.1038/s41467-019-08624-0
