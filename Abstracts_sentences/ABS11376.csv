3,11376,"Thus, H-2 production from ethanol has gained much attention worldwide.",Ethanol steam reforming over Pt catalysts supported on CexZr1-xO2 prepared via a glycine nitrate process,10.1021/ef700576f
4,11376,"In this work, H-2 production from ethanol steam reforming (ESR) was investigated over Pt catalysts supported on CexZr1-xO2 (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, or 0.8) developed via a glycine nitrate process.",Ethanol steam reforming over Pt catalysts supported on CexZr1-xO2 prepared via a glycine nitrate process,10.1021/ef700576f
5,11376,"The supports or catalysts were characterized by low temperature N-2 physical adsorption, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), H-2 temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed desorption of ethanol, and catalytic performance measurements for ESR at 350-550 degrees C. Initial catalyst stability was also investigated.",Ethanol steam reforming over Pt catalysts supported on CexZr1-xO2 prepared via a glycine nitrate process,10.1021/ef700576f
6,11376,"The results indicated that Pt/CexZr1-xO2 catalysts were highly active for ESR at lower temperatures, only yielding H-2, CO, CH4, and CO2 as products.",Ethanol steam reforming over Pt catalysts supported on CexZr1-xO2 prepared via a glycine nitrate process,10.1021/ef700576f
7,11376,"However, selectivity to CH4 was found around 50.0% at 350-400 degrees C, while selectivity of products at 450-550 degrees C was found close to thermodynamic control values, indirectly suggesting that ethanol first dehydrogenates on the metallic surface and then aldehyde undergoes decarbonylation, forming CO and CH4.",Ethanol steam reforming over Pt catalysts supported on CexZr1-xO2 prepared via a glycine nitrate process,10.1021/ef700576f
8,11376,The function of steam was to establish thermodynamic equilibria for methane steam reforming and water gas shift reactions.,Ethanol steam reforming over Pt catalysts supported on CexZr1-xO2 prepared via a glycine nitrate process,10.1021/ef700576f
9,11376,The high activity and good initial stability made the catalysts suitable for application to portable power generation by using a PEMFC combined with a solid oxide fuel cell or a methane internal combustion engine for capturing the energy in methane.,Ethanol steam reforming over Pt catalysts supported on CexZr1-xO2 prepared via a glycine nitrate process,10.1021/ef700576f
