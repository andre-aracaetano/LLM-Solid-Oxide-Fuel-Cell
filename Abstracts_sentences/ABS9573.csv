4,9573,"Ti) Pt/Ti alloy cathode shows five times lower degradation rate in activation resistance compared to a pure Pt cathode at 450 degrees C, resulting in a 33% enhancement in the maximum power density after 2 h of operation.",Co-sputtered Pt/Ti alloy cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.163407
5,9573,"We show that the performance enhancement of the Pt/Ti alloy cathode at elevated temperature is due to the formation of a catalytically active and thermally stable Pt3Ti alloy phase, in which coarsening is effectively prevented as opposed to its pure Pt counterpart.",Co-sputtered Pt/Ti alloy cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.163407
6,9573,"Moreover, we demonstrate that Pt/Ti alloy cathodes with excessive Ti content (>= 19 at%) suffer from the formation of a nonreactive TiO2 surface upon oxygen exposure at elevated temperature, which causes higher activation resistance.",Co-sputtered Pt/Ti alloy cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.163407
