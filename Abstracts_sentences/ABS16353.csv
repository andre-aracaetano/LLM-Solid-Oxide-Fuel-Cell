1,16353,A pulse reactor technique was utilized to measure CH4 oxidation rates under solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode conditions.,"Pulse Reactor Studies to Assess the Potential of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.4X0.1O3-δ (X = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, V) as Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes",10.1021/cm101567v
2,16353,"La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.4X0.1O3-delta powders (LSCMX, X = Co, Fe, Mn and Ni) were synthesized and were found to be phase-pure perovskites, space group R (3) over barC. All compositions were determined by XRD to be stable up to 800 degrees C in dry 20% CH4/N-2, at which point small amounts of a Ruddlesden-Poepper (RP) phase A(2)BO(4-delta) were detected.","Pulse Reactor Studies to Assess the Potential of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.4X0.1O3-δ (X = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, V) as Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes",10.1021/cm101567v
3,16353,"At higher temperatures, MnO and metallic Fe were observed, but no Ni and Co phases could be detected.","Pulse Reactor Studies to Assess the Potential of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.4X0.1O3-δ (X = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, V) as Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes",10.1021/cm101567v
4,16353,"Measurements of the CH4 reaction rates on LSCMX samples provided indirect evidence for the instability of Ni and Co containing perovskites at temperatures higher than 650 and 750 degrees C, respectively.","Pulse Reactor Studies to Assess the Potential of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.4X0.1O3-δ (X = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, V) as Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes",10.1021/cm101567v
5,16353,"At 600 and 650 degrees C, CH4 oxidation rates for LSCMCo and LSCMNi were similar to the rates on LSCM.","Pulse Reactor Studies to Assess the Potential of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.4X0.1O3-δ (X = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, V) as Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes",10.1021/cm101567v
6,16353,"At higher temperatures, CO2 and CO production on LSCMCo and LSCMNi samples was enhanced, which was ascribed to the exsolution of Co and Ni from the perovskite lattice.","Pulse Reactor Studies to Assess the Potential of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.4X0.1O3-δ (X = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, V) as Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes",10.1021/cm101567v
7,16353,"CO, production rates on LSCM and LSCM Fe continuously decreased with oxygen stoichiometry whereas LSCMCo and LSCMNi produced CO2 in two separate regions of oxygen stoichiometry.","Pulse Reactor Studies to Assess the Potential of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.4X0.1O3-δ (X = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, V) as Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes",10.1021/cm101567v
8,16353,"The second region was attributed to the reduction of Co and Ni, respectively, present either as a metal oxide or in an RP phase.","Pulse Reactor Studies to Assess the Potential of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.4X0.1O3-δ (X = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, V) as Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes",10.1021/cm101567v
9,16353,"For all temperatures, LSCM Fe had the lowest CH4 reaction rate of the materials tested.","Pulse Reactor Studies to Assess the Potential of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.4X0.1O3-δ (X = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, V) as Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes",10.1021/cm101567v
