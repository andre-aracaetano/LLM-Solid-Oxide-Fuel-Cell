1,10808,The feasibility of applying single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (SC-SOFCs) to power generators for exhaust energy recovery was investigated using both model and actual exhaust gases.,A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
2,10808,"In the experiments with model exhaust gases, a single cell, Ni-Ce0.8SM0.2O1.9/YSZ/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, was operated in a mixture of gases containing ppm levels of CH4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10 and O-2.",A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
3,10808,"The cell performance was considerably affected by the molar ratio of total hydrocarbons to 02, the operating temperature and the gas flow rate.",A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
4,10808,The optimal operating conditions of the SC-SOFC were found to be similar to those found in actual exhaust from gasoline engines.,A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
5,10808,Thermal and mechanical loading performance tests demonstrated high tolerance towards thermal cycling and breakage of the electrolyte.,A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
6,10808,Performance tests with and without a gas separator suggested that there is no requirement for a gas separator in an actual exhaust.,A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
7,10808,"in the experiments with actual exhaust gases, a 12-cell stack was installed to a 250-cm(3) engine.",A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
8,10808,"The open circuit voltages (OCVs) were between 5 and 8 V and independent of the number of revolutions, but were lower than the values expected from the model exhaust results.",A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
9,10808,This was considered to be due to the deviation of the actual exhaust gases from the model gases.,A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
10,10808,"Nevertheless, the stack performance was reproducible and stable in the range from 1,500 to 5,500 rpm.",A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
11,10808,"The resultant peak power reached above 1 W at 4,500 rpm.",A Single-Chamber SOFC Stack: Energy Recovery from Engine Exhaust,10.1002/fuce.200800017
