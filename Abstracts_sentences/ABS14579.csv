1,14579,"Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) consisting of NiO-Y0.16Zr0.92O2-delta (YSZ) anode support layer, NiO-YSZ anode functional layer, YSZ electrolyte and (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3-delta (LSM)-YSZ cathode were successfully fabricated by single-step cofiring at 1250 degrees C. Cells were prepared by tape casting, with Fe2O3 sintering aid used to obtain a nearly dense YSZ electrolyte.",Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated by Single Step Reduced-Temperature Co-Firing,10.1149/2.03716023jes
2,14579,Scanning electron microscope (SEM)-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed no evidence of reactions or interdiffusion between layers during co-firing.,Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated by Single Step Reduced-Temperature Co-Firing,10.1149/2.03716023jes
3,14579,"The cells yielded area specific resistance of 0.44 Omega cm(2) and a maximum power density of 0.91 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Impedance spectroscopy measurements showed that the LSM-YSZ cathode polarization resistance was higher for the co-fired cathodes than for a cathode that was fired separately at an optimized temperature of 1175 degrees C. However, reducing the cell co-firing time decreased cathode polarization resistance and increased cell power output.",Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated by Single Step Reduced-Temperature Co-Firing,10.1149/2.03716023jes
4,14579,"Analysis of SEM images showed that co-firing caused more sintering and coarsening than in the optimally-fired LSM-YSZ, reducing three-phase boundary density and explaining the increased cathode resistance.",Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated by Single Step Reduced-Temperature Co-Firing,10.1149/2.03716023jes
