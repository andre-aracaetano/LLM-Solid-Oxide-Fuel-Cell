1,2943,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode consisting of a NiFe bimetal alloy/(NiFe)O-x (NFA/NFO) core-shell-structured nanocatalyst-decorated ceramic substrate was fabricated by in situ reduction of A-site deficient cubic perovskite (Ba0.2Sr0.8)(0.9)Ni0.07Fe0.63Mo0.3O3-delta (BSNFM) in wet H-2 at 800 degrees C.,In Situ Exsolved NiFe/(NiFe)Ox Core-Shell-Structured Nanocatalysts on Perovskite Anode with Enhanced Coking Resistance,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01024
2,2943,The BSNFM-NFA/NFO ceramic anode exhibits an excellent catalytic activity toward H-2 and hydrocarbon fuels.,In Situ Exsolved NiFe/(NiFe)Ox Core-Shell-Structured Nanocatalysts on Perovskite Anode with Enhanced Coking Resistance,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01024
3,2943,"The La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte-supported SOFC single cell with a BSNFM-NFA/NFO anode delivers a P-max of 1099 mW cm(-2) in wet H-2 at 800 degrees C and 1049 mW cm(-2) in wet C3H8 at 850 degrees C, respectively.",In Situ Exsolved NiFe/(NiFe)Ox Core-Shell-Structured Nanocatalysts on Perovskite Anode with Enhanced Coking Resistance,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01024
4,2943,"Moreover, the single cell with a BSNFM-NFA/NFO anode showed a stable output under a constant current density of 1.0 A cm(-2) at 750 degrees C in C3H8 fuel, suggesting that BSNFM-NFA/NFO is a promising anode with outstanding coking resistance.",In Situ Exsolved NiFe/(NiFe)Ox Core-Shell-Structured Nanocatalysts on Perovskite Anode with Enhanced Coking Resistance,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01024
