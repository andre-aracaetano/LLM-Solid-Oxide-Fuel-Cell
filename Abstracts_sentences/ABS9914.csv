2,9914,yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coating for the electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Understanding of suspension DC plasma spraying of finely structured coatings for SOFC,10.1109/TPS.2005.845094
3,9914,A suspension of YSZ powder (d(50) similar to 1 mu m) was mechanically injected in direct current (dc) plasma jets.,Understanding of suspension DC plasma spraying of finely structured coatings for SOFC,10.1109/TPS.2005.845094
4,9914,"The plasma jet acted as an atomizer and the suspension drops (d similar to 200 mu m) were sheared, long before they started vaporiziiig, into many droplets (d similar to 2 mu m).",Understanding of suspension DC plasma spraying of finely structured coatings for SOFC,10.1109/TPS.2005.845094
5,9914,The solvent of the latters was then very rapidly (a few microseconds) evaporated and decomposed by the plasma jet.,Understanding of suspension DC plasma spraying of finely structured coatings for SOFC,10.1109/TPS.2005.845094
6,9914,The solid particles enclosed in each droplet were then accelerated and melted before impacting on the substrate where they formed splats.,Understanding of suspension DC plasma spraying of finely structured coatings for SOFC,10.1109/TPS.2005.845094
7,9914,"The thermal inertia of particles with sizes below 1 mu m being low, the standoff distance was much shorter than in conventional plasma spraying (40-60 against 100-120 mm).",Understanding of suspension DC plasma spraying of finely structured coatings for SOFC,10.1109/TPS.2005.845094
8,9914,"Thus, the heat flux from the plasma to the coating reached 20 MW(.)m(-2) when spraying YSZ suspensions with Ar-H-2 or Ar-H-2-He plasma jets.",Understanding of suspension DC plasma spraying of finely structured coatings for SOFC,10.1109/TPS.2005.845094
9,9914,"It allowed keeping the whole pass (about 0.8-mu m-thick) completely molten resulting after its solidification, for YSZ, in a fully dense coating (20-30-mu m-thick) with a granular microstructure.",Understanding of suspension DC plasma spraying of finely structured coatings for SOFC,10.1109/TPS.2005.845094
