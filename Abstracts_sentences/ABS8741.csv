1,8741,A core-shell structured catalyst Ni-BaO-CeO2@SiO2 (@NBC; 7.87% Ni content) with high catalytic activity and thermal stability is prepared and utilized for partial oxidation of methane.,Improvement of solid oxide fuel cell performance by a core-shell structured catalyst using low concentration coal bed methane fuel,10.1002/er.5301
2,8741,The catalyst is introduced into the Ni-8 mol% Y-stabilized ZrO2 anode of a conventional solid oxide fuel cell (CC) by direct spraying (denoted as P-@NBC//CC) and indirect loading as an independent catalyst layer (denoted as Y-@NBC//CC) to improve the coking resistance and cell stability when low concentration coal bed methane is used.,Improvement of solid oxide fuel cell performance by a core-shell structured catalyst using low concentration coal bed methane fuel,10.1002/er.5301
3,8741,"At 800 degrees C, the maximum power density of P-@NBC//CC and Y-@NBC//CC increases by similar to 26.8% and 32.8%, respectively, over that of CC (0.63 W cm(-2)).",Improvement of solid oxide fuel cell performance by a core-shell structured catalyst using low concentration coal bed methane fuel,10.1002/er.5301
4,8741,"At a discharge current of 0.16 A at 800 degrees C, the voltage of CC drops to 0 V after 16 hours.",Improvement of solid oxide fuel cell performance by a core-shell structured catalyst using low concentration coal bed methane fuel,10.1002/er.5301
5,8741,"In contrast, the voltage of P-@NBC//CC decreases from 0.8 to 0.6 V within 30 hours, and that of Y-@NBC//CC decreases from 0.8 to 0.7 V over 180 hours.",Improvement of solid oxide fuel cell performance by a core-shell structured catalyst using low concentration coal bed methane fuel,10.1002/er.5301
6,8741,The manner of loading of the catalyst layer has a significant effect on the cell stability.,Improvement of solid oxide fuel cell performance by a core-shell structured catalyst using low concentration coal bed methane fuel,10.1002/er.5301
7,8741,The indirect loading mode as an independent catalyst layer has an advantage over the direct spraying method.,Improvement of solid oxide fuel cell performance by a core-shell structured catalyst using low concentration coal bed methane fuel,10.1002/er.5301
8,8741,"The postmortem microstructure of the cell reveals that direct spray loading on the anode surface allows the catalyst particles to penetrate into the anode layer and blocks the anode pores, resulting in a lower porosity and higher diffusion resistance.",Improvement of solid oxide fuel cell performance by a core-shell structured catalyst using low concentration coal bed methane fuel,10.1002/er.5301
