1,19652,Films of yuria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) on a polished silicon substrate of diameter up to 125 mm have been produced in a large-area pulsed laser deposition (PLD) setup under typical PLD conditions.,Thickness determination of large-area films of yttria-stabilized zirconia produced by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.apsusc.2005.07.145
2,19652,The film thickness over the full film area has been determined by energy-dispersive Xray spectrometry in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with use of a method similar to one described by Bishop and Poole.,Thickness determination of large-area films of yttria-stabilized zirconia produced by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.apsusc.2005.07.145
3,19652,The attenuation of the electron-induced X-rays from the Si wafer by the film was monitored at a number of points along a diameter and the thickness was determined by Monte Carlo simulations of the attenuation for various values of film thickness with the program CASINO.,Thickness determination of large-area films of yttria-stabilized zirconia produced by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.apsusc.2005.07.145
4,19652,These results have been compared with direct measurements in the SEM of the film thickness on a cross-section on one of the wafers.,Thickness determination of large-area films of yttria-stabilized zirconia produced by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.apsusc.2005.07.145
5,19652,"The results of these measurements demonstrate the ability of this technique to accurately determine the thickness of a large film, i.e. up to diameters of 125 mm, in a relatively short time, without destroying the substrate, without the need of a standard sample and without the need of a flat substrate.",Thickness determination of large-area films of yttria-stabilized zirconia produced by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.apsusc.2005.07.145
6,19652,We have also demonstrated that by controlling the deposition parameters large-area YSZ films with uniform thickness can be produced.,Thickness determination of large-area films of yttria-stabilized zirconia produced by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.apsusc.2005.07.145
