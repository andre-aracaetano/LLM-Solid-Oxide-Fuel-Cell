2,16336,"Utilizing the h-adaptive finite-element method, we solve the electrochemical potential and flux for both ionic and electronic species in the MIEC, taking the transport properties of Sm0.15Ce0.85O1.925-delta (SDC15).",Surface reaction and transport in mixed conductors with electrochemically-active surfaces: a 2-D numerical study of ceria,10.1039/c0cp01219j
3,16336,"In addition to the ionic flux that flows between the two sides of the cell, there are two types of electronic fluxes: (1) cross-plane current that flows in the same general direction as the ionic current, and (2) in-plane current that flows between the catalytically-active MIEC surface and the metal current collectors.",Surface reaction and transport in mixed conductors with electrochemically-active surfaces: a 2-D numerical study of ceria,10.1039/c0cp01219j
4,16336,"From an evaluation of these fluxes, the macroscopic interfacial resistance is decomposed into an electrochemical reaction resistance and an electron diffusion-drift resistance, the latter associated with the in-plane electronic current.",Surface reaction and transport in mixed conductors with electrochemically-active surfaces: a 2-D numerical study of ceria,10.1039/c0cp01219j

Haile, Solid State Ionics, 2008, 179, 1036-1041) indicates that surface reaction rather than electron migration is the overall rate-limiting step, and suggests furthermore that the surface reaction rate, which has not been directly measured in the literature, scales with p(O2)(-1/4).",Surface reaction and transport in mixed conductors with electrochemically-active surfaces: a 2-D numerical study of ceria,10.1039/c0cp01219j
