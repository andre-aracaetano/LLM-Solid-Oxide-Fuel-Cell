1,11611,Orthoferrite-based perovskites are of interest as materials for the cathode in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Chemical interactions between La-Sr-Mn-Fe-O-based perovskites and yttria-stabilized zirconia,
2,11611,"Therefore, the chemical compatibility between perovskites of the composition (La1-xSrx)(z)Fe1-yMny O3-delta (O less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.3; 0.2 less than or equal to y less than or equal to 1; z = 0.90, 0.95, 1.00) and the solid electrolyte zirconia (ZrO2) doped with 8 mol% yttria (Y2O3) (8YSZ) has been investigated, Powder mixtures of the two materials have beers annealed at different temperatures, The formation of monoclinic ZrO2 at 1000 degrees C, as well as of La2Zr2O7 and SrZrO3 at 1400 degrees C, has been determined in some samples.",Chemical interactions between La-Sr-Mn-Fe-O-based perovskites and yttria-stabilized zirconia,
3,11611,"The reactions that are observed are discussed, with respect to the thermodynamic activities, tolerance factor, and oxygen-ion migration energies.",Chemical interactions between La-Sr-Mn-Fe-O-based perovskites and yttria-stabilized zirconia,
4,11611,"Some perovskite compositions seem to be compatible with Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ), thereby offering the possibility to use orthoferrite-based perovskites in SOFCs with a solid electrolyte made of YSZ.",Chemical interactions between La-Sr-Mn-Fe-O-based perovskites and yttria-stabilized zirconia,
