1,6068,Doped ceria has been widely studied as electrolyte materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,An Efficient SOFC Based on Samaria-Doped Ceria (SDC) Electrolyte,10.1149/2.032206jes
2,6068,"While high peak power densities have been reported, the electronic conductivity of doped ceria under fuel cell operating conditions reduces the open circuit voltage (OCV) and hence energy efficiency, more so with thinner electrolyte membrane at higher operating temperatures.",An Efficient SOFC Based on Samaria-Doped Ceria (SDC) Electrolyte,10.1149/2.032206jes
3,6068,Here we report a new cell structure: a thin SDC electrolyte membrane supported by a composite anode consisting of a mixed-ion conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) and NiO.,An Efficient SOFC Based on Samaria-Doped Ceria (SDC) Electrolyte,10.1149/2.032206jes
4,6068,"The inter-diffusion between BZCYYb and SDC during co-firing results in a thin layer of doped barium cerate and zirconate at the interface, which suppresses the electronic conduction of SDC and enhances the OCV and cell performance.",An Efficient SOFC Based on Samaria-Doped Ceria (SDC) Electrolyte,10.1149/2.032206jes
5,6068,The new cell structure also shows excellent stability when wet hydrogen or methane was used as fuel at 750 degrees C. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.,An Efficient SOFC Based on Samaria-Doped Ceria (SDC) Electrolyte,10.1149/2.032206jes
