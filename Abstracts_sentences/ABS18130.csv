1,18130,The sintering characteristics and physical properties of Ni/YSZ cermets were investigated in connection with the sinterability of YSZ powders and the amount of NiO. Commercial YSZ and pre-calcined YSZ were used for the cermets.,Effects of sinterability of YSZ powder and NiO content on characteristics of Ni-YSZ cermets,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00173-8
