2,16729,The effect of the co-dopants on phase stability and electrical properties was investigated.,Dysprosium and Gadolinium Double Doped Bismuth Oxide Electrolytes for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0951605jes
3,16729,Phase transformation from cubic to rhombohedral was observed as Gd dopant concentration increased and consequently resulted in conductivity degradation.,Dysprosium and Gadolinium Double Doped Bismuth Oxide Electrolytes for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0951605jes
4,16729,The stabilization of high temperature cubic phase was achieved with a total dopant concentration as low as similar to 12 mol% with 8 mol% Dy and 4 mol% Gd double dopant composition (8D4GSB) and this composition showed one of the highest total conductivity reported at this low temperature regime.,Dysprosium and Gadolinium Double Doped Bismuth Oxide Electrolytes for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0951605jes
