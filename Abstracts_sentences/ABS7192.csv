3,7192,"The as-prepared high-entropy La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) incorporates five components into A-site of LSM perovskite, including La, Pr, Nd, Sm and Sr (La0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Sr0.2MnO3-delta, HE-LSM).",A novel facile strategy to suppress Sr segregation for high-entropy stabilized La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228959

5,7192,"Besides, the lattice distortion of HE-LSM caused by the high dispersity of A-site cations will lead to the formation of disordered stress field around Sr, which can limit the transport rate of Sr.",A novel facile strategy to suppress Sr segregation for high-entropy stabilized La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228959
6,7192,"Further long-term stability test indicates that HE-LSM is rather stable under the operation condition, demonstrating that high-entropy perovskite oxide is a potential cathode material which can suppress the cation segregation for solid oxide fuel cell.",A novel facile strategy to suppress Sr segregation for high-entropy stabilized La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228959
