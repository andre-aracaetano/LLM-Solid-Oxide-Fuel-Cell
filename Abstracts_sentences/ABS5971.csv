1,5971,Ethanol and methane are compared as candidate fuels for generation of electrical power in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs).,Ethanol And Methane Fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Comparative Study,10.1007/BF02419235
2,5971,The thermodynamic analysis of both alternatives was undertaken considering that a SOFC operates with the equilibrium products of the steam reforming of each raw fuel.,Ethanol And Methane Fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Comparative Study,10.1007/BF02419235
3,5971,"The comparison was made assuming SOFC operation under atmospheric total pressure in the temperature range of 800-1200K, and results were obtained in terms of the maximun theoretical electromotive force (emf) and the thermodynamic efficiency of total energy conversion.",Ethanol And Methane Fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Comparative Study,10.1007/BF02419235
4,5971,"It was found that although methane fueled SOFCs are able to provide slightly higher efficiencies, ethanol is a competitive alternative fuel with suitable characteristics.",Ethanol And Methane Fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Comparative Study,10.1007/BF02419235
