5,21047,The results show that electrical undershoots or overshoots occur after fast voltage changes.,Transient characteristics of a solid oxide electrolysis cell under different voltage ramps: Transport phenomena behind overshoots,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116759
6,21047,This phenomenon reflects the discrepancies between the steady and transient current-voltage characteristics and may lead to unsteady hydrogen production rates in practice.,Transient characteristics of a solid oxide electrolysis cell under different voltage ramps: Transport phenomena behind overshoots,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116759
7,21047,"The electrical undershoots or overshoots are caused by the different transfer rates in SOEC - electronic/ionic transfer rate is faster than mass transfer rate, and mass transfer rate is faster than heat transfer rate.",Transient characteristics of a solid oxide electrolysis cell under different voltage ramps: Transport phenomena behind overshoots,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116759
8,21047,"Furthermore, the electrical undershoots or overshoots can be divided into two parts.",Transient characteristics of a solid oxide electrolysis cell under different voltage ramps: Transport phenomena behind overshoots,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116759
9,21047,"One part is related to mass-transfer lag, and the other part is related to heat-transfer lag.",Transient characteristics of a solid oxide electrolysis cell under different voltage ramps: Transport phenomena behind overshoots,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116759
10,21047,"The former can be alleviated or eliminated by simply slowing down the voltage ramp, while the latter needs a more effective control strategy other than merely adjusting the voltage ramps.",Transient characteristics of a solid oxide electrolysis cell under different voltage ramps: Transport phenomena behind overshoots,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116759
11,21047,"Apart from the electrical conditions, cell structure also has significant impacts on the electrical responses, e.g., the rib and the length of channel are related to the non-uniform electrical responses in the functional layer.",Transient characteristics of a solid oxide electrolysis cell under different voltage ramps: Transport phenomena behind overshoots,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116759
12,21047,"Finally, via a quantitative technique developed from linear time-invariant systems, it is shown that the electrical responses of SOEC are governed by two time constants in the functional layer, namely the mass-transfer time constant (estimated as m,H2O,FL = 0.00723 s) and the heat-transfer time constant (estimated as t,FL= 180 s).",Transient characteristics of a solid oxide electrolysis cell under different voltage ramps: Transport phenomena behind overshoots,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116759
