1,15969,BaIn0.3Ti0.7O2.85 (BIT07) is a suitable electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) but half cells based on La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) as a cathode material show a degradation of the Area Specific Resistance (ASR) at 700 degrees C with time.,"Synthesis, structural analysis and electrochemical performances of BLSITCFx as new cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) based on BITO7 electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.052
2,15969,This study deals with the characterization of alternative cathode materials showing a better compatibility with BIT07 than LSCF.,"Synthesis, structural analysis and electrochemical performances of BLSITCFx as new cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) based on BITO7 electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.052
3,15969,"A new solid solution, BaxLa0.58(1.x)Sr0.4(1-x)In0.3xTi0.7xCo0.2(1-x)Fe0.8(1-x)O3-delta, with 0 <= x <= 1, also called BLSITCFx, with in this case x expressed in molar %, derived from BIT07 and LSCF, has been synthesized at 1350 degrees C in air using BIT07 and LSCF powders.","Synthesis, structural analysis and electrochemical performances of BLSITCFx as new cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) based on BITO7 electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.052

5,15969,Symmetrical half cells based on these two new materials deposited on BIT07 electrolyte have been studied by complex impedance spectroscopy in air versus temperature and time.,"Synthesis, structural analysis and electrochemical performances of BLSITCFx as new cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) based on BITO7 electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.052
6,15969,"Their behaviour is comparable to LSCF's, with ASR values never exceeding 0.2 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, and moreover their less important Thermal Expansion Coefficient (TEC) mismatch with BIT07 lead to a better mechanical compatibility with time.","Synthesis, structural analysis and electrochemical performances of BLSITCFx as new cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) based on BITO7 electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.052
