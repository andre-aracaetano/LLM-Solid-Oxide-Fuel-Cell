1,330,"The development of the Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell, now 65 years old in its pure molten-salt cell embodiment, has spawned a remarkable variety of designs and technologies (gas-fed fuel cells, direct carbon fuel cells, solid oxide FC hybrids, CO2 concentrating/capture and hydrogen generating systems).","MOLTEN SALT FUEL CELLS: Diversity and convergence, cycles and recycling",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.197
2,330,Sometimes these new subsets are recycling ideas from earlier stages of fuel cell exploration - which extend quite far back.,"MOLTEN SALT FUEL CELLS: Diversity and convergence, cycles and recycling",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.197
3,330,"Since Grove's discovery in 1840, diversification of the fuel has been a persistent lure and challenge - which led to exploration of ionic melts.","MOLTEN SALT FUEL CELLS: Diversity and convergence, cycles and recycling",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.197
4,330,"Much later, after the isolation and identification of solid-oxide conductors, the path to a purely carbonate cell became conceptually clear.","MOLTEN SALT FUEL CELLS: Diversity and convergence, cycles and recycling",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.197
5,330,"Its history since then has had several critical points, of diversification and convergence.","MOLTEN SALT FUEL CELLS: Diversity and convergence, cycles and recycling",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.197
6,330,"Like all energy technologies, it is forever at the mercy of the economics, and politics, of primary energy resources - the balance between fossil and renewable.","MOLTEN SALT FUEL CELLS: Diversity and convergence, cycles and recycling",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.197
