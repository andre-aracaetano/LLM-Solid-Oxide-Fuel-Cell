1,13417,"To lower the operating temperatures in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operations, anode-supported SOFC single cells with a single dip-coated interlayer were fabricated and the effect of the interlayer oil the electrolyte structure and the electrical performance was investigated.",Effect of interlayer on structure and performance of anode-supported SOFC single cells,10.1016/j.ultramic.2008.04.069
2,13417,"For the preparation of SOFC single cells, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, NiO-YSZ anode, and 50% YSZ-50% strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) cathode were used.",Effect of interlayer on structure and performance of anode-supported SOFC single cells,10.1016/j.ultramic.2008.04.069
3,13417,"In order to characterize the cells, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were utilized and the gas (air) permeability measurements were conducted for gas tightness estimation.",Effect of interlayer on structure and performance of anode-supported SOFC single cells,10.1016/j.ultramic.2008.04.069
4,13417,"When the interlayer was inserted onto NiO-YSZ anode, the surface toughness of anode was diminished by about 40% and dense crack-free electrolytes were obtained.",Effect of interlayer on structure and performance of anode-supported SOFC single cells,10.1016/j.ultramic.2008.04.069
5,13417,"The electrical performance was enhanced remarkably and the maximum power density was 0.57 W/cm(2) at 800 C and 0.44 W/cm(2) at 700 degrees C. On the other hand, the effect of interlayer on the gas tightness was negligible.",Effect of interlayer on structure and performance of anode-supported SOFC single cells,10.1016/j.ultramic.2008.04.069
6,13417,The characterization Study revealed that the enhancement in the electrical performance was mainly attributed to the increase of ion transmission area of anode/electrolyte interface and the increase of ionic conductivity of dense crack-free electrolyte layer.,Effect of interlayer on structure and performance of anode-supported SOFC single cells,10.1016/j.ultramic.2008.04.069
