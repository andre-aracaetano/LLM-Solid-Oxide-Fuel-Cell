2,724,The degradation rates were found to be higher in electrolysis than in fuel cell operation.,Degradation mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ composite electrode operated under solid oxide electrolysis and fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.05.011
3,724,"Post-test analyses have revealed that Sr diffusion and formation of SrZrO3 at YSZ/CGO interface occur mainly during electrolysis operation, whereas the process is very limited in fuel cell mode.",Degradation mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ composite electrode operated under solid oxide electrolysis and fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.05.011

5,724,An in-house multi-scale model has been used to interpret the role of the cell operating mode on the LSCF demixing mechanism.,Degradation mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ composite electrode operated under solid oxide electrolysis and fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.05.011
6,724,The simulations have shown that the electrolysis operation leads to a strong depletion of oxygen vacancies in LSCF material (while the fuel cell condition results in an increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies).,Degradation mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ composite electrode operated under solid oxide electrolysis and fuel cell conditions,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.05.011
