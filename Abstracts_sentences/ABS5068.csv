1,5068,La(Sr)MnO3 cathodes have been investigated as high temperature oxygen reduction electrodes in the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL CATHODE FABRICATED BY ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION,10.1149/1.2055028
2,5068,The cathodes consist of 10 mole percent of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin film electrolyte layer deposited on a porous La0.81Sr0.09MnO3 tube using the electrochemical vapor deposition method.,HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL CATHODE FABRICATED BY ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION,10.1149/1.2055028
3,5068,The La(Sr)KnO3/YSZ cathodes have different electrochemical properties from those fabricated with the sintering method.,HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL CATHODE FABRICATED BY ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION,10.1149/1.2055028
4,5068,The cathode polarization was about 1 mV at a current density of 1.5 A/cm2 in oxygen at 1000-degrees-C. This type of cathode has an extremely large phase boundary and large interfacial capacitance (more than 1 F/cm2) which is approximately proportional to the oxygen partial pressure.,HIGH-PERFORMANCE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL CATHODE FABRICATED BY ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION,10.1149/1.2055028
