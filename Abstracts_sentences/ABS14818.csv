4,14818,"The RMD simulations at different fuel gas components show that in the H2/CO/Ni/YSZ system the H2 conversion rate maintains the maximum (100%), and the conversion rate of CO improves compared with that of pure CO fuel in the case of 30%H2-70%CO.",ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics study on electrochemistry of H2/CO hybrid fuel in Ni/YSZ anode,10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125989
5,14818,"Two ways of CO2 generation are found: one is that the CO(Ni) species formed by the adsorption and activation of CO on the Ni surface is oxidized by the lattice oxygen; the other is the oxidation of CO(Ni) by spillover atomic oxygen, which is adsorbed on the Ni surface.",ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics study on electrochemistry of H2/CO hybrid fuel in Ni/YSZ anode,10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125989
