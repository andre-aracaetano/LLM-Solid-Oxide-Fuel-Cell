5,13222,"Overall, graded electrodes have much lower area specific resistance (ASR) than ungraded electrodes.",Enhanced Performance of a Pr4Ni3O10±δ-Ce0.75Gd0.1Pr0.15O2-δ Composite Electrode via Particle Size Grading,10.1021/acsaem.3c03139
6,13222,"The lowest ASR obtained for graded electrodes is 0.059 Omega cm2 at 625 degrees C (0.025 Omega cm2 at 698 degrees C) and pO2 of 0.21 atm, nearly a one-fold decrease compared to 0.11 Omega cm2 for ungraded electrodes at the same condition.",Enhanced Performance of a Pr4Ni3O10±δ-Ce0.75Gd0.1Pr0.15O2-δ Composite Electrode via Particle Size Grading,10.1021/acsaem.3c03139
