2,13765,"A nickel powder of median size 14 mum or a NiO powder of median size 2.5 mum was mixed with Sm-doped ceria (SDC) powder (median size 0.87 mum) with a composition of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9, which was produced by the calcination of an oxalate solid solution (Ce0.8Sm0.2)(2)(C2O4)(3) at 600degreesC. The mixtures of Ni/SDC (sample A) and NiO/SDC (sample B) were sintered at 1300degreesC in air to a relative density of 58.6% and 97.3%, respectively.","Preparation, microstructures and electrical properties of a Ni/Sm-doped ceria cermet as an anode material of a solid oxide fuel cell",
3,13765,"During the sintering of the cermet, the Ni powder was oxidized to NiO in sample A.","Preparation, microstructures and electrical properties of a Ni/Sm-doped ceria cermet as an anode material of a solid oxide fuel cell",
4,13765,The NiO component in the as-sintered cermet was reduced to Ni in a H-2-H2O atmosphere of an oxygen partial pressure similar to10(-20) atm at 700degreesC. Both the cermets showed a high stability of high electronic conduction to 100 h of heating at 700degreesC in a low oxygen partial pressure atmosphere.,"Preparation, microstructures and electrical properties of a Ni/Sm-doped ceria cermet as an anode material of a solid oxide fuel cell",
5,13765,Sample A with large Ni particles was too brittle to handle after the heating.,"Preparation, microstructures and electrical properties of a Ni/Sm-doped ceria cermet as an anode material of a solid oxide fuel cell",
6,13765,Sintering of the fine Ni grains in sample B proceeded at 700degreesC.,"Preparation, microstructures and electrical properties of a Ni/Sm-doped ceria cermet as an anode material of a solid oxide fuel cell",
