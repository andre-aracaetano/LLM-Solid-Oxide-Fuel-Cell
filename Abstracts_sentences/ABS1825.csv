1,1825,"Studies of oxygen diffusion, interphase exchange, specific electric conductivity, and thermal expansion showed that perovskite-like Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3 - delta (SCMO) as a potential cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has considerable advantages over the conventional materials based on lanthanum-strontium manganites.",Stability and functional properties of Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3-δ as cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1134/S1023193514080084
2,1825,"To prevent the interactions of SCMO with solid electrolyte membranes of stabilized zirconia and lanthanum gallate, it is necessary to deposit protective layers of solid solutions based on cerium oxide, which do not form new phases in contact with SCMO and electrolytes.",Stability and functional properties of Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3-δ as cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1134/S1023193514080084
3,1825,The trials of model SOFCs with porous SCMO-based cathodes demonstrated satisfactory electrochemical and endurance characteristics of these electrodes.,Stability and functional properties of Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3-δ as cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1134/S1023193514080084
