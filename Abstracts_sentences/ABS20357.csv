2,20357,"To address this scenario, (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 (MCO)-coated Crofer 22 APU interconnect coupons are subjected to thermal cycling, and intermittent current density, with gas compositions relevant to high-temperature electrolysis (elevated steam:hydrogen ratio and oxygen content).","Dynamic oxidation of (Mn,Co)3O4-Coated interconnects for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.110
3,20357,"Defects are also intentionally introduced in the MCO coating, to assess whether the difference in oxidation properties of the adjacent coated and uncoated (defective) surfaces causes sufficient stress to damage the protective oxide scale.","Dynamic oxidation of (Mn,Co)3O4-Coated interconnects for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.110
4,20357,"Specimens with defects are subjected to oxidation for 1000 h at 800 degrees C, or thermal cycling.","Dynamic oxidation of (Mn,Co)3O4-Coated interconnects for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.110
5,20357,"Before thermal cycling, some specimens are pre-oxidized to create a thick oxide scale to mimic the scale thickness expected after similar to 30 kh operation.","Dynamic oxidation of (Mn,Co)3O4-Coated interconnects for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.110
6,20357,"In all cases, the coating and oxide scale remain well adhered with no cracking observed.","Dynamic oxidation of (Mn,Co)3O4-Coated interconnects for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.110
7,20357,"Area-specific resistance (ASR) is monitored in both single-atmosphere and dual-atmosphere conditions, and the ASR is stable and is not impacted by dynamic cycling of the current density.","Dynamic oxidation of (Mn,Co)3O4-Coated interconnects for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.110
8,20357,"This work provides confidence that the MCO coated interconnect will function as needed in dynamic operation conditions, even with coating defects.","Dynamic oxidation of (Mn,Co)3O4-Coated interconnects for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.110
