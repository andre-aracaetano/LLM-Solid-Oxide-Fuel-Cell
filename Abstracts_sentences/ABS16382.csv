2,16382,"In this study, BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-sigma-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (BCFZY-GDC) composite cathode with infiltration of PrOx nanoparticles is systematically investigated.",Enhanced reaction kinetics of BCFZY-GDC-PrOx composite cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141617
3,16382,"It is found that not only the composite cathodes demonstrate excellent phase compatibility, but also their reaction kinetics toward oxygen reduction reactions is substantially improved.",Enhanced reaction kinetics of BCFZY-GDC-PrOx composite cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141617
4,16382,"Simultaneously, when the amount of the PrOx nanoparticles is about 18 mg/cm(2), the R-p value of the resultant cathode reaches the minimum, and the value is about 0.082 Omega center dot cm(2) at the operating temperature of 600 degrees C, which is only 25.3% of that of the cathode without PrOx.",Enhanced reaction kinetics of BCFZY-GDC-PrOx composite cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141617
5,16382,"Furthermore, at operating temperatures of 700 degrees C, 650 degrees C, and 600. degrees C, the single-cell's power densities with the configuration of Ni-YSZ/YSZ/GDC/Pr18 (PrOx in BCFZY-GDC cathode is 18 mg/cm(2)) can reach about 1.55, 1.02, 0.56 W cm(-2) under H-2 atmosphere, and 1.22, 0.78, 0.39 W cm 2 under 20%CH3OH-80%N-2 atmosphere, respectively, which is among the top high values based on the commercially available Ni-YSZ anode-supported single cells.",Enhanced reaction kinetics of BCFZY-GDC-PrOx composite cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141617
6,16382,The mechanism investigation further verifies that the enhanced reaction kinetics can be attributed to the improved surface exchange and ion transfer at the cathode's oxygen reduction reactions.,Enhanced reaction kinetics of BCFZY-GDC-PrOx composite cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141617
