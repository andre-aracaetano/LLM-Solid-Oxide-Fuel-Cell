3,8393,"The results show that conductivity depends on the rare earth dopant, its amount, an appearance of second phase, and the microstructure.","Ionic conductivity of Sm, Gd, Dy and Er-doped ceria",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.104
4,8393,"With 10 mol% dopant, Sm exhibits higher conductivity than Gd, Dy and Er, respectively.","Ionic conductivity of Sm, Gd, Dy and Er-doped ceria",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.104
5,8393,"With an increase in Dy content, the total conductivity increases, which is attributed to an increase in grain boundary conductivity.","Ionic conductivity of Sm, Gd, Dy and Er-doped ceria",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.104
6,8393,"By contrast, an increasing amount of Er from 10 to 20 mol% reduces the conductivity of ceria and results in a separated phase of Er2O3 as detected by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.","Ionic conductivity of Sm, Gd, Dy and Er-doped ceria",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.104
7,8393,"In addition, the grain size corresponding to grain boundary density affects the conductivity due to the contributions from the grain interior and grain boundary conductivities.","Ionic conductivity of Sm, Gd, Dy and Er-doped ceria",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.104
