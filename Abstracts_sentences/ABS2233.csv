1,2233,"In this study, the effect of hydrogen, on the degradation of AISI 441 interconnect, under solid oxide fuel cell operating conditions was investigated between 500-800 degrees C for 336 h. As a new hypothesis, it is concluded that, hydrogen impedes Cr diffusion, probably in the grain boundaries, leading to the breakdown of the protective oxide scale.",The effect of hydrogen on the breakdown of the protective oxide scale in solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.corsci.2020.109112
2,2233,"This effect is most severe at 600 degrees C, while at lower or higher temperatures the effect is attenuated.",The effect of hydrogen on the breakdown of the protective oxide scale in solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.corsci.2020.109112
3,2233,"Cr diffusion is enhanced at high temperatures, whereas protective scales can be obtained at low temperatures with a lower amount of Cr.",The effect of hydrogen on the breakdown of the protective oxide scale in solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.corsci.2020.109112
