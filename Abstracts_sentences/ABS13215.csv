1,13215,In this paper a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system for cogeneration of heat and power integrated with a stratified heat storage tank is studied.,Modelling of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell CHP System Coupled with a Hot Water Storage Tank for a Single Household,10.3390/en8032211
2,13215,"The use of a storage tank with thermal stratification allows one to increase the annual operating hours of CHP: heat can be produced when the request is low (for instance during the night), taking advantage of thermal stratification to increases the heat recovery performance.",Modelling of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell CHP System Coupled with a Hot Water Storage Tank for a Single Household,10.3390/en8032211
3,13215,A model of the SOFC system is presented to estimate the energy required to meet the average electric energy demand of the residence.,Modelling of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell CHP System Coupled with a Hot Water Storage Tank for a Single Household,10.3390/en8032211
4,13215,"Two fuels are considered, namely syngas produced by gasification and natural gas.",Modelling of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell CHP System Coupled with a Hot Water Storage Tank for a Single Household,10.3390/en8032211
5,13215,The tank model considers the temperature gradients over the tank height.,Modelling of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell CHP System Coupled with a Hot Water Storage Tank for a Single Household,10.3390/en8032211
6,13215,The results of the numerical simulation are used to size the SOFC system and storage heat tank to provide energy for a small household using two different fuels.,Modelling of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell CHP System Coupled with a Hot Water Storage Tank for a Single Household,10.3390/en8032211
7,13215,"In particular it was shown that in the case of syngas, due to larger system heat output, a larger tank volume was required in order to accumulate unused heat over the night.",Modelling of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell CHP System Coupled with a Hot Water Storage Tank for a Single Household,10.3390/en8032211
8,13215,The detailed description of the tank model will be useful to energy system modelers when sizing hot water tanks.,Modelling of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell CHP System Coupled with a Hot Water Storage Tank for a Single Household,10.3390/en8032211
9,13215,Problem formulation is reported also using a Matlab script.,Modelling of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell CHP System Coupled with a Hot Water Storage Tank for a Single Household,10.3390/en8032211
