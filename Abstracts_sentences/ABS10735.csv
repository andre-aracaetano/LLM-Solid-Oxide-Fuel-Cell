2,10735,Gd 0.1 O 1.95 cermet anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs) for direct use of biogas fuel containing trace amounts of H 2 S was investigated at 700 degrees C.,Adaptation of Ni 0.6 Cu 0.4 / Ce 0.9 Gd 0.1 O 1.95 cermet anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells to actual biogas fuel containing trace amounts of H 2 S: E ff ects of catalyst amount and fuel supply rate,10.2109/jcersj2.23193
3,10735,The catalyst amount and fuel supply rate were investigated based on the stable power generation conditions achieved with simulated biogas.,Adaptation of Ni 0.6 Cu 0.4 / Ce 0.9 Gd 0.1 O 1.95 cermet anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells to actual biogas fuel containing trace amounts of H 2 S: E ff ects of catalyst amount and fuel supply rate,10.2109/jcersj2.23193
4,10735,The catalyst amount was increased by enlarging the electrode area and anode thickness to produce a tri-layered anode.,Adaptation of Ni 0.6 Cu 0.4 / Ce 0.9 Gd 0.1 O 1.95 cermet anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells to actual biogas fuel containing trace amounts of H 2 S: E ff ects of catalyst amount and fuel supply rate,10.2109/jcersj2.23193
5,10735,The in fl uence of H 2 S poisoning was mitigated and the stability of the power generation performance was improved.,Adaptation of Ni 0.6 Cu 0.4 / Ce 0.9 Gd 0.1 O 1.95 cermet anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells to actual biogas fuel containing trace amounts of H 2 S: E ff ects of catalyst amount and fuel supply rate,10.2109/jcersj2.23193
6,10735,"However, increasing the amount of catalyst caused an increase in carbon deposition on the anodes.",Adaptation of Ni 0.6 Cu 0.4 / Ce 0.9 Gd 0.1 O 1.95 cermet anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells to actual biogas fuel containing trace amounts of H 2 S: E ff ects of catalyst amount and fuel supply rate,10.2109/jcersj2.23193
7,10735,"When the fuel supply rate was decreased, carbon deposition was suppressed and the amount of H 2 S supplied was also reduced, further improving the stability of the power generation performance, sustainable for 24 h. These results are expected to provide important insights into the practical applications of IT-SOFCs that directly use biogas as a fuel.",Adaptation of Ni 0.6 Cu 0.4 / Ce 0.9 Gd 0.1 O 1.95 cermet anodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells to actual biogas fuel containing trace amounts of H 2 S: E ff ects of catalyst amount and fuel supply rate,10.2109/jcersj2.23193
