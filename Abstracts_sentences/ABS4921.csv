1,4921,"To develop solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) capable of operating on sulfur-containing practical fuels at intermediate temperatures, further improvement of the sulfur tolerance of a Ni+BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3- (BZCY) anode is attempted through the addition of some metal modifiers (Fe, Co, and Ag) by a one-pot synthesis approach.",One-pot synthesis of silver-modified sulfur-tolerant anode for SOFCs with an expanded operation temperature window,10.1002/aic.15649
2,4921,"The effects of these modifiers on the electrical conductivity, morphology, sulfur tolerance, and electrochemical activity of the anode are systematically studied.",One-pot synthesis of silver-modified sulfur-tolerant anode for SOFCs with an expanded operation temperature window,10.1002/aic.15649
3,4921,"As a result, the cell with Ag-modified Ni+BZCY anode demonstrates highest power output when operated on 1000 ppm H2S-H-2 fuel.",One-pot synthesis of silver-modified sulfur-tolerant anode for SOFCs with an expanded operation temperature window,10.1002/aic.15649
4,4921,"Furthermore, the Ag-modified anode displays much better stability than Ni+BZCY with 1000 ppm H2S-H-2 fuel at 600 degrees C. These results suggest that the addition of Ag modifier into Ni+BZCY is a promising and efficient method for improving the sulfur tolerance of SOFCs.",One-pot synthesis of silver-modified sulfur-tolerant anode for SOFCs with an expanded operation temperature window,10.1002/aic.15649
