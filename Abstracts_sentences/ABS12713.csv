2,12713,"In this study, to enhance the sulfur tolerances of anodes for solid oxide fuel cells, we have used a dip-coating method to modify the pore wall surfaces of conventional nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) anodes by coating them with ceria nanoparticles (10-20 nm).",Ceria Coatings Effect on H2S Poisoning of Ni/YSZ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3499215
3,12713,"We have monitored the sulfur poisoning process in various H2S concentrations at 700 degrees C. Because the ceria reacted with H2S to form Ce2O2S, which acted as a sulfur sorbent, Ni3S2 was hardly formed in the ceria-coated Ni/YSZ anode; therefore, its performance dropped to a lesser degree relative to that of the conventional Ni/YSZ anode.",Ceria Coatings Effect on H2S Poisoning of Ni/YSZ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3499215
4,12713,"Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy revealed that the polarization resistance increased upon increasing the H2S concentration.",Ceria Coatings Effect on H2S Poisoning of Ni/YSZ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3499215
5,12713,Our results suggest that ceria nanocoatings on Ni-YSZ anodes provide greater sulfur tolerance at higher H2S concentrations (>= 200 ppm) and lower operating temperatures (700 degrees C).,Ceria Coatings Effect on H2S Poisoning of Ni/YSZ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3499215
