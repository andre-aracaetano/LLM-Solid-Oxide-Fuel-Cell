4,19053,"Using the synchrotron technique of total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF), it was found that the kinetics of Sr surface segregation was enhanced when annealing at 800 degrees C in a high-CO2 partial pressure, as compared to a similar anneal in a CO2-free atmosphere, with the oxygen partial pressure being constant in both cases.",Effect of atmospheric CO2 on surface segregation and phase formation in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin films,10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.09.019
