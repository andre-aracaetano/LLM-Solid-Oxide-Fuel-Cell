1,4565,Ruddlesden-Popper phases of the formula (LaNiO3)(n)LaO are potential materials for intermediatetemperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes.,Novel La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ composites for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.106
2,4565,The n = 1 phase La2NiO4+delta is known to have good ionic conductivity but its performance as a single-phase cathode is limited by its electronic conductivity.,Novel La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ composites for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.106
3,4565,The n = 3 phase La4Ni3O10-delta is known to have good total conductivity but has been little-explored as a cathode.,Novel La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ composites for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.106
4,4565,In this study we explore composite electrodes of these two materials with a view to taking advantage of their complimentary properties.,Novel La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ composites for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.106
5,4565,The performance of these electrodes is compared to that of the single-phase end-members and is found to be improved above 600 degrees C. A 50:50 wt.% La2NiO4+delta:La4Ni3O10-delta mix gave the best performance and represents best-in-class for these materials.,Novel La2NiO4+δ and La4Ni3O10-δ composites for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.106
