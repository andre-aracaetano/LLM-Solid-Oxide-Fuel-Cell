1,449,"Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, ITSOFCs, have attracted considerable attention lately due to the prospects of obtaining a ceramic fuel cell that operates at a reduced temperature, approximately 500 to 750degreesC, compared to the traditional high temperature solid oxide fuel cells operating at 800-1000degreesC. The ITSOFCs offer many advantages such as minimized material problems yet the reaction kinetics are fast enough for using non-noble catalysts in the electrodes.",Ceria-based electrolytes for intermediate temperature SOFCs - Electric and dielectric properties,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1257
2,449,These devices are thus very promising both regarding technical as well as economical issues and may therefore play an important role in the future.,Ceria-based electrolytes for intermediate temperature SOFCs - Electric and dielectric properties,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1257
3,449,In the search for an electrolyte with the desired properties at reduced temperatures Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 is the most studied material and in the present work we report on the dielectric properties on this model material.,Ceria-based electrolytes for intermediate temperature SOFCs - Electric and dielectric properties,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1257
