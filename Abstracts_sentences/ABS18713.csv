1,18713,"Here we investigate the elemental and phase compositions during the solid-state synthesis of the promising SOFC-anode material, Sr2MgMoO6, and demonstrate that molybdenum does not notably evaporate under the normal synthesis conditions with temperatures up to 1200 degrees C due to the formation of SrMoO4 as an intermediate product at low temperatures, below 600 degrees C. However, partial decomposition of the Sr2MgMoO6 phase becomes evident at the higher temperatures (similar to 1500 degrees C).",Role of SrMoO4 in Sr2MgMoO6 synthesis,10.1016/j.jssc.2011.03.045
