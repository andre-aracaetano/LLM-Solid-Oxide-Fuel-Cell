1,12972,A unitized regenerative solid oxide fuel cell (URSOFC) can be considered as a next-generation power source and a storage device in the future since it can generate electricity in the SOFC mode and also produce H-2/O-2 in the solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) mode.,Analytically investigating the characteristics of a high-temperature unitized regenerative solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/er.3071
