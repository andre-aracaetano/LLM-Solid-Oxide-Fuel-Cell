1,795,This modeling study focuses on gasification of carbon by CO2 in a minimally fluidized bed containing a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Modeling of CO2 Gasification of Carbon for Integration with Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aic.11713
2,795,"Kinetic parameters for a five-step reaction mechanism characterizing the Boudouard reaction (C + CO2 -> 2CO) were determined thermogravimetrically at 1 atm from 973 to 1273 K. Experimentally determined kinetic parameters are employed in a transport model that predicts velocities and gas concentration profiles established in the carbon bed as a consequence of convection, diffusion, and heterogeneous reaction.",Modeling of CO2 Gasification of Carbon for Integration with Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aic.11713
3,795,"The model is used to simulate the effect of an imbedded SOFC, in contact with the carbon bed.",Modeling of CO2 Gasification of Carbon for Integration with Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aic.11713
4,795,"Although the model does not assume particular I-V characteristics for the fuel cell, it indicates that current densities in the practical range of 100-1000 mA/cm(2) can be supported.",Modeling of CO2 Gasification of Carbon for Integration with Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aic.11713
5,795,"Results show that temperature strongly affects the current density, whereas CO2 flow I-ate has only a weak effect.",Modeling of CO2 Gasification of Carbon for Integration with Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aic.11713
