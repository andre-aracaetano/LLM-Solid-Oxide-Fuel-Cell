2,14036,Nickel and precious metal catalysts were tested at 650 degrees C and 700 degrees C inlet temperature.,Carbon formation in catalytic steam reforming of natural gas with SOFC anode off-gas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.074
3,14036,The oxygen to carbon (O/C) molar ratio of the inlet gas was varied between 0.3 and 2.0 to find out the limit O/C ratio for carbon formation.,Carbon formation in catalytic steam reforming of natural gas with SOFC anode off-gas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.074
4,14036,Two natural gas compositions were used: low purity Danish gas and high purity Russian gas.,Carbon formation in catalytic steam reforming of natural gas with SOFC anode off-gas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.074
5,14036,The experimental limit was found to be 0.9-1.25 for nickel catalyst and 0.5-0.75 for precious metal catalyst.,Carbon formation in catalytic steam reforming of natural gas with SOFC anode off-gas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.074
6,14036,The limit was higher with Danish gas than with Russian gas in the experiments with nickel catalyst but this effect was not observed with the precious metal catalyst.,Carbon formation in catalytic steam reforming of natural gas with SOFC anode off-gas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.074
7,14036,A good correlation between experimental results and thermodynamic calculations was found using the principle of actual gas: the calculations estimated the O/C limit ratio for nickel at 1.0 and for precious metal catalyst between 0.5 and 0.7.,Carbon formation in catalytic steam reforming of natural gas with SOFC anode off-gas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.074
