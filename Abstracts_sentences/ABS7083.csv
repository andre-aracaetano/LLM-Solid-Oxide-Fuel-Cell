1,7083,"Kerosene, as a widely used liquid hydrocarbon fuel, is difficult to convert directly in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) due to the coking issue.","Co-generation of gas and electricity on liquid antimony anode solid oxide fuel cells for high efficiency, long-term kerosene power generation",10.1016/j.energy.2022.125758
2,7083,"Liquid antimony anodes (LAAs) are promising for converting complex hydrocarbon fuels, but the intrinsic low open circuit voltage (0.72 V at 750 degrees C) limits the energy efficiency of LAA-SOFCs.","Co-generation of gas and electricity on liquid antimony anode solid oxide fuel cells for high efficiency, long-term kerosene power generation",10.1016/j.energy.2022.125758
3,7083,"In this paper, we propose a method using LAA-SOFCs as an electrochemical partial oxidation reformer of kerosene, which has the potential to co-generate electricity and syngas.","Co-generation of gas and electricity on liquid antimony anode solid oxide fuel cells for high efficiency, long-term kerosene power generation",10.1016/j.energy.2022.125758
4,7083,The conversion processes for kerosene in the different components of LAAs were investigated.,"Co-generation of gas and electricity on liquid antimony anode solid oxide fuel cells for high efficiency, long-term kerosene power generation",10.1016/j.energy.2022.125758
5,7083,"In liquid Sb2O3, kerosene was partially oxidized into gaseous products with an oxygen/carbon ratio of 1.3-2 at 750-900 degrees C, which can be directly used as reforming feedstock to produce syngas.","Co-generation of gas and electricity on liquid antimony anode solid oxide fuel cells for high efficiency, long-term kerosene power generation",10.1016/j.energy.2022.125758
6,7083,"We also measured an LAA-SOFC with sulfur-containing kerosene as the fuel for 650 h at 750 degrees C, and the stable cell performance demonstrated the good durability of the cell.","Co-generation of gas and electricity on liquid antimony anode solid oxide fuel cells for high efficiency, long-term kerosene power generation",10.1016/j.energy.2022.125758
7,7083,"Comparison between the gas-electricity co-generation method and conventional fuel processing methods demonstrates that LAA-SOFCs are attractive as a primary gas-electricity co-generation module for high-efficiency, long-term kerosene-fuelled series power generation systems.","Co-generation of gas and electricity on liquid antimony anode solid oxide fuel cells for high efficiency, long-term kerosene power generation",10.1016/j.energy.2022.125758
