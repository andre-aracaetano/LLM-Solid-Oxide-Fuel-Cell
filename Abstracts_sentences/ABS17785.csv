1,17785,This work investigated the mechanical and electrical properties of NiO-SDC/SDC anode sintered by two different methods: in a microwave at about 1200 degrees C for 1 h and in a conventional furnace at 1200 degrees C with a holding time of 1 h (total sintering time of 21 h).,Characterization of IT-SOFC non-symmetrical anode sintered through conventional furnace and microwave,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.151

4,17785,"The electrical behaviors of all sintered samples were studied using electrochemical impedance spectra in the frequency range of 0.01-10(5) Hz under 97% H-2-3% H2O, an amplitude of 10 mV, and at high temperature range of 600-800 degrees C. Results indicate that the non-symmetrical NiO-SDC/SDC anode achieved through microwave sintering has finer grain size and higher electrochemical performance.",Characterization of IT-SOFC non-symmetrical anode sintered through conventional furnace and microwave,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.151
