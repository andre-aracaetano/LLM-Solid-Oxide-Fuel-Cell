1,5053,The work contains the results of studies of a promising composite material of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 + Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 for electrodes of symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells.,Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell with strontium ferrite-molybdenum electrodes,10.1134/S1023193517060131
2,5053,"It is shown that conductivity of the composite at 800A degrees C is about 10 and 15 S/cm, for air and humid hydrogen, respectively, and polarization resistance of the electrodes in contact with the electrolyte based on doped lanthanum gallate under the same conditions is about 0.26 and 0.12 Ohm cm(2).",Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell with strontium ferrite-molybdenum electrodes,10.1134/S1023193517060131
3,5053,Tests of a symmetrical fuel cell with a planar design and the supporting gallate electrolyte with the thickness of 300 mu m show that the cell can develop the power of about 0.5 W/cm(2) at 800A degrees C when air is supplied to the cathode and humid hydrogen is supplied to the anode.,Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell with strontium ferrite-molybdenum electrodes,10.1134/S1023193517060131
4,5053,Analysis of polarization losses shows that the polarization of the oxygen electrode considerably exceeds the polarization of the anode.,Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell with strontium ferrite-molybdenum electrodes,10.1134/S1023193517060131
