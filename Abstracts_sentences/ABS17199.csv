1,17199,"Rare earth (Pr, Nd, Sm) manganite cathode materials with formula Ln(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3) were obtained from oxides by solid reaction at temperature of 1400 degrees C, The produced compounds display an orthorhombic perovskite structure similar to LaMnO3 when x less than or equal to 0.5.","A study of (Pr, Nd, Sm)1-xSrxMnO3 cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00378-6
2,17199,The results of electrical conductivity measurement show that the three rare earth manganites exhibit about 0.5 to one order of magnitude higher in conductivity than La1-xSrxMnO3 at above 500 degrees C. Thick film of the synthesized manganites were formed on YSZ solid electrolyte by spin-coating technique.,"A study of (Pr, Nd, Sm)1-xSrxMnO3 cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00378-6
3,17199,The morphology and reaction of the interface between the YSZ electrolyte and rare earth manganites cathode film were investigated by SEM and XRD.,"A study of (Pr, Nd, Sm)1-xSrxMnO3 cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00378-6
