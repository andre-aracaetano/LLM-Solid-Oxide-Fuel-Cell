2,9987,"A single cell, composed of similar to 120 mu m-thick NiFe-support, similar to 30 mu m-thick Ni-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) anode, and similar to 15 mu m-thick YSZ electrolyte, shows a good mechanical flexibility.",Flexible solid oxide fuel cells supported on thin and porous metal,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.040
3,9987,"With the use of a thin metal (NiFe) support, the degree of bending for the metal-supported cell is much larger than that for the anode- or electrolyte-supported SOFCs as the displacement shows under the mechanical load.",Flexible solid oxide fuel cells supported on thin and porous metal,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.040
4,9987,The rupture of the cell is also largely prevented due to its flexibility.,Flexible solid oxide fuel cells supported on thin and porous metal,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.040
5,9987,A thin NiFe-supported cell that operated at 800 degrees C with a LSCF (La0.6Sr0.4CO0.2Fe0.8O3-delta) cathode shows a power density of similar to 430 mW cm(2).,Flexible solid oxide fuel cells supported on thin and porous metal,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.040
6,9987,This type of cell is promising as a mobile or portable power generator because it is light weight and highly resistant to mechanical shocks.,Flexible solid oxide fuel cells supported on thin and porous metal,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.040
