1,2809,This study presents the final results of a series of modelling steps which are undertaken for the performance assessment of the building cogeneration and polygeneration systems using solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Modelling and evaluation of building integrated SOFC systems,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.003
2,2809,"Based on earlier work, generic SOFC cell stack and system models were developed and employed to analyze different SOFC systems configurations for optimal efficiencies, this SOFC system model is used to derive performance input data for transient whole-building and energy system simulation tools which contain simpler SOFC system models.",Modelling and evaluation of building integrated SOFC systems,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.003
3,2809,These steps are shortly summarized here.,Modelling and evaluation of building integrated SOFC systems,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.003
4,2809,"Then the final step, the evaluation of building integrated co- and polygeneration SOFC systems in terms of primary energy demand and CO2 emissions, employing such tools, is presented here for a polygeneration system with typical heating and cooling loads, and electricity demand profiles, for different SOFC systems, including a comparison to current standard technologies.",Modelling and evaluation of building integrated SOFC systems,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.003
