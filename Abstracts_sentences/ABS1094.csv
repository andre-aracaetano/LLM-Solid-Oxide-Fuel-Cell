1,1094,An electrochemical model of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has been developed with given geometry and material properties.,Structural parameters study of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1179/174602205X39803
2,1094,"The model includes an evaluation of ohmic, activation and concentration polarization.",Structural parameters study of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1179/174602205X39803
3,1094,The effects of two structural parameters such as the thickness of electrolyte and the pore size on the model predictions are discussed.,Structural parameters study of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1179/174602205X39803
4,1094,Results show that the ohmic loss is the biggest one among the three losses and decreasing the thickness of electrolyte or increasing the value of mean pore radius leads to an increase of power output of the SOFC.,Structural parameters study of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1179/174602205X39803
