1,1518,The applicability of calcium-borosilicate glass-ceramics with high boron oxide content as a sealant for solid oxide fuel cells is studied.,Calcium-Borosilicate Glass-Ceramics as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193524030121
2,1518,"Chemical composition of the studied materials is: 33 mol % CaO, 21 mol % B2O3, and 46 mol % SiO2.",Calcium-Borosilicate Glass-Ceramics as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193524030121
3,1518,The material is studied as an alternative to the existing calcium- and barium-aluminosilicate-based sealants because of the latters' limited adhesion to steel interconnects in fuel cells.,Calcium-Borosilicate Glass-Ceramics as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193524030121
4,1518,"The studied sealant is shown to have a softening point of about 920-930 degrees C, which allows using it for sealing of fuel cells at 925 degrees C. Use of relatively low sealing temperature allows avoiding overheating of the cell during the sealing and avoiding the accompanying degradation of the battery operational characteristics.",Calcium-Borosilicate Glass-Ceramics as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193524030121
5,1518,The studied sealant demonstrated excellent adhesion to the surface of interconnect materials (the Crofer 22 APU steel).,Calcium-Borosilicate Glass-Ceramics as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193524030121
6,1518,"Furthermore, the studied sealant is found to be thermomechanically compatible with the Crofer 22 APU steel and ZrO2-based electrolytes.",Calcium-Borosilicate Glass-Ceramics as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193524030121
