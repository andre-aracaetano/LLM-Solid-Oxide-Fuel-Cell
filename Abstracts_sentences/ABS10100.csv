5,10100,"The increase in the ASR for this alloy is found to be only 15 m Omega cm(2)/kh and is ascribed to the thin dense oxide layer (similar to 0.4 mu m), the presence of spinel (MnCrO4) at the outer side of the oxide layer, and the improved oxide layer adherence to the metal substrate.",Highly durable nano-oxide dispersed ferritic stainless steel interconnects for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227109
