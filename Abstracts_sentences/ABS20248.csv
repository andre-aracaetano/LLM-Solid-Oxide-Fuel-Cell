5,20248,"Structural refinement of powder neutron diffraction data showed that both compounds have a hexagonal cell (space group P-3; a = b approximate to 9.7, c approximate to 7.2 Angstrom).","A powder neutron diffraction study of the oxide-ion-conducting apatite-type phases, La9.33Si6O26 and La8Sr2Si6O26",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00835-3
6,20248,"in addition to the presence of vacancies on the cation sites, the sample La9.33Si6O26 also showed a key difference in the channel oxygen sites compared to La8Sr2Si6O26.","A powder neutron diffraction study of the oxide-ion-conducting apatite-type phases, La9.33Si6O26 and La8Sr2Si6O26",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00835-3
7,20248,"For the latter the channel oxygen atoms all appear to be located close to the ideal (0.0.0.25) site, whereas for La9.33Si6O26, similar to 14% of these oxygens are displaced to a new position around (0,0, = 0.38).","A powder neutron diffraction study of the oxide-ion-conducting apatite-type phases, La9.33Si6O26 and La8Sr2Si6O26",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00835-3
8,20248,From these studies we can propose that the higher conductivity and lower activation energy for oxide ion conduction in La9.33Si6O26 compared to La8Sr2Si6O26 is due to this observed disorder on the channel sites.,"A powder neutron diffraction study of the oxide-ion-conducting apatite-type phases, La9.33Si6O26 and La8Sr2Si6O26",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00835-3
