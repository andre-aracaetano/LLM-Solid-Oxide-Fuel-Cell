1,3429,Subsolidus equilibria in air in the RuO2-CeO2 and RuO2-Y2O3-CeO2 systems were studied with the aim of obtaining information on possible interactions between the Y2Ru2O7-based cathode and the CeO2-based solid electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Subsolidus phase equilibria in the RuO2-Y2O3-CeO2 system,10.1016/S0025-5408(00)00436-0
