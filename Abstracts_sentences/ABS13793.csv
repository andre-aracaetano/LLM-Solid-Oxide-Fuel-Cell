4,13793,"The V, Co, and Ni doping in the La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.9Ti0.1O3-based perovskite enhanced their air-sintering characteristics, and in particular, the V-doped samples with a V content of 0.02 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.05 reached greater than or equal to90% relative density after treatment at 1600degreesC for 20 h. It was found that the V doping in the perovskites had a tendency to decrease an isothermal expansion under a H-2 atmosphere.",Enhancing effect on densification and thermal expansion compatibility for La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.9Ti0.1O3-Based SOFC interconnect with B-Site doping,10.1149/1.1479154
5,13793,"Thus, La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.9xTi0.1VxO3 perovskites (0.02 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.05) is a promising candidate for interconnect in high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.",Enhancing effect on densification and thermal expansion compatibility for La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.9Ti0.1O3-Based SOFC interconnect with B-Site doping,10.1149/1.1479154
