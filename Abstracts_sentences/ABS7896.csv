1,7896,The electrochemical behaviour of Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (Ni-CGO) with a NiO content of 2.5 and 70 wt.% was investigated by impedance spectroscopy.,Electrochemical characterization of Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ for SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.022
2,7896,Symmetrical cells with yttrium-stabilized zirconia as electrolyte were prepared with screen printing and then sintered at 1250 degreesC for 5 h. The microstructure of the anode material after sintering was analysed by SEM.,Electrochemical characterization of Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ for SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.022
