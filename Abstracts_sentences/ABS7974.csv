2,7974,This effect was not observed for cells with cathodes that did not contain manganese.,SOFC Ohmic Resistance Reduction by HCl-Induced Removal of Manganese at the Anode/Electrolyte Interface,10.1149/1.3380668
3,7974,Substantial amounts of Mn were found throughout the grain boundaries of the 8 mol % yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte.,SOFC Ohmic Resistance Reduction by HCl-Induced Removal of Manganese at the Anode/Electrolyte Interface,10.1149/1.3380668
4,7974,"Exposure to HCl partially removed Mn near the anode/electrolyte interface, presumably by volatilization as MnCl(2)(g).",SOFC Ohmic Resistance Reduction by HCl-Induced Removal of Manganese at the Anode/Electrolyte Interface,10.1149/1.3380668
5,7974,This work suggests that one of the underlying causes of the higher than expected electrolyte resistance in anode-supported SOFCs involves the formation of a Mn-containing insulating layer at grain boundaries.,SOFC Ohmic Resistance Reduction by HCl-Induced Removal of Manganese at the Anode/Electrolyte Interface,10.1149/1.3380668
