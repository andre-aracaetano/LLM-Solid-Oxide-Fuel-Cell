2,12267,"Here, we report our findings in notably improving ORR. dynamics and stability of A-site-deficient (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.95)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode using PrO2-delta/Pr0.8Ce0.2O2-delta nanoparticles.",Enhancing Activity and Durability of A-Site-Deficient (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode by Surface Modification with Pr2-δ Nanoparticles,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b07354
3,12267,"The LSCF + PrO2-delta cathode shows an area-specific resistance of similar to 0.241 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, which is about 67% lower than that of pristine LSCF cathode (similar to 0.738 Omega cm(2)).",Enhancing Activity and Durability of A-Site-Deficient (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode by Surface Modification with Pr2-δ Nanoparticles,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b07354
4,12267,"Furthermore, anode-supported single cells with LSCF + PrO2-delta/Pr0.8Ce0.2O2-delta cathodes show excellent peak power densities (similar to 1457.8 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C and similar to 516.7 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C) and enhanced durability (0.9 A cm(-2) for similar to 100 h).",Enhancing Activity and Durability of A-Site-Deficient (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode by Surface Modification with Pr2-δ Nanoparticles,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b07354
5,12267,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses indicate that Pro(2-delta) accelerates ORR kinetics by creating an active surface with abundant oxygen vacancies and improving ionic conductivity.,Enhancing Activity and Durability of A-Site-Deficient (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode by Surface Modification with Pr2-δ Nanoparticles,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b07354
6,12267,"The active surface promotes cation migration, leading to the formation of active SrxCoyOz, which may further contribute to the improvement of ORR kinetics.",Enhancing Activity and Durability of A-Site-Deficient (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode by Surface Modification with Pr2-δ Nanoparticles,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b07354
7,12267,"It is found that the distinctive LSCF/SrxCoyOz/PrO2-delta heterostructure plays a vital role in improving the surface stability of LSCF cathode, and the strategy of adjusting the intrinsic activity and thermal expansion behavior of catalytic coatings has also proven to be effective in enhancing the durability of an electrode.",Enhancing Activity and Durability of A-Site-Deficient (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode by Surface Modification with Pr2-δ Nanoparticles,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b07354
