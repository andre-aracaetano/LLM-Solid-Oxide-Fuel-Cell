3,2740,"In this work, an analytical model is derived to quantitatively evaluate the poisoning effects of H2S. The results show that sulfur poisoning correlates closely with inefficient gas diffusion for small anode pore size, small porosity/tortuosity, and low working temperatures.",Synergistic Effects of Sulfur Poisoning and Gas Diffusion on Polarization Loss in Anodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aic.15997
4,2740,"As compared with concentration polarization, H2S-diffusion-induced activation polarization in thin anodes with a large epsilon/tau is detrimental, especially for low-temperature operations with a high H2S concentration and a low current density.",Synergistic Effects of Sulfur Poisoning and Gas Diffusion on Polarization Loss in Anodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aic.15997
