1,14703,"Half-cell structures of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a thin and dense electrolyte layer of 8YSZ supported by a thick and porous Ni0-8YSZ anode precursor structure were reduced in a gas mixture of 5% H-2-95% Ar at 800 degrees C for selected time periods in order to fabricate cermets with desired microstructure and composition, and to study their effects on the elastic properties at ambient and reactive atmospheres.","Studies on phase formation, microstructure development and elastic properties of reduced NiO-8YSZ anode supported bi-layer half-cell structures of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.materresbull.2011.12.002
