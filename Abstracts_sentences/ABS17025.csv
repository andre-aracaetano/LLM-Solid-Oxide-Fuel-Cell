1,17025,Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with different Cr protection layers on the metallic interconnect were operated in a short stack at 700 degrees C for 1240 h.,Insight into the Reaction Mechanism of (La0.58Sr0.40)(Co0.20Fe0.80)O3-δ Cathode with Volatile Chromium Species at High Current Density in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1149/2.0051710jes
2,17025,"The current density was raised sequentially from 0.5 A cm(-2) during the first 240 h of operation to 0.75 A cm(-2) for a further 1000 h. After operation, the (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-delta (LSCF) cathode layers were analyzed with respect to Cr interaction by both wet chemical and microstructural methods.",Insight into the Reaction Mechanism of (La0.58Sr0.40)(Co0.20Fe0.80)O3-δ Cathode with Volatile Chromium Species at High Current Density in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1149/2.0051710jes
3,17025,"For cells equipped with interconnects coated with a dense APS protection layer, the amount of Cr on the cathode was in the range of a few mu g. For cells with a porous WPS coating on the interconnect, the amount of Cr was in the range of 110-160 mu g cm(-2) and Cr-containing phases were detected by SEM analysis both on top of the cathode layer and also at the LSCF/GDC interface, which has rarely been observed before.",Insight into the Reaction Mechanism of (La0.58Sr0.40)(Co0.20Fe0.80)O3-δ Cathode with Volatile Chromium Species at High Current Density in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1149/2.0051710jes
4,17025,"In addition, a deterioration of the cathode microstructure near the LSCF/GDC interface was observed.",Insight into the Reaction Mechanism of (La0.58Sr0.40)(Co0.20Fe0.80)O3-δ Cathode with Volatile Chromium Species at High Current Density in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1149/2.0051710jes
5,17025,"With respect to the high current density during operation, a theory was developed which explains both the Cr deposition at the LSCF/GDC interface and also the deterioration of the cathode.",Insight into the Reaction Mechanism of (La0.58Sr0.40)(Co0.20Fe0.80)O3-δ Cathode with Volatile Chromium Species at High Current Density in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1149/2.0051710jes
