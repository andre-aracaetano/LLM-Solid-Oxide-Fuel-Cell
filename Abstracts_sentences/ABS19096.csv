1,19096,"In this paper, a series of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SSC-SDC) composite with different ratios were prepared and characterized as oxygen electrodes for solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs).",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300091
2,19096,Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was selected as the electrolyte with a SDC barrier layer to avoid detrimental solid state interaction between SSC and YSZ.,Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300091
3,19096,"At 850 degrees C, the impedance spectra showed that the optimum SDC content in the composite electrode was found to be about 30wt.%, which showed a much lower area specific resistance of 0.03cm(2).",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300091
4,19096,The electrochemical performances of a Ni-YSZ hydrogen electrode supported YSZ membrane SOEC with the SSC-SDC73 oxygen electrode were also measured at 750-850 degrees C.,Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300091
5,19096,"The hydrogen production rate calculated from the Faraday's law was 327mLcm(-2)h(-1) at 850 degrees C at an electrolysis voltage of 1.3V with a steam concentration of approximate to 40%, which indicated that the SSC-SDC73 was a promising oxygen electrode candidate for high temperature electrolysis cells.",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300091
