5,12858,"The power density of SOFC supported by a graded Ni-YSZ anode is 284 mW.cm(-2), operated at 850 degrees C using H-2 as a fuel, but decreases to 143 mW.cm(-2) when the fuel is changed to CH4.",Preparation and Properties of Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on a Graded Cu-CeO2-Ni-YSZ Composite Anode,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201305151
6,12858,"In contrast, the cell supported by a Cu-CeO2-Ni-YSZ anode show the reverse behavior, increasing from 176 to 196 mW.cm(-2) when the fuel is changed from H-2 to CH4 at 850 degrees C.",Preparation and Properties of Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on a Graded Cu-CeO2-Ni-YSZ Composite Anode,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201305151
7,12858,"Under a 250 mA.cm(-2) load using CH4 as the fuel, the output of the cell with a graded Ni-YSZ anode fluctuats and the cell is blocked after 10 h. At this point, carbon particles or fibers are observed in the anode layer by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",Preparation and Properties of Direct-Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on a Graded Cu-CeO2-Ni-YSZ Composite Anode,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201305151
