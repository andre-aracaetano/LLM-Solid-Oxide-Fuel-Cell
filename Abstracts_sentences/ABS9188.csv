2,9188,"In an effort to bridge this gap, this study describes the experimental implementation of steady-state real-time optimization (RTO) to an SOFC system that consists of both hardware and software components.",Real-time optimization of an experimental solid-oxide fuel-cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.03.025
3,9188,The proposed adaptive optimization scheme uses an approximate steady-state model of the fuel-cell system and corrects it appropriately so that it becomes excellent for optimization.,Real-time optimization of an experimental solid-oxide fuel-cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.03.025
4,9188,"This way, the plant can be steered efficiently toward optimality, while meeting the varying electric power demand.",Real-time optimization of an experimental solid-oxide fuel-cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.03.025
5,9188,"In these experiments, the plant efficiency was increased from 55% to 62% through application of RTO.",Real-time optimization of an experimental solid-oxide fuel-cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.03.025
6,9188,"Furthermore, although the SOFC system is characterized by slow thermal dynamics that may take a few hours to settle to steady state, it has been possible to reduce the time necessary to reach the power setpoint from 1 h to about 5 min thanks to the use of transient measurements and a dynamic model.",Real-time optimization of an experimental solid-oxide fuel-cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.03.025
7,9188,"This experimental work has shown that it is possible, not only to control the SOFC system at a desired operating point, but also to operate it near optimality despite changes in power demand.",Real-time optimization of an experimental solid-oxide fuel-cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.03.025
