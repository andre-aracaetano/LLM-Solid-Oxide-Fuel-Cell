1,11597,"In the fabrication process of Ni/Y2O3-ZrO2 (YSZ) cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells, it has been found that sintering and reducing processes of the cermet anodes at high temperatures (1000 to 1400degreesC) cause significant grain growth and agglomeration of YSZ and in particular Ni particles.",Fabrication of high-performance NiOY2O3-ZrO2 cermet anodes of solid oxide fuel cells by ion impregnation,10.1149/1.1497982
2,11597,This paper reports on the enhancement of the microstructure and performance of Ni/YSZ cermet electrodes by an ion impregnation process.,Fabrication of high-performance NiOY2O3-ZrO2 cermet anodes of solid oxide fuel cells by ion impregnation,10.1149/1.1497982
3,11597,"By impregnation of very fine oxide particles into Ni/YSZ cermet structure, sintering, grain growth, and agglomeration of the nickel phase in the cermet during the high- temperature sintering and reducing stages were significantly inhibited, leading to the enhancement of the Ni and YSZ phase distribution and thus significant improvement in the electrochemical activity and stability of the Ni/YSZ anodes for the H-2 oxidation reaction.",Fabrication of high-performance NiOY2O3-ZrO2 cermet anodes of solid oxide fuel cells by ion impregnation,10.1149/1.1497982
