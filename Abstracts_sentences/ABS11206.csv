1,11206,Lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) powders of composition La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 are good candidates for cathode application in solid oxide fuel cells.,Effect of propellant on the combustion synthesized Sr-doped LaMnO3 powders,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.08.016
2,11206,"This paper reports the synthesis of LSM powders from nitrate precursors by the combustion method, using two different propellants (urea and glycine) and varying the propellant/nitrate ratio.",Effect of propellant on the combustion synthesized Sr-doped LaMnO3 powders,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.08.016
3,11206,"Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed two or three decomposition stages of the as-synthesized samples, with complete burn out of organics at about 850-900 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed formation of only LSM phase for the sample synthesized with excess of urea, whereas SrCO3 and MnCO3 phases were also found for the samples prepared from glycine.",Effect of propellant on the combustion synthesized Sr-doped LaMnO3 powders,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.08.016
