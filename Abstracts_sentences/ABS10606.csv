1,10606,"This paper reports the alternating current (AC) conductivity and dielectric behavior of Ce0.90Gd0.06Y0.02M0.02O2-delta (M = Ca, Fe, La, & Sr) systems for their application as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Electrical conductivity of gadolinium and yttria co-doped ceria with Ca, Fe, La, & Sr addition: as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10854-022-08563-5
2,10606,The mixed oxide method was used for the preparation of these compositions.,"Electrical conductivity of gadolinium and yttria co-doped ceria with Ca, Fe, La, & Sr addition: as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10854-022-08563-5
3,10606,The samples of all the prepared compositions were sintered by both conventional and microwave heating at 1400 degrees C.,"Electrical conductivity of gadolinium and yttria co-doped ceria with Ca, Fe, La, & Sr addition: as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10854-022-08563-5
4,10606,The AC conductivity and dielectric behavior of the prepared samples were studied in the temperature range from room temperature to 500 K. The AC conductivity was found to be higher for the microwave-sintered samples than the conventionally sintered samples.,"Electrical conductivity of gadolinium and yttria co-doped ceria with Ca, Fe, La, & Sr addition: as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10854-022-08563-5
5,10606,The microwave processed samples have shown lower activation energy too.,"Electrical conductivity of gadolinium and yttria co-doped ceria with Ca, Fe, La, & Sr addition: as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10854-022-08563-5
6,10606,"Further, the microwave sintered composition of lanthanum doped ceria has shown the maximum AC conductivity, dielectric constant, and minimum activation energy among all the prepared samples, making it an excellent candidate for SOFC electrolyte.","Electrical conductivity of gadolinium and yttria co-doped ceria with Ca, Fe, La, & Sr addition: as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10854-022-08563-5
