2,18108,XRD patterns indicate the perovskite structure is formed without any second phases after sintering the powders at 1 400 degreesC for 6 h. The pellet sample was sintered to 98.,Electrochemical properties of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8 electrolyte and its application to SOFCs,
3,18108,"3% of theoretical density at 1 450 degreesC for 18 h. The total electrical conductivity was greatly depended on the sintering time, and reached the maximum when the pellet was sintered at 1 450 degreesC for 24 h. Planar SOFC was constructed using Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 and La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.6Ni0.4O2.7 as the anode and cathode, respectively.",Electrochemical properties of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8 electrolyte and its application to SOFCs,
4,18108,"When humidified hydrogen and air were introduced to the two electrodes, maximum power density of 252 mW/cm(2)(U=0. 48 V, J=525 mA,/cm(2)) was achieved with the open circuit voltage of 1. 04 V at 750 degreesC.",Electrochemical properties of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8 electrolyte and its application to SOFCs,
