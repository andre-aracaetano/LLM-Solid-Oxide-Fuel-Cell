2,16481,"The oxidized material is suggested to present mixed ionic-electronic conductivity (MIEC) from in-situ neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiments, complemented with transport measurements; the presence of a sufficiently high oxygen deficiency, with large displacement factors for oxygen atoms suggest a large lability and mobility combined with a semiconductor-like behaviour with a maximum conductivity of 29 S cm(-1) at T = 850 degrees C. A complete reversibility towards reduction-oxidation processes has been observed, where the reduced Pm-3m perovskite with La0.5Sr0.5Co0.5Ti0.5O2.64 composition has been obtained by topotactical oxygen removal without abrupt changes in the thermal expansion.",Characterization of La0.5Sr0.5Co0.5Ti0.5O3-δ as symmetrical electrode material for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.033
