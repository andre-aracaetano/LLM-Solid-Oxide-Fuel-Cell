1,3633,"Lowering the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is highly desirable to reduce the cost and increase the lifetime, which relies upon the development of a cathode component with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity at a lower temperature.",Highly Oxygen Non-Stoichiometric BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- as a High-Performance Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/celc.201701309
2,3633,"Herein, we report the characterization of high-performance BaScxCo1-xO3- (x=0, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.375) perovskite SOFC cathodes.",Highly Oxygen Non-Stoichiometric BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- as a High-Performance Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/celc.201701309
3,3633,"Unlike BaCoO3-, which adopts 2H-hexagonal perovskite structure, the replacement of 25mol% of Co with Sc stabilizes the cubic structure, which also leads to the significant reduction in area specific resistances and their activation energies between 650 and 500 degrees C (for BaSc0.25Co0.75O3-) relative to the non-doped BaCoO3-.",Highly Oxygen Non-Stoichiometric BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- as a High-Performance Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/celc.201701309
4,3633,"In this temperature range, BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- displayed a remarkably high ORR activity compared to Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3- (BSCF), the current cathode benchmark.",Highly Oxygen Non-Stoichiometric BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- as a High-Performance Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/celc.201701309
5,3633,"We attribute such superior ORR performance to the higher oxygen non-stoichiometries of BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- relative to BSCF, which also translates to the higher oxygen bulk diffusion and surface exchange coefficients for the former compared to the latter.",Highly Oxygen Non-Stoichiometric BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- as a High-Performance Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/celc.201701309
6,3633,"As a result, a single fuel cell based on an anode-supported 20m thick samarium-doped ceria electrolyte and BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- cathode achieved a very high peak power density of 1723mWcm(-2) at 650 degrees C. We also demonstrated the possibility to increase the ORR activity of the BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- cathode by impregnation of a low amount of silver.",Highly Oxygen Non-Stoichiometric BaSc0.25Co0.75O3- as a High-Performance Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/celc.201701309
