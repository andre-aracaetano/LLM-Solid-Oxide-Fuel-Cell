1,17976,Gadolinia doped ceria in its doped or strained form is considered to be an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell applications.,Special quasirandom structures for gadolinia-doped ceria and related materials,10.1039/c2cp41202k
2,17976,The simulation of the defect processes in these materials is complicated by the random distribution of the constituent atoms.,Special quasirandom structures for gadolinia-doped ceria and related materials,10.1039/c2cp41202k
3,17976,We propose the use of the special quasirandom structure (SQS) approach as a computationally efficient way to describe the random nature of the local cation environment and the distribution of the oxygen vacancies.,Special quasirandom structures for gadolinia-doped ceria and related materials,10.1039/c2cp41202k
4,17976,We have generated two 96-atom SQS cells describing 9% and 12% gadolinia doped ceria.,Special quasirandom structures for gadolinia-doped ceria and related materials,10.1039/c2cp41202k
5,17976,These SQS cells are transferable and can be used to model related materials such as yttria stabilized zirconia.,Special quasirandom structures for gadolinia-doped ceria and related materials,10.1039/c2cp41202k
6,17976,To demonstrate the applicability of the method we use density functional theory to investigate the influence of the local environment around a Y dopant in Y-codoped gadolinia doped ceria.,Special quasirandom structures for gadolinia-doped ceria and related materials,10.1039/c2cp41202k
7,17976,It is energetically favourable if Y is not close to Gd or an oxygen vacancy.,Special quasirandom structures for gadolinia-doped ceria and related materials,10.1039/c2cp41202k
8,17976,"Moreover, Y-O bonds are found to be weaker than Gd-O bonds so that the conductivity of O ions is improved.",Special quasirandom structures for gadolinia-doped ceria and related materials,10.1039/c2cp41202k
