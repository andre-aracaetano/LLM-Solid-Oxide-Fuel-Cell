2,7666,"However, thinner electrolyte often contains prominent defects and flaws, which may decrease the yield and increase operation risk.",Robust and reliable solid oxide fuel cells with modified thin film YSZ electrolyte,10.1111/ijac.14346
3,7666,"This work proposes a method to modify the thin film YSZ electrolyte, to improve cell reliability and durability.",Robust and reliable solid oxide fuel cells with modified thin film YSZ electrolyte,10.1111/ijac.14346
4,7666,"The as-sintered anode supported half-cell with screen printed YSZ electrolyte was immersed in precursor solution of Y(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O and Zr(NO3)(4)center dot 5H(2)O, and being treated under hydrothermal condition of 150 degrees C for 12 h. As a result, the modified cells show slight increase in the OCV values.",Robust and reliable solid oxide fuel cells with modified thin film YSZ electrolyte,10.1111/ijac.14346
5,7666,"Furthermore, the hydrothermal modification effectively promotes interface sintering between YSZ electrolyte and GDC barrier layer, yielding a smaller ohmic resistance of .142 omega center dot cm(2) (a decrease of similar to 11%) and a higher peak power density of .964 W/cm(2) (an increase of similar to 18%) at 750 degrees C, than pristine cell.",Robust and reliable solid oxide fuel cells with modified thin film YSZ electrolyte,10.1111/ijac.14346
6,7666,"Moreover, the modified cell operates stably over 300 h, while the pristine cell presents large and irregular voltage fluctuations.",Robust and reliable solid oxide fuel cells with modified thin film YSZ electrolyte,10.1111/ijac.14346
7,7666,This work suggests that the hydrothermal modification is an effective and promisingly industrial applicable method for thin film electrolyte recovery in SOFCs.,Robust and reliable solid oxide fuel cells with modified thin film YSZ electrolyte,10.1111/ijac.14346
