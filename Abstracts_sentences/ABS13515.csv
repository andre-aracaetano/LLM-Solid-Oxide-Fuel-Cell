1,13515,A solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) can reversibly generate hydrogen by electrolyzing superheated steam or produce electricity from a fuel cell by using hydrogen.,CFD analysis for optimizing superheater components for high temperature steam production for use in an SOEC,10.1080/15567036.2020.1809566
2,13515,Converting water into steam by using the waste heat from other processes can improve the efficiency of high-temperature electrolysis for directly converting steam.,CFD analysis for optimizing superheater components for high temperature steam production for use in an SOEC,10.1080/15567036.2020.1809566
3,13515,"In the present study, steam at over 180 degrees C and 3.4 bars generated from a boiler is converted into superheated steam at over 700 degrees C and 3 bars by using a cylindrical steam superheater and the waste heat of flue gas at 900 degrees C from a solid refuse fuel combustor.",CFD analysis for optimizing superheater components for high temperature steam production for use in an SOEC,10.1080/15567036.2020.1809566
4,13515,"However, during the production of steam at 700 degrees C and its transportation to the SOEC, a conventional superheater cannot produce a temperature of 700 degrees C owing to poor heat transfer and energy loss.",CFD analysis for optimizing superheater components for high temperature steam production for use in an SOEC,10.1080/15567036.2020.1809566
5,13515,"To determine the optimal conditions for generating steam at 700 degrees C or above, we evaluate the effect of varying different superheater components, such as the shape of the top part of the superheater, number of steam inlet pipes, length, and coil rotation diameter of coil injection pipes, and steam inlet and outlet pipe diameters, through computational fluid dynamics analyses.",CFD analysis for optimizing superheater components for high temperature steam production for use in an SOEC,10.1080/15567036.2020.1809566
6,13515,"Under the optimal conditions, the superheater with two steam injection pipes is the most effective, producing a maximum outlet steam temperature of similar to 753 degrees C.",CFD analysis for optimizing superheater components for high temperature steam production for use in an SOEC,10.1080/15567036.2020.1809566
