2,8111,We systematically investigate the influences of the steam/carbon ratio (S/C) and the cell temperature on the internal steam reforming reaction and the electrochemical reaction on the anode by evaluating short-term power generation.,Reactions on Ni-YSZ cermet anode of solid oxide fuel cells during internal steam reforming of n-octane,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.10.135
3,8111,"The n-octane is fully reformed to H-2, CO, C, CO2, CH4, and/or C2H6 by internal steam reforming, and is considered a suitable fuel for obtaining high yields of H-2 and CO, which are important for achieving high power generation efficiency.",Reactions on Ni-YSZ cermet anode of solid oxide fuel cells during internal steam reforming of n-octane,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.10.135
4,8111,"However, very little deposited carbon is consumed, and the carbon deposition is not suppressed even under the maximum power generation conditions at 950 degrees C and an S/C ratio of 1.0.",Reactions on Ni-YSZ cermet anode of solid oxide fuel cells during internal steam reforming of n-octane,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.10.135
