7,4134,"The overall performance is slightly lower than state-of-the-art materials and comparable with similar perovskites, and in general is fair considering the needed cell optimization (i.e an anode supported configuration is necessary).","Reversible, all-perovskite SOFCs based on La, Sr gallates",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.142
8,4134,"The cell (impregnated and not) activates at 0.7 V. Obtained data suggest thus LSGF/LSGM/LSGF cell, is promising as reversible SOC for intermediate temperature.","Reversible, all-perovskite SOFCs based on La, Sr gallates",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.142
