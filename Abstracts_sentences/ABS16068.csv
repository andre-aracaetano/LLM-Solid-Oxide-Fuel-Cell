2,16068,Here we show that in this material the diffusion activation energy of oxygen ions is 0.35 eV.,Enhanced oxygen diffusion in nano-structured ceria,10.1007/s10854-017-8430-0
3,16068,"The diffusion mechanism corresponds to the single-file diffusion mechanism, associated with the presence of one-dimensional channels in the anion sublattice of CeO2.",Enhanced oxygen diffusion in nano-structured ceria,10.1007/s10854-017-8430-0
4,16068,"The small grain size of the material approximate to 10 nm, as well as its stoichiometric state (Ce2O3), minimize the contribution of the electronic and polaron components of the electrical conductivity of this material, which also contribute to the optimization of SOFC operation.",Enhanced oxygen diffusion in nano-structured ceria,10.1007/s10854-017-8430-0
