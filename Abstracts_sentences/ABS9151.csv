1,9151,"Since solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) produce electricity with high energy conversion efficiency, and chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a process for fuel conversion with inherent CO2 separation, a novel combined cycle integrating coal gasification, solid oxide fuel cell, and chemical looping combustion was configured and analyzed.",Coal gasification integration with solid oxide fuel cell and chemical looping combustion for high-efficiency power generation with inherent CO2 capture,10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.100
2,9151,A thermodynamic analysis based on energy and exergy was performed to investigate the performance of the integrated system and its sensitivity to major operating parameters.,Coal gasification integration with solid oxide fuel cell and chemical looping combustion for high-efficiency power generation with inherent CO2 capture,10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.100
3,9151,"The major findings include that (1) the plant net power efficiency reaches 49.8% with similar to 100% CO2 capture for SOFC at 900 degrees C, 15 bar, fuel utilization factor = 0.85, fuel reactor temperature = 900 degrees C and air reactor temperature = 950 degrees C, using NiO as the oxygen carrier in the CLC unit.",Coal gasification integration with solid oxide fuel cell and chemical looping combustion for high-efficiency power generation with inherent CO2 capture,10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.100

5,9151,"In this parameter neighborhood the fuel utilization factor, the SOFC temperature and SOFC pressure have small effects on the plant net power efficiency because changes in pressure and temperature that increase the power generation by the SOFC tend to decrease the power generation by the gas turbine and steam cycle, and v.v.; an advantage of this system characteristic is that it maintains a nearly constant power output even when the temperature and pressure vary.",Coal gasification integration with solid oxide fuel cell and chemical looping combustion for high-efficiency power generation with inherent CO2 capture,10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.100
