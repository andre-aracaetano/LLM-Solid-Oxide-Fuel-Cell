1,5590,"A combustion synthesis method, the glycine-nitrate process, was used to prepare all nano-size materials used in a single intermedium-temperature solid-oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC).",Single intermedium-temperature SOFC prepared by glycine-nitrate process,10.1016/S0925-8388(02)01198-2
2,5590,"Samaria-doped ceria (CeO2)(0.9)(SmO1.5)(0.1) (SDC) was used as electrolyte, La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 (LSCF) with 50 wt% SDC was selected as the cathode, and a SDC-Ni composite powder was used as the anode.",Single intermedium-temperature SOFC prepared by glycine-nitrate process,10.1016/S0925-8388(02)01198-2
3,5590,"In this study, the performance of the SOFC was obtained from 250 to 750 degreesC. The highest open circuit voltage was about 0.95 V at 450 degreesC and the maximum power density of 0.104 W cm(-2) and a short circuit current density of 500 mA cm(-2) of the cell were achieved at 750 degreesC.",Single intermedium-temperature SOFC prepared by glycine-nitrate process,10.1016/S0925-8388(02)01198-2
4,5590,"The initial cell performance showed that, with a proper choice of synthesis process and technology, a SOFC using CeO2-based materials as electrolyte operating at IT-temperature is a realistic goal.",Single intermedium-temperature SOFC prepared by glycine-nitrate process,10.1016/S0925-8388(02)01198-2
