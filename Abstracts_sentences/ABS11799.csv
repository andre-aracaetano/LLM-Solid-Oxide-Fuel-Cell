1,11799,Two Cu-based anode cermets suitable for direct hydrocarbon oxidation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) based on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte were tested in the temperature range (500-800A degrees C).,Preparation and characterization of copper based cermet anodes for use in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1007/s10832-009-9569-8
2,11799,The ceramic components were CeO2 and the perovskite La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-d (LSCM).,Preparation and characterization of copper based cermet anodes for use in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1007/s10832-009-9569-8
3,11799,The cermets were made in both the form of pellets and films applied onto the YSZ electrolytes.,Preparation and characterization of copper based cermet anodes for use in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1007/s10832-009-9569-8
4,11799,Pellets exhibited good mechanical strength and resistance to fracture in both oxidized and reduced state.,Preparation and characterization of copper based cermet anodes for use in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1007/s10832-009-9569-8
5,11799,Cu-LSCM cermets exhibited good redox cycling behavior between 700-800A degrees C. Reduction temperature plays a significant role on final morphology with Cu segregation occurring at 800A degrees C. Cu-LSCM films were found to exhibit lower polarization resistances than Cu-CeO2 under 5% H-2.,Preparation and characterization of copper based cermet anodes for use in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1007/s10832-009-9569-8
6,11799,Examination of the data revealed a poorer contact of the Cu-CeO2 electrode with the YSZ surface than the Cu-LSCM electrode.,Preparation and characterization of copper based cermet anodes for use in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1007/s10832-009-9569-8
7,11799,Reduction temperature should be less than 750A degrees C to ensure suitable microstructure and adhesion of both film electrodes with the electrolyte.,Preparation and characterization of copper based cermet anodes for use in solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1007/s10832-009-9569-8
