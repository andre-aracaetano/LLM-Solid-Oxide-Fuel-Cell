1,5088,We proposed a novel way to improve the cell performance of proton-conducting solid-oxide fuel cells by increasing the chemical interaction between the anode components using BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY4) as the ionic conducting phase of anode for a fuel cell with a BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BCY) electrolyte.,A novel way to improve performance of proton-conducting solid-oxide fuel cells through enhanced chemical interaction of anode components,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.081
2,5088,The strength of the chemical interaction between NiO and the ionic conducting phase (BZCY4 or BCY) was analyzed by the hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) technique.,A novel way to improve performance of proton-conducting solid-oxide fuel cells through enhanced chemical interaction of anode components,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.081
3,5088,The effect of chemical interaction between NiO and the ionic conducting phase on the NiO diffusivity was investigated by SEM-EDX.,A novel way to improve performance of proton-conducting solid-oxide fuel cells through enhanced chemical interaction of anode components,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.081
4,5088,"The results demonstrated NiO had a much stronger interaction with BZCY4 than with BCY, thereby resulting in suppressed diffusivity of NiO into the BCY electrolyte.",A novel way to improve performance of proton-conducting solid-oxide fuel cells through enhanced chemical interaction of anode components,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.081

6,5088,"In contrast, a cell with BCY as the ionic conducting phase of the anode had an ohmic resistance of 0.82 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Therefore, the single cell with NiO + BZCY4 anode showed a peak power density higher than that of the cell with the NiO + BCY anode.",A novel way to improve performance of proton-conducting solid-oxide fuel cells through enhanced chemical interaction of anode components,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.081
