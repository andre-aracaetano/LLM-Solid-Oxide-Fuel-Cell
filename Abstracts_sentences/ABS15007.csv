2,15007,"For both anode-supported cells or electrolyte-supported cells, the anode needs pretreatment to reduce NiO/YSZ to Ni/YSZ to increase its conductivity as well as its catalytic characteristics.",Effects of Pretreatment Methods on Electrodes and SOFC Performance,10.3390/en7063922
3,15007,"In this study, the effects of different pretreatments (open-circuit, closed-circuit) on cathode and anodes as well as SOFC performance are investigated.",Effects of Pretreatment Methods on Electrodes and SOFC Performance,10.3390/en7063922
4,15007,"To investigate the influence of closed-circuit pretreatment on the NiO/YSZ anode alone, a Pt cathode is utilized as reference for comparison with the LSM cathode.",Effects of Pretreatment Methods on Electrodes and SOFC Performance,10.3390/en7063922

6,15007,It's found that the influence of open-circuit pretreatment on the LSM cathode is limited.,Effects of Pretreatment Methods on Electrodes and SOFC Performance,10.3390/en7063922
7,15007,"However, the influence of closed-circuit pretreatment on both the LSM cathode and NiO/YSZ anode and the resulting SOFC performance is profound.",Effects of Pretreatment Methods on Electrodes and SOFC Performance,10.3390/en7063922
8,15007,The effect of closed-circuit pretreatment on the NiO/YSZ anode is attributed to its change of electronic/pore structure as well as catalytic characteristics.,Effects of Pretreatment Methods on Electrodes and SOFC Performance,10.3390/en7063922
9,15007,"With closed-circuit pretreatment, the SOFC performance improved greatly from the change of LSM cathode (and Pt reference) compared to the Ni/YSZ anode.",Effects of Pretreatment Methods on Electrodes and SOFC Performance,10.3390/en7063922
