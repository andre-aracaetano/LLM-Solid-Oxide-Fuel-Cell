1,4174,Syngas cogeneration in direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells with Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anodes was studied with temperature varying from 700 to 900 degrees C. A phenomenon of electrochemical promotion of bulk lattice-oxygen extraction from the YSZ electrolyte was observed.,Temperature effect on electrochemical promotion of syngas cogeneration in direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.09.061
