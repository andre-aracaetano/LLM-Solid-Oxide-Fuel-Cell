1,8048,"The sintering of La0.85Sr0.15CrO3 (LSC) Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) connector material has been enhanced by addition of elements such as copper, vanadium, magnesium and cobalt.","Synthesis, sintering and properties of doped LaSrCrO3",
2,8048,"Sintered densities of over 95 %TD have been achieved with these additives at temperatures ranging from 1525 to 1600degreesC, compared to <92 %TD for undoped LSC.","Synthesis, sintering and properties of doped LaSrCrO3",
3,8048,"In addition to promoting sintering, these additives also help to modify the physical and electrical properties of the interconnect material.","Synthesis, sintering and properties of doped LaSrCrO3",
4,8048,"The addition of Cu to LSC is found to increase both electrical conductivity and thermal expansion, whereas V, Mg and Co reduce both.","Synthesis, sintering and properties of doped LaSrCrO3",
5,8048,"Copper addition shift the rhombohedral-orthorhombic phase transformation below the room temperature, but vanadium, magnesium and cobalt only reduced it from similar to280degreesC to the range 60degrees to 125degreesC.","Synthesis, sintering and properties of doped LaSrCrO3",
