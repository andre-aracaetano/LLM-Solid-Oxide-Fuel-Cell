1,3308,Degradation of the Ni/yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) anode of the solid oxide fuel cell has been evaluated in the coal syngas containing different PH3 concentrations in the temperature range from 750 to 900 degrees C. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations show that PH3 in the coal syngas gas is converted Mostly to P2O3 at 750-900 degrees C.,Temperature and Impurity Concentration Effects on Degradation of Nickel/Yttria-stabilised Zirconia Anode in PH3-Containing Coal Syngas,10.1002/fuce.200900016
