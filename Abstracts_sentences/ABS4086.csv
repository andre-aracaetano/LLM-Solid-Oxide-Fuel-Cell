2,4086,"In this study, ultralow-loading Ru catalysts (<10 mu g cm(-2)) are fabricated using plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) on a samaria-doped ceria (SDC) backbone for a methane oxidation electrode.",Ultralow-Loading Ruthenium Catalysts by Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acscatal.0c04526
3,4086,The Ru catalyst with a high surface area and a high triple-phase boundary density shows electrochemical performance superior to that of its sputtered counterpart despite a 95% reduction in noble-metal loading.,Ultralow-Loading Ruthenium Catalysts by Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acscatal.0c04526
4,4086,"Furthermore, the PEALD Ru catalyst demonstrates more stable operation at elevated temperatures with less morphological degradation in comparison to the sputtered catalyst and mitigates carbon coking.",Ultralow-Loading Ruthenium Catalysts by Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acscatal.0c04526
5,4086,"Such improvements are ascribed to the nature of PEALD, which can make Ru particles conformally on porous SDC with highly dense and intimate interfaces.",Ultralow-Loading Ruthenium Catalysts by Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acscatal.0c04526
