5,14805,"The Y0.7Ca0.3Cr0.9Zn0.1O3-delta (YCCZ10) powder exhibited the best sintering ability, and a relative density of 96.6% Could be obtained for the sample sintered at 1400 C for 4h in air.","Stable, easily sintered Ca-Zn-doped YCrO3 as novel interconnect materials for co-fired yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.005
6,14805,"The electrical conductivities of the specimens increase with the Zn2+ content at x 0.10, but then remarkably decrease at x = 0.15, which might relate to the over-range of the substitution amount of Zn (0.15) for Cr position.","Stable, easily sintered Ca-Zn-doped YCrO3 as novel interconnect materials for co-fired yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.005
7,14805,"YCCZ10 shows a remarkable electrical conductivity of 20.9 S cm (1) I at 850 C in air, and a very suitable thermal expansion coefficient value of 10.8 x 10 (6) K (1) (YSZ: similar to 10.8 x 10 (6) K (1)).","Stable, easily sintered Ca-Zn-doped YCrO3 as novel interconnect materials for co-fired yttrium-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.005
