1,18328,"To understand the effect of the B site species in La-based perovskites, the electrical conductivity of La0.9Sr0.1MO3 & delta; (M = Al, Ga, In, Er, and Y) was studied under varying oxygen partial pressures ranging from 600 and 800 degrees C under humidified and dry conditions.","Correlation between conductivity and structural parameters in Sr-doped LaMO3 (M = Al, Ga, In, Er, and Y) for solid oxide membranes",10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116315
2,18328,The oxygen-ion conductors La0.9Sr0.1AlO3-& delta; and La0.9Sr0.1GaO3-& delta; exhibited no significant change in conductivity under humidified and dry conditions.,"Correlation between conductivity and structural parameters in Sr-doped LaMO3 (M = Al, Ga, In, Er, and Y) for solid oxide membranes",10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116315
3,18328,"In contrast, the mixed-ion conductor La0.9Sr0.1InO3-& delta; (LSI) and proton conductors La0.9Sr0.1ErO3-& delta; (LSEr) and La0.9Sr0.1YO3-& delta; (LSY) exhibit relatively significant changes under humidified and dry conditions.","Correlation between conductivity and structural parameters in Sr-doped LaMO3 (M = Al, Ga, In, Er, and Y) for solid oxide membranes",10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116315
4,18328,"In addition, the conductivities of LSEr and LSY could be affected by the concentration of CO used to reduce the conductivity.","Correlation between conductivity and structural parameters in Sr-doped LaMO3 (M = Al, Ga, In, Er, and Y) for solid oxide membranes",10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116315
5,18328,"Finally, this study demonstrated that as the unit cell volume divided by Z increased, the ionic conductivity changed from an oxygen ion conductor to a mixed conductor, and finally to a proton conductor.","Correlation between conductivity and structural parameters in Sr-doped LaMO3 (M = Al, Ga, In, Er, and Y) for solid oxide membranes",10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116315
