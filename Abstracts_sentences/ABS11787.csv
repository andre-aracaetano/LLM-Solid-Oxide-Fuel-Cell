1,11787,"The reactivity of typical electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells, namely La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF), La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO), with fast oxide-ion conductor La2Mo2O9 is thoroughly studied using X-ray diffractometry.","Physicochemical compatibility of CGO fluorite, LSM and LSCF perovskite electrode materials with La2MO2O9 fast oxide-ion conductor",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2005.05.007
2,11787,Modifications in the materials diffraction patterns and occurrence of impurity diffraction peaks are evidenced in LSCF and LSM above 700-800 degrees C.,"Physicochemical compatibility of CGO fluorite, LSM and LSCF perovskite electrode materials with La2MO2O9 fast oxide-ion conductor",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2005.05.007
3,11787,"They are interpreted in terms of cationic migrations from one material phase to the other (typically strontium depletion/substitution), and subsequent formation of subsidiary phases (for instance strontium molybdate).","Physicochemical compatibility of CGO fluorite, LSM and LSCF perovskite electrode materials with La2MO2O9 fast oxide-ion conductor",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2005.05.007
4,11787,With CGO no reactivity is observed up to 1000 degrees C. For all three electrode materials the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) is measured from X-ray thermodiffractograms and compared to that of La2Mo2O9.,"Physicochemical compatibility of CGO fluorite, LSM and LSCF perovskite electrode materials with La2MO2O9 fast oxide-ion conductor",10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2005.05.007
