3,20139,The XRD results showed that the crystallographic structure of the samples had displayed a fluorite type face-centered cubic delta-Bi2O3 phase.,"Structural, thermal, electrical and morphological characterization of (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Sm2O3)x(Yb2O3)y nanostructures prepared by solid state synthesis",10.1016/j.cap.2016.09.013
4,20139,The phase stability was also checked by the DTA measurements.,"Structural, thermal, electrical and morphological characterization of (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Sm2O3)x(Yb2O3)y nanostructures prepared by solid state synthesis",10.1016/j.cap.2016.09.013
5,20139,The temperature dependent electrical conductivity results revealed that the maximum electrical conductivity observed for the sample of the nanostructure( Bi2O3)(0.8)(Sm2O3)(0.1)(Yb2O3)(0.1) system was 5.39 x 10(-2) (ohm.cm)(-1) at 650 degrees C.,"Structural, thermal, electrical and morphological characterization of (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Sm2O3)x(Yb2O3)y nanostructures prepared by solid state synthesis",10.1016/j.cap.2016.09.013
6,20139,The results also show that the lowest activation energy was 0.7062 eV and the lowest crystallite size was 31.62 nm for the nanostructure-(Bi2O3)(0.75)(Sm2O3)(0.1)(Yb2O3)(0.15) system.,"Structural, thermal, electrical and morphological characterization of (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Sm2O3)x(Yb2O3)y nanostructures prepared by solid state synthesis",10.1016/j.cap.2016.09.013
7,20139,"Consequently, the face-centered cubic stable delta-phase(Bi2O3)(0.8)(Sm2O3)(0.1)(Yb2O3)(0.1) is the optimal dopant amount due to the relatively good stability and oxygen ionic conductivity obtained, which are two of our major concerns for the electrolyte layer of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Structural, thermal, electrical and morphological characterization of (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Sm2O3)x(Yb2O3)y nanostructures prepared by solid state synthesis",10.1016/j.cap.2016.09.013
