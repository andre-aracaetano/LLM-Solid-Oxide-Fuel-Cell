1,14946,"For the purpose of suspension plasma spraying solid oxide fuel cell anode coatings, individual and multi-component aqueous suspensions of NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 have been assessed for stability either alone or in conjunction with poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) or 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (PBTCA).","Development of a multi-component aqueous NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 suspension for use in suspension plasma spraying of SOFC anode layers",10.1016/j.powtec.2012.12.055
2,14946,Optimum concentrations of the dispersants have been determined using rheology measurements.,"Development of a multi-component aqueous NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 suspension for use in suspension plasma spraying of SOFC anode layers",10.1016/j.powtec.2012.12.055
3,14946,The suspensions have also been characterized by dissolution behavior and zeta potential.,"Development of a multi-component aqueous NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 suspension for use in suspension plasma spraying of SOFC anode layers",10.1016/j.powtec.2012.12.055
4,14946,"The isoelectric points of CuO, Co3O4, and NiO were measured to be 7.9, 7.4, and greater than 10, respectively.","Development of a multi-component aqueous NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 suspension for use in suspension plasma spraying of SOFC anode layers",10.1016/j.powtec.2012.12.055
5,14946,Both the Co3O4 and a fine NiO fraction were stable in their native state.,"Development of a multi-component aqueous NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 suspension for use in suspension plasma spraying of SOFC anode layers",10.1016/j.powtec.2012.12.055
6,14946,"Based on the results of this study, all of the metal oxides respond favorably to PBTCA as a dispersant while only the Co3O4 responds well to the addition of PEI.","Development of a multi-component aqueous NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 suspension for use in suspension plasma spraying of SOFC anode layers",10.1016/j.powtec.2012.12.055
7,14946,The effectiveness of PEI as a dispersant for CuO is unclear.,"Development of a multi-component aqueous NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 suspension for use in suspension plasma spraying of SOFC anode layers",10.1016/j.powtec.2012.12.055
8,14946,"A multi-component suspension of these oxides containing the equivalent of 60 wt.% Cu, 32 wt.% Co and 8 wt.% Ni using only PBTCA as a dispersant showed no obvious signs of settling over 2 days at a pH of 8.5.","Development of a multi-component aqueous NiO, CuO, and Co3O4 suspension for use in suspension plasma spraying of SOFC anode layers",10.1016/j.powtec.2012.12.055
