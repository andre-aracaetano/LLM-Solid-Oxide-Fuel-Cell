1,10693,"The electrochemical properties of the interfaces between an SM0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (samaria-doped ceria, SDC) electrolyte and porous composite cathodes consisting of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (SSC) and SDC have been investigated in anode-supported single cells at low temperatures (400-600 degreesC).",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 cathodes for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00131-5
2,10693,"The bilayer structures of the SDC electrolyte films (25 mum thick) and the NiO-SDC anode supports were formed by co-pressing and subsequent co-firing at 1350 degreesC for 5 h. The effect of composition, firing temperature, and microstructure of the composite cathodes on the electrochemical properties is systematically studied.",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 cathodes for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00131-5
3,10693,"Results indicate that the optimum firing temperature is about 950 degreesC, whereas the optimum content of SDC electrolyte in the composite cathodes is about 30 wt.%.",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 cathodes for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00131-5
4,10693,It is noted that the addition of the proper amount of SDC to SSC dramatically improved the catalytic properties of the interfaces; reducing the interfacial resistance by more than one order of magnitude compared with an SSC cathode without SDC.,Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 cathodes for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00131-5
