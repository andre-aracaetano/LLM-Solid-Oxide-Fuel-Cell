2,12872,A post-spray annealing treatment of the SSC deposit has been performed.,"Microstructure, oxygen stoichiometry and electrical conductivity of flame-sprayed Sm0.7Sr0.3CoO3-δ",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.016
3,12872,"The coating characterization includes: the electrical conductivity of the SSC deposit along the lamellar direction measured by a four-electrode D.C. approach, the microstructures of SSC powders and deposits characterized using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, the oxygen stoichiometry ill both the as-sprayed and annealed deposits and starting powder determined by redox titration.","Microstructure, oxygen stoichiometry and electrical conductivity of flame-sprayed Sm0.7Sr0.3CoO3-δ",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.016
4,12872,"The results show that a significant oxygen deficiency (12%) occurs in the sprayed powder particles during high temperature flame spraying, leading to reduction of the electrical conductivity of the as-sprayed SSC deposit.","Microstructure, oxygen stoichiometry and electrical conductivity of flame-sprayed Sm0.7Sr0.3CoO3-δ",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.016
