1,20406,"Catalytic properties of Pd-Ni catalysts were studied to clarify the mechanism of suppression of carbon deposition on a Pd-Ni catalyst supported on a composite of Ce(Sm)O-2 and La(Sr)CrO3, which is a promising anode material for direct oxidation of dry CH4 in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Mechanism of suppression of carbon deposition on the Pd-Ni/Ce(Sm)O2-La(Sr)CrO3 anode in dry CH4 fuel,10.1021/jp801496v
2,20406,The catalytic activity of Pd-Ni catalysts for the carbon formation in the decomposition of CH4 was found to be strongly dependent on the support materials.,Mechanism of suppression of carbon deposition on the Pd-Ni/Ce(Sm)O2-La(Sr)CrO3 anode in dry CH4 fuel,10.1021/jp801496v
3,20406,"Carbon deposition was remarkably suppressed on Pd-Ni/Ce(Sm)O-2 and Pd-Ni/La(Sr)CrO3 catalysts, whereas Pd-Ni/SiO2 and Pd-Ni/carbon catalysts were very active for the formation of carbon nanofibers.",Mechanism of suppression of carbon deposition on the Pd-Ni/Ce(Sm)O2-La(Sr)CrO3 anode in dry CH4 fuel,10.1021/jp801496v
4,20406,TEM analysis showed the morphology of the Pd-Ni particles and carbon deposit on the Pd-Ni/Ce(SM)O-2 catalyst was quite different from that on the Pd-Ni/C catalyst.,Mechanism of suppression of carbon deposition on the Pd-Ni/Ce(Sm)O2-La(Sr)CrO3 anode in dry CH4 fuel,10.1021/jp801496v
5,20406,XRD and TEM-EDS analysis indicate that Ce and Sm were doped into the Pd-Ni alloy from the Ce(SM)O-2 supports.,Mechanism of suppression of carbon deposition on the Pd-Ni/Ce(Sm)O2-La(Sr)CrO3 anode in dry CH4 fuel,10.1021/jp801496v
6,20406,High catalytic activity of the Pd-Ni/Ce(SM)O-2 catalyst for steam reforming indicates that the Pd-Ni catalysts modified with Ce still have high catalytic activity for the activation of CH4.,Mechanism of suppression of carbon deposition on the Pd-Ni/Ce(Sm)O2-La(Sr)CrO3 anode in dry CH4 fuel,10.1021/jp801496v
7,20406,A model for the mechanism of the suppression of the carbon deposition on the Pd-Ni catalyst is proposed focusing on the formation mechanism of the carbon deposit.,Mechanism of suppression of carbon deposition on the Pd-Ni/Ce(Sm)O2-La(Sr)CrO3 anode in dry CH4 fuel,10.1021/jp801496v
