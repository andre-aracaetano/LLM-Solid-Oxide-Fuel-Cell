2,7480,Ultra-thin films with high in-plane electrical conductivity have been deposited by RF sputtering from composite targets.,Ultra-thin nanocrystalline lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ) films synthesis by RF-sputtering and temperature-dependent conductivity studies,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.094
3,7480,"The films, with nominal thickness of 54 nm, are crystalline when annealed or deposited at temperatures above 450 degrees C. Effects of annealing temperature, annealing time, and substrate temperature on crystallization, microstructure, and room temperature lateral electrical conductivity have been systematically studied.",Ultra-thin nanocrystalline lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ) films synthesis by RF-sputtering and temperature-dependent conductivity studies,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.094
4,7480,"No interfacial reaction products between the LSCF and single crystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were observed from X-ray diffraction Studies upon annealing until 750 degrees C. In-plane electrical conductivity as high as 580S cm(-1) at 650 degrees C has been observed for LSCF thin films deposited on single crystalline YSZ substrates and sputtered nanocrystalline YSZ thin films: while activation energy for conductivity were determined to be 0.15eV and 0.10eV for the former and latter films, respectively, in 650-400 degrees C range.",Ultra-thin nanocrystalline lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ) films synthesis by RF-sputtering and temperature-dependent conductivity studies,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.094
5,7480,The high in-plane electrical conductivity for the nanocrystalline LSCF ultra-thin films is likely attributed to their low level of porosity.,Ultra-thin nanocrystalline lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ) films synthesis by RF-sputtering and temperature-dependent conductivity studies,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.094
