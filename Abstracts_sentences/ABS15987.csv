1,15987,We have proposed a novel micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) design with an inert support and an integrated current collector for the inner electrode to improve current collection efficiency as well as reduction oxidation stability of the cell.,Fabrication and Evaluation of a Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with an Inert Support Using Scandia-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte,10.1149/2.1031514jes
2,15987,"In this work, a micro-tubular SOFC based on the proposed design was fabricated using scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) as electrolyte owing to its high ionic conductivity over a wide range of temperatures.",Fabrication and Evaluation of a Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with an Inert Support Using Scandia-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte,10.1149/2.1031514jes
3,15987,"Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), Ni, Ni-ScSZ, strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) ScSZ, and LSM were used as the inert support, anode current collector, anode, cathode, and cathode current collector, respectively.",Fabrication and Evaluation of a Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with an Inert Support Using Scandia-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte,10.1149/2.1031514jes
4,15987,"The electrochemical performance of the fabricated cell was evaluated at temperatures between 600 and 850 degrees C. Because of the lower ohmic resistance across its components, the cell exhibited good power generation performance at high and intermediate temperatures.",Fabrication and Evaluation of a Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with an Inert Support Using Scandia-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte,10.1149/2.1031514jes
5,15987,"Additionally, we confirmed stable operation of the micro-tubular SOFC for over 60 h at 750 degrees C. (C) The Author(s) 2015.",Fabrication and Evaluation of a Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with an Inert Support Using Scandia-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte,10.1149/2.1031514jes
