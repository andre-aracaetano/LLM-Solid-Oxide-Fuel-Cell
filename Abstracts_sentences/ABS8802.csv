1,8802,The evolution of Co coating in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) under low and medium temperatures (<700 & DEG;C) is different from that under high temperatures.,Experimental Investigation of the Initial Stage of the Oxidation Mechanism of Co Coating for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects at 650 °C,10.3390/coatings13071144
2,8802,"In this context, the oxidation corrosion of 441 ferritic stainless steel (FSS) with a Co coating in air under 650 & DEG;C was investigated.",Experimental Investigation of the Initial Stage of the Oxidation Mechanism of Co Coating for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects at 650 °C,10.3390/coatings13071144
3,8802,"The results indicated that the Co coating was oxidized rapidly and a Co3O4 spinel layer formed in the initial exposure of 5 min, which improved the oxidation resistance of 441 steel.",Experimental Investigation of the Initial Stage of the Oxidation Mechanism of Co Coating for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects at 650 °C,10.3390/coatings13071144
4,8802,"After oxidation at 650 & DEG;C for 120 h, a Cr2O3 layer with a thickness of 0.2-0.4 & mu;m was observed on the surface of bare 441 steel, while the surface oxide scale of Co-coated 441 steel samples was composed of an inner Cr2O3 and Fe2O3 solid solution (0.1-0.3 & mu;m thick), an intermediate (Fe, Co)(3)O-4 layer and an outer Co3O4 spinel layer, respectively.",Experimental Investigation of the Initial Stage of the Oxidation Mechanism of Co Coating for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects at 650 °C,10.3390/coatings13071144
