3,2825,"Experiments were performed at reduced oxygen partial pressures between 1.3 X 10(-3) and 6 X 10(-5) atm since in a real fuel cell under cathodic bias, the material near the electrode/electrolyte interface is expected to be in a reduced state.",Oxygen stoichiometries in La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ perovskites at reduced oxygen partial pressures,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00718-9
