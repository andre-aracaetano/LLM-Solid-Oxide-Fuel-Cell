1,7403,"To achieve high volumetric power density, some fuel cell stacks are designed to place fuel/air manifolds within (and penetrate through) the cell plane zone and adopt open outlet manifold.",Physics field distributions within fuel cell stacks with manifolds penetrating through the plane zone and open outlet features,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.034
2,7403,"In this paper, a 3D large scale multi physics model of a whole 18-cell stack with the above two structural features is first completed by carefully coupling momentum, mass, energy and quasi electrochemical equations.",Physics field distributions within fuel cell stacks with manifolds penetrating through the plane zone and open outlet features,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.034
3,7403,"Then, the generic distribution regularity of the main physics items, which depends on the above two structural features rather than any specific design and parameters, are reported.",Physics field distributions within fuel cell stacks with manifolds penetrating through the plane zone and open outlet features,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.034
4,7403,The result shows that the air flow rate fed to cell unit monotonously increases with increasing cell number as long as the open outlet of air flow path is adopted.,Physics field distributions within fuel cell stacks with manifolds penetrating through the plane zone and open outlet features,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.034
5,7403,Only 0.41 times the average air flow rate fed to each cell unit can pass through the 1st cell layer; and its value will greatly reduce when the stack scale increases.,Physics field distributions within fuel cell stacks with manifolds penetrating through the plane zone and open outlet features,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.034
6,7403,Placing manifolds within cell plane zone causes complex air/fuel flow distributions over the electrode surface; and adopting cross flow arrangement pattern can relieve the local temperature rising risk.,Physics field distributions within fuel cell stacks with manifolds penetrating through the plane zone and open outlet features,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.034
7,7403,The highest stack temperature appears around the crossing corner of both air and fuel flow exhaust headers in the 1st cell layer.,Physics field distributions within fuel cell stacks with manifolds penetrating through the plane zone and open outlet features,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.034
