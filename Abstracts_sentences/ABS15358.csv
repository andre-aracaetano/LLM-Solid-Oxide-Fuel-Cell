1,15358,"In this study, the synthesis of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.4Mn0.5Ru0.1O3-delta a (LSC0.4MRu0.1) compound is presented and its total conductivity is measured and compared with that of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) and the Ni-substituted compound La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.3Ni0.2O3-delta (LSCM0.3Ni0.2).",Ru exsolution in substituted La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ compound as anode material for an IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124724
2,15358,"While the substitution of Ni decreased LSCM conductivity under a reducing atmosphere, an increase of the total conductivity of Ru substituted phase is evidenced.",Ru exsolution in substituted La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ compound as anode material for an IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124724
3,15358,"The reduction of Ni and Ru-substituted LSCM under Ar/H-2 5% up to 800 degrees C or 1000 degrees C respectively leads to the exsolution of nanoparticles, but also to a slight decomposition for the Ru-substituted compound.",Ru exsolution in substituted La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ compound as anode material for an IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124724
4,15358,"However, the use of these reduced materials as anode for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) in symmetrical cells based on Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) electrolyte implies not reducing the total system at a temperature higher than 600 degrees C to avoid ceria reduction.",Ru exsolution in substituted La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ compound as anode material for an IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124724
