1,20849,"(La0.6Sr0.4)(1-x)Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O3 (LSCF/CGO) composite cathodes were investigated for SOFC application at intermediate temperature, i.e., 500-700 degreesC. The LSCF/CGO cathodes have been studied on three types of tape-casted electrolyte substrates including CGO electrolyte, Yttrium-stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte coated with a thin layer of CGO, and YSZ electrolyte.",High-performance lanthanum-ferrite-based cathode for SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.007

3,20849,R-p of 0.19 Omega cm(2) at 600 degreesC and 0.026 Omega cm(2) at 700 degreesC were obtained using LSCF/CGO cathode on CGO electrolyte.,High-performance lanthanum-ferrite-based cathode for SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.007
4,20849,"On the YSZ electrolyte with thin layer CGO coating, R-p of 0.6 Omega cm(2) at 600 degreesC and 0.12 Omega cm(2) at 700 degreesC were obtained.",High-performance lanthanum-ferrite-based cathode for SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.007

6,20849,These results are roughly six times better than our typical LSM cathodes.,High-performance lanthanum-ferrite-based cathode for SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.007
7,20849,Slightly higher R-s was observed in the samples with LSCF/CGO cathode on the YSZ electrolyte with CGO coating due to extra contribution from the thin CGO layer and the CGO/YSZ interface.,High-performance lanthanum-ferrite-based cathode for SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.007
8,20849,"For the samples with LSCF/CGO on YSZ, the Rs was the same as that of our best LSM samples, which indicates good adhesion between LSCF/CGO cathode and YSZ electrolyte.",High-performance lanthanum-ferrite-based cathode for SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.007
