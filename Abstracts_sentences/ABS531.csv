3,531,"Using electrochemical measurements, the resistance of each part of the complete cell has been minimized, and the optimization of the complete fuel cell has been achieved.","Electrochemical impedance measurements for evaluation of the different components of a complete solid oxide fuel cell associating La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ as cathode, BaIn0.3Ti0.7O2.85 as electrolyte and BaIn0.3Ti0.7O2.85-Ni cermet as anode",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.108
4,531,"A maximum power density of about 266 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C under wet H-2 on the anode side and air on the cathode one has been reached, with a total area specific resistance of about 0.87 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Using impedance measurements, the total resistance of the cell has been decomposed in several parts, attributed to the different components of the cell.","Electrochemical impedance measurements for evaluation of the different components of a complete solid oxide fuel cell associating La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ as cathode, BaIn0.3Ti0.7O2.85 as electrolyte and BaIn0.3Ti0.7O2.85-Ni cermet as anode",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.108
