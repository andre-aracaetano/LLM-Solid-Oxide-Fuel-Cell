1,20557,Oxidative coupling of methane is a process that converts methane directly to C-2 products (ethane and ethylene).,Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for solid oxide membrane reactors,10.1039/c5cy01622c
2,20557,One of the problems with the technology is that the selectivity and yield to the desired C-2 products is prohibitively low when conventional plug flow reactors are employed.,Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for solid oxide membrane reactors,10.1039/c5cy01622c
3,20557,"The main reasons for the low C-2 selectivity are the thermodynamic and kinetic preference for undesired products (CO and CO2), which are formed through direct methane combustion and sequential ethane and ethylene oxidation.",Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for solid oxide membrane reactors,10.1039/c5cy01622c
4,20557,These unselective processes are particularly problematic at high O-2 partial pressures (low CH4/O-2 ratios).,Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for solid oxide membrane reactors,10.1039/c5cy01622c
5,20557,"In order to achieve higher C-2 selectivity, plug flow membrane reactors, utilizing O2- conducting oxide membranes, can be utilized.",Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for solid oxide membrane reactors,10.1039/c5cy01622c
6,20557,"The optimal design of a membrane reactor for OCM would, in addition to the membrane, include a catalyst that is active and selective under the relevant operating conditions, and that can be seamlessly integrated with the membrane.",Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for solid oxide membrane reactors,10.1039/c5cy01622c
7,20557,In this contribution we have identified and tested several mixed oxide catalysts which could be integrated into a solid oxide membrane reactor.,Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for solid oxide membrane reactors,10.1039/c5cy01622c
8,20557,"The tested catalysts included lanthanum gallate doped with strontium and magnesium (La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta, LSGM), lanthanum manganite doped with strontium (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta, LSM) and lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta, LSCF).",Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for solid oxide membrane reactors,10.1039/c5cy01622c
9,20557,We show that LSGM and LSGM doped with lithium reached over 90% selectivity to the C2+ products at high CH4/O-2 operating ratios which are applicable to membrane reactor designs.,Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for solid oxide membrane reactors,10.1039/c5cy01622c
10,20557,We have characterized these materials and discussed the strategies for their integration into a membrane reactor system.,Oxidative coupling of methane over mixed oxide catalysts designed for solid oxide membrane reactors,10.1039/c5cy01622c
