1,2375,"This paper presents a model that describes the performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) under different designs such as cathode, electrolyte and anode supported designs.",Performance comparison of solid oxide fuel cells with different structural parameters of electrode,10.1179/174602209X427042
2,2375,"The effects of the pore size, porosity and tortuosity on the predictions are also discussed in details.",Performance comparison of solid oxide fuel cells with different structural parameters of electrode,10.1179/174602209X427042
3,2375,Sensitivity analyses have been performed to examine the effect of the parameters on the power density of SOFC.,Performance comparison of solid oxide fuel cells with different structural parameters of electrode,10.1179/174602209X427042
4,2375,Result shows that the higher power density can be achieved in the anode supported cell rather than other designs for its wider operation current density range.,Performance comparison of solid oxide fuel cells with different structural parameters of electrode,10.1179/174602209X427042
5,2375,"It also can be shown that both increases in the value of the structural parameter C (the ratio of porosity to tortuosity) and mean pore radius can increase the power density of SOFC, but the former has more significant effect on the output of cell than the latter.",Performance comparison of solid oxide fuel cells with different structural parameters of electrode,10.1179/174602209X427042
