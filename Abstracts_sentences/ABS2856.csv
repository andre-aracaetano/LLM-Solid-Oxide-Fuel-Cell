1,2856,"Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes consisting of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and Ce(Ln)O2-delta (Ln=Pr, Sm, Gd) were investigated with the ac impedance method.",SOFC Cathodes Composed of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and Pr-Doped CeO2,10.1149/1.3086726
2,2856,The interface resistance of cathodes with Pr-doped ceria was approximately one-third of those with Sm- and Gd-doped ceria.,SOFC Cathodes Composed of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and Pr-Doped CeO2,10.1149/1.3086726
3,2856,Cathodes with Pr-doped ceria had frequency peaks in the imaginary part impedance spectra that were 100 times lower than those for cathodes without Pr-doped ceria.,SOFC Cathodes Composed of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and Pr-Doped CeO2,10.1149/1.3086726
4,2856,This low-frequency peak for the Pr-doped ceria was caused by its large interface capacitance.,SOFC Cathodes Composed of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and Pr-Doped CeO2,10.1149/1.3086726
5,2856,This suggests that triple-phase boundary is present over the entire surface of the Pr-doped ceria particles.,SOFC Cathodes Composed of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and Pr-Doped CeO2,10.1149/1.3086726
