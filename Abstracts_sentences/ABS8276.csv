6,8276,It is shown that the absence of the barrier layer leads to a decrease in the SOFC performance by 22.5% as-sintered and continues to drop down during the exposure of 850 degrees C for 400 h. The impregnation of the cathode and anode by Pr(NO3)(3) and Ce(NO3)(3) improves electrochemical performance by 15% and this increase withstands a heat treatment at least for 215 h without any noticeable degradation.,The influence of formation features on SOFC electrochemical performance and long-term stability,10.1007/s10800-022-01667-0
