1,14709,"In the present study, high-quality apatite-type La9.33Ge6O26 powders are successfully synthesized by a facile molten-salt synthesis method (MSSM) at low temperatures, using LiCl, LiCl/NaCl mixture (mass ratio 1: 1) as molten salt, respectively.",Low-temperature synthesis of apatite-type La9.33Ge6O26 as electrolytes with high conductivity,10.1088/1674-1056/27/4/048201
2,14709,"Experimental results indicate that the optimal mass ratio between reactant and molten salt is 1: 2, and LiCl/NaCl mixed molten-salt is more beneficial for forming high-quality La9.33Ge6O26 powders than LiCl individual molten-salt.",Low-temperature synthesis of apatite-type La9.33Ge6O26 as electrolytes with high conductivity,10.1088/1674-1056/27/4/048201
3,14709,"Comparing with the conventional solid-state reaction method (SSRM), the synthesis temperature of apatite-type La9.33Ge6O26 powders using the MSSM decreases more than 350 degrees C, which can effectively avoid Ge loss in the preparation process of precursor powders.",Low-temperature synthesis of apatite-type La9.33Ge6O26 as electrolytes with high conductivity,10.1088/1674-1056/27/4/048201
