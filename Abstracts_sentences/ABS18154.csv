2,18154,"Impedance measurements using a silver electrode were unsuccessful due to a solid state reaction between FeVO4 and Ag, forming alpha-AgVO3 and alpha-Fe2O3 at the interface.",Study on conductivity and redox stability of iron orthovanadate,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2011.01.009
3,18154,"Impedance measurements, with a platinum electrode, reaffirmed that FeVO4 exhibits semiconductor behaviour in air.",Study on conductivity and redox stability of iron orthovanadate,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2011.01.009
4,18154,"In a reducing atmosphere, 5% H-2/Ar, high electronic conductivity, from 1 S cm(-1) at 300 degrees C to 2 S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C, was observed with an activation energy of 0.13(1) eV. X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry data determined that the change in electronic conductivity was due to the degradation of the material into FeV2O4 and alpha-Fe2O3.",Study on conductivity and redox stability of iron orthovanadate,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2011.01.009
