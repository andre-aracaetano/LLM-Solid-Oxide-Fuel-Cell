2,11108,"After in-situ reduction, the substrate turned to be porous by the reduction of NiO and Fe3O4 to Ni and Fe, and the porosity reached to 13.6 vol%.",An intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell using a La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 thin film prepared by pulsed laser deposition as electrolyte,10.5796/electrochemistry.73.945
3,11108,Stoichiometric composition of LSGM film was successfully prepared by optimizing the deposition parameters and the target composition.,An intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell using a La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 thin film prepared by pulsed laser deposition as electrolyte,10.5796/electrochemistry.73.945
4,11108,"When Sm0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (SSC) was used as cathode material, extremely high power density was achieved at relatively low temperature.",An intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell using a La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 thin film prepared by pulsed laser deposition as electrolyte,10.5796/electrochemistry.73.945
5,11108,"The maximum power density reached to 3270, 1951, 612 and 80 mW/cm(2) at 973, 873, 773 and 673 K, respectively.",An intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell using a La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 thin film prepared by pulsed laser deposition as electrolyte,10.5796/electrochemistry.73.945
6,11108,"Detail analysis by current interruption method revealed that IR drop was still dominant internal resistance at low temperature and the overpotential of the anode and the cathode was not significant even at 673 K. Therefore, SOFC can be operated at temperature lower than 773 K by using LSGM thin film.",An intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell using a La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3 thin film prepared by pulsed laser deposition as electrolyte,10.5796/electrochemistry.73.945
