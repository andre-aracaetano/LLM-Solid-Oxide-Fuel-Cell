1,17416,"To standardize materials and component characterization for next generation hydrogen production and energy generation solid oxide cell (SOC) technologies, test protocols are being established to facilitate comparison across the numerous laboratories and research institutions where SOC development for application in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolyzes cells (SOEC) is conducted.",Conductivity and Transference Number Determination Protocols for Solid Oxide Cell Materials,10.3389/fenrg.2022.867783
2,17416,"This paper proposes guiding protocols for fundamental electrical properties characterization of SOC materials, including temperature- and oxygen partial pressure (pO(2))-dependent conductivity measurements, and use of the electromotive force for determining the transference numbers, or contributions of each charge carrier (i.e., ions and electrons), to the total conductivity.",Conductivity and Transference Number Determination Protocols for Solid Oxide Cell Materials,10.3389/fenrg.2022.867783
3,17416,The protocol for Archimedes density measurements is also provided as an integral technique to both of these methods.,Conductivity and Transference Number Determination Protocols for Solid Oxide Cell Materials,10.3389/fenrg.2022.867783
