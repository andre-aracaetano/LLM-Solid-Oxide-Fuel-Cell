5,20001,"H-2-TPR tests exhibited two primary reduction peaks, which correspond to the following stages: the first one (150-350 degrees C) can be ascribed to the reduction of CuO species into metallic Cu; while the second one (750-900 degrees C) can be ascribed to the bulk Ce4+ -> Ce3+ reduction process of the support (CGO).",CGO20-CuO composites synthesized by the combustion method and characterized by H2-TPR,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.032
6,20001,"Further, after H-2-TPR reduction of the asprepared CGO-CuO compositions, powders exhibit the presence of metallic Cu and the fluorite CGO solid solution that remains stable whereas any CuO is no longer noticed.",CGO20-CuO composites synthesized by the combustion method and characterized by H2-TPR,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.032
