5,17101,The magnetic properties were studied at room temperature (300 K) and at low temperature (100 K) using vibrating sample magnetometer.,Tuning the structural and magnetic properties on Cu/Cr nanoferrite using different rare-earth ions,10.1007/s10854-017-8261-z
6,17101,The saturation magnetization (M-s) at 100 K was nearly twice than that at 300 K. The most suitable sample in the present work to be applied in many technological applications (especially in solid-oxide fuel cell electrodes) is La sample due to it has the highest saturation magnetization (M-s) and low coercivity (H-c).,Tuning the structural and magnetic properties on Cu/Cr nanoferrite using different rare-earth ions,10.1007/s10854-017-8261-z
