2,10250,"The crystallization kinetic behavior of calcium borosilicate glasses were studied by Differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).",Thermal and crystallization kinetics of yttrium and lanthanum calcium silicate glass sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.05.124
3,10250,These glasses were exposed for different heat treatment durations in oxidizing atmosphere at 800 and 900 degrees C. XRD results indicate the presence of La2SiO5 crystalline phase which increases the thermal expansion of the glasses.,Thermal and crystallization kinetics of yttrium and lanthanum calcium silicate glass sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.05.124
4,10250,"However, yttria doped calcium borosilicate glass (CaY) sample could not form any crystalline phase even after 10 h heat treatment at 900 degrees C. Moreover, the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), viscosity values and fragility index of the glasses indicate that lanthanum doped calcium borosilicate glass (CaLa) might be a better glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cell as compared to CaY glass.",Thermal and crystallization kinetics of yttrium and lanthanum calcium silicate glass sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.05.124
