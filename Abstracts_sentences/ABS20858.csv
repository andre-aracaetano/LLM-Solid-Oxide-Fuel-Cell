2,20858,"All LSCSbx oxides have a tetragonal distorted perovskite structure with s.g. P4/mmm, while a La2Co2O5 impurity phase was observed within La doping levels at x=0.6-0.8.","Effects of La doping on electrical conductivity, thermal expansion and electrochemical performance in LaxSr1-xCo0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.070
3,20858,The LSCSb0.4 has a good chemical compatibility with LSGM electrolyte for temperatures up to 1050 degrees C. XPS examinations indicate the existence of Co3+/Co4+ mixed valence states in LSCSbx.,"Effects of La doping on electrical conductivity, thermal expansion and electrochemical performance in LaxSr1-xCo0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.070
4,20858,"The conductivity increases with La doping and the LSCSbx with x=0.4 exhibits the highest electrical conductivity (e.g., 673-1637 S cm(-1) at 300-850 degrees C).","Effects of La doping on electrical conductivity, thermal expansion and electrochemical performance in LaxSr1-xCo0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.070
5,20858,"The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) decreases from 25.89X10(-6) K-1 for x=0.0 to 18.5X10(-6) K-1 for x=0.6 at 30-900 degrees C. Among the LSCSbx compositions, the LSCSb0.2 exhibits the lowest polarization resistance (R-p), which is merely 0.069 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C.","Effects of La doping on electrical conductivity, thermal expansion and electrochemical performance in LaxSr1-xCo0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.070
6,20858,"The maximum power density of the cell with LSCSb0.2 cathode on 300 mu m thick LSGM electrolyte attains 564mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, which is higher than that of SrCo0.9Sb0.1O3-delta (SCSb) cathode.","Effects of La doping on electrical conductivity, thermal expansion and electrochemical performance in LaxSr1-xCo0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.070
7,20858,All of the results indicate that LSCSb0.2 is a promising material for application in IT-SOFCs cathodes.,"Effects of La doping on electrical conductivity, thermal expansion and electrochemical performance in LaxSr1-xCo0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cathodes for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.02.070
