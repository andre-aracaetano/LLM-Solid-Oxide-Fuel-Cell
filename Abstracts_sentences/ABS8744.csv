2,8744,The composite electrodes are fabricated with screen-printing technique and characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.,"(La,Sr)MnO3-(Y,Bi)2O3 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.111
3,8744,"The interfacial polarization resistances (R-p) of the LSM-YSB electrodes on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), samaria-doped ceria (SDC), and YSB electrolytes are analyzed regarding the electrode composition and operating temperature.","(La,Sr)MnO3-(Y,Bi)2O3 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.111
4,8744,R-p decreases with the increase of YSB content up to 80 wt.% in the LSM-YSB composite.,"(La,Sr)MnO3-(Y,Bi)2O3 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.111
5,8744,"When YSZ is used as the electrolyte, the lowest R-p, is 0.14 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, which is only 1.8% of that for a pure LSM electrode, 5.6% of that reported for LSM-YSZ composites, and 13.2% of that for reported LSM-GDC (gadolinia-doped ceria) electrodes, demonstrating that YSB is very effective to enhance the performance of LSM-based cathodes.","(La,Sr)MnO3-(Y,Bi)2O3 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.111
6,8744,The electrode performance is also affected by the electrolyte substrate.,"(La,Sr)MnO3-(Y,Bi)2O3 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.111
7,8744,"LSM electrodes without any YSB exhibit obviously different performance on YSZ, SDC and YSB electrolytes.","(La,Sr)MnO3-(Y,Bi)2O3 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.111
8,8744,"However, when YSB is cooperated, R-p on different electrolytes tends to become equivalent, especially for electrodes with high YSB content.","(La,Sr)MnO3-(Y,Bi)2O3 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.111
9,8744,"Further analysis shows that their electrochemical performance is contributed dominantly from the electrode bulk whereas the contribution from the electrode/electrolyte interface is negligible, suggesting weak electrolyte effect on the performance of LSM-YSB composite electrodes.","(La,Sr)MnO3-(Y,Bi)2O3 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.111
