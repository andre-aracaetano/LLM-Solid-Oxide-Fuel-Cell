2,12729,"A syngas producer is developed as a stand-alone SMR + CaL process using a combination of a steam methane reformer (SMR), a calcium looping (CaL) and a pre-burner to enhance CO2 concentration of exhaust gas and produce syngas for power generation.",Design and optimization of stand-alone triple combined cycle systems using calcium looping technology,10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.10.079
3,12729,"A stand-alone triple combined cycle system (TCCS), which mainly consists, of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), Brayton-Rankine combined cycles, and a syngas producer, is developed as a high efficiency power generation system with CO2 capture by adding a post-burner and using the specific water/heat exchanger networks.",Design and optimization of stand-alone triple combined cycle systems using calcium looping technology,10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.10.079
4,12729,"Based on optimal operating conditions by solving two optimization algorithms, the simulation shows that the total power efficiency of the stand-alone TCCS is up to 60.56% and its CO2 emissions per kWh of electricity is down to 7.18 gCO(2).",Design and optimization of stand-alone triple combined cycle systems using calcium looping technology,10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.10.079
