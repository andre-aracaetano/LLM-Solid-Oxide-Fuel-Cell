1,3160,"It is well known that at solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating temperatures, volatile Cr species are generated over the chromia scale of chromia-forming alloy interconnect, poisoning the cathodes such as (LaSr)MnO3 (LSM) and (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O-3 (LSCF) and causing the rapid degradation of the cell performance.",Mechanism of Cr deposition and its application in the development of Cr-tolerant cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.006
2,3160,"Thus, SOFCs based on the chromia-forming alloy interconnect require the development of cathode not only with high electrochemical activity but also with the high Cr-tolerance.",Mechanism of Cr deposition and its application in the development of Cr-tolerant cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.006
