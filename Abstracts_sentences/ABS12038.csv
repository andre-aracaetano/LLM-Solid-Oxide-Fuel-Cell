2,12038,Uniform hierarchical porous microstructures are formed in Ni0.9Cu0.1/SDC anode with interconnected large pores of 2-5 mu m and 100-300 nm small pores on the wall.,A hierarchical porous microstructure for improving long-term stability of Ni1-xCux/SDC anode-supported IT-SOFCs fueled with dry methane,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.01.212
3,12038,The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based on such anode exhibits exceptional electrochemical catalytic activity for dry CH4 oxidation and a maximum power density of 379 mW cm(-2) is acquired at 600 degrees C. Durability test results show only 2.4% power density drop is observed after 72 h operation under a constant cell voltage of 0.5 V. The results have demonstrated that the optimization of anode microstructures is an effective way to improve the performance and long-term stability of Ni1-xCux alloy-based anode-supported SOFC.,A hierarchical porous microstructure for improving long-term stability of Ni1-xCux/SDC anode-supported IT-SOFCs fueled with dry methane,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.01.212
