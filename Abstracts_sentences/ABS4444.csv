3,4444,"In the presence of gaseous Cr species, the electrode processes for the O-2 reduction on LSM and Pt electrode were significantly inhibited while on LSCF electrodes, the inhibiting effect was much smaller.",Use of gaseous Cr species to diagnose surface and bulk process for O2 reduction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004137720740
4,4444,It has been shown that gaseous Cr species primarily inhibited the electrode surface process of the O-2 reduction reaction and the inhibiting effect can be quantitatively related to the oxygen diffusion coefficient of the electrode material.,Use of gaseous Cr species to diagnose surface and bulk process for O2 reduction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004137720740
5,4444,The results demonstrated that gaseous Cr species can be used to distinguish between the surface and bulk process kinetics for the O-2 reduction reaction under solid oxide fuel cells operation conditions.,Use of gaseous Cr species to diagnose surface and bulk process for O2 reduction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004137720740
