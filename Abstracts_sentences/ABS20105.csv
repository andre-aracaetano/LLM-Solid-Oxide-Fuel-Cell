3,20105,"In the employed sol-gel process, stable sols of hydrated alumina Al2O3 (.) yH(2)O (190 < y < 210) were reacted with methanolic KOH and Li2CO3 dissolved in water, forming crystalline K/Li-inserted boehmite.",Preparation of Li-stabilized K+-beta-aluminas by sol-gel process and their characterization compared with solid state reaction,
4,20105,"Through thermal decomposition at about 430degreesC, this precursor was converted to a modified K/Li-gamma -alumina intermediate, which yielded the phase pure K+-beta-alumina by calcinations at relatively low temperatures between 1100-1200degreesC. On the other hand, both beta/beta-alumina phases with a maximum beta-alumina phase fraction of about 50% appeared at 1300degreesC through the solid state reaction using fine a -alumina powder as a starting material.",Preparation of Li-stabilized K+-beta-aluminas by sol-gel process and their characterization compared with solid state reaction,
