2,13576,"It presents very high oxygen exchange and diffusion coefficients, two characteristics of utmost importance for an efficient cathode material.","Simulations of REBaCo2O5.5 (RE=Gd, La, Y) cathode materials through energy minimisation and molecular dynamics",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.006
3,13576,Yet the understanding at atomic scale of these two properties is rather limited.,"Simulations of REBaCo2O5.5 (RE=Gd, La, Y) cathode materials through energy minimisation and molecular dynamics",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.006
4,13576,"Here, we performed calculations to understand the influence of rare-earth nature in REBaCo2O5.5 (RE=Gd, La, Y) on material stability and oxygen diffusion properties.","Simulations of REBaCo2O5.5 (RE=Gd, La, Y) cathode materials through energy minimisation and molecular dynamics",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.006
5,13576,"Through energy minimisation, we determined the most energetically favourable distribution of A-site cations and oxygen vacancies.","Simulations of REBaCo2O5.5 (RE=Gd, La, Y) cathode materials through energy minimisation and molecular dynamics",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.006
6,13576,We also investigated with Molecular Dynamics simulations the mechanisms of oxygen diffusion in A-site ordered REBaCo2O5.5.,"Simulations of REBaCo2O5.5 (RE=Gd, La, Y) cathode materials through energy minimisation and molecular dynamics",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.006
7,13576,"The results confirm that oxygen vacancies essentially lie in the RE-plane and that diffusion is mainly two-dimensional with oxygen moving in the (a,b) plane while diffusion along the c axis is strongly hindered.","Simulations of REBaCo2O5.5 (RE=Gd, La, Y) cathode materials through energy minimisation and molecular dynamics",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.006
8,13576,"Between 1300 and 1900 K. the activation energy for oxygen diffusion lies in the range 0.69-0.83 eV depending on the RE cation nature, values in good agreement with the experimental ones.","Simulations of REBaCo2O5.5 (RE=Gd, La, Y) cathode materials through energy minimisation and molecular dynamics",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.006
9,13576,"We show that, in the double perovskite structure, the replacement of Gd by a larger rare-earth ion enhances oxygen diffusion properties but also reduces the stability of the double perovskite structure.","Simulations of REBaCo2O5.5 (RE=Gd, La, Y) cathode materials through energy minimisation and molecular dynamics",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.006
