2,7407,A dense LSCF thin film was deposited by spin coating between porous thick LSCF cathode film and gadolinium-doped ceria electrolyte in ceramic form.,Synthesis and characterization of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 films for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.tsf.2013.11.136
3,7407,Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy characterizations were carried out on these materials to observe the microstructure and measure the thicknesses of the films.,Synthesis and characterization of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 films for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.tsf.2013.11.136
4,7407,"DC measurements on LSCF pellets showed that the conductivity of the material is optimized as higher than 100 S/cm at temperatures above 400 degrees C. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements at 700 degrees C have shown that, thanks to the interlayer thin LSCF film, the Area Specific Resistance of the cathode has decreased by 27%.",Synthesis and characterization of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 films for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.tsf.2013.11.136
