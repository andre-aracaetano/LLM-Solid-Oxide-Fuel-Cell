1,15975,Various disadvantages such as indolent oxidation/reduction and carbon-hydrogen (C-H) activation has hindered the commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operated with multi fuels at low temperatures (i.e. 400700)degrees C. Extensive efforts have been made for the efficient performance of SOFCs by utilizing safe and cheap hydrocarbon fuels at low temperatures.,Structural and electrochemical evaluation of symmetrical and fuel flexible perovskite electrode for low temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.482
2,15975,"In the current investigation, electrochemical performance of novel anode and cathode material SrMo0.5Fe0.5O3-delta (SMFO) is evaluated in the presence of multi-fuels such as hydrogen (gaseous), ethanol (liquid) and sub-bituminous coal (solid) at low temperature - 700 degrees C. SMFO (synthesized through solid state reaction route) is thoroughly investigated via X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).",Structural and electrochemical evaluation of symmetrical and fuel flexible perovskite electrode for low temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.482
