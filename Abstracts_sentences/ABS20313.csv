2,20313,"Due to the ubiquitous presence of SiO2 impurities and wide use of Ni-containing anodes, it is therefore of great technical importance to understand the synergetic effect of NiO and SiO2 on densification, grain growth and ionic conductivities (especially the grain boundary (GB) conduction) of zirconia electrolytes.",Synergetic effect of NiO and SiO2 on the sintering and properties of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.08.028
3,20313,"In this study, three groups of 8YSZ ceramics, with Si contents of similar to 30, similar to 500 and similar to 3000 ppm, have been designed.",Synergetic effect of NiO and SiO2 on the sintering and properties of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.08.028
