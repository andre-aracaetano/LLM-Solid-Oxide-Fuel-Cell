2,19248,"We propose a dominant A-site cation migration mechanism which involves an A-site cation (e.g., La-A(x)) hop into a V-A ''' of a V-A '''-V-B ''' cluster, where La-A(x), V-A ''', and, V-B ''' are La3+, A-site vacancy, and B-site vacancy in bulk LSM, respectively, and V-A '''-V-B ''' is the first nearest-neighbor V-A ''' and V-B ''' pair.",Density-Functional-Theory Modeling of Cation Diffusion in Bulk La1-xSrxMnO3±δ ( x=0.0-0.25) for Solid-Oxide Fuel-Cell Cathodes,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044001

4,19248,This decrease in the cation migration barrier is attributed to the presence of the V-B ''' relieving the electrostatic repulsion and steric constraints to the migrating A-site cations in the transition-state image configurations.,Density-Functional-Theory Modeling of Cation Diffusion in Bulk La1-xSrxMnO3±δ ( x=0.0-0.25) for Solid-Oxide Fuel-Cell Cathodes,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044001
5,19248,"The V-A '''-V-B ''' interaction energy is predicted to be weakly repulsive (0.2-0.3 eV) in bulk LSM, which enables the V-A '''-V-B ''' cluster to readily form.",Density-Functional-Theory Modeling of Cation Diffusion in Bulk La1-xSrxMnO3±δ ( x=0.0-0.25) for Solid-Oxide Fuel-Cell Cathodes,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044001

7,19248,"By examining the A-site cation migration barriers among different metal cations (Zr4+, Y3+, Gd3+) relevant for SOFC applications, it is demonstrated that migration barriers of the cation impurity in bulk LSM correlate with the ionic charge and ionic radius at a given formal cationic charge.",Density-Functional-Theory Modeling of Cation Diffusion in Bulk La1-xSrxMnO3±δ ( x=0.0-0.25) for Solid-Oxide Fuel-Cell Cathodes,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044001

12,19248,"[Mn-A(x) (V-A ''') mechanism] has a barrier of only 0.5 eV. Such a low Mn-A(x) (V-A ''') migration barrier opens the possibility to activate Mn transport in bulk LSM through the diffusion of the antisite Mn-A(x) (V-A ''') pathway on the A-site lattice, particularly when the concentration of the Mn antisite defect can be altered upon varying the A/B ratio and the activity of MnOy.",Density-Functional-Theory Modeling of Cation Diffusion in Bulk La1-xSrxMnO3±δ ( x=0.0-0.25) for Solid-Oxide Fuel-Cell Cathodes,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044001
13,19248,"The increase in Sr-A' doping concentration in bulk La1-xSrxMnO3 +/-delta (x = 0.0-0.25) is found to influence primarily the formation energies of cation transport carriers (cation vacancies), whereas the cation migration barriers exhibit only a weak dependence on the Sr-A' concentration.",Density-Functional-Theory Modeling of Cation Diffusion in Bulk La1-xSrxMnO3±δ ( x=0.0-0.25) for Solid-Oxide Fuel-Cell Cathodes,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.8.044001
