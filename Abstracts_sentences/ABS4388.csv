1,4388,The bilayered supports for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on composites of NiO and ZrO2 stabilized by 10 mol % Sc2O3 and 1 mol % Y2O3 (10Sc1YSZ) are synthesized by tape casting.,Tape Casting of Bilayered Anode Supports and Electrochemical Performance of SOFCs Based on Them,10.1134/S1023193522020033
2,4388,"The required porosity is attained by optimization of the content of pore-forming agent (starch) in the initial suspension and also by thermal treatment, on retention of the high strength characteristics of the substrate.",Tape Casting of Bilayered Anode Supports and Electrochemical Performance of SOFCs Based on Them,10.1134/S1023193522020033
3,4388,The mechanical strength of supports is assessed by three-point bending method.,Tape Casting of Bilayered Anode Supports and Electrochemical Performance of SOFCs Based on Them,10.1134/S1023193522020033
4,4388,"The bilayered gas-tight electrolyte with the layers of ZrO2 stabilized by Y2O3 (8 mol %) (8YSZ) and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 is obtained by magnetron sputtering followed by annealing at 1200 degrees C. Studying the electrochemical characteristics of a SOFC with the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - delta cathode has shown that as the working temperature decreases, the contribution of electrode processes into cell's internal resistance increases which induces the specific power decrease down to 1.8, 1.4, and 0.9 W/cm(2) at 850, 800, and 750 degrees C, respectively.",Tape Casting of Bilayered Anode Supports and Electrochemical Performance of SOFCs Based on Them,10.1134/S1023193522020033
