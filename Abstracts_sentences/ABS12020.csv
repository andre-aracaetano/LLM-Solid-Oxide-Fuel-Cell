1,12020,Suspension plasma-sprayed YSZ coatings were deposited at lab-scale and production-type facilities to investigate the effect of process equipment on coating properties.,The Influence of Process Equipment on the Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Coatings,10.1007/s11666-012-9837-z
2,12020,"The target application for these coatings is solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolytes; hence, dense microstructures with low permeability values were preferred.",The Influence of Process Equipment on the Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Coatings,10.1007/s11666-012-9837-z
3,12020,"Both facilities had the same torch but different suspension feeding systems, torch robots, and substrate holders.",The Influence of Process Equipment on the Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Coatings,10.1007/s11666-012-9837-z
4,12020,The lab-scale facility had higher torch-substrate relative speeds compared with the production-type facility.,The Influence of Process Equipment on the Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Coatings,10.1007/s11666-012-9837-z
5,12020,"On porous stainless steel substrates, permeabilities and microstructures were comparable for coatings from both facilities, and no segmentation cracks were observed.",The Influence of Process Equipment on the Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Coatings,10.1007/s11666-012-9837-z
6,12020,Coating permeability was further reduced by increasing substrate temperatures during deposition or reducing suspension feed rates.,The Influence of Process Equipment on the Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Coatings,10.1007/s11666-012-9837-z
7,12020,"On SOFC cathode substrates, coatings made in the production-type facility had higher permeabilities and more segmentation cracks compared with coatings made in the lab-scale facility.",The Influence of Process Equipment on the Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Coatings,10.1007/s11666-012-9837-z
8,12020,Increased cracking in coatings from the production-type facility was likely caused mainly by its lower torch-substrate relative speed.,The Influence of Process Equipment on the Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Coatings,10.1007/s11666-012-9837-z
