1,4135,This paper concerns a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based integrated powering system for a medium-sized airplane and analyzes it thermodynamically for its performance assessment and evaluation.,Development and evaluation of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell system for medium airplanes,10.1002/er.5525
2,4135,It further investigates the system in relation to aircraft operating conditions and provides the conceptual solutions for heating and cooling at various temperatures.,Development and evaluation of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell system for medium airplanes,10.1002/er.5525
3,4135,The results of the energy and exergy analyses and performance assessments of the proposed integrated system are presented and discussed.,Development and evaluation of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell system for medium airplanes,10.1002/er.5525
4,4135,"The exergy and energy efficiencies of the main components are calculated and observed for the SOFCs with the maximum values of 84.54% and 80.31%, respectively.",Development and evaluation of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell system for medium airplanes,10.1002/er.5525
5,4135,"The present integrated system has overall energy and exergy efficiencies of 57.53% and 47.18%, respectively.",Development and evaluation of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell system for medium airplanes,10.1002/er.5525
6,4135,"Furthermore, it is found that an increase in the reforming temperature ratio can improve the hydrogen yield.",Development and evaluation of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell system for medium airplanes,10.1002/er.5525
7,4135,"However, when the system is operated at a temperature higher than 800 degrees C, the hydrogen yield decreases since a reverse water gas shift reaction is more pronounced.",Development and evaluation of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell system for medium airplanes,10.1002/er.5525
