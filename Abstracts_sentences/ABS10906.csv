1,10906,"The effect of nickel film thickness and the thickness of a porous ceramic layer, covering the Ni film, on anode polarization of a solid oxide electrolyte fuel cell was measured at around 1273 K.",EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVE REACTION ZONE AT NI(NIO)/ZIRCONIA ANODE BY USING AN ELECTRODE WITH A NOVEL STRUCTURE,10.1149/1.2050007
2,10906,The electrode impedance was found to be dependent on the thickness of the porous layer but not on that of Ni film.,EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVE REACTION ZONE AT NI(NIO)/ZIRCONIA ANODE BY USING AN ELECTRODE WITH A NOVEL STRUCTURE,10.1149/1.2050007
3,10906,DC polarization was affected by the thickness of neither film at relatively high partial pressure of hydrogen.,EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVE REACTION ZONE AT NI(NIO)/ZIRCONIA ANODE BY USING AN ELECTRODE WITH A NOVEL STRUCTURE,10.1149/1.2050007
4,10906,"The interface resistance, R(1), obtained from the impedance plot consisted of a reaction resistance, R(1), and a diffusion resistance, R(2), caused by the porous ceramic layer.",EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVE REACTION ZONE AT NI(NIO)/ZIRCONIA ANODE BY USING AN ELECTRODE WITH A NOVEL STRUCTURE,10.1149/1.2050007
5,10906,R(1) was proportional to p(H2O)(-1/2) but was not affected by P-H2.,EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVE REACTION ZONE AT NI(NIO)/ZIRCONIA ANODE BY USING AN ELECTRODE WITH A NOVEL STRUCTURE,10.1149/1.2050007
6,10906,These results suggested that the rate-determining process is an activation one and it takes place at very thin zone of the Ni film within 1 mu m from the electrode/electrolyte interface.,EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVE REACTION ZONE AT NI(NIO)/ZIRCONIA ANODE BY USING AN ELECTRODE WITH A NOVEL STRUCTURE,10.1149/1.2050007
7,10906,P-H2 and P-H2O dependencies of the current-voltage relation were similar to that obtained from a Ni patterned electrode and a Ni-YSZ cermet electrode by other researchers.,EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVE REACTION ZONE AT NI(NIO)/ZIRCONIA ANODE BY USING AN ELECTRODE WITH A NOVEL STRUCTURE,10.1149/1.2050007
