3,10722,Results for materials with different crystal structures and electrical properties are presented and show characteristic differences attributed to the materials' electrical properties.,Electrochemical characterization of ceramic SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.1383774
4,10722,At 1000 degreesC in hydrogen saturated with water at room temperature materials with dominant electronic conduction show polarization resistances in the range 10-13 Omega cm(2).,Electrochemical characterization of ceramic SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.1383774
5,10722,"For mixed conducting ceramics as Y0.2Ti0.18Zr0.62O1.9+/-delta (YZT) and Ce0.6Gd0.4O2+/-delta the electrochemical performance is improved to 3.7 and 0.44 Omega cm(2), respectively.",Electrochemical characterization of ceramic SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.1383774
6,10722,"The best value measured for YZT was 0.7 Omega cm(2) when sintering the layer at 1300 degreesC. Initial evaluation of the impedance spectra indicates an extension of the reaction zone into the porous mixed conducting electrode, which can explain the higher electrochemical activity of the mixed conductors Ce0.6Gd0.4O1.8+/-delta and YZT.",Electrochemical characterization of ceramic SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.1383774
