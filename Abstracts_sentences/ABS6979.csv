1,6979,A commercial solid oxide fuel cell with a Ni/YSZ anode was characterized under a pure methane atmosphere.,Carbon deposition in porous nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia anode under methane atmosphere,10.1007/s12613-019-1744-6
2,6979,The amount of deposited carbon increased with an increase in temperature but decreased when the temperature exceeded 700 degrees C.,Carbon deposition in porous nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia anode under methane atmosphere,10.1007/s12613-019-1744-6
3,6979,The reactivity of carbon decreased with increasing deposition temperature.,Carbon deposition in porous nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia anode under methane atmosphere,10.1007/s12613-019-1744-6
4,6979,"Filamentous carbon was deposited from 400 to 600 degrees C, whereas flake carbon was deposited at 700 and 800 degrees C. With increasing temperature, the intensity ratio of the D band over the sum of the G and D bands was constant at the beginning and then decreased with the transformation of the carbon morphology.",Carbon deposition in porous nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia anode under methane atmosphere,10.1007/s12613-019-1744-6
5,6979,The crystallite size increased from 2.9 to 13 nm with increasing temperature.,Carbon deposition in porous nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia anode under methane atmosphere,10.1007/s12613-019-1744-6
6,6979,The results also indicated that the structure of the deposited carbon was better ordered with increasing deposition temperature.,Carbon deposition in porous nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia anode under methane atmosphere,10.1007/s12613-019-1744-6
7,6979,"In comparison with pure Ni powders, the interaction between the YSZ substrate and Ni particles could not only modify the carbon deposition kinetics but also reduce the temperature effect on the structure and reactivity variation of carbon.",Carbon deposition in porous nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia anode under methane atmosphere,10.1007/s12613-019-1744-6
