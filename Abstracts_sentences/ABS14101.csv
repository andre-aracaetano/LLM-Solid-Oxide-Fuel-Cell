1,14101,"The stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface is a critical issue in solid-oxide cells working at high temperatures, affecting their durability.",Interface Solid-State Reactions in La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/BaCe0.9Y0.1O3 Disclosed by X-ray Microspectroscopy,10.1021/acsaem.9b00037
2,14101,"In this paper, we investigate the solid-state chemical mechanisms that occur at the interface between two electrolytes (Ce0.8Sm0.2O2, SDC, and BaCe0.9Y0.1O3, BCY) and a cathode material (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, LSM) after prolonged thermal treatments.",Interface Solid-State Reactions in La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/BaCe0.9Y0.1O3 Disclosed by X-ray Microspectroscopy,10.1021/acsaem.9b00037
3,14101,"Following our previous work on the subject, we used X-ray microspectroscopy, a technique that probes the interface with submicrometric resolution combining microanalytical information with the chemical and structural information coming from space-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy.",Interface Solid-State Reactions in La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/BaCe0.9Y0.1O3 Disclosed by X-ray Microspectroscopy,10.1021/acsaem.9b00037
4,14101,"In LSM/BCY, the concentration profiles show striking reactive phenomena at the interface with a variety of micrometer-sized secondary phases: in particular, X-ray absorption spectra reveal at least three different chemical states for manganese (from +3 to +6).",Interface Solid-State Reactions in La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/BaCe0.9Y0.1O3 Disclosed by X-ray Microspectroscopy,10.1021/acsaem.9b00037
5,14101,"Also in LSM/SDC, a couple previously reported as chemically stable, we found the formation of small islets of SmMnO3 after the migration of manganese to the SDC side; these may constitute the nuclei for the subsequent formation of an interfacial resistive layer after more prolonged operation.",Interface Solid-State Reactions in La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/BaCe0.9Y0.1O3 Disclosed by X-ray Microspectroscopy,10.1021/acsaem.9b00037
6,14101,The ability of manganese to adopt several oxidation states and crystal chemical environments is indicated as a possible cause for these behaviors.,Interface Solid-State Reactions in La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/BaCe0.9Y0.1O3 Disclosed by X-ray Microspectroscopy,10.1021/acsaem.9b00037
