1,18412,"Nano-sized Ce0.79Sm0.2Cu0.01O2-delta (CSCO) and Ce0.80Sm0.2O2-delta (CSO) electrolyte powders were synthesized by the PVA-assisted combustion method, sintered at various temperatures and electrochemical properties, mechanical properties and microstructures were characterized in detail.",A high-strength Sm-doped CeO2 oxide-ion conducting electrolyte membrane for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1039/c3ra42626b
2,18412,"The results demonstrate that besides a considerable lowering of sintering temperature to achieve high levels of densification, the addition of very minor amounts of CuO as a co-dopant to CSO significantly enhanced mechanical properties (strength and hardness) without great degradation in electrochemical performance.",A high-strength Sm-doped CeO2 oxide-ion conducting electrolyte membrane for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1039/c3ra42626b
3,18412,The CSCO sintered at 1100 degrees C exhibits a biaxial flexural strength of 319 +/- 41 MPa which compared with 194 +/- 57 MPa for CSO with a slightly lower relative density sintered at 1400 degrees C.,A high-strength Sm-doped CeO2 oxide-ion conducting electrolyte membrane for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1039/c3ra42626b
4,18412,The enhancement of biaxial flexural strength is due to the formation of stronger CuO-rich grain boundaries during sintering as a consequence of the slight modification in grain boundary chemistry which leads to changes in fracture mode from intergranular to transgranular.,A high-strength Sm-doped CeO2 oxide-ion conducting electrolyte membrane for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1039/c3ra42626b
