5,16047,Both as-prepared and reduced LCTM samples have been studied by thermogravimetric analysis and dilatometry in air and Ar/H-2 (8%).,Evaluation of La2CoTi0.7Mg0.3O6 as an electrode material for a symmetrical SOFC,10.1007/s10832-018-0116-3
6,16047,No chemical interaction between the as-prepared LCTM and standard electrolyte materials for SOFC like GDC and YSZ has been observed up to 1273 K. High-temperature electrical conductivity of the as-prepared LCTM at variable oxygen partial pressure (10(-4)-0.21 atm) showed weak dependence over pO(2) with E-a = 0.48 +/- 0.01 eV. AC impedance study of the symmetrical cells LCTM/GDC/LCTM has revealed ASR value at 1173 K of similar to 8.1 +/- 0.1 Omega a (TM) cm(2) in air and 0.24 +/- 0.05 Omega a (TM) cm(2) in a reducing atmosphere.,Evaluation of La2CoTi0.7Mg0.3O6 as an electrode material for a symmetrical SOFC,10.1007/s10832-018-0116-3
7,16047,These results allow to consider LCTM as a promising electrode material for a symmetrical SOFC.,Evaluation of La2CoTi0.7Mg0.3O6 as an electrode material for a symmetrical SOFC,10.1007/s10832-018-0116-3
