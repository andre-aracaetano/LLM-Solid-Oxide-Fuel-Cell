2,8133,The results show functionally gradient LNF cathode and Gd0.2Ce0.8O2 (GDC)-impregnated LNF cathode both reveal the better electrochemical properties compared to that of 70 wt.% LNF-30 wt.% GDC cathode.,Comparison of the electrochemical properties of impregnated and functionally gradient LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2 composite cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.02.010
3,8133,"Functionally gradient LNF cathode with better interface of LNF/GDC/ScSZ can be achieved by the gradual change in composition from electrolyte to cathode, resulting in the decline in charge transfer resistance and gas phase diffusion resistance, therefore the decline in specific cathode polarization resistance (R-p).",Comparison of the electrochemical properties of impregnated and functionally gradient LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2 composite cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.02.010
