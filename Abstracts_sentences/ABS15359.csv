1,15359,"As a typical proton conductor, the perovskite structure BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY) has a strong water absorption capacity, which occupies the reaction sites and reduces the oxygen partial pressure at the cathode side of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs).",A novel inhibiting water adsorption strategy to enhance the cathode electrocatalytic ability,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160205
2,15359,"To solve this problem, a strategy for water adsorption inhibition was proposed to prepare composite cathode using the cubic fluorite structure La2Ce2O7 (LCO).",A novel inhibiting water adsorption strategy to enhance the cathode electrocatalytic ability,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160205
3,15359,"With much lower water absorption, when employing the mixed protonic and oxygen ionic conductor La1.85M0.15Ce2O7 (LMC, M=K, Rb, Cs) to replace the BZCY, the composite cathode LMC-La0.7Sr0.3FeO3-delta (LSF) possess higher open circuit voltage (OCV) and better electrochemical performance.",A novel inhibiting water adsorption strategy to enhance the cathode electrocatalytic ability,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160205
4,15359,"In addition, the comparatively study of LMC-LSF series cathodes were also carried out to investigate the effect of large radius alkali metals substitution on the electrochemical properties.",A novel inhibiting water adsorption strategy to enhance the cathode electrocatalytic ability,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160205
5,15359,"The cell with La1.85Rb0.15Ce2O7 (LRC)-LSF cathode reveals the most cell performance with the maximum power densities (MPDs) of 743, 547, 372, and 233 mW cm & minus;2 and the interfacial polarization resistance of 0.065, 0.148, 0.358, and 0.934 omega cm2 at 700-550 degrees C, respectively.",A novel inhibiting water adsorption strategy to enhance the cathode electrocatalytic ability,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160205
6,15359,"In general, LSF-LRC is a considerably potential cathode for H-SOFCs, and this strategy could inspire new ideas for designing and further optimizing new electrode materials.",A novel inhibiting water adsorption strategy to enhance the cathode electrocatalytic ability,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160205
