2,12012,"In this work, we improve the performance and stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and a recently developed electrode material, SrTi0.3Fe0.55Co0.15O3-delta (STFC), with addition of PrOx nanoparticles.",Mechanisms of PrOx performance enhancement of oxygen electrodes for low and intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.mtener.2019.100362
3,12012,Single-step PrOx infiltration improves performance of both LSCF and STFC across all tested temperatures (450-650 degrees C) with the most significant enhancements at lower temperatures.,Mechanisms of PrOx performance enhancement of oxygen electrodes for low and intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.mtener.2019.100362
4,12012,"STFC modified with PrOx yields the best overall performance and stability, with the initial polarization resistance of 0.20 Omega cm(2) at 550 degrees C increasing over similar to 800 h before stabilizing at 0.27 Omega cm(2).",Mechanisms of PrOx performance enhancement of oxygen electrodes for low and intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.mtener.2019.100362
5,12012,This represents a factor of similar to 10 resistance decrease compared to the LSCF electrode at 550 degrees C. A distribution of relaxation times analysis sheds light on the electrochemical mechanisms impacted by PrOx.,Mechanisms of PrOx performance enhancement of oxygen electrodes for low and intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.mtener.2019.100362
