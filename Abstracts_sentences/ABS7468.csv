1,7468,"Addition of doped ceria to double perovskite oxide such as PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+delta(PBCC) leads to remarkable performance enhancement of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), however, the challenge is to facilely fabricate nano-structured PBCC cathodes with nanoscale doped ceria without agglomeration of the ultrafine phase during the conventional high temperature electrode sintering process.",Facile co-synthesis and utilization of ultrafine and highly active PrBa0.8C0.2Co2O5+δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139673
2,7468,"Here, we report the fabrication of an ultrafine PBCC-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (GDC) composite via a facile co-synthesis route and direct assembly approach without the high temperature sintering process.",Facile co-synthesis and utilization of ultrafine and highly active PrBa0.8C0.2Co2O5+δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139673
3,7468,"The as-fabricated PBCC-GDC composite powder calcined at 750 degrees C contains PBCC, GDC, BaCoO3-delta(BCO) and PrCoO3-delta(PCO), and only PBCC and GDC phases as the calcination temperature increases to 850 degrees C and higher.",Facile co-synthesis and utilization of ultrafine and highly active PrBa0.8C0.2Co2O5+δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139673
4,7468,"A single cell with the directly assembled multi-phased PBCC-GDC powder calcined at 750 degrees C exhibits a peak power density of 2.08 W cm(-2) at an operating temperature of 750 degrees C, and is stable at 0.5 A cm(-2) and 700 degrees C for over 100 h. The outstanding electrode performance and stability is primarily ascribed to the in situ formation of intimate electrode/electrolyte interface by polarization and the construction and retaining of ultrafine electrode microstructure.",Facile co-synthesis and utilization of ultrafine and highly active PrBa0.8C0.2Co2O5+δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139673
