1,7198,A 70 nm-thick Ni layer deposited between the NiO-gadolinia doped ceria (NiO-GDC) anode and the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) substrate successfully enhanced the electrochemical performance of thin film solid oxide fuel cells (TF-SOFCs) using the sputtering technique.,Performance Enhancement in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Metal-Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors Bilayer Anode,10.1166/sam.2016.2589
2,7198,The thickness ratio between the NiO-GDC and Ni layer on the cell performance was investigated.,Performance Enhancement in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Metal-Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors Bilayer Anode,10.1166/sam.2016.2589
3,7198,"The TF-SOFCs with sputtered 210 nm-thick NiO-GDC and 70 nm-thick Ni layers exhibited maximum power density of 170 mW/cm(2) at 500 degrees C, which was about two times higher than those without Ni layers (80 mW/cm(2)).",Performance Enhancement in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Metal-Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors Bilayer Anode,10.1166/sam.2016.2589
4,7198,The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the performance improvement mostly stems from two factors: the reduced ohmic and anodic activation resistances and the improved anodic kinetics.,Performance Enhancement in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Metal-Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors Bilayer Anode,10.1166/sam.2016.2589
5,7198,"When the NiO-GDC layer is too thin (70 nm), the ionic conduction in the NiO-GDC layer became sluggish.",Performance Enhancement in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Metal-Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors Bilayer Anode,10.1166/sam.2016.2589
6,7198,"Therefore, the maximum power density decreased to 132 mW/cm(2).",Performance Enhancement in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Metal-Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors Bilayer Anode,10.1166/sam.2016.2589
7,7198,"Thus, we can conclude a proper thickness ratio between the NiO-GDC and Ni layers is required to maximize cell performance.",Performance Enhancement in Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Metal-Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors Bilayer Anode,10.1166/sam.2016.2589
