2,721,"In this work, we develop a novel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) by constructing a heterostructure electrolyte based on Gd0.15Ni0.05Ce0.8O2-delta (GNDC) and SnO2, which acquires an open circuit voltage of 1.026 V and a maximum power density (MPD) of 879.4 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C.",Enhanced Ionic Conductivity and Durability of Novel Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Constructing a Heterojunction Based on Transition and Rare Earth Metal Co-doped Ceria,10.1021/acsaem.1c01873
3,721,"It is demonstrated that the composites are a hybrid ionic and protonic conductor with competent conductivity of 0.124-0.220 S cm(-1) at 450-550 degrees C. Further characterization authenticates the valence state alteration of Ni, creating more oxygen vacancies during the tests.",Enhanced Ionic Conductivity and Durability of Novel Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Constructing a Heterojunction Based on Transition and Rare Earth Metal Co-doped Ceria,10.1021/acsaem.1c01873
