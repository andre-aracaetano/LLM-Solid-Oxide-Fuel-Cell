2,20779,"The anode sintered at 1250 degrees C displays minimum anode polarization (with anode ohmic loss), while the anode prepared at 1300 degrees C has the best electrochemical overpotential, viz., 27 mV at 300 mA cm(-2) operating at 800 degrees C.",Ni-SDC cermet anode for medium-temperature solid oxide fuel cell with lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00293-1
3,20779,"The anode ohmic loss gradually increases with increase in the sintering temperature at levels below 1300 degrees C, and sharply increases at 1350 degrees C. Electron micrographs show a clear grain growth at sintering temperatures higher than 1300 degrees",Ni-SDC cermet anode for medium-temperature solid oxide fuel cell with lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00293-1
