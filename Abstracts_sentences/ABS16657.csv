1,16657,The variations in the crystallinity and particle size of La0.84Sr0.16CrO3 powders synthesized using precursor solutions with various pHs in the glycine-nitrate process were investigated.,Preparation of La0.84Sr0.16CrO3 powders by pH-controlled glycine-nitrate process,10.1143/JJAP.35.L996
2,16657,Increasing the pH of the precursor solution promotes the formation of a complex between the Sr nitrate and the COOH group of the glycine.,Preparation of La0.84Sr0.16CrO3 powders by pH-controlled glycine-nitrate process,10.1143/JJAP.35.L996
3,16657,Powders with a higher crystallinity and finer particle size were obtained with increasing the pH of the precursor solution.,Preparation of La0.84Sr0.16CrO3 powders by pH-controlled glycine-nitrate process,10.1143/JJAP.35.L996
4,16657,It is thought that higher crystallinity and finer particle size of the powders synthesized using precursor solutions with high pH are due to homogeneous combustion resulting from the increased degree of complex formation of the Sr nitrate with the carboxylic acid group of the glycine.,Preparation of La0.84Sr0.16CrO3 powders by pH-controlled glycine-nitrate process,10.1143/JJAP.35.L996
