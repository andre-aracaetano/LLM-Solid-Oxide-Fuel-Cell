2,8376,"In this work, a biogas-fed solid oxide fuel cell system operating in a wastewater treatment plant (located in Turin, Italy) is analyzed in terms of its potential improvements through novel polygeneration systems.",Solutions for improving the energy efficiency in wastewater treatment plants based on solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119080
3,8376,"In its present combined heat and power configuration, along with electrical power, thermal energy from the exhaust gas is recovered to provide required heat to the plant's anaerobic digester.",Solutions for improving the energy efficiency in wastewater treatment plants based on solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119080
4,8376,"The analysis is focusing on different energy efficiency solutions for this type of plant by using solar thermal collectors, microturbines, a trilateral Rankine cycle, and an absorption chiller.",Solutions for improving the energy efficiency in wastewater treatment plants based on solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119080
5,8376,"Results reveal that, despite of higher efficiency for the trigeneration case using both trilateral Rankine cycle and absorption chiller (up to 88.4%), the solar integrated system results in the lowest natural gas consumption, which is 38.5% lower than the baseline scenario.",Solutions for improving the energy efficiency in wastewater treatment plants based on solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119080
6,8376,This same scenario is also the worst in economic terms due to the high capital costs of solar collectors.,Solutions for improving the energy efficiency in wastewater treatment plants based on solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119080
7,8376,"In a short-term cost trajectory of the solid oxide fuel cell technology, the most economically favorable scenario is the microturbine integrated case in which the calculated levelized cost of electricity is 0.11 (sic)/kWh, lower than grid electricity price, and with payback time of 6.5 years.",Solutions for improving the energy efficiency in wastewater treatment plants based on solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119080
8,8376,Long-term cost trajectory is indeed generating effective investments for all of the four scenarios with payback time between 3 and 5 years in all cases.,Solutions for improving the energy efficiency in wastewater treatment plants based on solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119080
