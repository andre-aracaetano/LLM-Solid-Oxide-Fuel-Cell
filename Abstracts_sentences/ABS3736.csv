2,3736,"This study presents models and simulations for SOFC performance that use previously published models to describe the connection between electrode microstructure and key properties such as effective conductivity, three phase boundary density, effective diffusivity, and permeability.",Structure-Properties-Performance: Modelling a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Infiltrated Electrodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ab91ca
3,3736,These effective properties are then used in a multiphysics model that solves the coupled set of differential equations that describe the working of a SOFC for a given set of operating conditions and model parameters.,Structure-Properties-Performance: Modelling a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Infiltrated Electrodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ab91ca
4,3736,"The results presented strongly suggest that using infiltrated electrodes for both the air and fuel electrodes, instead of conventional composite sintered-powder based electrodes, leads to substantially higher performance as measured by high current density at high cell potentials and high fuel utilization.",Structure-Properties-Performance: Modelling a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Infiltrated Electrodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ab91ca
5,3736,The cell performance curves are supplemented with sensitivity and parametric analyses to examine the impact of varying experimentally controllable electrode microstructural parameters on cell performance.,Structure-Properties-Performance: Modelling a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Infiltrated Electrodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ab91ca
