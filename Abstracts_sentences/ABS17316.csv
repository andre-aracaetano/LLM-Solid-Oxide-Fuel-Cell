2,17316,"Transient modeling can be of particular interest in order to describe and optimize start-up and shut-down procedures in SOFC systems; moreover, mathematical description of transients is helpful in the diagnostic of hazardous conditions during dynamic operation (i.e., load following).",Experimental Modeling of Transients in Large SOFC Systems,10.1115/1.4023217
3,17316,Physical based models-described by differential equations-are usually complex and need significant computing time.,Experimental Modeling of Transients in Large SOFC Systems,10.1115/1.4023217
4,17316,"To achieve real-time capability, the focus is on empirical models.",Experimental Modeling of Transients in Large SOFC Systems,10.1115/1.4023217
5,17316,"In this study, the transient operation of a large SOFC generator is reproduced by using the system identification approach that is based on the definition of a black-box model and on the identification of main model coefficients based on real experimental data.",Experimental Modeling of Transients in Large SOFC Systems,10.1115/1.4023217
6,17316,"In particular, the start-up of the system and its dynamics under fuel sensitivity experiments are investigated.",Experimental Modeling of Transients in Large SOFC Systems,10.1115/1.4023217
7,17316,"First, the work valuably shows some experimental results of a large SOFC generator under dynamic operation.",Experimental Modeling of Transients in Large SOFC Systems,10.1115/1.4023217
8,17316,"In particular, modeling results show that the system identification approach is an effective tool for the description of the transient behavior of SOFC large systems.",Experimental Modeling of Transients in Large SOFC Systems,10.1115/1.4023217
9,17316,The simulation of the start-up of a 100 kWe (electric) SOFC system shows the possibility to save similar to 20% of start-up time using an electric air heater rated a 30% in power than the nominal one.,Experimental Modeling of Transients in Large SOFC Systems,10.1115/1.4023217
10,17316,"The increase of natural gas flow during the start-up operation is instead not beneficial in term of yielding a faster procedure; rather, it leads to an excessive cooling of the stack due to internal reforming of natural gas (the higher amount of fuel burnt in the combustion zone does not lead to a more efficient way to preheat the cathode air).",Experimental Modeling of Transients in Large SOFC Systems,10.1115/1.4023217
11,17316,The results of this work are fully supported by experimental data available from a real generator running in Italy through years 2006-2009 and thus believed to be a valuable contribution for the scientific and engineering community.,Experimental Modeling of Transients in Large SOFC Systems,10.1115/1.4023217
