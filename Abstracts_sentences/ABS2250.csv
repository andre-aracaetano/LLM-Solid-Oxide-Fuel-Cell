5,2250,"Anode polarization resistance showed little or no change after 15 redox cycles at 800 degrees C. Cell performance was stable with 22 ppm H2S, with only a slight performance decrease relative to pure H-2, but higher H2S concentrations caused continuous degradation.","Structural, chemical, and electrochemical characteristics of LaSr2Fe2CrO9-δ-based solid oxide fuel cell anodes",10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.037
