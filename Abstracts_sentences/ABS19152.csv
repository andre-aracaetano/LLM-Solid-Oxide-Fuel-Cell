1,19152,We report the formation of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin films by supercritical fluid deposition (SFD) in carbon dioxide at 20 MPa and a stage temperature of 300 degrees C via hydrolysis of zirconium(IV) hexafluoroacetylacetonate and yttrium(III) hexafluoroacetylacetonate.,Supercritical fluid deposition of compositionally uniform yttria stabilized zirconia films,10.1016/j.supflu.2011.11.018

4,19152,We show that a cyclic co-deposition process in which aliquots of precursor are introduced sequentially enables the depostion of YSZ thin films with uniform composition as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.,Supercritical fluid deposition of compositionally uniform yttria stabilized zirconia films,10.1016/j.supflu.2011.11.018
