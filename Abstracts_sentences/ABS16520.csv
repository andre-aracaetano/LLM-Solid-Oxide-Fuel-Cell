1,16520,The effects on performance of commercially produced solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) were evaluated for two types of cathode infiltration: a mixed ionic-electronic conductor and an electronic insulator.,Effect of Sr-Doped LaCoO3 and LaZrO3 Infiltration on the Performance of SDC-LSCF Cathode,10.1149/1.3581026
2,16520,"The bi-layered cathode backbone consists of a thin, dual-phased functional layer containing Sm2O3-doped CeO2 (SDC) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and a thick current collecting layer of LSCF.",Effect of Sr-Doped LaCoO3 and LaZrO3 Infiltration on the Performance of SDC-LSCF Cathode,10.1149/1.3581026
3,16520,"The backbone was infiltrated with either La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSCo) or La1.97Sr0.03Zr2O7 (LSZ) using nitrate solution precursors, followed by calcination at 850 or 950 degrees C, respectively.",Effect of Sr-Doped LaCoO3 and LaZrO3 Infiltration on the Performance of SDC-LSCF Cathode,10.1149/1.3581026
4,16520,"LSCo infiltration decreased the measured full cell overpotential by 28-40% after 6 wt % loading, and no further effect was observed with higher loading.",Effect of Sr-Doped LaCoO3 and LaZrO3 Infiltration on the Performance of SDC-LSCF Cathode,10.1149/1.3581026
5,16520,"The LSCo-infiltrated cells demonstrated stable performance for over 200 h of operation at 0.25 A/cm(2) and 750 degrees C. Conversely, cathode infiltration with electrically insulating LSZ pyrochlore had a negative influence on the cathode performance that became substantial with increased infiltrate loading.",Effect of Sr-Doped LaCoO3 and LaZrO3 Infiltration on the Performance of SDC-LSCF Cathode,10.1149/1.3581026
6,16520,Characteristic wetting behavior of the two infiltrates on the composite backbone affects the dependency of infiltrate amounts on cathode performance.,Effect of Sr-Doped LaCoO3 and LaZrO3 Infiltration on the Performance of SDC-LSCF Cathode,10.1149/1.3581026
7,16520,The results imply that the composite cathode reaction is primarily under the control of the surface exchange reaction rate.,Effect of Sr-Doped LaCoO3 and LaZrO3 Infiltration on the Performance of SDC-LSCF Cathode,10.1149/1.3581026
8,16520,"This comparative study demonstrates that the cathode performance of a commercially produced SOFC can be influenced by applying infiltrates in a simple process, and indicates that the infiltrate's electrocatalytic activity and conductivity must be carefully considered when infiltrating a standard SDC-LSCF cathode.",Effect of Sr-Doped LaCoO3 and LaZrO3 Infiltration on the Performance of SDC-LSCF Cathode,10.1149/1.3581026
