2,15882,"CGO layers with thicknesses of 0.15, 0.3, and 0.5 mu m were integrated in state-of-the-art 5 x 5 cm(2)-large electrolyte-supported cells, and their performance characteristics and degradation behavior were investigated.",Intercalation of Thin-Film Gd-Doped Ceria Barrier Layers in Electrolyte-Supported Solid Oxide Cells: Physicochemical Aspects,10.1021/acsami.1c11175
3,15882,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements are correlated with a postmortem scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis to show that 0.15 mu m thick layers lead to the formation of a continuous Sr-containing secondary phase at the CGO/YSZ interface, likely related to the formation of a SrO-ZrO2 phase.",Intercalation of Thin-Film Gd-Doped Ceria Barrier Layers in Electrolyte-Supported Solid Oxide Cells: Physicochemical Aspects,10.1021/acsami.1c11175
4,15882,Major performance losses were confirmed by an increase in both Ohmic and polarization resistance with an increase in the frequency region similar to 10(3) Hz.,Intercalation of Thin-Film Gd-Doped Ceria Barrier Layers in Electrolyte-Supported Solid Oxide Cells: Physicochemical Aspects,10.1021/acsami.1c11175

6,15882,"and 0.5 mu m-thick CGO layers showed similar high performance and low degradation rates over a testing period of similar to 800 h. The YSZ/CGO interface of the cells with a 0.3 mu m-thick CGO layer showed the formation of a discontinuous Sr-containing secondary phase; however, performance losses were still successfully prevented.",Intercalation of Thin-Film Gd-Doped Ceria Barrier Layers in Electrolyte-Supported Solid Oxide Cells: Physicochemical Aspects,10.1021/acsami.1c11175
7,15882,"Furthermore, it is observed that 0.5 mu m-thick CGO layers were sufficient to suppress the formation of the Sr-containing secondary phase.",Intercalation of Thin-Film Gd-Doped Ceria Barrier Layers in Electrolyte-Supported Solid Oxide Cells: Physicochemical Aspects,10.1021/acsami.1c11175
