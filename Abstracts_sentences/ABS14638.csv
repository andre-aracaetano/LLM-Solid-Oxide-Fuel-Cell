2,14638,Conventionally employed current collection on the electrode segment linking together the single lines of the electrode comb was compared to applying gold mesh current collectors on the whole electrode surface.,Experimental study of current collection in single-chamber micro solid oxide fuel cells with comblike electrodes,10.1149/1.2958311
3,14638,"A simplified design was used with a comblike Ni-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) anode on one side of the YSZ electrolyte and a square, planar cathode made of (La(0.8)Sr(0.2))(0.98)MnO(3)-YSZ and (La(0.8)Sr(0.2))(0.98)MnO(3) on the opposite side.",Experimental study of current collection in single-chamber micro solid oxide fuel cells with comblike electrodes,10.1149/1.2958311
4,14638,"The cells were tested in methane-air mixtures at 700 degrees C. Current collection on the whole anode surface led to a reduction in the ohmic cell resistance for the conduction and collection of generated electrons, and 50% more power could be extracted from the cell.",Experimental study of current collection in single-chamber micro solid oxide fuel cells with comblike electrodes,10.1149/1.2958311
