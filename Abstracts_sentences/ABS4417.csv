3,4417,The crystal structure of GNP-derived LSNF was analyzed with X-ray diffraction.,Preparation and electrical properties of La0.4Sr0.6Ni0.2Fe0.8O3 using a glycine nitrate process,10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.03.042
4,4417,The possibility of using LSNF as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was investigated in symmetric cells at temperature between 500 and 850degreesC. The interfacial polarization resistance between LSNF cathodes and samaria-doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte was studied by impedance measurement.,Preparation and electrical properties of La0.4Sr0.6Ni0.2Fe0.8O3 using a glycine nitrate process,10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.03.042
5,4417,The effect of firing temperature and SDC addition on the interfacial resistance was systematically studied.,Preparation and electrical properties of La0.4Sr0.6Ni0.2Fe0.8O3 using a glycine nitrate process,10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.03.042
6,4417,"Results show that the optimum firing temperature is about 950degreesC, whereas the optimum amount of SDC addition is about 45 vol.% in the LSNF-SDC composite; polarization resistances for this LSNF-SDC cathode was as low as 0.16 Omegacm(2) at 700degreesC and 0.06 Omegacm(2) at 800degreesC, indicating LSNF is a promising cathode for intermediate temperature SOFCs based on doped ceria electrolytes.",Preparation and electrical properties of La0.4Sr0.6Ni0.2Fe0.8O3 using a glycine nitrate process,10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.03.042
