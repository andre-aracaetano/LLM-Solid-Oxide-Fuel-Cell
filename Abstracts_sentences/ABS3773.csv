1,3773,A new method for bonding blocks of Si3N4 has been developed that produces bonds whose maximum service temperature is equal to the temperature used during the bonding process.,Bonding of silicon nitride using preceramic polymer and germanium powders for potential fuel cell applications,10.1179/174367605X46803
2,3773,In the present paper a system consisting of blocks of Si3N4 coated with a preceramic film containing a fine dispersion of silicon and a thin layer of germanium powder has been investigated to determine the effect of the thickness of the germanium film.,Bonding of silicon nitride using preceramic polymer and germanium powders for potential fuel cell applications,10.1179/174367605X46803
3,3773,The maximum service temperature is not determined by the melting point of the germanium since the germanium forms a higher melting point solid solution with the silicon in the film.,Bonding of silicon nitride using preceramic polymer and germanium powders for potential fuel cell applications,10.1179/174367605X46803
4,3773,"Control of the thickness of the germanium film is found to be critical as a thicker layers results in lower strength bonds owing to differences in thermal expansion, and the maximum service temperature is lower owing to the lower liquidus temperature of the leaner Ge-Si solid solution.",Bonding of silicon nitride using preceramic polymer and germanium powders for potential fuel cell applications,10.1179/174367605X46803
5,3773,"This technique has potential applications in fuel cells as a result of the small differences in thermal expansion coefficients and firing shrinkage in fuel cell materials, thus allowing successful fabrication and joining of monolithic solid oxide fuel cells (MSOFCs) with few defects.",Bonding of silicon nitride using preceramic polymer and germanium powders for potential fuel cell applications,10.1179/174367605X46803
