1,16285,3D microstructure-performance relationships in Ni-YSZ anodes for electrolyte-supported cells are investigated in terms of the correlation between the triple phase boundary (TPB) length and polarization resistance (R-pol).,3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
2,16285,Three different Ni-YSZ anodes of varying microstructure are subjected to eight reduction-oxidation (redox) cycles at 950 degrees C.,3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
3,16285,In general the TPB lengths correlate with anode performance.,3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
4,16285,"However, the quantitative results also show that there is no simplistic relationship between TPB and R-pol.",3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
5,16285,The degradation mechanism strongly depends on the initial microstructure.,3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
6,16285,Finer microstructures exhibit lower degradation rates of TPB and R-pol.,3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
7,16285,"In fine microstructures, TPB loss is found to be due to Ni coarsening, while in coarse microstructures reduction of active TPB results mainly from loss of YSZ percolation.",3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
8,16285,The latter is attributed to weak bottlenecks associated with lower sintering activity of the coarse YSZ.,3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
9,16285,The coarse anode suffers from complete loss of YSZ connectivity and associated drop of TPBactive by 93%.,3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
10,16285,"Surprisingly, this severe microstructure degradation did not lead to electrochemical failure.",3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
11,16285,Mechanistic scenarios are discussed for different anode microstructures.,3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
12,16285,"These scenarios are based on a model for coupled charge transfer and transport, which allows using TPB and effective properties as input.",3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
13,16285,"The mechanistic scenarios describe the microstructure influence on current distributions, which explains the observed complex relationship between TPB lengths and anode performances.",3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
14,16285,The observed loss of YSZ percolation in the coarse anode is not detrimental because the electrochemical activity is concentrated in a narrow active layer.,3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
15,16285,"The anode performance can be predicted reliably if the volume-averaged properties (TPBactive, effective ionic conductivity) are corrected for the so-called short-range effect, which is particularly important in cases with a narrow active layer.",3D Microstructure Effects in Ni-YSZ Anodes: Influence of TPB Lengths on the Electrochemical Performance,10.3390/ma8105370
