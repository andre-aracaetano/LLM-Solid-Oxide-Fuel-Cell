1,16371,"In an effort to boost the power densities of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at intermediate temperatures (600-750 degrees C), novel powder synthesis methods have been studied with the goal of increasing the three-phase boundary region of the anode.",Superior power density solid oxide fuel cells by enlarging the three-phase boundary region of a NiO-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite anode through optimized surface structure,10.1039/c3cp52679h
2,16371,"Porous anodes composed of Ni and Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC) cermet are commonly studied in SOFCs, but the cell performance is limited by their dependency on the three-phase boundaries at which the electrochemical oxidation reaction takes place.",Superior power density solid oxide fuel cells by enlarging the three-phase boundary region of a NiO-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite anode through optimized surface structure,10.1039/c3cp52679h
3,16371,This paper presents a remarkable improvement in the electrochemical performance through a significant enlargement of the three-phase boundary region by an optimization of the surface structure.,Superior power density solid oxide fuel cells by enlarging the three-phase boundary region of a NiO-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite anode through optimized surface structure,10.1039/c3cp52679h
4,16371,"The strategy starts with the premise that the oxide powder particles in aqueous solution carry a positive or negative electrical charge depending upon the pH of the solution, and the charge can be exploited to attach chelated metal ions to their surface, extending the three-phase boundary region.",Superior power density solid oxide fuel cells by enlarging the three-phase boundary region of a NiO-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite anode through optimized surface structure,10.1039/c3cp52679h
5,16371,"This modified NiO-GDC composite powder resulted in not only an extension of both electronic and O2- ionic conduction pathways, but also a suppression of grain growth in the anode during the process of cell fabrication.",Superior power density solid oxide fuel cells by enlarging the three-phase boundary region of a NiO-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite anode through optimized surface structure,10.1039/c3cp52679h
6,16371,"As the final outcome, the modified Ni-GDC anode-supported cells show far superior power densities (1.85 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and 0.83 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C) in H-2 compared to the conventional Ni-GDC anode-supported cells (0.61 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and 0.26 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C).",Superior power density solid oxide fuel cells by enlarging the three-phase boundary region of a NiO-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite anode through optimized surface structure,10.1039/c3cp52679h
