1,9033,A composite used as cathode current collecting material to replace noble metal for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells is fabricated and its properties are characterized.,Composite contacting interlayer as cathode current collector for anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.042
2,9033,Current collecting for the cathode is achieved by forming a composite contacting interlayer to bind the cathode and interconnect together.,Composite contacting interlayer as cathode current collector for anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.042
3,9033,"The results indicate that, with the existence of the glass, the change of the conductivity may be attributed to the glass used as sintering-aid to raise the relative density of the sample calcined at 1000 degrees C for 1 h. The composite contacting interlayer can well adhere to the contact surface and the area specific resistances is 0.024 Omega cm(2) for composite coated interconnect.",Composite contacting interlayer as cathode current collector for anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.042
4,9033,The cell stack with composite contacting interlayer as cathode current collector shows more stable performance after ten thermal cycling tests from 30 to 800 degrees C.
