2,21049,Crucial to the developments of the applications is the discovery of a class of oxide-ion conductors.,"Ruddlesden-Popper Oxychlorides Ba3Y2O5Cl2, Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, and Sr2ScO3Cl: First Examples of Oxide-Ion-Conducting Oxychlorides",10.1021/acsaem.1c02828
3,21049,"Some Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) oxychlorides are expected to show high oxide-ion conductivity, because they have larger free and lattice volumes than RP oxides, leading to low activation energies.","Ruddlesden-Popper Oxychlorides Ba3Y2O5Cl2, Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, and Sr2ScO3Cl: First Examples of Oxide-Ion-Conducting Oxychlorides",10.1021/acsaem.1c02828

5,21049,Rietveld analyses of X-ray powder diffraction data indicate that Ba3Y2O5Cl2 and Sr3Sc2O5Cl2 are tetragonal I4/mmm n = 2 RP phases and that Sr2ScO3Cl is a tetragonal P4/nmm n = 1 RP phase.,"Ruddlesden-Popper Oxychlorides Ba3Y2O5Cl2, Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, and Sr2ScO3Cl: First Examples of Oxide-Ion-Conducting Oxychlorides",10.1021/acsaem.1c02828
6,21049,"The predominant conducting species in Ba3Y2O5Cl2, Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, and Sr2ScO3Cl is strongly suggested to be the oxide ion by (i) direct-current (DC) polarization measurements, (ii) electrolyte domains observed in the oxygen partial pressure dependence of DC electrical conductivities at constant temperatures, and (iii) wide optical band gaps.","Ruddlesden-Popper Oxychlorides Ba3Y2O5Cl2, Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, and Sr2ScO3Cl: First Examples of Oxide-Ion-Conducting Oxychlorides",10.1021/acsaem.1c02828
7,21049,"DFT calculations of Ba3Y2O5Cl2 show a lower energy barrier for oxide-ion migration than that for chloride-ion migration, which supports the oxide-ion conduction.","Ruddlesden-Popper Oxychlorides Ba3Y2O5Cl2, Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, and Sr2ScO3Cl: First Examples of Oxide-Ion-Conducting Oxychlorides",10.1021/acsaem.1c02828
8,21049,The DFT results indicate that oxide ions in Ba3Y2O5Cl2 two-dimensionally migrate mainly through equatorial oxygen O1 sites along the O1-O1 edge of the YO5 square pyramid.,"Ruddlesden-Popper Oxychlorides Ba3Y2O5Cl2, Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, and Sr2ScO3Cl: First Examples of Oxide-Ion-Conducting Oxychlorides",10.1021/acsaem.1c02828
9,21049,"The oxide-ion conductivity of Ba3Y2O5Cl2 is considerably higher than that of Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, mainly due to a lower activation energy for conductivity, which can be ascribed to the larger free and lattice volumes of Ba3Y2O5Cl2.","Ruddlesden-Popper Oxychlorides Ba3Y2O5Cl2, Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, and Sr2ScO3Cl: First Examples of Oxide-Ion-Conducting Oxychlorides",10.1021/acsaem.1c02828
10,21049,The DFT energy barrier for oxide-ion migration and experimental activation energy for bulk conductivity in Ba3Y2O5Cl2 are as low as those of a leading oxide-ion conductor La(0.9)Sr(0.1)Ga(0.9)5Mg(0.05)O(3-delta).,"Ruddlesden-Popper Oxychlorides Ba3Y2O5Cl2, Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, and Sr2ScO3Cl: First Examples of Oxide-Ion-Conducting Oxychlorides",10.1021/acsaem.1c02828
11,21049,"Thus, the present work suggests that RP oxychlorides are a class of potential oxide-ion conductors.","Ruddlesden-Popper Oxychlorides Ba3Y2O5Cl2, Sr3Sc2O5Cl2, and Sr2ScO3Cl: First Examples of Oxide-Ion-Conducting Oxychlorides",10.1021/acsaem.1c02828
