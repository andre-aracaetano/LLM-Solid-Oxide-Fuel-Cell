1,3535,"Mixed ionic and electronic conducting K2NiF4-type oxide, Nd2Ni1-xCuxO4+delta (x=0 similar to 1) powders were synthesized by solid state reaction technique and solid oxide fuel cells consisting of a Nd2Ni1-xCuxO4+delta cathode, a Ni-YSZ anode and ScSZ as an electrolyte were fabricated.",PROPERTIES OF COPPER DOPED NEODYMIUM NICKELATE OXIDE AS CATHODE MATERIAL FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1515/amm-2016-0106
2,3535,The effect of copper substitution for nickel on the electrical and electrochemical properties was examined.,PROPERTIES OF COPPER DOPED NEODYMIUM NICKELATE OXIDE AS CATHODE MATERIAL FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1515/amm-2016-0106
3,3535,Small amount of copper doping (x=0.2) resulted in the increased electrical conductivity and decreased polarization resistance.,PROPERTIES OF COPPER DOPED NEODYMIUM NICKELATE OXIDE AS CATHODE MATERIAL FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1515/amm-2016-0106
4,3535,It appears that this phenomenon was associated with the high mean valence of nickel and copper and the resulting excess oxygen (delta).,PROPERTIES OF COPPER DOPED NEODYMIUM NICKELATE OXIDE AS CATHODE MATERIAL FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1515/amm-2016-0106
5,3535,It was found that power densities of the cell with the Nd2Ni1-xCuxO4+delta (x=0.1 and 0.2) cathode were higher than that of the cell with the Nd2NiO4+delta cathode.,PROPERTIES OF COPPER DOPED NEODYMIUM NICKELATE OXIDE AS CATHODE MATERIAL FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1515/amm-2016-0106
