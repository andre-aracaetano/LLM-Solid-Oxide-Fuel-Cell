1,14966,"A revised mechanistic SOFC model is presented with two main important modifications compared to the current state-of-the-art mechanistic SOFC models: 1) current models are all developed based on the CH4 adsorption mechanism; this is one of the most critical reactions but studies have indicated that CH4 adsorbed dissociatively on nickel, which is considered in the present revised model; and 2) kinetic data in the current models are fitted, in particular those for critical reactions such as CH4 cracking, CO and CO2 surface reactions; in the present work, the activation energies for those reactions are taken from DFT calculations, while the pre-exponential factors are still fitted to experimental data.",Two-dimensional mechanistic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell model with revised detailed methane reforming mechanism,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.08.017
2,14966,The results show that carbon distribution predicted by the revised model fits better the experimental observations reported in the literature and thus the proposed revised model represents a more realistic SOFC model operating with CH4 or CO fuel gas.,Two-dimensional mechanistic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell model with revised detailed methane reforming mechanism,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.08.017
3,14966,"Furthermore, the revised model was used to investigate the distributions of gas/surface species concentration and temperature effects under humidified CH4.",Two-dimensional mechanistic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell model with revised detailed methane reforming mechanism,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.08.017
4,14966,"The results show that Ni surface is covered mainly by H(s) and CO(s) where the electrochemical reactions take place, whereas there is a very high coverage of C(s) where electrochemical reactions are absent.",Two-dimensional mechanistic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell model with revised detailed methane reforming mechanism,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.08.017
