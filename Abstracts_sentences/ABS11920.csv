6,11920,"In theory, it is possible to obtain higher efficiencies, but this requires much higher capital expenditures (additional heat exchangers, gas turbines, set of heat regeneration heat exchangers, etc.) and much higher parameters of working media in the system (1400 C, 30 bar).",Comparison of SOE/SOFC system configurations for a peak hydrogen power plant,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.067
