5,15853,"The powders calcined at 300 degrees C with a crystal size of 5.7 nm have good sinterability, and the relative density could reach above 96% after being sintered at 1450 degrees C. With the addition Of MoO3, the sintering temperature could be decreased to 1250 degrees C. Impedance spectroscopy measurement in the temperature range of 250-800 degrees C indicates that a sharp increase of conductivity is observed when a small amount of Nd2O3 is added into ceria, of which Ce0.85Nd0.15O1.925 (15NDC) shows the highest conductivity.",Grain boundary conductivity of high purity neodymium-doped ceria nanosystem with and without the doping of molybdenum oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.093
6,15853,"With the addition of a small amount Of MoO3, the grain boundary conductivity of 15NDC at 600 degrees C increases from 2.56 S m(-1) to 5.62 S m(-1).",Grain boundary conductivity of high purity neodymium-doped ceria nanosystem with and without the doping of molybdenum oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.093
