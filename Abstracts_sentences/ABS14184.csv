1,14184,Chemical and material processes occurring in high temperature environments are difficult to quantify due to a lack of experimental methods that can probe directly the species present.,High-temperature Raman spectroscopy of solid oxide fuel cell materials and processes,10.1021/jp063952l
2,14184,"In this letter, Raman spectroscopy is shown to be capable of identifying in-situ and noninvasively changes in material properties as well as the formation and disappearance of molecular species on surfaces at temperatures of 715 C. The material, yttria-stabilized zirconia or YSZ, and the molecular species, Ni/NiO and nanocrystalline graphite, factor prominently in the chemistry of solid oxide fuel cells ( SOFCs).",High-temperature Raman spectroscopy of solid oxide fuel cell materials and processes,10.1021/jp063952l
3,14184,"Experiments demonstrate the ability of Raman spectroscopy to follow reversible oxidation/reduction kinetics of Ni/NiO as well as the rate of carbon disappearance when graphite, formed in-situ, is exposed to a weakly oxidizing atmosphere.",High-temperature Raman spectroscopy of solid oxide fuel cell materials and processes,10.1021/jp063952l
4,14184,"In addition, the Raman active phonon mode of YSZ shows a temperature dependent shift that correlates closely with the expansion of the lattice parameter, thus providing a convenient internal diagnostic for identifying thermal gradients in high temperature systems.",High-temperature Raman spectroscopy of solid oxide fuel cell materials and processes,10.1021/jp063952l
5,14184,"These findings provide direct insight into processes likely to occur in operational SOFCs and motivate the use of in-situ Raman spectroscopy to follow chemical processes in these high-temperature, electrochemically active environments.",High-temperature Raman spectroscopy of solid oxide fuel cell materials and processes,10.1021/jp063952l
