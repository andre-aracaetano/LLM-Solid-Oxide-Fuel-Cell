1,14880,A dense membrane of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 on a porous cathode based on a mixed conducting La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta was fabricated via a slurry coating/co-firing process.,Fabrication and characterization of a co-fired La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode-supported Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 thin-film for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.093
2,14880,"With the purpose of matching of shrinkage between the support cathode and the supported membrane, nano-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 powder with specific surface area of 30 m(2) g(-1) was synthesized by a newly devised coprecipitation to make the low-temperature sinterable electrolyte, whereas 39 m2 g-1 nano-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 prepared from citrate method was added to the cathode to favor the shrinkage for the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta.",Fabrication and characterization of a co-fired La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode-supported Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 thin-film for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.093

4,14880,"This was followed by co-firing with NiO-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 at 1100 degrees C to form a thin, porous, and well-adherent anode.",Fabrication and characterization of a co-fired La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode-supported Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 thin-film for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.093
5,14880,"The laboratory-sized cathode-supported cell was shown to operate below 600 degrees C, and the maximum power density obtained was 35 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C, 60 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C.
