1,10818,"The ability of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with lanthanum strontium vanadate (LSV, La(0.7)Sr(0.3)VO(3))/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and LSV/gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) anodes to use a simulated coal syngas fuel stream containing H(2)S was investigated at 800 and 900 degrees C.",Comparison of LSV/YSZ and LSV/GDC SOFC Anode Performance in Coal Syngas Containing H2S,10.1149/1.3489380
2,10818,The results were compared to SOFC performance in H(2) and simulated coal syngas environments at similar temperatures.,Comparison of LSV/YSZ and LSV/GDC SOFC Anode Performance in Coal Syngas Containing H2S,10.1149/1.3489380
3,10818,"The results corroborate previous claims relating to the sulfur tolerance of LSV, as little to no decrease in performance was indicated by the voltage-current density scans or electrical impedance spectroscopy upon the injection of H(2)S into the SOFC fuel stream.",Comparison of LSV/YSZ and LSV/GDC SOFC Anode Performance in Coal Syngas Containing H2S,10.1149/1.3489380
4,10818,The LSV/GDC-based SOFCs exhibit improved performance over LSV/YSZ-based SOFCs for all test conditions.,Comparison of LSV/YSZ and LSV/GDC SOFC Anode Performance in Coal Syngas Containing H2S,10.1149/1.3489380
5,10818,"Though it was determined that the tested LSV-based SOFCs do not reach the performance appropriate for sulfur polishing applications, LSV possesses considerable sulfur tolerance in coal syngas streams containing H(2)S; this finding indicates that LSV may have promise as an additive to Ni-based SOFC anodes to improve stability in commercial coal syngas streams.",Comparison of LSV/YSZ and LSV/GDC SOFC Anode Performance in Coal Syngas Containing H2S,10.1149/1.3489380
