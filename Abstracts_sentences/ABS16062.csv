1,16062,"Current fluctuations at potentiostatically controlled point electrodes of Pt, La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 (LSM), and Ni on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) surfaces are determined at 1000 degrees C. For the oxygen reduction process on Pt electrodes, characteristic sawtooth-shaped, low-frequency fluctuations are observed.",Fluctuations at electrode-YSZ interfaces,10.1149/1.2060667
2,16062,At temperatures below 900 degrees C the fluctuations cease.,Fluctuations at electrode-YSZ interfaces,10.1149/1.2060667
3,16062,"At LSM oxygen electrodes and Ni hydrogen electrodes the fluctuations are similar in amplitude and frequency, but the characteristic shape is not observed.",Fluctuations at electrode-YSZ interfaces,10.1149/1.2060667
4,16062,"Also some spectacular, but not easily reproduced, observations on Ni electrodes in hydrogen/water atmosphere are presented for discussion.",Fluctuations at electrode-YSZ interfaces,10.1149/1.2060667
5,16062,"The origin of the observations is not known at present, but it appears likely that they are related to the activation/deactivation mechanism of solid oxide fuel cells.",Fluctuations at electrode-YSZ interfaces,10.1149/1.2060667
