5,6638,This is in line with predictions from electrowetting theory with capacitances measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and distribution of relaxation times.,Evolution of the Morphology Near Triple-Phase Boundaries in Ni-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Electrodes Upon Cathodic Polarization,10.1115/1.4046478
6,6638,"The decrease in theta(Ni)was concurrent to transition toward concave Ni/pore interfacial shapes and lower genus of the Ni phase, which suggests the pinch-off of Ni ligaments following surface diffusion-controlled Rayleigh instability.",Evolution of the Morphology Near Triple-Phase Boundaries in Ni-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Electrodes Upon Cathodic Polarization,10.1115/1.4046478
7,6638,The increase in absolute mean curvature near the electrolyte interface is a driving force for outward transport of Ni.,Evolution of the Morphology Near Triple-Phase Boundaries in Ni-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Electrodes Upon Cathodic Polarization,10.1115/1.4046478
8,6638,The decrease in theta(YSZ)further suggests that TPB lines relocate on YSZ surface features that provide higher Zener pinning force.,Evolution of the Morphology Near Triple-Phase Boundaries in Ni-Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Electrodes Upon Cathodic Polarization,10.1115/1.4046478
