1,2491,By using the finite element method two cases are treated for which inhomogeneous current distributions and their frequency dependence is of crucial importance: (i) the impedance of different microstructures is calculated and compared with the brick layer model; (ii) the interplay of current constriction at the three-phase boundary and the electrode polarization of porous gas electrodes as used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is investigated.,Inhomogeneous current distributions at grain boundaries and electrodes and their impact on the impedance,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00400-7
