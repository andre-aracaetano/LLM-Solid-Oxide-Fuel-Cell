2,10732,It was reported in a previous work that an SOFC with a proton conducting electrolyte (SOFC-H+) offers higher efficiency than an SOFC with an oxygen ion conducting electrolyte (SOFC-O2-).,Theoretical performance analysis of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells with different electrolytes,10.1016/j.cej.2006.03.001
3,10732,"However, the study was based on the same steam-to-hydrocarbon feed ratio.",Theoretical performance analysis of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells with different electrolytes,10.1016/j.cej.2006.03.001
4,10732,Our previous work demonstrated the potential benefit of the SOFC-O2- over the SOFC-H+ in terms of a lower requirement for steam in the feed.,Theoretical performance analysis of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells with different electrolytes,10.1016/j.cej.2006.03.001

6,10732,Influences of mode of operation (i.e. plug flow (PF) and well-mixed (WM)) on the performance of SOFCs were also investigated.,Theoretical performance analysis of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells with different electrolytes,10.1016/j.cej.2006.03.001
7,10732,"In the PF mode, two feeding patterns (i.e. co-current (Co) and counter-current (CC)) were considered.",Theoretical performance analysis of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells with different electrolytes,10.1016/j.cej.2006.03.001
8,10732,"The results show that theoretical SOFC efficiencies depend on the type of electrolyte, mode of operation, inlet H2O:EtOH ratio and fuel utilization.",Theoretical performance analysis of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells with different electrolytes,10.1016/j.cej.2006.03.001
9,10732,"Although it was found that the feeding pattern has an influence on EMF distribution along the cell, the average EMF is not affected.",Theoretical performance analysis of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells with different electrolytes,10.1016/j.cej.2006.03.001
10,10732,"At the best conditions for each type of SOFC, it was observed that SOFC-O2- yields a maximum efficiency at the minimum inlet H2O:EtOH ratio which is the limit for carbon formation for each value of fuel utilization.",Theoretical performance analysis of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells with different electrolytes,10.1016/j.cej.2006.03.001
11,10732,"On the other hand, in SOFC-H+, optimum inlet H2O:EtOH ratios are higher than the limit of carbon formation.",Theoretical performance analysis of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells with different electrolytes,10.1016/j.cej.2006.03.001
12,10732,"At the optimum conditions, the rank of the various SOFCs is as follows: SOFC-H+(PF) >",Theoretical performance analysis of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells with different electrolytes,10.1016/j.cej.2006.03.001
