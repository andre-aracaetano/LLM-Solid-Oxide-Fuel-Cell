2,18866,H2O side when used as interconnect for solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOEC) working at 800 degrees C. Perovskite (La1-xSrxMnO3-delta) and spinel (CO3O4) oxides coatings were applied on the surface of the ferritic steel for ageing at 800 degrees C for 3000 h. Both coatings improved the behaviour of the steel and give interesting opportunities to use the K41X steel as interconnect for hydrogen production via high temperature steam electrolysis.,Effect of coatings on long term behaviour of a commercial stainless steel for solid oxide electrolyser cell interconnect application in H2/H2O atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.058
