5,1757,The simulation results indicate that the lowest value of the total displacement of the assembly was noticed for the mSOFC stack design with an external air flow cooling (case H-E).,Simulation of thermal stresses for new designs of microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.05.164
6,1757,"In addition, the smallest axial and total stresses were recognized for the same case H-E due to uniform temperature distribution, which limits strain of the materials and prevents development of excessive thermal stresses in the mSOFC stack components.",Simulation of thermal stresses for new designs of microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.05.164
