1,10085,"In order to evaluate applicability of Ce0.6 -x;La0.4PrxO2 - delta (x = 0-0.2) fluorites for protective interlayers and electrode components for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), their thermal expansion, chemical interaction with solid electrolyte material, tolerance towards reduction and electrochemical behavior were studied.",Stability and Functional Properties of Fluorite-Like Ce0.6-xLa0.4PrxO2-δ as Electrode Components for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193520020056
2,10085,"The incorporation of praseodymium into Ce0.6La0.4O2 - delta was found to increase unit cell parameters and thermal expansion coefficients, from (13.2 +/- 0.3) x 10(-6) to (18.5 +/- 0.8) x 10(-6) K-1 at intermediate temperatures.",Stability and Functional Properties of Fluorite-Like Ce0.6-xLa0.4PrxO2-δ as Electrode Components for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193520020056
3,10085,Increasing total concentration of rare-earth cations in the fluorite-like cerium dioxide structure also correlates with decreasing thermodynamic stability under both oxidizing and reducing conditions.,Stability and Functional Properties of Fluorite-Like Ce0.6-xLa0.4PrxO2-δ as Electrode Components for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193520020056
4,10085,"As a result, high-temperature chemical interaction between the Pr-doped materials and lanthanum gallate-based solid electrolyte becomes more intensive with respect to Ce0.6La0.4O2 - delta, whilst reduction of Pr-containing solid solution may leads to segregation of a secondary phase with the C-type structure.",Stability and Functional Properties of Fluorite-Like Ce0.6-xLa0.4PrxO2-δ as Electrode Components for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193520020056
5,10085,The combination of these factors deteriorates compatibility of the interlayers with other SOFC components.,Stability and Functional Properties of Fluorite-Like Ce0.6-xLa0.4PrxO2-δ as Electrode Components for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193520020056
6,10085,"Consequently, the overpotentials of PrBaFe1.2Ni0.8O6 - delta cathodes in the electrochemical cells with (La0.9Sr0.1)(0.98)Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 - delta solid electrolyte were -42 and -143 mV in O-2 atmosphere at the current density -58 mA/cm(2) and 1073 K when the interlayers of Ce0.6La0.4O2 - delta or Ce0.5La0.4Pr0.1O2 - delta were used, respectively.",Stability and Functional Properties of Fluorite-Like Ce0.6-xLa0.4PrxO2-δ as Electrode Components for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193520020056
