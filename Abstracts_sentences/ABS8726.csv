1,8726,The electrochemical performance of solid oxide cells (SOCs) is investigated under both fuel cell and electrolyzer operations to understand their asymmetric behavior between the two operation modes.,Asymmetric behavior of solid oxide cells between fuel cell and electrolyzer operations,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.093
2,8726,The current-voltage and electrochemical impedance characteristics of a hydrogen-electrode-supported cell are experimentally analyzed.,Asymmetric behavior of solid oxide cells between fuel cell and electrolyzer operations,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.093
3,8726,"Also, a numerical model is developed to reproduce the cell performance and to understand the internal resistances of the cell.",Asymmetric behavior of solid oxide cells between fuel cell and electrolyzer operations,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.093
4,8726,Partial pressures of supplied gas and load current are varied to evaluate their effects on the cell performance.,Asymmetric behavior of solid oxide cells between fuel cell and electrolyzer operations,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.093
5,8726,The gas partial pressures of hydrogen and steam supplied to the hydrogen electrode are kept equivalent so that the cell performance can be fairly compared between the two operation modes when the same current is applied.,Asymmetric behavior of solid oxide cells between fuel cell and electrolyzer operations,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.093
6,8726,It is found that the origin of the asymmetry is mostly from the hydrogen electrode; both activation and concentration overpotentials show asymmetric behavior particularly at high current densities.,Asymmetric behavior of solid oxide cells between fuel cell and electrolyzer operations,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.093
7,8726,A numerical experiment is also conducted by deliberately changing parameters in the model.,Asymmetric behavior of solid oxide cells between fuel cell and electrolyzer operations,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.093
8,8726,Asymmetry in the activation overpotential is found to be originated from the non-identical charge-transfer coefficients in the Butler-Volmer equation and also from the non-uniform gas concentration formed in the hydrogen electrode under current-biased conditions.,Asymmetric behavior of solid oxide cells between fuel cell and electrolyzer operations,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.093
9,8726,"On the other hand, asymmetry in the concentration overpotential is associated with the non-equimolar counter diffusion of hydrogen and steam caused by the effect of Knudsen diffusion.",Asymmetric behavior of solid oxide cells between fuel cell and electrolyzer operations,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.093
10,8726,"Therefore, enhancing gas transport in the hydrogen electrode and reducing the contribution of Knudsen diffusion are effective approaches to reduce asymmetry not only in the concentration overpotential but also in the activation overpotential.",Asymmetric behavior of solid oxide cells between fuel cell and electrolyzer operations,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.093
