1,16608,An interface between the perovskite La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta (LSC-113) and the K2NiF4-type (La0.5Sr0.5)(2)CoO4-delta (LSC-214) heterostructure was recently shown to enhance oxygen surface exchange and the rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by orders of magnitude compared to either the LSC-113 or LSC-214 phase alone.,Cation interdiffusion model for enhanced oxygen kinetics at oxide heterostructure interfaces,10.1039/c2cp23033j
2,16608,"This result is of interest to develop better optimized materials for solid-state electrochemical devices, e. g. solid oxide fuel cells.",Cation interdiffusion model for enhanced oxygen kinetics at oxide heterostructure interfaces,10.1039/c2cp23033j
3,16608,"The effect has been attributed to the interface itself, rather than changes in the bulk LSC-113 or LSC-214 phases.",Cation interdiffusion model for enhanced oxygen kinetics at oxide heterostructure interfaces,10.1039/c2cp23033j
4,16608,"Using density functional theory (DFT)-based simulations, we demonstrate that there is a similar to 0.9 eV (similar to 1.3 eV) energy gain for exchanging a Sr from LSC-113(25% Sr) (LSC-113(40% Sr)) with a La from LSC-214(50% Sr).",Cation interdiffusion model for enhanced oxygen kinetics at oxide heterostructure interfaces,10.1039/c2cp23033j
5,16608,These changes in energy create a large driving force for interdiffusion across the heterostructure interface from Sr into LSC-214 and La into LSC-113.,Cation interdiffusion model for enhanced oxygen kinetics at oxide heterostructure interfaces,10.1039/c2cp23033j
6,16608,"We estimate that the Sr concentrations (in the LSC-214 phase) in a typical experimental temperature range of 500-600 degrees C and in equilibrium with LSC-113(25% Sr) and LSC-113(40% Sr), may be about 75% Sr and 90% Sr, respectively.",Cation interdiffusion model for enhanced oxygen kinetics at oxide heterostructure interfaces,10.1039/c2cp23033j
7,16608,"Based on the bulk behavior of the LSC-214 phase (Vashook et al., Solid State Ionics, 2000, 138, 99-104), an Sr enrichment from x = 0.5 to x = 0.75 in (La1-xSrx)(2)CoO4-delta is expected to enhance the oxygen vacancy concentration by 2-2.5 orders of magnitude under typical experimental conditions.",Cation interdiffusion model for enhanced oxygen kinetics at oxide heterostructure interfaces,10.1039/c2cp23033j
8,16608,An increased vacancy concentration in LSC-214 near the interface can explain most of the enhanced oxygen kinetics observed up until now in these heterostructures.,Cation interdiffusion model for enhanced oxygen kinetics at oxide heterostructure interfaces,10.1039/c2cp23033j
