4,2156,X-ray absorption spectroscopy in conjunction with an insitu assembly was used to study the fundamental redox chemistry of SMMO at 800 degrees C.,"High-Temperature, In Situ X-ray Absorption Study of Sr2MgMoO6 Solid-Oxide Fuel-Cell Anode Materials",10.1002/celc.201500122
5,2156,"The X-ray absorption spectra for the Mo K-edge exhibited changes in the reduced and oxidized bulk SMMO samples, as evident in a shift in the Mo binding energies and in the formation of oxide vacancies.","High-Temperature, In Situ X-ray Absorption Study of Sr2MgMoO6 Solid-Oxide Fuel-Cell Anode Materials",10.1002/celc.201500122
6,2156,"However, insitu measurements of the working devices revealed that the Mo oxidation state remained unchanged under various cell polarizations.","High-Temperature, In Situ X-ray Absorption Study of Sr2MgMoO6 Solid-Oxide Fuel-Cell Anode Materials",10.1002/celc.201500122
7,2156,"These findings demonstrate that SMMO, as a solid oxide fuel cell anode, has the potential to provide adequate electron conduction through multivalent Mo sites and to provide fuel tolerance through oxide vacancies built into its crystal structure.","High-Temperature, In Situ X-ray Absorption Study of Sr2MgMoO6 Solid-Oxide Fuel-Cell Anode Materials",10.1002/celc.201500122
