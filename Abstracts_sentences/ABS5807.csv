2,5807,Three-dimension (3D) microstructure evolution of the porous electrode caused by Cr deposition during the polarization test at 900 degrees C in the presence of a Fe-Cr metallic interconnect is characterized for the first time using the transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) technique.,Study on the Cr deposition and poisoning phenomenon at (La0.6Sr0.4)(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-δ electrode of solid oxide fuel cells by transmission X-ray microscopy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.112
3,5807,"The results indicate that a layer of solid Cr deposits similar to 1.7 mu m in thickness is formed on the electrode surface, significantly reducing the linear porosity to similar to 2% in the surface region from similar to 25% in the bulk, which explains the retarded gas diffusion process at the LSCF electrode after Cr deposition.",Study on the Cr deposition and poisoning phenomenon at (La0.6Sr0.4)(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-δ electrode of solid oxide fuel cells by transmission X-ray microscopy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.112
