3,8955,"Upon exposure to dry propane at 500 degrees C, the intensity of the Raman peaks corresponding to -CO3 species decreases with time, suggesting that the surface-located -CO3 groups are consumed through a reaction with deposited carbon or dry reforming of propane, which reduces the tendency of coking.",In situ Raman spectroscopic analysis of the coking resistance mechanism on SrZr0.95Y0.05O3-x surface for solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.05.079
