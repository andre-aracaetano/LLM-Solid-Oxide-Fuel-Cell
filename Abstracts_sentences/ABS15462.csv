3,15462,"For both thin films the overall oxygen reduction is still limited by the oxygen surface exchange, although an extraordinarily high activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was measured (LBC similar to 0.18 Omega cm(2)/LSC similar to 0.6 Omega cm(2) at 604 degrees C and 0.21 bar pO(2)).",The Superior Properties of La0.6Ba0.4CoO3-δ Thin Film Electrodes for Oxygen Exchange in Comparison to La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1149/2.1061606jes
4,15462,"Moreover, LBC exhibits a rather low activation energy for the ORR (1.19 +/- 0.11 eV) together with a high electronic conductivity (839 S .",The Superior Properties of La0.6Ba0.4CoO3-δ Thin Film Electrodes for Oxygen Exchange in Comparison to La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1149/2.1061606jes
