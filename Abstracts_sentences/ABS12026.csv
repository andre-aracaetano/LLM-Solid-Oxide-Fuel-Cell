1,12026,"While ceramic anodes provide a path to overcome the obstacles of the current state of the art cermet-based solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), they are limited by processing challenges, low conductivity, poor catalytic activity, and instability.",Catalyst-Exsolving Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/1945-7111/ac25a7
2,12026,"Here, we address these challenges by fabricating a ceramic-anode-supported SOFC composed of Sr2Fe0.4Ni0.8Mo0.8O6-delta (SFNM) which is highly conductive and spontaneously exsolves nano-catalysts for low temperature operation (600 degrees C).",Catalyst-Exsolving Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/1945-7111/ac25a7
3,12026,"Using a simple and scalable procedure, we manufacture these SOFCs to have 60% lower ohmic loss than their electrolyte-supported analogues and we take advantage of the in-situ catalyst exsolution to circumvent additional catalyst deposition steps.",Catalyst-Exsolving Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/1945-7111/ac25a7
4,12026,"We show that the catalyst exsolution triples the peak power density up to similar to 200 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C with H-2 fuel, which is comparable to other ceramic anode SOFCs operating at considerably higher temperatures (>700 degrees C).",Catalyst-Exsolving Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/1945-7111/ac25a7
5,12026,"Further, we discuss two major challenges facing exsolution-anode supported SOFCs, show our efforts to identify and address the root causes of such problems, and describe a potential path forward for next-generation anodes.",Catalyst-Exsolving Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/1945-7111/ac25a7
