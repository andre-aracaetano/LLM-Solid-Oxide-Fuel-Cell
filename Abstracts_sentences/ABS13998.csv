1,13998,"Using additive manufacturing (AM) technology, a fundamental material and structure innovation was proposed to significantly increase the energy efficiency, and to reduce the weight, volume and component quantity of proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cells (PEMECs).",Fully printed and integrated electrolyzer cells with additive manufacturing for high-efficiency water splitting,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.001
2,13998,"Four conventional parts (liquid/gas diffusion layer, bipolar plate, gasket, and current distributor) in a PEMEC were integrated into one multifunctional AM plate without committing to tools or molds for the first time.",Fully printed and integrated electrolyzer cells with additive manufacturing for high-efficiency water splitting,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.001
3,13998,"In addition, since the interfacial contact resistances between those parts were eliminated, the comprehensive in-situ characterizations of AM cells showed that an excellent energy efficiency of up to 86.48% was achieved at 2 A/cm(2) and 80 degrees C, and the hydrogen generation rate was increased by 61.81% compared to the conventional cell.",Fully printed and integrated electrolyzer cells with additive manufacturing for high-efficiency water splitting,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.001
4,13998,"More importantly, the highly complex inner structures of the AM integrated multifunctional plates also exhibit the potential to break limitations of conventional manufacture methods for hydrogen generation and to open a door for the development of other energy conversion devices, including fuel cells, solar cells and batteries.",Fully printed and integrated electrolyzer cells with additive manufacturing for high-efficiency water splitting,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.001
