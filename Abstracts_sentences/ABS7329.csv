2,7329,"The integrated SOFC system consists of a distillation column, an EtOH/H2O heater, an air heater, an anode preheater, a reformer, an SOFC stack and an afterburner.",Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
3,7329,Bioethanol with 5 mol% ethanol was purified in a distillation column to obtain a desired concentration necessary for SOFC operation.,Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
4,7329,The SOFC stack was operated under isothermal conditions.,Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
5,7329,The heat generated from the stack and the afterburner was supplied to the reformer and three heaters.,Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
6,7329,"The net remaining heat from the SOFC system (Q(SOFC,Net)) was then provided to the reboiler of the distillation column.",Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
7,7329,"The effects of fuel utilization and operating voltage on the net energy (Q(Net)), Which equals Q(SOFC,Net) minus the distillation energy (Q(D)), were examined.",Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
8,7329,It was found that the system could become more energy sufficient when operating at lower fuel utilization or lower voltage but at the expense of less electricity produced.,Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
9,7329,"Moreover, it was found that there were some operating conditions, which yielded Q(Net) of zero.",Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
10,7329,"At this point, the integrated system provides the maximum electrical power without requiring an additional heat source.",Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
11,7329,The effects of ethanol concentration and ethanol recovery on the electrical performance at zero Q(Net) for different fuel utilizations were investigated.,Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
12,7329,"With the appropriate operating conditions (e.g. C-EtOH = 41 %, U-f = 80% and EtOH recovery = 80%), the overall electrical efficiency and power density are 33.3% (LHV) and 0.32 W cm(-2), respectively.",Thermodynamic assessment of solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with bioethanol purification unit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.105
