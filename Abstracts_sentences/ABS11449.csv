2,11449,A novel La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.9Nb0.1Pd0.04O3-delta (LSFNP) anode material has been developed with Fe-Pd co-exsolutions for IT-SOFCs.,A Highly Efficient and Robust Perovskite Anode with Iron-Palladium Co-exsolutions for Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201800641
3,11449,Fe-0 and Pd-0 metallic nanoparticles are confirmed to exsolve on the surface of the perovskite anode during operation under a hydrogen atmosphere.,A Highly Efficient and Robust Perovskite Anode with Iron-Palladium Co-exsolutions for Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201800641
4,11449,"The introduced Pd exsolutions promote the charge-transfer process slightly and the H-2-adsorption ability of the La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-delta (LSFN) parent anode significantly, as metallic Pd is a conductor with excellent catalytic activity and an absorber of hydrogen that can absorb a large amount of H-2 by forming unstable chemical bonds.",A Highly Efficient and Robust Perovskite Anode with Iron-Palladium Co-exsolutions for Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201800641
5,11449,"A single cell with the LSFNP anode exhibits high output performance (maximum power density of 287.6mWcm(-2) at T=800 degrees C by using humidified H-2 as the fuel), excellent redox stability, and considerable coking and sulfur tolerances.",A Highly Efficient and Robust Perovskite Anode with Iron-Palladium Co-exsolutions for Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201800641
6,11449,"After the introduction of Pd exsolutions, the increase in the electrochemical performance is more significant under low H-2 concentrations and at low temperatures with a maximum power density ratio of the LSFNP anode cell/LSFN anode cell reaching 18 under 5% H-2/argon at T=650 degrees C. Pd-decorated LSFNP is a high-performance, redox-stable, coking-tolerant, and sulfur-tolerant anode material for IT-SOFCs, making Pd exsolution a reliable nanodecoration strategy to improve the low kinetics of perovskite anodes.",A Highly Efficient and Robust Perovskite Anode with Iron-Palladium Co-exsolutions for Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201800641
