5,17380,"Using tape casting and lamination techniques, planar anode-supported half cells (Ni-YSZ/YSZ) were fabricated with such doped YSZ and co-sintered at two different temperatures viz., 1175 degrees C and 1350 degrees C. Finally, single cells (dia. similar to 15 mm) were fabricated through screen printing of La(Sr)MnO3 (LSM)-YSZ based cathode active layer and LSM current collector layer and tested with hydrogen as fuel and oxygen as oxidant in the temperature range 700-800 degrees C. A reasonably good electrochemical performance (similar to 1.6 A/cm(2) at 0.7 V and 800 degrees C) is achieved for single cells when half-cell sintering temperature is 1350 degrees C. However, under identical conditions, the current density dropped below 0.2 A/cm(2) when the corresponding half-cell is sintered at 1175 degrees C.",Transition metal-doped yttria stabilized zirconia for low temperature processing of planar anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.03.056
