1,15888,The performance of a Ni-SDC anode-supported cell operating with a dry CH4 feed stream and the effectiveness of exposing the anode to H-2 as a method of removing carbon deposits are evaluated.,Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ni-SDC anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.117
2,15888,This has involved the continuous monitoring of the outlet gas composition during CH4 operation and H-2 exposure.,Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ni-SDC anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.117
3,15888,A degradation rate in the cell voltage (similar to 1.33 mV h(-1)) is observed during 100 h operation with dry CH4.,Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ni-SDC anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.117
4,15888,Carbon is detected in the Ni-SDC anode after the stability test but only in the portion of the anode closest to the fuel channel.,Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ni-SDC anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.117
5,15888,"No carbon is detected at the electrolyte-anode interface, which is the likely reason that the cell performance remains relatively stable.",Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ni-SDC anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.117
6,15888,The information obtained from SEM and gas outlet composition analyses can be explained by a process whereby most of the CH4 that reacts decomposes into H-2 and C in the Ni-SDC anode near the fuel channel.,Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ni-SDC anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.117
7,15888,"H-2 then makes its way to the anode-electrolyte interface where it is electrochemically oxidized to H2O which can also react with any C that may have formed, leaving behind C primarily at the fuel channel.",Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ni-SDC anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.117
8,15888,"When an aged cell is exposed to H-2, carbon-containing gases (CO, CH4 and CO2) are released, indicating that some carbon has been removed from the anode.",Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ni-SDC anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.117
9,15888,Examination of the anode after the test shows that some carbon still remains after this treatment.,Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ni-SDC anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.117
