1,1748,"Interest in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) stems from their higher efficiencies and lower levels of emitted pollutants, compared to traditional power production methods.",Advances in the development of metallic interconnects of SOFC cells,10.3989/cyv.252013
2,1748,"Interconnects are a critical part in SOFC stacks, which connect cells in series electrically, and also separate air or oxygen at the cathode side from fuel at the anode side.",Advances in the development of metallic interconnects of SOFC cells,10.3989/cyv.252013
3,1748,"Therefore, the requirements of interconnects are the most demanding, i.e., to maintain high electrical conductivity, good stability in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres, and close thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) match and good compatibility with other SOFC ceramic components.",Advances in the development of metallic interconnects of SOFC cells,10.3989/cyv.252013
