1,5490,Anode catalysts comprising MoS2 and composite metal sulfides have been investigated for electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen sulfide in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) at temperatures up to 850 degreesC. All catalysts exhibited good electrical conductivity and catalytic activity at all temperatures.,Use of metal sulfides as anode catalysts in H2S-Air SOFCs,10.1149/1.1583715
2,5490,"MoS2 and composite catalysts were found to be more active than Pt, an established catalyst for high-temperature H2S-air fuel cells at 650-830 degreesC.",Use of metal sulfides as anode catalysts in H2S-Air SOFCs,10.1149/1.1583715
3,5490,"However, MoS2 itself sublimes above 450 degreesC.",Use of metal sulfides as anode catalysts in H2S-Air SOFCs,10.1149/1.1583715
4,5490,"In contrast, composite catalysts (M-Mo-S) derived from a mixture of sulfides of Mo and other transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) have been shown to be stable and effective for electrochemical conversion of H2S in SOFCs up to 850 degreesC. Electrical contact is poor between platinum current collecting layers and metal sulfide anode catalysts.",Use of metal sulfides as anode catalysts in H2S-Air SOFCs,10.1149/1.1583715
5,5490,"This problem has been overcome by mechanically mixing conductive Ag powder into the anode layer, instead of applying a thin layer of platinum to the anode.",Use of metal sulfides as anode catalysts in H2S-Air SOFCs,10.1149/1.1583715
