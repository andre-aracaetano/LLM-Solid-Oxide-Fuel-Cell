1,19281,"A combination of in situ analyses, including measurement of both electrical resistance and volumetric expansion, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to elucidate the deactivation process of a nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet (60 wt % NiO-YSZ) upon exposure to methane at 750 degrees C.",In Situ Analyses of Carbon Dissolution into Ni-YSZ Anode Materials,10.1021/jp3035693
2,19281,"In conjunction with the aforementioned in situ techniques, a number of ex situ analyses, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy, revealed that carbon deposition initially occurred at the Ni centers, followed by carbon dissolution into the Ni-YSZ cermet after an induction period of 200 mm, which then led to three-dimensional expansion.",In Situ Analyses of Carbon Dissolution into Ni-YSZ Anode Materials,10.1021/jp3035693
3,19281,The structural change of the Ni-based cermet induced increases in electrical resistance of the material.,In Situ Analyses of Carbon Dissolution into Ni-YSZ Anode Materials,10.1021/jp3035693
4,19281,"The increased electrical resistance likely originated from the breakage of the Ni-Ni conducting network as well as from the formation of microscopic cracks within the Ni-YSZ material, resulting from the observed process of carbon dissolution.",In Situ Analyses of Carbon Dissolution into Ni-YSZ Anode Materials,10.1021/jp3035693
5,19281,"Moreover, a combination of TGA involving measurements of electrical resistance was demonstrated to be useful for determining amounts of carbon deposits critical for carbon dissolution.",In Situ Analyses of Carbon Dissolution into Ni-YSZ Anode Materials,10.1021/jp3035693
6,19281,"These results strongly suggest that changes in electrical resistance can be utilized to monitor the extent of carbon dissolution into the Ni-YSZ catalysts in situ, which would be helpful for the development of an efficient curing system for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",In Situ Analyses of Carbon Dissolution into Ni-YSZ Anode Materials,10.1021/jp3035693
