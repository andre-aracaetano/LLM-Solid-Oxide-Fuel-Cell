3,15091,"Although electrical conductivity is reduced with the introduction of SDC content, the electrical conductivities of all the composite cathodes are still above 100 S cm(-1) at 300-850 degrees C. Thermal expansion result shows that the increase in SDC content greatly reduces thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) and the TEC for the LSCSb-50SDC cathode attains as low as 13.1 x 10(-6) K-1 at 30-900 degrees C. Polarization resistance (R-p) decreases monotonously with increasing SDC content, and the LSCSb-50SDC cathode shows the lowest polarization with the R-p of 0.086 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C.",Improved thermal expansion and electrochemical performance of La0.4Sr0.6Co0.9Sb0.1O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2019.03.023
