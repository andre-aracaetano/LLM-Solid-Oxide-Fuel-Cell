1,14825,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using Pd metal as the anode were fabricated for detection of CO in a flowing mixture of 0-4000 ppm CO, 50% H-2, 10% CO2 and 6% H2O vapor between 300 and 400 degreesC. When 20 mol% Sm3+-doped CeO2 (SDC) was used as the electrolyte, the Pd anode was subjected to a large and reversible change in the anodic-reaction resistance with the CO concentration.",Solid oxide fuel cells that enable the detection of CO in reformed gases,10.1016/S0925-4005(02)00068-0
2,14825,This behavior brought about an almost linear relationship between the electromotive force (EMF) generated from the cell or the short-circuit current through the cell and the logarithm of the CO concentration.,Solid oxide fuel cells that enable the detection of CO in reformed gases,10.1016/S0925-4005(02)00068-0
3,14825,"In both signals, the minimum detectable CO concentration was 50 ppm, and the 90% response and 90% recovery times were about 60 s.",Solid oxide fuel cells that enable the detection of CO in reformed gases,10.1016/S0925-4005(02)00068-0
4,14825,"However, the EMF of the cell at a CO concentration of 0 ppm significantly deviated from the theoretical value, which made it difficult to obtain reproducible data.",Solid oxide fuel cells that enable the detection of CO in reformed gases,10.1016/S0925-4005(02)00068-0
5,14825,"In addition, the current signal of a few muA at a CO concentration of 4000 ppm was not large enough to monitor the CO concentration exactly.",Solid oxide fuel cells that enable the detection of CO in reformed gases,10.1016/S0925-4005(02)00068-0
6,14825,The improvement of these problems could be achieved by using 25 mol% Y3+-doped BaCeO3 (BCY25) with higher ionic conduction as the electrolyte: the EMF of the cell at a CO concentration of 0 ppm was near the theoretical value; the current signal reached 66 muA at a CO concentration of 4000 ppm.,Solid oxide fuel cells that enable the detection of CO in reformed gases,10.1016/S0925-4005(02)00068-0
