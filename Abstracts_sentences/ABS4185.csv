1,4185,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are highly efficient in terms of converting hydrogen's chemical energy into electrical energy through electrochemical reactions and for generating power in the range of several kW to several tens of kW. A variable flow ejector equipped with an adjustable recirculating flow rate mechanism was designed for this investigation.,Evaluation of a variable flow ejector for anode gas circulation in a 50-kW class SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.039
