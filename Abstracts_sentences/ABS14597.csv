2,14597,"In this work, we aim to identify the influence of Lithium/Natrium binaries (Li/Na)(2) carbonates addition on Lanthanum Strontium Carbonate Ferrite-Samarium-Doped Ceria (LSCF-SDC) composite cathode on the phase and microstructural stability under long-term durability of 1000 h. Three different binaries (Li/Na)(2 )carbonate of 67:33, 62:38, and 53:47 mot% were incorporated into LSCF-SDC via high energy ball milling method The phase and microstructural stability as a function of operating temperature (400 and 600 degrees C) were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM).",Effects of Binary (Lithium/Natrium)2 Carbonates on the Phase and Microstructural Stability of Lscf-Sdc for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.17576/jsm-2020-4912-27

6,14597,Qualitative results show that the cathode morphology exhibits a slight increment on the particle size after the ageing process at 1000 h. All cathodes prepared at various binary carbonate ratio still maintain their porosity values between 26 and 32% after long-term stability test.,Effects of Binary (Lithium/Natrium)2 Carbonates on the Phase and Microstructural Stability of Lscf-Sdc for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.17576/jsm-2020-4912-27
7,14597,"This ,finding has yielded a smaller area specific resistance of 0.66 Omega.cm(2) at 600 degrees C. Therefore, incorporating binary (Li/Na)(2) carbonate in LSCF-SDC shows a good combination when insignificant changes observed after long-term stability test of 1000 h.",Effects of Binary (Lithium/Natrium)2 Carbonates on the Phase and Microstructural Stability of Lscf-Sdc for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.17576/jsm-2020-4912-27
