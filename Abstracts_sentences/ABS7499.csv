1,7499,A low pressure injection molding (LPIM) technique is successfully developed to fabricate porous NiO-YSZ anode substrates for cone-shaped tubular anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,A novel low-pressure injection molding technique for fabricating anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.079
2,7499,The porosity and microstructure of the anode samples prepared with different amount of pore formers are investigated through the Archimedes method and SEM analysis.,A novel low-pressure injection molding technique for fabricating anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.079
3,7499,"Experimental results show that with 15 wt.% paraffin as plasticizer, porosity of the NiO-YSZ substrates sintered at 1400 C is proportional to the amount of graphite as pore former, and proper porosities can be obtained with or without 5 wt.% graphite.",A novel low-pressure injection molding technique for fabricating anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.079
4,7499,NiO-YSZ/YSZ/LSM-YSZ single cells are assembled and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the LPIM technique.,A novel low-pressure injection molding technique for fabricating anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.079
5,7499,"At 800 C, with moist hydrogen (75 ml min(-1)) as fuel and ambient air as oxidant, the cell with the anode substrate fabricated with 5 wt.% pore former shows a maximum power density of 531 mW cm(-2), while the cell without any pore former, 491 mW cm-2.",A novel low-pressure injection molding technique for fabricating anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.079
6,7499,"Two of the single cells (without graphite) are applied to assemble a two-cell-stack which gives an open circuit voltage of 1.75 V and a maximum output power of 5.32W, at operating temperature of 800 C.
