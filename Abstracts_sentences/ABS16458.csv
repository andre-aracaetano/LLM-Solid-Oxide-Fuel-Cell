1,16458,The mechanical strength of ceramic multilayers for use in solid oxide fuel cell stacks was examined.,Relationship between strength and failure mode of ceramic multilayers,10.1023/A:1004429829323
2,16458,"The multilayers consist of a substrate, made of yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ), with a NiO/YSZ composite coating on both faces.",Relationship between strength and failure mode of ceramic multilayers,10.1023/A:1004429829323
3,16458,"Under some processing conditions the mechanical strength of the multilayers was similar to that of pure YSZ, while a much lower strength was found for other processing conditions, inspections of the fracture surfaces revealed markedly different appearances, suggesting that a transition in failure mode had occurred.",Relationship between strength and failure mode of ceramic multilayers,10.1023/A:1004429829323
4,16458,"Fracture mechanics models for thin films on substrates were used to interpret the observed fracture modes, providing insight to the underlying failure mechanisms.",Relationship between strength and failure mode of ceramic multilayers,10.1023/A:1004429829323
