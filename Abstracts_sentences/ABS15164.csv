1,15164,"In this work, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on different electrolytes, i.e., the yttriastabilized zirconia (YSZ) and the samaria-doped ceria (SDC), were investigated to study their performances at low-temperature operation.",Electrochemical performance assessment of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with YSZ-based and SDC-based electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.173
2,15164,The predicted performance of both SOFCs was validated with the experimental results.,Electrochemical performance assessment of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with YSZ-based and SDC-based electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.173
3,15164,"The verified models were implemented to study the impact of operating conditions, i.e., cell temperature, pressure, thicknesses of cathode, anode, and electrolyte, on their performances.",Electrochemical performance assessment of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with YSZ-based and SDC-based electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.173
4,15164,"The decrease in the operating temperature from intermediate range (800-900 degrees C) to low range (550-650) degrees C has a considerable effect on the performance of the YSZ-based SOFC as conventional type, which dropped from 0.67-1.40 W/cm(2) to 0.027-0.13 W/cm(2).",Electrochemical performance assessment of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with YSZ-based and SDC-based electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.173
5,15164,"Under the low operating temperature range, the performance of SDC-based SOFC was superior to that of the YSZ-based SOFC, due to the lower ohmic loss.",Electrochemical performance assessment of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with YSZ-based and SDC-based electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.173
6,15164,"Nevertheless, the SDC-based SOFC has higher concentration overpotentials than the YSZ-based SOFC.",Electrochemical performance assessment of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with YSZ-based and SDC-based electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.173
7,15164,The concentration overpotentials of the SDC-based SOFC can be reduced by the thinner anode and cathode thicknesses.,Electrochemical performance assessment of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell with YSZ-based and SDC-based electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.173
8,15164,"In addition, the SDC-based SOFC at low operating temperature with the pressurized operation could significantly improve its power density, about 20% at 2 bar, which was close to that of YSZ-based SOFC at intermediate temperature of 800 degrees C.
