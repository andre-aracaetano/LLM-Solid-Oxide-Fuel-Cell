1,7848,The integration of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems and micro gas turbines in a reference wastewater treatment plant is proposed.,Techno-economic assessment of biogas-fed CHP hybrid systems in a real wastewater treatment plant,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.115
2,7848,The main scope is to utilize the available biogas in a real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to feed both the SOFCs and micro gas turbines (MGTs) to produce electrical power while covering the digester thermal demand of the plant.,Techno-economic assessment of biogas-fed CHP hybrid systems in a real wastewater treatment plant,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.115
3,7848,"To do so, two cases namely SOFC-WWTP (in which the SOFC system is the only CHP unit), and SOFC-MGT-WWTP (integration of both SOFCs and microturbine systems) are proposed.",Techno-economic assessment of biogas-fed CHP hybrid systems in a real wastewater treatment plant,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.115
4,7848,Results show that use of microturbines along with the SOFC systems can increase the share of electricity covered by self-generation within the WWTP by up to 15% while keeping stable the coverage of the thermal load.,Techno-economic assessment of biogas-fed CHP hybrid systems in a real wastewater treatment plant,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.115
5,7848,"Also, the energy efficiency of the novel system (SOFC-MGT-WWTP) is calculated to be 7% more than that of the SOFC-WWTP.",Techno-economic assessment of biogas-fed CHP hybrid systems in a real wastewater treatment plant,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.115
6,7848,"Economic analysis results reveal that using microturbines, the payback time for whole the system could be reduced about 4 years.",Techno-economic assessment of biogas-fed CHP hybrid systems in a real wastewater treatment plant,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.115
7,7848,"Also, for the short term scenario, the levelized cost of electricity for the SOFC-MGT-WWTP system is found to be 0.118 $/kWh which is about 12% less than that for the SOFC-WWTP system.",Techno-economic assessment of biogas-fed CHP hybrid systems in a real wastewater treatment plant,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.115
8,7848,"However, for the long term scenario, the difference becomes remarkably less.",Techno-economic assessment of biogas-fed CHP hybrid systems in a real wastewater treatment plant,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.115
