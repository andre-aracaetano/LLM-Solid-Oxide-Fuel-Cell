5,16513,"In many VAN systems made by the inclusion of an oxygen ionic insulator, it is found that ions flow through the vertical heterointerfaces.",Research Update: Fast and tunable nanoionics in vertically aligned nanostructured films,10.1063/1.4978550
6,16513,The observation is consistent with structural incompatibility at the vertical heteroepitaxial interfaces resulting in oxygen deficiency in one of the phases and hence to oxygen ion conducting pathways.,Research Update: Fast and tunable nanoionics in vertically aligned nanostructured films,10.1063/1.4978550
