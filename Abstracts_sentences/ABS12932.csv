1,12932,"Thermal radiation is likely to play an important role in the calculation of the energy balance in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), due to their high operating temperatures (600 degrees-1000 degrees C).",High-Temperature Radiative Behavior of an La2NiO4+δ Cathodic Layer for SOFCs (up to 900°C): Influence of δ and Texture,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04446.x
2,12932,"However, the majority of previous studies dealing with this issue have used room-temperature radiative data for determining the overall heat transfer process within a given cell, which could lead to an inexact appreciation of the role played by the thermal radiation.",High-Temperature Radiative Behavior of an La2NiO4+δ Cathodic Layer for SOFCs (up to 900°C): Influence of δ and Texture,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04446.x
3,12932,"Consequently, the thermal field within the cell could also be incorrectly determined; however, accurate knowledge of the thermal field is important in order to understand the mechanical behavior of SOFCs.",High-Temperature Radiative Behavior of an La2NiO4+δ Cathodic Layer for SOFCs (up to 900°C): Influence of δ and Texture,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04446.x
4,12932,"Several parameters, including chemical composition, texture, thickness, and of course operating temperature, have a large effect on the radiative properties of a given compound.",High-Temperature Radiative Behavior of an La2NiO4+δ Cathodic Layer for SOFCs (up to 900°C): Influence of δ and Texture,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04446.x
5,12932,"As a first step to elucidate the temperature-dependent behavior of SOFCs, we deposited an La2NiO4+delta cathodic layer on a planar ZrO2-8% Y2O3 electrolyte-supported SOFC and investigated its radiative properties using high-temperature infrared emissivity spectroscopy (100 degrees-900 degrees C).",High-Temperature Radiative Behavior of an La2NiO4+δ Cathodic Layer for SOFCs (up to 900°C): Influence of δ and Texture,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04446.x
6,12932,"Additional X-ray diffraction, thermo-gravimetric analysis, and environmental scanning electron microscopy measurements were also made to study the role played by both the chemical composition and texture on the radiative properties of the cell.",High-Temperature Radiative Behavior of an La2NiO4+δ Cathodic Layer for SOFCs (up to 900°C): Influence of δ and Texture,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04446.x
