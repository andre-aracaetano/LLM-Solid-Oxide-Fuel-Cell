1,7937,This paper aims at performing a parametric analysis of the thermoeconomics costs associated with an integrated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system with a vapour-adsorption refrigeration (VAR) system.,Parametric analysis of the exergoeconomic variables of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) coupled with a vapour-adsorption refrigeration system (VARS),10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.040
2,7937,Particular emphasis is put on the cost of the SOFC's product (i.e. the electrical energy) and on the cost of the VAR's product (i.e. the cooling effect).,Parametric analysis of the exergoeconomic variables of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) coupled with a vapour-adsorption refrigeration system (VARS),10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.040
3,7937,"In order to do so, an hybrid system simulator was constructed to determine the influence of SOFC operating parameters: current density, inlet flow temperature, fuel utilization factor and steam to carbon ratio, on the exergy-based costs of the products as well as on the exergoeconomic factors.",Parametric analysis of the exergoeconomic variables of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) coupled with a vapour-adsorption refrigeration system (VARS),10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.040
