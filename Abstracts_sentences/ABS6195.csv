2,6195,"Recently, some studies have been reported to produce a component layer of solid oxide fuel cell using a Roll-to-Roll (R2R) system because of its characteristics of the cost-effective and eco-friendly advantages.",Morphology Engineering for Compact Electrolyte Layer of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Roll-to-Roll Eco-production,10.1007/s40684-022-00425-z
3,6195,"However, the brittleness and low density of GDC prevent it from being mass-produced via the R2R continuous process.",Morphology Engineering for Compact Electrolyte Layer of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Roll-to-Roll Eco-production,10.1007/s40684-022-00425-z
4,6195,"Therefore, we attempted to improve the density of GDC-based multi-electrolyte layers through an optimized R2R calendaring process.",Morphology Engineering for Compact Electrolyte Layer of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Roll-to-Roll Eco-production,10.1007/s40684-022-00425-z
5,6195,The finite element method was employed to determine suitable materials for the calendering rolls and the maximum calendering pressure that would reduce the thickness and porosity of the coated electrolyte layer without producing cracks in the layer.,Morphology Engineering for Compact Electrolyte Layer of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Roll-to-Roll Eco-production,10.1007/s40684-022-00425-z
6,6195,The effect of the number of calendering processes on the thickness and porosity of the electrolyte layers was examined as well.,Morphology Engineering for Compact Electrolyte Layer of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Roll-to-Roll Eco-production,10.1007/s40684-022-00425-z
7,6195,"Silicon and steel were observed to be best-suited as the materials for the top and bottom rolls, respectively.",Morphology Engineering for Compact Electrolyte Layer of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Roll-to-Roll Eco-production,10.1007/s40684-022-00425-z
8,6195,"Moreover, the maximum permissible calendering pressure was determined to be 15 MPa, while the ideal number of calendering processes was found to be 5.",Morphology Engineering for Compact Electrolyte Layer of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Roll-to-Roll Eco-production,10.1007/s40684-022-00425-z
