3,1343,The material was characterized and examined as a cathode for the intermediate temperature (400 to 650C) solid oxide fuel cell (ITSOFC) applications.,Cost-effective perovskite for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFC),
4,1343,ITSOFCs using this cost-effective perovskite as a cathode displayed an excellent cell performance: between 300 and 1500 mA/cm(-2) (100 to 500 mWcm(-2)) for temperatures ranging from 450 to 600 degreesC. The role of AgO as additive to the perovskite has also showed an enhancement in the fuel cell performance.,Cost-effective perovskite for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFC),
