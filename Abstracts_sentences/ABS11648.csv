8,11648,The best peak performance of 0.924 W/cm2 is obtained from the cell with tape cast electrolyte sintered at 1400 degrees C. SEM investigations and measured open circuit potentials reveal that almost fully dense electrolyte layer can be obtained with a tape cast electrolyte particularly sintered at temperatures higher than 1350 degrees C. Impedance analyses indicate that the main reason behind the significantly higher performances is due to not only increased electrolyte density but a decrease in the interface resistance of the anode functional and electrolyte layer is also responsible.,Comparison of electrolyte fabrication techniques on the performance of anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.01.097
