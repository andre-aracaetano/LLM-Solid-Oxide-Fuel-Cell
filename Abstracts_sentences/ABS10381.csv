3,10381,In this contribution the electrochemical performance of agglomerated and dense Pt thin film electrodes on yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) is correlated with their microstructural characteristics.,Microscopic and Nanoscopic Three-Phase-Boundaries of Platinum Thin-Film Electrodes on YSZ Electrolyte,10.1002/adfm.201001729
4,10381,"Besides the microscopically measurable triple-phase-boundary (tpb) where Pt, YSZ and air are in contact, a considerable contribution of nanoscopic tpbs to the electrode conductivity resulting from oxygen permeable grain boundaries is identified.",Microscopic and Nanoscopic Three-Phase-Boundaries of Platinum Thin-Film Electrodes on YSZ Electrolyte,10.1002/adfm.201001729
5,10381,It is demonstrated that dense Pt thin films are excellent electrodes provided their grain size and thickness are in the nanometer range.,Microscopic and Nanoscopic Three-Phase-Boundaries of Platinum Thin-Film Electrodes on YSZ Electrolyte,10.1002/adfm.201001729
6,10381,The results disprove the prevailing idea that the performance of Pt thin film electrodes results from microscopic and geometrically measurable tpbs only.,Microscopic and Nanoscopic Three-Phase-Boundaries of Platinum Thin-Film Electrodes on YSZ Electrolyte,10.1002/adfm.201001729
