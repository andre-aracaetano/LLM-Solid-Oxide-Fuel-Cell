1,17331,Thermal cyclic tests in air were performed for Crofer22APU/glass-ceramic/Anode-Supported-Electrolyte (ASE) joined samples for a total period of 3000 h. Different cooling rates from the SOFC operating temperature of 800 degrees C to room temperature were carried out.,Thermal cycling of Crofer22APU-sealant-anode supported electrolyte joined structures for planar SOFCs up to 3000 h,10.1016/j.matlet.2013.08.025
2,17331,Large and elongated voids were observed to develop just below the Cr2O3/Cr-Mn spinet layer of the Crofer22APU.,Thermal cycling of Crofer22APU-sealant-anode supported electrolyte joined structures for planar SOFCs up to 3000 h,10.1016/j.matlet.2013.08.025
3,17331,Diffusion of Al to the areas just below the protective oxide layer led to formation of Al2O3 on the surface of the voids.,Thermal cycling of Crofer22APU-sealant-anode supported electrolyte joined structures for planar SOFCs up to 3000 h,10.1016/j.matlet.2013.08.025
4,17331,The emergence of CaAl2Si2O8 as a new phase in the glass-ceramic was attributed to the diffusion of Ca away from the interfacial areas thus decreasing the proportion of Ca to Al and Si.,Thermal cycling of Crofer22APU-sealant-anode supported electrolyte joined structures for planar SOFCs up to 3000 h,10.1016/j.matlet.2013.08.025
5,17331,The glass-ceramic sealant maintained good adherence with the Crofer22APU and the ASE without presence of any crack even after 3000 h of exposure.,Thermal cycling of Crofer22APU-sealant-anode supported electrolyte joined structures for planar SOFCs up to 3000 h,10.1016/j.matlet.2013.08.025
