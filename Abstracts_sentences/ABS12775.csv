1,12775,"In the present study, chemical equilibrium FactSage computations with an actual flammable off-gas have been firstly done for designing a prototype O-2 reducing apparatus to convert the off-gas into safe SOFC fuel and determining a thermal pretreating temperature range.",Oxygen reduction from flammable off-gas for solid oxide fuel cell so as to avoid anode deterioration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227449
2,12775,O-2 reducing experiments from simulated flammable off-gases as thermal pretreatments before feeding to the SOFC anode side have been carried out.,Oxygen reduction from flammable off-gas for solid oxide fuel cell so as to avoid anode deterioration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227449
3,12775,"O-2 concentration can be reduced in proportion to the Ni surface area, reaching the minimum concentration of about 0.16 vol% from its initial value of 10.2 vol% with the Ni surface areas of 562 m(2)/m(3) at 1073 K. H-2 and CO concentrations of the objective SOFC fuel constituents are close to their respective initial concentrations, due to accelerated Boudouard reactions and reverse shift reaction.",Oxygen reduction from flammable off-gas for solid oxide fuel cell so as to avoid anode deterioration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227449
4,12775,"Concentration of H-2 plus CO reached the maximum value at 537 m(2)/m(3) of Ni surface area, concretely 92.8% of H-2 plus CO is remaining in comparison with the initial simulated flammable off-gas.",Oxygen reduction from flammable off-gas for solid oxide fuel cell so as to avoid anode deterioration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227449
5,12775,Some recommended future strategies of this thermal pretreating process to convert the flammable off-gas into safe SOFC fuel are also proposed in every part through this paper so as to supply complete solutions for any global-scale problems.,Oxygen reduction from flammable off-gas for solid oxide fuel cell so as to avoid anode deterioration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227449
