3,16308,"Testing was carried out during 130 h under a load demand of 100 mA cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, followed by adding 1 ppm of D4 siloxanes to biogas rich in methane on the cell performance, and operation under the same conditions during 180 h. The electrochemical behaviour of the cell has been evaluated by IV curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and distribution of relaxation times (DRT).",Impedance analysis of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cell with nickel-tungsten-cerium anode fed with CH4-CO2 mixtures and siloxanes,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140852
