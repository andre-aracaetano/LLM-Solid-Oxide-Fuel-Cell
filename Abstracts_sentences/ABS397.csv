1,397,"Direct carbon fuel cells can efficiently convert solid carbon fuel to electricity with an almost pure CO2 exhaust stream, which can be readily collected for industry use or CO2 sequestration, and thus could have a major impact on reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.",Samaria-Doped Ceria Electrolyte Supported Direct Carbon Fuel Cell with Molten Antimony as the Anode,10.1021/ie403164c
2,397,"Here, we report a high-performance samaria-doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte supported direct carbon fuel cell based upon a solid oxide fuel cell with a molten antimony anode.",Samaria-Doped Ceria Electrolyte Supported Direct Carbon Fuel Cell with Molten Antimony as the Anode,10.1021/ie403164c
3,397,"The area specific resistances associated with the molten Sb-Sb2O3 electrode are only 0.026, 0.045, and 0.121 Omega cm(2) at 750, 700, and 650 degrees C, respectively, while the maximum power outputs can reach 327, 268, and 222 mW cm(-2) at the corresponding temperatures.",Samaria-Doped Ceria Electrolyte Supported Direct Carbon Fuel Cell with Molten Antimony as the Anode,10.1021/ie403164c
4,397,"Moreover, SDC electrolyte shows the tolerance to corrosion of molten antimony at high temperature in the period investigated.",Samaria-Doped Ceria Electrolyte Supported Direct Carbon Fuel Cell with Molten Antimony as the Anode,10.1021/ie403164c
