3,15919,The SOFC performance (electrical efficiency and power density) was determined at different biogas compositions and reforming agent:biogas ratios.,Selection of appropriate fuel processor for biogas-fuelled SOFC system,10.1016/j.cej.2007.10.007
4,15919,The SOFC performance is better when the methane content in the biogas is higher.,Selection of appropriate fuel processor for biogas-fuelled SOFC system,10.1016/j.cej.2007.10.007
5,15919,Steam is considered to be the most suitable reforming agent in this study as the steam-fed SOFC offers much higher power density than the air-fed SOFC although its electrical efficiency is slightly lower.,Selection of appropriate fuel processor for biogas-fuelled SOFC system,10.1016/j.cej.2007.10.007
