1,19226,"This paper aims to study the properties of the triple phase boundaries (TPBs) in the vicinity of the strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (cathode)/yttria-stabilized zirconia (electrolyte YSZ) interface in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), The LaMnO3+/-delta (LM) nanometric films deposited on (100)YSZ can be considered as a realistic and simple model of this half-cell.",High-temperature interfacial reactivity of LaMnO3±δ nanometric films on (100)YSZ,
2,19226,"Low pressure metal-organic chemical vapour deposition was used to elaborate these films and to control the La/Mn ratio in the range 0.8-1.3 by using La(tmhd)(3) and Mn(acac)(3) solid precursors at restricted temperature, pressure and time conditions.",High-temperature interfacial reactivity of LaMnO3±δ nanometric films on (100)YSZ,
3,19226,"The film characteristics have been studied: morphology by SEM, chemical composition by energy-dispersive x-ray emission analysis and AES/scanning Auger microscopy and crystallography by x-ray diffraction and reflection high-energy electron diffraction, The half-cell performances at high temperature can be affected both by cation diffusion into YSZ and by the formation of foreign phases.",High-temperature interfacial reactivity of LaMnO3±δ nanometric films on (100)YSZ,
4,19226,Data are presented on the interfacial reactivity as analysed by the above techniques: important changes in the YSZ morphology in the TPB regions and the formation of epitaxial Lanthanum zirconate are analysed for two La/Mn ratios (0.80 and 1.30).,High-temperature interfacial reactivity of LaMnO3±δ nanometric films on (100)YSZ,
