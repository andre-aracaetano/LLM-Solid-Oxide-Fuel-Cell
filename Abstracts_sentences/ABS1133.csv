1,1133,"In this work, a mid infrared thermography was used to study thermal behavior of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a circular shape and a diameter of 90 mm.",REAL TIME THERMAL IMAGING OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL,10.24425/amm.2019.130082
2,1133,The emissivity of the anodic surface of the fuel cell was determined to be from 0.95 to 0.46 in the temperature range 550-1200 K and the profile and temperature distribution of the anodic surface of the unloaded cell was given.,REAL TIME THERMAL IMAGING OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL,10.24425/amm.2019.130082
3,1133,The surface temperature of the cell was determined during operation and the polarity changes from open circuit voltage (OCV) to 0.0 V. It was found that the cell self-heating effect decreases with increasing temperature of the cell.,REAL TIME THERMAL IMAGING OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL,10.24425/amm.2019.130082
