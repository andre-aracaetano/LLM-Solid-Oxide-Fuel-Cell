1,8751,The lack of highly active and robust catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the intermediate temperatures significantly hinders the commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/CeO2 Heterostructured Composite Nanofibers as a Highly Active and Robust Cathode Catalyst for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b06668
2,8751,"Here, we report a novel heterostructured composite nanofiber cathode composed of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta(LSCF) and CeO2 nanoparticles, synthesized by using a coaxial electrospinning technique, which exhibits remarkably enhanced ORR activity and durability as compared to single LSCF powder and nanofibers.",La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/CeO2 Heterostructured Composite Nanofibers as a Highly Active and Robust Cathode Catalyst for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b06668
3,8751,"This cathode achieves a polarization resistance of 0.031 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, approximately 1/5 of that for the LSCF powder cathode (0.158 Omega cm(2)).",La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/CeO2 Heterostructured Composite Nanofibers as a Highly Active and Robust Cathode Catalyst for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b06668
4,8751,Such enhancement can be attributed to the continuous paths provided by nanofibers for efficient mass/charge transport and the interdiffusion of La and Ce at the heterointerface which leads to more oxygen vacancy formation.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/CeO2 Heterostructured Composite Nanofibers as a Highly Active and Robust Cathode Catalyst for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b06668
5,8751,"Furthermore, the anode-supported cell with the LSCF/CeO2 composite cathode shows excellent stability (0.4 V for similar to 200 h at 600 degrees C) because of suppression of Sr segregation in LSCF by introducing CeO2 and the structure of heterogeneous nanofibers.",La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/CeO2 Heterostructured Composite Nanofibers as a Highly Active and Robust Cathode Catalyst for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b06668
6,8751,These results indicate that the microstructure design of this heterostructured composite nanofiber for LSCF/CeO2 is extremely effective for enhancing ORR activity and stability.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/CeO2 Heterostructured Composite Nanofibers as a Highly Active and Robust Cathode Catalyst for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b06668
7,8751,This finding may provide a new strategy for the microstructure design of highly active and robust ORR catalysts in SOFCs.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ/CeO2 Heterostructured Composite Nanofibers as a Highly Active and Robust Cathode Catalyst for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.9b06668
