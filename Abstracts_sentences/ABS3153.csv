3,3153,"The effects of oxygen partial pressure (PO2/PAr of 0 %-50 % at the sputter pressure of 30 mTorr) and deposition temperature on the physical, chemical and electrochemical properties of Ni-SDC films are studied.",Reactive sputtered Ni-SDC cermet alloy anode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166332
4,3153,"While the Ni-SDC anodes deposited at high PO2/PAr (> 20 %) exhibited higher initial performance, they suffered from crack formation and massive Ni agglomeration upon operation due to NiO-to-Ni reduction and severe volume change.",Reactive sputtered Ni-SDC cermet alloy anode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166332
5,3153,We further show that increasing the deposition temperature to 500 degrees C was effective in suppressing such Ni agglomeration and preserving the performance during operation.(c) 2022,Reactive sputtered Ni-SDC cermet alloy anode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166332
