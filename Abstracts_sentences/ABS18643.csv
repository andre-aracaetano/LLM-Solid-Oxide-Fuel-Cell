1,18643,A new oxide of the Ruddlesden-Popper series has been isolated and structurally characterized in the Eu-Sr-Co-Mn-O system.,"Exploring the physical properties of Eu2SrCo1.5Mn0.5O7, a new n=2 member of the Ruddlesden-Popper series (Eu,Sr)n+1(Co,Mn)nO3n+1",10.1039/c5ta05464h
2,18643,"X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy show that polycrystalline Eu2SrCo1.5Mn0.5O7 constitutes the n = 2 member of a homologous series, the essential feature of which is the existence of two connected Co/Mn octahedral layers, separated by Eu atoms.","Exploring the physical properties of Eu2SrCo1.5Mn0.5O7, a new n=2 member of the Ruddlesden-Popper series (Eu,Sr)n+1(Co,Mn)nO3n+1",10.1039/c5ta05464h
3,18643,"Electrochemical studies show that the area-specific resistance of this compound is 0.15 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air, a performance which is comparable to that of the best state-of-the-art materials used as cathodes in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.","Exploring the physical properties of Eu2SrCo1.5Mn0.5O7, a new n=2 member of the Ruddlesden-Popper series (Eu,Sr)n+1(Co,Mn)nO3n+1",10.1039/c5ta05464h
4,18643,Below 150 K the title material presents two different magnetic phenomena.,"Exploring the physical properties of Eu2SrCo1.5Mn0.5O7, a new n=2 member of the Ruddlesden-Popper series (Eu,Sr)n+1(Co,Mn)nO3n+1",10.1039/c5ta05464h
5,18643,"The first one corresponds to the formation of ferromagnetic nanoclusters (T-C similar to 121 K) within an ordered Co2+/Mn4+ atomic configuration, whereas at lower temperature (similar to 21 K) a spin glass state occurs.","Exploring the physical properties of Eu2SrCo1.5Mn0.5O7, a new n=2 member of the Ruddlesden-Popper series (Eu,Sr)n+1(Co,Mn)nO3n+1",10.1039/c5ta05464h
