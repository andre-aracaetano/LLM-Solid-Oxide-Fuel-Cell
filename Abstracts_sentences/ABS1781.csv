1,1781,This paper presents the work on part-load operation of a power generation system composed of a solid oxide fuel cell and a gas turbine (SOFC-GT) which operate on natural gas.,Modelling for part-load operation of solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid power plant,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00613-4
2,1781,"The system consists of an internal reforming SOFC (IRSOFC) stack, an external combustor, two turbines, two compressors, two recuperators and one heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG).",Modelling for part-load operation of solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid power plant,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00613-4
3,1781,"Based on experience in different levels of modelling of the fuel cell, fuel cell stack and integrated system and the inherent characteristics of a IRSOFC-GT hybrid power plant, a practical approach for simplifying part-load operation of the system is proposed.",Modelling for part-load operation of solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid power plant,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00613-4
4,1781,"Simulation results show that an IRSOFC-GT hybrid system could achieve a net electrical efficiency and system efficiency (including waste heat recovery for steam generation) of greater than 60 and 80%, respectively, under full-load operation.",Modelling for part-load operation of solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid power plant,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00613-4
5,1781,"Due to the complexity of the interaction of the components and safety requirements, the part-load performance of a IRSOFC-GT hybrid power plant is poorer than that under full-load operation.",Modelling for part-load operation of solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid power plant,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00613-4
