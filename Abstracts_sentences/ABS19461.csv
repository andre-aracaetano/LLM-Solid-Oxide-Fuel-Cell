2,19461,In this paper we report the first ever in situ 3D electron diffraction (ED) experiment in a gas environment and with it uncover the structure evolution of SrFeO2.5 as notably different from that reported from in situ X-ray and in situ neutron powder diffraction studies in gas environments.,Topotactic redox cycling in SrFeO2.5+δ explored by 3D electron diffraction in different gas atmospheres,10.1039/d2ta03247c
3,19461,"Using in situ 3D ED on submicron sized single crystals, we observe the transformation under O-2 flow of brownmillerite SrFeO2.5 with an intra- and interlayer ordering of the left and right twisted (FeO4)(infinity) tetrahedral chains (space group Pcmb) into consecutively SrFeO2.75 with space group Cmmm (at 350 degrees C, 33% O-2) and SrFeO3-delta with space group Pm3m (at 400 degrees C, 100% O-2).",Topotactic redox cycling in SrFeO2.5+δ explored by 3D electron diffraction in different gas atmospheres,10.1039/d2ta03247c
4,19461,"Upon reduction in H-2 flow, the crystals return to the brownmillerite structure with intralayer order, but without regaining the interlayer order of the pristine crystals.",Topotactic redox cycling in SrFeO2.5+δ explored by 3D electron diffraction in different gas atmospheres,10.1039/d2ta03247c
5,19461,"Therefore, redox cycling of SrFeO2.5 crystals in O-2 and H-2 introduces stacking faults into the structure, resulting in an I2/m(0 beta gamma)0s symmetry with variable beta.",Topotactic redox cycling in SrFeO2.5+δ explored by 3D electron diffraction in different gas atmospheres,10.1039/d2ta03247c
