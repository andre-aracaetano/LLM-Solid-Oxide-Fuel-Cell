1,17928,"The high temperature oxidation behavior of a new metal interconnects material Fe-Cr-Co alloy in SOFC anodic atmosphere (N-2+2%H-2+60%H2O) was studied by cyclic oxidation at 750 degrees C, and then the thermal stress analysis was carried out based on the interface morphology of the real oxide and the alloy.",Formation and Thermal Stress Analysis of Oxide of Interconnects Alloy in SOFC Reduction Atmosphere,
2,17928,"The phase structure, cross-sectional morphology and composition of the alloy oxide were characterized by XRD and SEM equipped with EDS, and the thermal stress extreme distribution of the alloy oxide was simulated by image processing and finite element simulation technology.",Formation and Thermal Stress Analysis of Oxide of Interconnects Alloy in SOFC Reduction Atmosphere,
3,17928,"The results show that 2 mu m oxide is formed by cyclic oxidation of Fe-Cr-Co alloy at 750 degrees C anode for 600 h, which is composed of Fe-doped Cr2O3 inner layer and MnCr2O4 outer layer, and the simulation analysis shows that the maximum shear stress at the interface is distributed in the region between the peak and trough, which makes the oxide in this area easy to peel off first.",Formation and Thermal Stress Analysis of Oxide of Interconnects Alloy in SOFC Reduction Atmosphere,
