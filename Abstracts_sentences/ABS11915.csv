1,11915,"High-temperature corrosion of ferritic stainless steel (FSS) surfaces can be accelerated and anomalous when it is simultaneously subjected to different gaseous environments, e.g., when separating fuel (hydrogen) and oxidant (air) streams, in comparison with single-atmosphere exposures, e.g., air only.","High-Temperature, Dual-Atmosphere Corrosion of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects",10.1007/s11837-012-0473-3
2,11915,"This so-called dual-atmosphere exposure is realized in many energy-conversion systems including turbines, boilers, gasifiers, heat exchangers, and particularly in intermediate temperature (600-800A degrees C) planar solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks.","High-Temperature, Dual-Atmosphere Corrosion of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects",10.1007/s11837-012-0473-3
3,11915,"It is generally accepted that hydrogen transport through the FSS (plate or tube) and its subsequent integration into the growing air-side surface oxide layer can promote accelerated and anomalous corrosion-relative to single-atmosphere exposure-via defect chemistry changes, such as increased cation vacancy concentrations, decreased oxygen activity, and steam formation within the growing surface oxide layers.","High-Temperature, Dual-Atmosphere Corrosion of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects",10.1007/s11837-012-0473-3
4,11915,Establishment of a continuous and dense surface oxide layer on the fuel side of the FSS can inhibit hydrogen transport and the associated effects on the air side.,"High-Temperature, Dual-Atmosphere Corrosion of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects",10.1007/s11837-012-0473-3
5,11915,"Minor differences in FSS composition, microstructure, and surface conditions can all have dramatic influences on dual-atmosphere corrosion behaviors.","High-Temperature, Dual-Atmosphere Corrosion of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects",10.1007/s11837-012-0473-3
6,11915,"This article reviews high-temperature, dual-atmosphere corrosion phenomena and discusses implications for SOFC stacks, related applications, and future research.","High-Temperature, Dual-Atmosphere Corrosion of Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects",10.1007/s11837-012-0473-3
