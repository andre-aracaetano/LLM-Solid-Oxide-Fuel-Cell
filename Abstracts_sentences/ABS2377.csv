3,2377,"The results show that a rotational speed of 750rpm, a solution feeding rate of 0.5 mL h(-1), and an operating voltage of 17 kV allow to obtain tissues with an average fiber diameter of 0.590 m and porosity around 50%.",Parameter Optimization for the Electrospinning of La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ Fibers for IT-SOFC Electrodes,10.1002/fuce.201600190
4,2377,"The subsequent calcination processes are investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which shows exothermic peaks due to solvent evaporation, debinding and perovskite structure formation, and suggest to perform calcination slowly in the temperature range 520-820 K. A fiber calcination process is carried out with a heating rate of 0.3 K min(-1).",Parameter Optimization for the Electrospinning of La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ Fibers for IT-SOFC Electrodes,10.1002/fuce.201600190
