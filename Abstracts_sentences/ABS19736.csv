1,19736,"In this work, we studied the structural features of La1.9Ca0.1NiO4.11, which is considered a promising cathode material for intermediate temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC).",Unusual Lattice Parameters Behavior for La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+δ at the Temperatures below Oxygen Loss,10.3390/cryst12030344
2,19736,The effect of different pretreatments on the structural characteristics of the sample was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in order to elucidate the origin of a peculiar change of lattice parameters observed earlier during in situ XRD studies.,Unusual Lattice Parameters Behavior for La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+δ at the Temperatures below Oxygen Loss,10.3390/cryst12030344
3,19736,The XRD studies have shown that anisotropic broadening for reflections with a high Miller index l appears after tempering of a quenched (from 1100 degrees C) sample at 250 degrees C.,Unusual Lattice Parameters Behavior for La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+δ at the Temperatures below Oxygen Loss,10.3390/cryst12030344
4,19736,This temperature is too low for the release/incorporation of oxygen into the structure but is sufficient for oxygen migration inside the structure.,Unusual Lattice Parameters Behavior for La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+δ at the Temperatures below Oxygen Loss,10.3390/cryst12030344
5,19736,The HRTEM assisted us in revealing differences in the defect structure after different pretreatments.,Unusual Lattice Parameters Behavior for La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+δ at the Temperatures below Oxygen Loss,10.3390/cryst12030344
6,19736,"Based on obtained results, the following possible explanation was proposed.",Unusual Lattice Parameters Behavior for La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+δ at the Temperatures below Oxygen Loss,10.3390/cryst12030344
7,19736,Observed additional microstrains and non-oriented planar defects as well as a decrease in the coherent scattering region size in the [00l] direction are caused by the non-homogeneous redistribution of interstitial oxygen in the structure during tempering.,Unusual Lattice Parameters Behavior for La1.9Ca0.1NiO4+δ at the Temperatures below Oxygen Loss,10.3390/cryst12030344
