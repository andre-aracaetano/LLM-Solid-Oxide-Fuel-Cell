3,3738,BaO nanoparticles were introduced to LSCF electrodes by solution impregnation.,Effect of BaO impregnation on sulfur tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/2053-1591/ab1122
4,3738,The resistance and tolerance of LSCF electrodes toward sulfur in air stream increased with the loading of impregnated BaO nanoparticles.,Effect of BaO impregnation on sulfur tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/2053-1591/ab1122
5,3738,"For 1.08 mgcm(-2) BaO impregnated LSCF electrodes, initial electrode polarization resistance R-E was 0.4 Omega cm(2), which was close to 0.35 Omega cm(2) measured on pristine LSCF electrode at 700 degrees C. However, R-E remained almost constant after polarization at 200 mA cm(-2) for 40 h in the presence of 1 ppm SO2 at 700 degrees C, which was in contrast with significant increase of R-E to 1.24 Omega cm(2) after polarization for 20 h for the reaction on pristine LSCF under identical test conditions.",Effect of BaO impregnation on sulfur tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/2053-1591/ab1122
6,3738,"The results indicate that the impregnated BaO nanoparticles served as a barrier layer, effectively inhibiting the interaction between sulfur and strontium of LSCF electrode and thus enhancing its sulfur tolerance.",Effect of BaO impregnation on sulfur tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1088/2053-1591/ab1122
