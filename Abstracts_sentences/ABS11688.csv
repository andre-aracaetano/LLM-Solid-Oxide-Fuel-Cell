1,11688,"In the past years, a major interest has been devoted to decrease the working temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) down to about 700 degrees C. Apatite materials (La10-xSrxSi6O27-x/2) are attractive candidates for solid electrolytes, with a high ionic conductivity at 700 degrees C, a chemical and a dimensional stability for a pO(2) ranging from 10(-25) to 0.2 atm.",Evaluation of the La0.75Sr0.25Mn0.8Co0.2O3-δ system as cathode material for ITSOFCs with La9Sr1Si6O26.5 apatite as electrolyte,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.11.009

4,11688,Impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed on these cells in order to determine the electrode resistance.,Evaluation of the La0.75Sr0.25Mn0.8Co0.2O3-δ system as cathode material for ITSOFCs with La9Sr1Si6O26.5 apatite as electrolyte,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.11.009
5,11688,It has been shown that the latter decreases with the porosity content of the cathode and with the use of a composite material (apatite/perovskite) instead of a simple perovskite.,Evaluation of the La0.75Sr0.25Mn0.8Co0.2O3-δ system as cathode material for ITSOFCs with La9Sr1Si6O26.5 apatite as electrolyte,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.11.009
