1,11647,This paper presents a technical and economic analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell system equipped with a palladium membrane reactor (PMR-SOFC) with the aim of determining the benefits of such an integrated unit over the conventional reformer module (CON-SOFC).,Integration of solid oxide fuel cell and palladium membrane reactor: Technical and economic analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.02.049
2,11647,The performance of both SOFC systems under the conditions for energetically self-sustaining operation (Q(NET) = 0) was achieved by varying the fuel utilization for each operating voltage.,Integration of solid oxide fuel cell and palladium membrane reactor: Technical and economic analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.02.049

4,11647,The simulation results show that the maximum power density of the CON-SOFC fuelled by methane (0.423 W/cm(2)) is higher than that of the CON-SOFC fuelled by biogas (0.399 W/cm(2)) due to the presence Of CO2 in biogas.,Integration of solid oxide fuel cell and palladium membrane reactor: Technical and economic analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.02.049
5,11647,"For the PMR-SOFC, it is found that the operation at a higher permeation pressure offers higher power density because lower fuel utilization is required when operating the SOFC at the energy self-sustained condition.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cell and palladium membrane reactor: Technical and economic analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.02.049
6,11647,"When the membrane reactor is operated at the permeation pressure of 1 bar, the methane-fuelled and biogas-fuelled PMR-SOFCs can achieve the maximum power density of 0.4398 and 0.4213 W/cm(2), respectively.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cell and palladium membrane reactor: Technical and economic analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.02.049
7,11647,"Although the PMR-SOFC can offer higher power density, compared with the CON-SOFC, the capital costs of supporting units, i.e., palladium membrane reactor, high-pressure compressor, and vacuum pump, for PMR-SOFC need to be taken into account.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cell and palladium membrane reactor: Technical and economic analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.02.049
8,11647,The economic analysis shows that the PMR-SOFC is not a good choice from an economic viewpoint because of the requirement of a large high-pressure compressor for feeding gas to the membrane reactor.,Integration of solid oxide fuel cell and palladium membrane reactor: Technical and economic analysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.02.049
