1,6894,"The effect of SO2 content in air on degradation of a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF6428) cathode for solid oxide fuel cells was investigated at T = 1073 K for 24 h by setting the concentration of SO2 to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ppm.",Sulfur Poisoning on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 Cathode for SOFCs,10.1149/2.059111jes
2,6894,The degradation of the LSCF6428 cathode became more significant with increasing SO2 concentrations due to the increase of cathode polarization resistance.,Sulfur Poisoning on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 Cathode for SOFCs,10.1149/2.059111jes
