1,2088,"Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-x (CGO) was found to have useful methane steam reforming activity at solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating temperatures producing H-2, CO and some CO2.",Catalytic steam reforming of methane over Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-x,10.1016/j.apcatb.2003.08.008
2,2088,The turnover frequency for steam reforming at 900 degreesC and activation energy (153 +/- 10 kJ mol(-1)) are approximately equal to those for reaction between CGO and dry methane.,Catalytic steam reforming of methane over Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-x,10.1016/j.apcatb.2003.08.008
3,2088,This is consistent with a reaction mechanism controlled by the slow reaction of methane with oxygen in CGO and a facile reaction between steam and CGO to replenish the oxygen.,Catalytic steam reforming of methane over Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-x,10.1016/j.apcatb.2003.08.008
