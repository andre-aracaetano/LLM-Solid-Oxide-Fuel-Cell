1,2158,A 50-50wt.% Ba2Co9O14 (BCO)+ Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) composite was evaluated as a cathode for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) operating at 800 degrees C.,Electrochemical performance of Ba2Co9O14 + SDC composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.02.034
2,2158,"The composite was supported on the electrolyte La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 (LSGM) and its performance for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) was evaluated with a symmetric BCO + SDC[LSGM]BCO + SDC cell, which gave a polarization resistance of 0.068 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C in air.",Electrochemical performance of Ba2Co9O14 + SDC composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.02.034
3,2158,"A singe cell with a 300-mu m-thick electrolyte and a composite NiO+Gd-doped ceria anode gave a nearly stable P-max approximate to 450 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, indicating that with a thinner electrolyte, the composite cathode could provide an IT-SOFC that meets the targeted 500 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C.",Electrochemical performance of Ba2Co9O14 + SDC composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.02.034
4,2158,The fabrication of the composite cathode versus BCO alone serves two functions: improved adhesion to the electrolyte and an enhancement of the ORR activity.,Electrochemical performance of Ba2Co9O14 + SDC composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.02.034
