1,4124,We investigated direct butane power generation for microtubular solid oxide fuel cells with a diameter of less than 2 mm.,Impact of direct butane microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.106
2,4124,Conventional Ni-stabilized zirconia anodes deteriorated rapidly over a period of 3-4 h at 610 degrees C and a low steam/carbon (S/C) ratio of 0.044 in butane due to a large amount of carbon deposition.,Impact of direct butane microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.106
3,4124,"For the Ni-Gd doped ceria (Ni-GDC) anode, the power could be generated continuously for more than 24 h at 610 degrees C and S/C = 0.044 in butane.",Impact of direct butane microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.106
4,4124,"The rate of carbon deposition for the Ni-GDC was slower than that for the Ni-stabilized zirconia at 610 degrees C. Ceria can be reduced from Ce4+ to Ce3+, which causes the suppression of carbon deposition on the Ni-GDC anode in butane at low humidity.",Impact of direct butane microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.106
