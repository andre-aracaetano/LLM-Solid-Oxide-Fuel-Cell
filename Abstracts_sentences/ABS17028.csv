1,17028,"A detailed study aimed at understanding and confirming the reported highly promising performance of a La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-delta (LSFCr) perovskite catalyst in CO2/CO mixtures, for use in reversible solid oxide fuel cells (RSOFCs), is reported in this work, with an emphasis on chemical and performance stability.",Deciphering the Interaction of Single-Phase La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ with CO2/CO Environments for Application in Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c00857
2,17028,"This work includes an X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and electrochemical study in a range of pO(2) atmospheres (pure CO2, CO alone (balance N-2), and a 90-70% CO2/10-30% CO containing mixture), related to the different conditions that could be encountered during CO2 reduction at the cathode.",Deciphering the Interaction of Single-Phase La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ with CO2/CO Environments for Application in Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c00857
3,17028,"Powdered LSFCr remains structurally stable in 20-100% CO2 (balance N-2, pO(2) = 10(-11)-10(-)(12) atm) without any decomposition.",Deciphering the Interaction of Single-Phase La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ with CO2/CO Environments for Application in Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c00857
4,17028,"However, in 30% CO (balance N-2, pO(2), similar to 10(-26) atm), a Ruddlesden-Popper phase, Fe nanoparticles, and potentially some coke are observed to form at 800 degrees C. However, this can be reversed and the original perovskite can be recovered by heat treatment in air at 800 degrees C.",Deciphering the Interaction of Single-Phase La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ with CO2/CO Environments for Application in Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c00857
5,17028,"While no evidence for coke formation is obtained in 90-70% CO2/10-30% CO (pO(2) = 10(-18) atm) mixtures at 800 degrees C, in 70 CO2/30 CO, minor impurities of SrCO3 and Fe nanoparticles were observed, with the latter potentially beneficial to the electrochemical activity of the perovskite.",Deciphering the Interaction of Single-Phase La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ with CO2/CO Environments for Application in Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c00857
6,17028,"Consistent with prior work, symmetrical two-electrode full cells (LSFCr used at both electrodes), fed with the various CO2/CO gas mixtures at one electrode and air at the other, showed excellent electrochemical performance at 800 degrees C, both in the SOFC and in SOEC modes.",Deciphering the Interaction of Single-Phase La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ with CO2/CO Environments for Application in Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c00857
7,17028,"Also, LSFCr exhibits excellent stability during CO2 electrolysis in medium-term potentiostatic tests in all gas mixtures, indicative of its excellent promise as an electrode material for use in symmetrical solid oxide cells.",Deciphering the Interaction of Single-Phase La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ with CO2/CO Environments for Application in Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c00857
