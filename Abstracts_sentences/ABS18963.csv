1,18963,The performance of a solid-state electrochemical system depends critically on the transport process in the bulk phases as well as the mass transfer and charge transfer across interfaces.,CONSIDERATIONS IN DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID-STATE ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90086-5
2,18963,"The bulk transport process, such as diffusion under a chemical potential gradient and migration under an electric field, is relatively well-understood and property characterized.",CONSIDERATIONS IN DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID-STATE ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90086-5
3,18963,"The phenomena occurring at an interface, however, have received little attention due either to the lack of understanding of these processes or to the experimental difficulty with determination of the interfacial properties.",CONSIDERATIONS IN DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID-STATE ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90086-5
4,18963,"Although interfacial phenomena are far more complex in nature than bulk transport processes, their effect on the system performance is becoming more and more important, particularly for systems involving thin-film electrolytes or for operation at low temperatures.",CONSIDERATIONS IN DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID-STATE ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90086-5
5,18963,"In both cases, the kinetics of interfacial processes dominate the performance characteristics.",CONSIDERATIONS IN DESIGN AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID-STATE ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90086-5
