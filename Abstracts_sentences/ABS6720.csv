1,6720,The effects of mixed conduction on the open-circuit voltage of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on SDC20 were studied in the temperature range of 723-973 K.,Effects of mixed conduction on the open-circuit voltage of intermediate-temperature SOFCs based on Sm-doped ceria electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.10.010
2,6720,"Though the measured OCVs of a test cell using high activity electrodes agreed well with theoretical values calculated using the conductivity data at 973 K, they deviated from the theoretical ones at lower temperatures.",Effects of mixed conduction on the open-circuit voltage of intermediate-temperature SOFCs based on Sm-doped ceria electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.10.010
3,6720,"The OCV was dependent on electrode activity and electrolyte thickness, and it was concluded that overpotential at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces affected the OCV because of internal short circuit.",Effects of mixed conduction on the open-circuit voltage of intermediate-temperature SOFCs based on Sm-doped ceria electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.10.010
4,6720,The ionic transference number of SDC 20 that is free from the effect of overpotential was obtained using a method derived by Liu et al.,Effects of mixed conduction on the open-circuit voltage of intermediate-temperature SOFCs based on Sm-doped ceria electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.10.010
