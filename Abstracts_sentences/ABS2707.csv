2,2707,The model consists of an improved radial basis function (RBF) neural network model and a pressure-incremental model.,A Hybrid Experimental Model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1115/1.2971125
3,2707,The improved RBF model is built to predict the stack voltage with different temperatures and current density.,A Hybrid Experimental Model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1115/1.2971125
4,2707,"Likewise, the pressure-incremental model is constructed to predict the stack voltage under various hydrogen, oxygen, and water partial pressures.",A Hybrid Experimental Model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1115/1.2971125
5,2707,"We combine the two models together and make a powerful hybrid multivariable model that can predict the voltage under any current density, temperature, hydrogen, oxygen, and water partial pressure.",A Hybrid Experimental Model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1115/1.2971125
6,2707,"The validity and accuracy of modeling are tested by simulations, and the simulation results show that it is feasible to build the hybrid multivariable experimental model.",A Hybrid Experimental Model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack,10.1115/1.2971125
