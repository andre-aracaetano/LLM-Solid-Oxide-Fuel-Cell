8,16359,The Niquist diagrams for 8ZrMZ samples show significantly lower ionic conductivity compared to standards 4ZrY and 8 ZrY. This may be attributed to the presence of detrimental Fe and Si impurities following the mixed REE after Th and U removal from monazite concentrates and the ratio of REEs in the dopant composition affecting the ionic conductivity due to possible association of structural defects.,Hydrothermal synthesis of zirconia doped with naturally mixed rare earths oxides and their electrochemical properties for possible applications in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1051/mfreview/2023014
