1,16622,Perovskite electrodes have been considered as an alternative to Ni-YSZ cermet-based anodes as they afford better tolerance towards coking and impurities and due to redox stability can allow very high levels of fuel utilisation.,Demonstration of high performance in a perovskite oxide supported solid oxide fuel cell based on La and Ca co-doped SrTiO3,10.1039/c6ta04074h
2,16622,"Unfortunately performance levels have rarely been sufficient, especially for a second generation anode supported concept.",Demonstration of high performance in a perovskite oxide supported solid oxide fuel cell based on La and Ca co-doped SrTiO3,10.1039/c6ta04074h
3,16622,"A-site deficient lanthanum and calcium co-doped SrTiO3, La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 (LSCTA-) shows promising thermal, mechanical and electrical properties and has been investigated in this study as a potential anode support material for SOFCs.",Demonstration of high performance in a perovskite oxide supported solid oxide fuel cell based on La and Ca co-doped SrTiO3,10.1039/c6ta04074h
4,16622,"Flat multilayer ceramics cells were fabricated by aqueous tape casting and co-sintering, comprising a 450 mu m thick porous LSCTA- scaffold support, a dense YSZ electrolyte and a thin layer of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta (LSC)-La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta (LSF)-YSZ cathode.",Demonstration of high performance in a perovskite oxide supported solid oxide fuel cell based on La and Ca co-doped SrTiO3,10.1039/c6ta04074h
5,16622,Impregnation of a small content of Ni significantly enhanced fuel cell performance over naked LSCTA-.,Demonstration of high performance in a perovskite oxide supported solid oxide fuel cell based on La and Ca co-doped SrTiO3,10.1039/c6ta04074h
6,16622,Use of ceria as a co-catalyst was found to improve the microstructure and stability of impregnated Ni and this in combination with the catalytic enhancement from ceria significantly improved performance over Ni impregnation alone.,Demonstration of high performance in a perovskite oxide supported solid oxide fuel cell based on La and Ca co-doped SrTiO3,10.1039/c6ta04074h
7,16622,"With addition of CeO2 and Ni to a titanate scaffold anode that had been pre-reduced at 1000 degrees C, a maximum powder density of 0.96 W cm(-2) can be achieved at 800 degrees C using humidified hydrogen as fuel.",Demonstration of high performance in a perovskite oxide supported solid oxide fuel cell based on La and Ca co-doped SrTiO3,10.1039/c6ta04074h
8,16622,"The encouraging results show that an oxide anode material, LSCTA- can be used as anode support with YSZ electrolyte heralding a new option for SOFC development.",Demonstration of high performance in a perovskite oxide supported solid oxide fuel cell based on La and Ca co-doped SrTiO3,10.1039/c6ta04074h
