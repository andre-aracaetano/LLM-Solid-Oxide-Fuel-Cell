3,4488,Low anode over-potentials and high exchange current densities (>60 mA/cm(2) in some instances) were observed.,Utilization of hydrogen sulfide in an intermediate-temperature ceria-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1838503
4,4488,An analysis of the product distribution showed that complete oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide las opposed to sulfur) and water appears to be the favored reaction pathway.,Utilization of hydrogen sulfide in an intermediate-temperature ceria-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1838503
