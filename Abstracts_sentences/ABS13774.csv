1,13774,"The layered structure of the orthorhombic GdBaCo2O5+delta (GBCO) double perovskite compound, currently considered as a promising cathode material in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), is believed to induce a high degree of anisotropy in the oxygen diffusion coefficient, being maximum along the a-b plane in comparison to the diffusion along the c-axis direction.",Anisotropic 18O tracer diffusion in epitaxial films of GdBaCo2O5+δ cathode material with different orientations,10.1039/c3ta10749c
2,13774,"In this study we have deposited films with different orientation: pure c-axis and a-axis orientation on SrTiO3(001) and NdGaO3(110) single crystals, respectively.",Anisotropic 18O tracer diffusion in epitaxial films of GdBaCo2O5+δ cathode material with different orientations,10.1039/c3ta10749c
3,13774,The oxygen diffusion was analysed by isotopic O-18 exchange depth profiling (IEDP) and Time-of-flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) in the films along the longitudinal and transverse directions at different exchange temperatures and exposure times.,Anisotropic 18O tracer diffusion in epitaxial films of GdBaCo2O5+δ cathode material with different orientations,10.1039/c3ta10749c
4,13774,The magnitude of longitudinal D* at low temperatures shows a clear anisotropy.,Anisotropic 18O tracer diffusion in epitaxial films of GdBaCo2O5+δ cathode material with different orientations,10.1039/c3ta10749c
5,13774,"The oxygen diffusion along the a-axis shows comparable values to the bulk polycrystalline GBCO, while it is about one order of magnitude lower along the c-axis of the structure.",Anisotropic 18O tracer diffusion in epitaxial films of GdBaCo2O5+δ cathode material with different orientations,10.1039/c3ta10749c
6,13774,The corresponding oxygen surface exchange rates k* do not show any anisotropy having comparable values for c-axis and a-axis orientation.,Anisotropic 18O tracer diffusion in epitaxial films of GdBaCo2O5+δ cathode material with different orientations,10.1039/c3ta10749c
7,13774,These k* values are slightly larger than those reported for bulk material showing that thin film textured cathodes may have enhanced activity for oxygen reduction at low temperatures.,Anisotropic 18O tracer diffusion in epitaxial films of GdBaCo2O5+δ cathode material with different orientations,10.1039/c3ta10749c
