1,6162,The long-term properties of Ni/yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells were evaluated experimentally.,Durability and thermal cycling of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1003991529552
2,6162,A total of 13 anodes of three types based on two commercial NiO powders were examined.,Durability and thermal cycling of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1003991529552
3,6162,"The durability was evaluated at temperatures of 850 (degrees)C, 1000 (degrees)C and 1050 (degrees)C over 1300 to 2000 h at an anodic d.c. load of 300 mA cm(-2) in hydrogen with 1 to 3% water.",Durability and thermal cycling of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1003991529552
4,6162,"The anode-related polarization resistance, R(P), was measured by impedance spectroscopy and found to be in the range of 0.05 to 0.7 Omega cm(2).",Durability and thermal cycling of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1003991529552
5,6162,"After an initial stabilization period of up to 300 h, R(P) varied linearly with time within the experimental uncertainty.",Durability and thermal cycling of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1003991529552
6,6162,At 1050 (degrees)C no degradation was observed.,Durability and thermal cycling of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1003991529552
7,6162,At 1000 (degrees)C a degradation rate of 10 m Omega cm(2) per 1000 h was found.,Durability and thermal cycling of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1003991529552
8,6162,The degradation rate was possibly higher at 850 (degrees)C. A single anode was exposed to nine thermal cycles from 1000 to below 100 (degrees)C at 100 (degrees)C h(-1).,Durability and thermal cycling of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1003991529552
9,6162,An increase in R(P) of about 30 m Omega cm(2) was observed over the first two cycles.,Durability and thermal cycling of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1003991529552
10,6162,For the following thermal cycles R(P) was stable within the experimental uncertainty.,Durability and thermal cycling of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1003991529552
