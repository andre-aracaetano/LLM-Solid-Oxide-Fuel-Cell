1,259,"In this paper, we describe new strategies to reduce the resistances related to cathode reactions and interfacial proton transfer in protonic solid oxide fuel cells (H+-SOFCs) based on proton-conducting BaZrxCe0.8-xM0.2O3-delta (M = Y, Yb, Sc etc.) by means of material and cell-structure design changes.",Studies on Protonic Solid Oxide Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.23-00026
2,259,"First, an extension of the effective cathode reaction areas by employing the H+/O2-/e(-) triple-conducting cathode is described.",Studies on Protonic Solid Oxide Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.23-00026
3,259,"Cubic La0.7Sr0.3Mn1-xNixO3-delta (x = 0-0.3) can be hydrated under fuel cell conditions due to its large hydration enthalpy (similar to 100 kJ mol(-1)), whereas rhombohedral La0.7Sr0.3Mn1-xNixO3-delta does not exhibit hydration capabilities; hence, the porous anode cermet support fuel cells (PAFCs), which use the former as a cathode, possess significantly smaller cathode polarization resistances than the PAFCs that use the latter.",Studies on Protonic Solid Oxide Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.23-00026
4,259,"Second, we describe a new thermodynamic mechanism for reducing the electrolyte and cathode reaction resistances in a hydrogen-permeable metal-support fuel cell (HMFC), which involves the blocking of the oxide ion minor conduction in the BaZrxCe0.8-xM0.2O3-delta electrolyte at metal/oxide heterointerfaces.",Studies on Protonic Solid Oxide Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.23-00026
5,259,"The BaZrxCe0.8-xM0.2O3-delta membrane of HMFCs is forced to gain extra protons to compensate for the charge from the oxide ions accumulating near the heterointerfaces via blocking, resulting in extremely high proton conductivity.",Studies on Protonic Solid Oxide Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.23-00026
6,259,This promotes significant interfacial proton diffusion for cathode reactions.,Studies on Protonic Solid Oxide Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.23-00026
