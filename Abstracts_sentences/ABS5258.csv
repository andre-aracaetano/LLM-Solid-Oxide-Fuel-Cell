1,5258,Redox tolerance of 50 and 500m thick Ni/YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) anodes supported on YSZ electrolytes were studied under single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell conditions.,Redox Tolerance of Thin and Thick Ni/YSZ Anodes of Electrolyte-Supported Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Methane Oxidation Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200050
2,5258,"Open circuit voltage, electrochemical impedance spectra, and discharge curves of the cells were measured under different methane/oxygen ratios at 700 degrees C. For the cell with the thin anode, a significant degradation accompanying oscillatory behaviors was observed, whereas the cell based on the thick anode was much more stable under the same conditions.",Redox Tolerance of Thin and Thick Ni/YSZ Anodes of Electrolyte-Supported Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Methane Oxidation Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200050
3,5258,"In situ local anode resistance (R-s) results indicated that the Ni/NiO redox cycling was responsible for the oscillatory behaviors, and the cell degradation was primarily caused by the Ni reoxidation.",Redox Tolerance of Thin and Thick Ni/YSZ Anodes of Electrolyte-Supported Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Methane Oxidation Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200050
4,5258,"Reoxidation of the thick anode took place at a low methane/oxygen ratio, but the anode can be recovered to its original state by switching to a methane-rich environment.",Redox Tolerance of Thin and Thick Ni/YSZ Anodes of Electrolyte-Supported Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Methane Oxidation Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200050
5,5258,"On the contrary, the thin anode was unable to be regenerated after the oxidation.",Redox Tolerance of Thin and Thick Ni/YSZ Anodes of Electrolyte-Supported Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Methane Oxidation Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200050
6,5258,Microstructure damage of the anode was attributed to its irreversible degradation.,Redox Tolerance of Thin and Thick Ni/YSZ Anodes of Electrolyte-Supported Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Methane Oxidation Conditions,10.1002/fuce.201200050
