1,10406,"As a potential cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells, the commercial application of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) has to face the challenges in insufficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, segregation of Sr element, and CO2 poisoning.",In-situ segregation of A-site defect (La0.6Sr0.4)0.90Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ to form a high-performance solid oxide fuel cell cathode material with heterostructure,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.295
2,10406,"Therefore, the effect of A-site non-stoichiometry on the electrochemical perfor-mance of (LS)(1-x)CFs (x =-0.05, 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) from the aspect of microstructure/elemental surface chemical environment evolution is investigated in this paper.",In-situ segregation of A-site defect (La0.6Sr0.4)0.90Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ to form a high-performance solid oxide fuel cell cathode material with heterostructure,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.295
3,10406,The results show that (LS)(0.90)CF has the best ORR activity and the highest electrochemical performance.,In-situ segregation of A-site defect (La0.6Sr0.4)0.90Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ to form a high-performance solid oxide fuel cell cathode material with heterostructure,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.295
4,10406,"The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the (LS)(0.90)CF/Co2FeO4/CoFe2O4-type heterostructure, formed by in-situ segregation induced by A-site defects, which improves the surface oxygen diffusion coefficient and chemical bulk diffusion coefficient of the cathode.",In-situ segregation of A-site defect (La0.6Sr0.4)0.90Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ to form a high-performance solid oxide fuel cell cathode material with heterostructure,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.295
5,10406,"At the same time, the A-site defect can effectively inhibit the segregation of Sr element in (LS)(0.90)CF, thereby improving the tolerance of CO2.",In-situ segregation of A-site defect (La0.6Sr0.4)0.90Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ to form a high-performance solid oxide fuel cell cathode material with heterostructure,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.295
6,10406,"At 800 degrees C, the area-specific resistance (ASR) of (LS)(0.90)CF (0.023 Omega cm(2)) is 66.7% lower than that of LSCF (0.069 Omega cm(2)), and the peak power density (1.57 Wcm(-2)) is 1.8 times higher than that of LSCF (0.87 Wcm(-2)).",In-situ segregation of A-site defect (La0.6Sr0.4)0.90Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ to form a high-performance solid oxide fuel cell cathode material with heterostructure,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.295
7,10406,"Therefore, perovskite A-site defect-induced B-site segregation to form hetero-structures provides an effective strategy for the preparation of high-performance cathode materials.",In-situ segregation of A-site defect (La0.6Sr0.4)0.90Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ to form a high-performance solid oxide fuel cell cathode material with heterostructure,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.295
