2,20136,"Metallic interconnects (MICs) are exposed to high temperature (ca. 850 degrees C) and dual atmosphere (fuel and air streams), and hence react to form an oxide scale on top.","Characterization of metallic interconnects extracted from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stacks operated up to 20,000 h in real life conditions: The fuel side",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.156
3,20136,"This paper focuses on the fuel side of the MIC and investigates the nature of the oxides formed in SOFC stacks field operated by the SUNFIRE GmbH Company for up to 20,000 h in the frame of the EU-H2020 ADASTRA project.","Characterization of metallic interconnects extracted from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stacks operated up to 20,000 h in real life conditions: The fuel side",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.156
4,20136,"This opportunity supports the understanding on how the metal (i.e., CROFER (R) 22APU) reacts once exposed to the fuel stream by performing investigations on the surface and on the cross-section of the samples by SEM-EDS and micro-Raman spectroscopy.","Characterization of metallic interconnects extracted from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stacks operated up to 20,000 h in real life conditions: The fuel side",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.156
5,20136,The results show the presence of a layered thermally grown oxide (TGO) rich in Cr at the interface with the metal.,"Characterization of metallic interconnects extracted from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stacks operated up to 20,000 h in real life conditions: The fuel side",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.156
6,20136,"On top of the scale, a predominant presence of MnxOy is found supporting the hypothesis of a further reaction of the TGO with selective Cr depletion.","Characterization of metallic interconnects extracted from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stacks operated up to 20,000 h in real life conditions: The fuel side",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.156
