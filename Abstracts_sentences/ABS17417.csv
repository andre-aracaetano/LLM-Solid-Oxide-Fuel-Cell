6,17417,"As a reference plant, we considered a power cycle proposed by Adams and Barton (2010, High-Efficiency Power Production From Natural Gas With Carbon Capture, J. Power Sources, 195(7), pp. 1971-1983), whose performance is the highest found in literature for SOFC-based power cycles, with 82% LHV electrical efficiency.",High Efficiency SOFC Power Cycles With Indirect Natural Gas Reforming and CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4029425
7,17417,"It is based on a prereforming concept where fuel is reformed ahead the SOFC, which thus works with a high hydrogen content fuel.",High Efficiency SOFC Power Cycles With Indirect Natural Gas Reforming and CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4029425
8,17417,"After reproducing the power cycle with the ideal assumptions proposed by the original authors, as second step, the simulations were focused on revising the power cycle, implementing a complete set of assumptions about component losses and more conservative operating conditions about FC voltage, heat exchangers minimum temperature differences (which were previously neglected), maximum steam temperature (set according to heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) practice), turbomachinery efficiency, component pressure losses, and other adjustments.",High Efficiency SOFC Power Cycles With Indirect Natural Gas Reforming and CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4029425
9,17417,"The simulation also required to design an appropriate heat exchangers network, which turned out to be very complex, instead of relying on the free allocation of heat transfer among all components.",High Efficiency SOFC Power Cycles With Indirect Natural Gas Reforming and CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4029425
10,17417,"Considering the consequent modifications with respect to the original layout, the net electric efficiency changes to around 63% LHV with nearly complete (95%+) CO2 capture, a still remarkable but less attractive value.",High Efficiency SOFC Power Cycles With Indirect Natural Gas Reforming and CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4029425
11,17417,"On the other hand, the power cycle requires a complicated and demanding heat exchangers network and heavily relies on the SOFC performances, not generating a positive power output from the gas turbine loop.",High Efficiency SOFC Power Cycles With Indirect Natural Gas Reforming and CO2 Capture,10.1115/1.4029425
