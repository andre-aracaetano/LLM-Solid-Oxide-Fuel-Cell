1,10836,La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.5Mn0.5O2.6/Gd-doped ceria (LCCM)/GDC composite oxides are developed as anodes for the hydrogen and methane oxidation reactions of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,"Pd-promoted (La,Ca)(Cr,Mn)O3/GDC anode for hydrogen and methane oxidation reactions of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2010.06.042
2,10836,"The composite anodes are sintered in temperatures range from 1150 to 1350 degrees C and the lowest ohmic and polarization resistances of the cells are obtained on the anodes sintered at 1300 degrees C. Electrode polarization resistance or area specific resistance (ASR) of the LCCM/GDC anode is 0.47 Omega cm(2) for the hydrogen oxidation reaction and -2.2 Omega cm(2) for the methane oxidation reaction at 850 degrees C. Addition of the Pd nanoparticles via a wet impregnation to the LCCM/GDC anodes decreases the ASR substantially to 0.15 and 0.2313 cm(2) for the hydrogen and methane oxidation reaction at 850 degrees C, respectively.","Pd-promoted (La,Ca)(Cr,Mn)O3/GDC anode for hydrogen and methane oxidation reactions of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2010.06.042

4,10836,"The results indicate that the addition of Pd nanoparticles mainly affects the electrode process associated with the low frequencies, revealing the significant promotion effect of the impregnated Pd catalyst for the dissociation and diffusion processes of the hydrogen and methane oxidation reactions.","Pd-promoted (La,Ca)(Cr,Mn)O3/GDC anode for hydrogen and methane oxidation reactions of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2010.06.042
