1,14930,"Sulphur-containing impurities can have a damaging impact on nickel-based SOFC anode performance even at sub-ppm concentrations, but the electrochemical mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood.",The effect of current density on H2S-poisoning of nickel-based solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.089
2,14930,"In this work, three-electrode cells of Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95/YSZ/(La0.8Sr0.2)MnO3-x have been used to obtain new electrochemical data on the sulphur poisoning behaviour of Ni-based SOFC anodes operating at different current densities in the temperature range 700-750 degrees C.",The effect of current density on H2S-poisoning of nickel-based solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.089
3,14930,"The three-electrode arrangement enabled direct measurement of anode overpotential, with concurrent impedance measurement to provide detail into the electrochemical processes occurring at the anode during sulphur poisoning.",The effect of current density on H2S-poisoning of nickel-based solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.089
4,14930,"The initial, stepwise degradation on exposure to 0.5 ppm H2S caused an increase in anode polarization resistance, which was almost entirely recoverable on removal of H2S. Operation at higher current density was found to result in a smaller increase in anode polarization resistance.",The effect of current density on H2S-poisoning of nickel-based solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.089
5,14930,It is proposed that this initial poisoning behaviour is caused by adsorbed sulphur inhibiting surface diffusion of H atoms to active sites.,The effect of current density on H2S-poisoning of nickel-based solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.089
6,14930,Exposure to 1 ppm and 3 ppm levels of H2S led to an observed secondary degradation which was also recoverable on removal of sulphur.,The effect of current density on H2S-poisoning of nickel-based solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.089
7,14930,"This degradation was caused by an increased ohmic resistance, and was more severe at higher temperatures.",The effect of current density on H2S-poisoning of nickel-based solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.089
