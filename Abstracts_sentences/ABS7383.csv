2,7383,Microstructural studies indicate that the multilayer films have excellent single-crystal quality and epitaxial nature.,Ultrafast oxygen exchange kinetics on highly epitaxial PrBaCo2O5+δ thin films,10.1063/1.4712123
3,7383,The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements reveal that the PBCO film electrodes have a polarization resistance as low as 0.109 Omega cm(2) at 597 degrees C in air and an ultrafast surface exchange coefficient (0.006 cm/s at 598 degrees C) with low activation energy (0.77 eV).,Ultrafast oxygen exchange kinetics on highly epitaxial PrBaCo2O5+δ thin films,10.1063/1.4712123
4,7383,The low polarization resistance and rapid surface oxygen exchange kinetics suggest that the PBCO can be an excellent cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Ultrafast oxygen exchange kinetics on highly epitaxial PrBaCo2O5+δ thin films,10.1063/1.4712123
