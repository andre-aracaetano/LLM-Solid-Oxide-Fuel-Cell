2,17772,The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the synthesised powder showed the complete calcination/crystallisation of the resultant precipitates to take place at 500 degrees C.,Green synthesis and characterisation of nanocrystalline NiO-GDC powders with low activation energy for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.177
3,17772,"The prepared NiO-GDC powder was coated on a GDC electrolyte disc and co-sintered at 1300 degrees C. A mixture of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta and GDC was used as the cathode material and subsequently coated onto the anode-electrolyte bilayer, resulting in the fabrication of a NiO-GDC vertical bar GDC vertical bar La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-GDC cell.",Green synthesis and characterisation of nanocrystalline NiO-GDC powders with low activation energy for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.177
4,17772,The crystallite size of both NiO and CeO2 phases were estimated using the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) profiles and were calculated to be similar to 14 nm.,Green synthesis and characterisation of nanocrystalline NiO-GDC powders with low activation energy for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.177
5,17772,"Applied H-2 temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) analysis indicated a synergetic effect among different anode composites' constituents, where an intense interaction between the dispersed NiO nanocrystalline particles and the GDC crystallite phase had weakened the metal-oxygen bonds in the synthesised anode composites, resulting in a strikingly high catalytic activity at temperatures as low as 300 degrees C.",Green synthesis and characterisation of nanocrystalline NiO-GDC powders with low activation energy for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.177
6,17772,The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the electrochemical performance of the fabricated cells were measured over a broad range of operating temperatures (500-750 degrees C) and H-2/Ar-ratios of the anode fuel (e.g. 100%-15%).,Green synthesis and characterisation of nanocrystalline NiO-GDC powders with low activation energy for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.177
