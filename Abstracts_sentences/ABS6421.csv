3,6421,The liquid fuels were injected directly into the anode compartment and the performance for each fuel with 50% N-2 dilution was stable for a period of at least 12 h. Photographs of Cu-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and Ni-YSZ composites exposed to 50% toluene in N-2 at 973 K fur 1.5 h showed little carbon formation on the Cu-YSZ but demonstrated that the Ni-YSZ was covered with carbon and fractured by this environment.,Direct oxidation of liquid fuels in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1374216
