4,9725,"Although LSFC is robust under typical SSOFC conditions at 500 degrees C, in-situ X-ray diffraction studies at 800 degrees C in reducing atmospheres show that its perovkite structure can undergo a slow, pO(2)-dependent structural change, forming a LaSrFeO4-based Ruddlesden-Popper phase plus alpha-Fe, a process which can be reversed in air at 800 degrees C. For LSFC-3, this phase change occurs when the pO(2) of the fuel is lower than 1.9 x 10(-21) atm.",Sr-rich chromium ferrites as symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.02.024

7,9725,"Extended full cell tests also show that the LSFC-3 anode performs very well in wet 1:1 H-2:CO fuels (pO(2) > 1.9 x 10(-21) atm) that contain 10 ppm H2S, demonstrating the excellent versatility of this electrode material.",Sr-rich chromium ferrites as symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.02.024
