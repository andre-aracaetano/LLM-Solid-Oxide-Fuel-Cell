2,12283,The methane oxidation behavior and the polarization resistance of the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with the perovsldte oxides as anode was subsequently measured as a function of operation temperature.,"Catalytic activity of perovskite-type doped La0.08Sr0.92Ti1-xMxO3-δ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) oxides for methane oxidation",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.008
3,12283,Surface atomic concentrations of the perovskite oxides were evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and their relationship to the catalytic activity were discussed with respect to the transition metal dopant.,"Catalytic activity of perovskite-type doped La0.08Sr0.92Ti1-xMxO3-δ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) oxides for methane oxidation",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.008
4,12283,"The complete oxidation of methane was predominant in the low-temperature region, while the partial oxidation of methane occurred at high temperatures.","Catalytic activity of perovskite-type doped La0.08Sr0.92Ti1-xMxO3-δ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) oxides for methane oxidation",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.008
5,12283,Fe- and Co-doped perovsldtes showed better catalytic activity for the methane oxidation reaction than Mn-doped powder.,"Catalytic activity of perovskite-type doped La0.08Sr0.92Ti1-xMxO3-δ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) oxides for methane oxidation",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.008
6,12283,This phenomenon could be explained by the high atomic concentration with low oxidation states and the resulting high oxygen vacancy concentration in the Fe- and Co-doped perovskite powder samples.,"Catalytic activity of perovskite-type doped La0.08Sr0.92Ti1-xMxO3-δ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) oxides for methane oxidation",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.008
