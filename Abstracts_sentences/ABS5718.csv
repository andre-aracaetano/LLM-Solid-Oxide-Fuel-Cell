2,5718,"A photo-acoustic instrument provided direct measurements of solid carbon concentration in the reformer effluent stream, which could be correlated to reformate gas composition (as determined via mass spectrometer) and reformer temperature.",Measurement and analysis of carbon formation during diesel reforming for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.12.034

4,5718,"It was determined that oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O/C), fuel utilization fraction and anode recycle fraction all influence the degree of carbon formation, and that once significant carbon concentration is measured, the reformer performance begins to show marked degradation.",Measurement and analysis of carbon formation during diesel reforming for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.12.034
