1,9677,"To improve electrochemical performance and thermal expansion compatibility of LnBaCoFeO(5+delta) (P(N) BCF; Ln-Pr and Nd) double perovskite cathodes, P(N) BCF-xCe(0.8)-Sm0.2O1.9 (P(N) BCF-xSDC; x = 20-50 wt%) composites were developed as potential cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Improved electrochemical performance and thermal expansion compatibility of LnBaCoFeO5+δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (Ln=Pr and Nd) composite cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.05.322
2,9677,P(N) BCF materials exhibited good chemical compatibility with SDC at 1150 degrees C for 5 h. Electrical conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the P(N) BCF-xSDC composite cathodes decreased with increasing SDC content.,Improved electrochemical performance and thermal expansion compatibility of LnBaCoFeO5+δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (Ln=Pr and Nd) composite cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.05.322
3,9677,The introduction of SDC into P(N) BCF improved the electrochemical performance of P(N) BCF-xSDC composite cathodes.,Improved electrochemical performance and thermal expansion compatibility of LnBaCoFeO5+δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (Ln=Pr and Nd) composite cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.05.322
4,9677,"The P(N) BCF-xSDC composite cathodes containing 40 wt% and 30 wt% SDC displayed the best electrochemical performance: the area specific resistances were 0.037 and 0.046 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C; the maximum power densities achieved 960 and 891 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C for PBCF-40SDC and NBCF-30SDC composite cathodes, respectively.",Improved electrochemical performance and thermal expansion compatibility of LnBaCoFeO5+δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (Ln=Pr and Nd) composite cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.05.322
5,9677,"These results suggested that the introduction of SDC into P(N) BCF cathodes was very effective in reducing the TEC and improving the electrochemical performance, making the PBCF-40SDC and NBCF-30SDC composites more suitable as IT-SOFC cathodes.",Improved electrochemical performance and thermal expansion compatibility of LnBaCoFeO5+δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (Ln=Pr and Nd) composite cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.05.322
