2,10766,The effects of cosintering temperatures of cathode and anode with electrolyte and the additions of metal oxide (Bi2O3 and CeO2) in the anode on the microstructures and electrochemical properties were investigated.,Improving the electrochemical properties of SSZ electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.048
3,10766,The carbon deposition behaviors of the anode with added CeO2 were also evaluated.,Improving the electrochemical properties of SSZ electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.048
4,10766,"Results indicated that the maximum power density (P-max) initially increased from 0.28 W/cm(2) (1150 degrees C) to 0.35 W/cm(2) (1250 degrees C), and then decreased to 0.33 W/cm(2) (1300 degrees C) with the increase in co-sintering temperature from 1150 degrees C to 1300 degrees C.",Improving the electrochemical properties of SSZ electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.048
5,10766,The variation tendency of P-max was attributed to a complex combination of the bond strength increase of the interfaces and the densification of the electrodes with the increase of the co-sintering temperature.,Improving the electrochemical properties of SSZ electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.048
