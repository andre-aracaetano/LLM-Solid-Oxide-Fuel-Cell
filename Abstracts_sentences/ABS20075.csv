1,20075,A novel method for the formation of the protective layer on stainless steel interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cells was developed.,"Protective Coatings La-Mn-Cu-O for Stainless-Steel Interconnector 08D17D¢ for SOFC, Obtained by the Electrocrystallization Method from Non-Aqueous Solutions",10.3103/S1067821218010029
2,20075,The method was based on the electrocrystallization of metals from non-aqueous solutions on the stainless-steel interconnector with consecutive thermal treatments.,"Protective Coatings La-Mn-Cu-O for Stainless-Steel Interconnector 08D17D¢ for SOFC, Obtained by the Electrocrystallization Method from Non-Aqueous Solutions",10.3103/S1067821218010029
3,20075,Suggested method was applied for the stainless-steel 08X17T. Chemical composition of the electrolyte for the electrocrystallization was made in order to obtain the oxide protective layer of the stainless-steel interconnector of the following composition: LaMn0.9Cu0.1O3.,"Protective Coatings La-Mn-Cu-O for Stainless-Steel Interconnector 08D17D¢ for SOFC, Obtained by the Electrocrystallization Method from Non-Aqueous Solutions",10.3103/S1067821218010029
4,20075,"As a result, a uniform oxide layer was formed on the stainless-steel interconnector surface, protected the stainless-steel from the high-temperature oxidation leading to degradation of the functional properties of the interconnector.","Protective Coatings La-Mn-Cu-O for Stainless-Steel Interconnector 08D17D¢ for SOFC, Obtained by the Electrocrystallization Method from Non-Aqueous Solutions",10.3103/S1067821218010029
5,20075,"Forming coatings were characterized by means of grazing incidence X-rays diffraction, X-rays photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy.","Protective Coatings La-Mn-Cu-O for Stainless-Steel Interconnector 08D17D¢ for SOFC, Obtained by the Electrocrystallization Method from Non-Aqueous Solutions",10.3103/S1067821218010029
6,20075,Elemental analysis and phase composition have shown that the main components of the protective coatings are found to be compounds with perovskite and spinel structures.,"Protective Coatings La-Mn-Cu-O for Stainless-Steel Interconnector 08D17D¢ for SOFC, Obtained by the Electrocrystallization Method from Non-Aqueous Solutions",10.3103/S1067821218010029
7,20075,The protective coating in the contact with cathode material based on lanthanum-strontium manganite shows significant decrease of chromium propagation from the stainless steel as a result of the diffusive firing in comparison with the sample of the stainless steel without the protective coating.,"Protective Coatings La-Mn-Cu-O for Stainless-Steel Interconnector 08D17D¢ for SOFC, Obtained by the Electrocrystallization Method from Non-Aqueous Solutions",10.3103/S1067821218010029
8,20075,Electrical resistance of the interconnector with the protective coating does not show noticeable degradation during at least 500 h at the temperature 850A degrees C in ambient air.,"Protective Coatings La-Mn-Cu-O for Stainless-Steel Interconnector 08D17D¢ for SOFC, Obtained by the Electrocrystallization Method from Non-Aqueous Solutions",10.3103/S1067821218010029
