1,16107,"The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system is complicated because the characteristics of gas, heat, and electricity are intricately coupled.",A Comparative Study of the Kalman Filter and the LSTM Network for the Remaining Useful Life Prediction of SOFC,10.3390/en16093628
2,16107,"During the operation of the system, problems such as frequent failures and a decrease in the stack's performance have caused the SOFC system to work less well and greatly shortened the SOFC's practical life.",A Comparative Study of the Kalman Filter and the LSTM Network for the Remaining Useful Life Prediction of SOFC,10.3390/en16093628
3,16107,"As such, it is essential to accurately forecast its remaining useful life (RUL) to make the system last longer and cut down on economic losses.",A Comparative Study of the Kalman Filter and the LSTM Network for the Remaining Useful Life Prediction of SOFC,10.3390/en16093628
4,16107,"In this study, both model-based and data-driven prediction methods are used to make predictions about the RUL of SOFC.",A Comparative Study of the Kalman Filter and the LSTM Network for the Remaining Useful Life Prediction of SOFC,10.3390/en16093628
5,16107,"First, the linear degradation model of the SOFC system is established by introducing degradation resistance as the index of health status.",A Comparative Study of the Kalman Filter and the LSTM Network for the Remaining Useful Life Prediction of SOFC,10.3390/en16093628
6,16107,"Using the Kalman filtering (KF) method, the health status of SOFC is evaluated online.",A Comparative Study of the Kalman Filter and the LSTM Network for the Remaining Useful Life Prediction of SOFC,10.3390/en16093628

10,16107,"Finally, a comparison is made between the LSTM network prediction approach suggested and the model-based KF prognostics.",A Comparative Study of the Kalman Filter and the LSTM Network for the Remaining Useful Life Prediction of SOFC,10.3390/en16093628
11,16107,The results of the experiments indicate that the LSTM network is more suitable for RUL prediction than the KF algorithm.,A Comparative Study of the Kalman Filter and the LSTM Network for the Remaining Useful Life Prediction of SOFC,10.3390/en16093628
