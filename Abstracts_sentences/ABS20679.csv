2,20679,"In this manuscript, barium cerium yttrium zirconate (Ba(Zr0.5Ce0.4)(8/9)Y0.2O2.9) and strontium cerium yttrium zirconate (SrZr0.5Ce0.4Y0.1O2.95), proton conducting perovskites were employed as solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrolytes for hydrogen production via intermediate temperature steam electrolysis at 550 and 600 degrees C. Cathode-supported button cells examined for a 12 m Ba(Zr0.5Ce0.4)(8/9)Y0.2O2.9 electrolyte, with Ni-SrZr0.5Ce0.4Y0.1O2.95 as the H-2-electrode, and porous Ba0.5La0.5CoO3",Efficient intermediate-temperature steam electrolysis with Y : SrZrO3-SrCeO3 and Y : BaZrO3-BaCeO3 proton conducting perovskites,10.1039/c8ta04019b
