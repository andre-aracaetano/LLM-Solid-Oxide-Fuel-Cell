6,20601,"A significant carbon deposition was observed in the Ni/SDC anode in CH4, but the carbon deposition observed in Ni(BaO)/ SDC was less.",Anodic Performance of BaO-Added Ni/SDC for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed With Dry CH4,10.3389/fenrg.2021.652239
7,20601,"From the DC electrical resistance measurement of the anode films, a remarkable decrease in resistance was observed in Ni/SDC due to the carbon deposition after CH4 exposure.",Anodic Performance of BaO-Added Ni/SDC for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed With Dry CH4,10.3389/fenrg.2021.652239
8,20601,The resistance of Ni(BaO)/SDC was higher than that of Ni/SDC and did not change even after CH4 exposure because of the less carbon deposit.,Anodic Performance of BaO-Added Ni/SDC for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed With Dry CH4,10.3389/fenrg.2021.652239
9,20601,The high dispersibility of Ni particles was confirmed in both anodes and was particularly remarkable in Ni(BaO)/SDC.,Anodic Performance of BaO-Added Ni/SDC for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed With Dry CH4,10.3389/fenrg.2021.652239
10,20601,The highest anodic performance in Ni(BaO)/SDC was attributed to the high Ni dispersibility which might promote CH4 decomposition by producing less carbon deposit.,Anodic Performance of BaO-Added Ni/SDC for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed With Dry CH4,10.3389/fenrg.2021.652239
11,20601,It was speculated that the higher cell output in CH4 than that in H-2 is due to the locally high concentration of H-2 and/or CO gas on the anode surface by the promotion of CH4 decomposition.,Anodic Performance of BaO-Added Ni/SDC for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed With Dry CH4,10.3389/fenrg.2021.652239
