1,5855,The direct application of glycerol in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) for power generation has been demonstrated experimentally but the detailed mechanisms are not well understood due to the lack of comprehensive modeling study.,Modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with internal glycerol steam reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.001
2,5855,"In this paper, a numerical model is developed to study the glycerol-fueled SOFC.",Modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with internal glycerol steam reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.001
3,5855,"After model validation, the simulated SOFC demonstrates a performance of 7827 A m(-2) at 0.6 V, with a glycerol conversion rate of 49% at 1073 K.",Modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with internal glycerol steam reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.001
4,5855,"Then, parametric analyses are conducted to understand the effects of operation conditions on cell performance.",Modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with internal glycerol steam reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.001
5,5855,It is found that the SOFC performance increases with decreasing operating voltage or increasing inlet temperature.,Modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with internal glycerol steam reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.001
6,5855,"However, increasing either the fuel flow rate or steam to glycerol ratio could decrease the cell performance.",Modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with internal glycerol steam reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.001
7,5855,"It is also interesting to find out that the contribution of H-2 and CO to the total current density is significantly different under various operating conditions, even sometimes CO dominates while H-2 plays a negative role.",Modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with internal glycerol steam reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.001
8,5855,This is different from our conventional understanding that usually H-2 contributes more significantly to current generation.,Modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with internal glycerol steam reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.001
9,5855,"In addition, cooling measures are needed to ensure the long-term stability of the cell when operating at a high current density.",Modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with internal glycerol steam reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.03.001
