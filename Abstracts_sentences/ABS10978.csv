1,10978,This paper investigates the effective steady-state creep response of porous Ni-YSZ composites used in solid oxide fuel cell applications by numerical homogenization based on three-dimensional microstructural reconstructions and steady-state creep properties of the constituent phases.,Computation of Effective Steady-State Creep of Porous Ni-YSZ Composites with Reconstructed Microstructures,10.1111/jace.13712
2,10978,The Ni phase is found to carry insignificant stress in the composite and has a negligible role in the effective creep behavior.,Computation of Effective Steady-State Creep of Porous Ni-YSZ Composites with Reconstructed Microstructures,10.1111/jace.13712
3,10978,"Thus, when determining effective creep, porous Ni-YSZ composites can be regarded as porous YSZ in which the Ni phase is counted as additional porosity.",Computation of Effective Steady-State Creep of Porous Ni-YSZ Composites with Reconstructed Microstructures,10.1111/jace.13712
4,10978,"The stress exponents of porous YSZ are the same as that of dense YSZ, but the effective creep rate increases by a factor of 8-10 due to porosity.",Computation of Effective Steady-State Creep of Porous Ni-YSZ Composites with Reconstructed Microstructures,10.1111/jace.13712
5,10978,The relationship of creep rate and volume fraction of YSZ computed by numerical homogenization is underestimated by most existing analytical models.,Computation of Effective Steady-State Creep of Porous Ni-YSZ Composites with Reconstructed Microstructures,10.1111/jace.13712
6,10978,The Ramakrishnan-Arunchalam creep model provides the closest approximation among all analytical models.,Computation of Effective Steady-State Creep of Porous Ni-YSZ Composites with Reconstructed Microstructures,10.1111/jace.13712
