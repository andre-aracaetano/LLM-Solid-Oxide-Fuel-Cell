1,10563,The increasing quality and durability of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) state-of-the-art materials renders the long-term testing of fuel cells difficult since considerably long equipment times are needed to obtain valuable results.,Segmented cell testing for cathode parameter investigation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.034
2,10563,"Moreover, reproducibility issues are common due to the high sensitivity of the performance and degradation on the testing conditions.",Segmented cell testing for cathode parameter investigation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.034
3,10563,"An original segmented cell configuration has been adopted in order to carry out four tests in parallel, thus decreasing the total experimental time and ensuring the same operating conditions for the four segments.",Segmented cell testing for cathode parameter investigation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.034
4,10563,The investigation has been performed on both anode-supported cells and symmetrical Lanthanum-Strontium Manganite-Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (LSM-YSZ) electrolyte-supported cells.,Segmented cell testing for cathode parameter investigation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.034
5,10563,"In separate tests, the influence of variables like cathode thickness, current density and cathode composition on performance and degradation have been explored on anode-supported cells.",Segmented cell testing for cathode parameter investigation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.034
6,10563,"Furthermore, the effect of chromium poisoning has been studied on electrolyte-supported symmetric cells by contacting one segment with a chromium-iron interconnect material.",Segmented cell testing for cathode parameter investigation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.034
