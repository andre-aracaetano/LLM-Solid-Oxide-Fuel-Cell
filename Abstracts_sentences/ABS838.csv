2,838,"Similarly, there is little information on the structure and phase assemblage of solid fuels exposed to typical environments found in direct carbon fuel cells.",In situ high-temperature powder diffraction studies of solid oxide electrolyte direct carbon fuel cell materials in the presence of brown coal,10.1007/s10853-015-9712-7
3,838,"In this paper, we use in situ high-resolution synchrotron powder diffraction on conventional high-temperature fuel cell materials and untreated brown coal to assess the stability and reactivity of these materials at various temperatures up to 850 A degrees C. Materials investigated include nickel metal (Ni), gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) and yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ).",In situ high-temperature powder diffraction studies of solid oxide electrolyte direct carbon fuel cell materials in the presence of brown coal,10.1007/s10853-015-9712-7
4,838,"The phase stability, crystallite size, lattice parameters and associated linear coefficient of thermal expansion were determined.",In situ high-temperature powder diffraction studies of solid oxide electrolyte direct carbon fuel cell materials in the presence of brown coal,10.1007/s10853-015-9712-7
5,838,The phase stability of all fuel cell materials was found to be good with no additional phase formation noted either during heating or after prolonged periods at temperature.,In situ high-temperature powder diffraction studies of solid oxide electrolyte direct carbon fuel cell materials in the presence of brown coal,10.1007/s10853-015-9712-7
