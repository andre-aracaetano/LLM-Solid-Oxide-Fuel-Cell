1,10079,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) hold great promise for reducing global air pollution, but the cost and fragility of current stacks is severely limiting the number of potential applications.",Reaction-diffusion of fuel with air between planar solid oxide fuel cells stacked with ceramic felt,10.1098/rspa.1996.0141
2,10079,This paper reports a new system devised to overcome these problems by stacking the zirconia plates together using a porous ceramic felt material.,Reaction-diffusion of fuel with air between planar solid oxide fuel cells stacked with ceramic felt,10.1098/rspa.1996.0141
3,10079,A sub-unit of this stack has been experimentally tested and mathematically modelled as a reaction-diffusion system.,Reaction-diffusion of fuel with air between planar solid oxide fuel cells stacked with ceramic felt,10.1098/rspa.1996.0141
4,10079,"A novel transition layer solution was derived which predicted the experimentally measured trends in electrode potential as a function of position on the zirconia plate, plate sire, fuel feed rate and ceramic felt thickness.",Reaction-diffusion of fuel with air between planar solid oxide fuel cells stacked with ceramic felt,10.1098/rspa.1996.0141
5,10079,The conclusion was that the mathematical solution gave an adequate description of the observed behaviour and could be used to design planar SOFC stacks (and related reaction-diffusion systems) where plate-centre reactant feeds are used.,Reaction-diffusion of fuel with air between planar solid oxide fuel cells stacked with ceramic felt,10.1098/rspa.1996.0141
