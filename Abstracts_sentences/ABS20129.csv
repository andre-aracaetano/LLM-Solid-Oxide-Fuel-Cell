1,20129,"Mechanistic analysis of oxygen transfer in an atomic-scale structure is important for various applications, such as the three-way catalysts for treating NOx in automotive exhaust and solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte materials.","Analysis of atomic structure, magnetic ordering, and oxygen diffusion in oxygen deficient Sr3Fe2O7-δ perovskite: Toward rational catalysts design",10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.015801
2,20129,It has been shown that the n = 2 Ruddlesden-Popper phases Sr3Fe2O7.0-delta have superior oxygen storage capacity compared to the conventional CeO2-ZrO2.,"Analysis of atomic structure, magnetic ordering, and oxygen diffusion in oxygen deficient Sr3Fe2O7-δ perovskite: Toward rational catalysts design",10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.015801
3,20129,"Atomic structure, magnetic ordering, charged defects arising due to oxygen vacancies, and the effect of lattice parameters on the ionic transport in Sr3Fe2O7.0-delta within the oxygen content of 5.75 to 7.0 were investigated by using DFT+U calculations.","Analysis of atomic structure, magnetic ordering, and oxygen diffusion in oxygen deficient Sr3Fe2O7-δ perovskite: Toward rational catalysts design",10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.015801
4,20129,"In the case of Sr3Fe2O6.0-7.0, the oxidation reaction energies were found to be almost independent of the initial oxygen content.","Analysis of atomic structure, magnetic ordering, and oxygen diffusion in oxygen deficient Sr3Fe2O7-δ perovskite: Toward rational catalysts design",10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.015801
5,20129,We investigated the activation energies of oxygen diffusion by using the equilibrium and compressively strained lattice parameters for Sr3Fe2O6.5.,"Analysis of atomic structure, magnetic ordering, and oxygen diffusion in oxygen deficient Sr3Fe2O7-δ perovskite: Toward rational catalysts design",10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.015801
6,20129,"The activation energies were found to be nearly proportional to the volume of the unit cell; namely, as the volume of the unit cell increases, the activation energy decreases.","Analysis of atomic structure, magnetic ordering, and oxygen diffusion in oxygen deficient Sr3Fe2O7-δ perovskite: Toward rational catalysts design",10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.015801
7,20129,"It was found that in the oxygen diffusion process the activation energy increases as the bond length between iron and oxygen decreases and the bond length is minimum in the transition state, indicating that the iron-oxygen repulsive interaction is the origin of the activation energy.","Analysis of atomic structure, magnetic ordering, and oxygen diffusion in oxygen deficient Sr3Fe2O7-δ perovskite: Toward rational catalysts design",10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.015801
8,20129,"Moreover, in addition to the dominant migration pathway in Sr3Fe2O6.0-7.0, a new migration pathway in Sr3Fe2O5.75-6.0 was found.","Analysis of atomic structure, magnetic ordering, and oxygen diffusion in oxygen deficient Sr3Fe2O7-δ perovskite: Toward rational catalysts design",10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.6.015801
