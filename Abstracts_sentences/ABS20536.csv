1,20536,The impact of long-term exposure of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 - delta to SO2-containing atmospheres was investigated.,Degradation and regeneration of the SOFC cathode material La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ in SO2-containing atmospheres,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.01.009
2,20536,"In-situ dc-conductivity relaxation measurements showed a decrease in the chemical surface exchange coefficient of oxygen (k(chem)) during the course of 1000 h in an atmosphere with either a few ppb or 2 ppm SO2 at 700 degrees C. Post-test analyses by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and analytical transmission electron microscopy indicated that SrSO4 crystals with diameters of 100 nm-1 mu m are formed during the degradation, in addition to a nanocrystalline 100-300 nm thick multi-phase layer and LaCoO3 - delta at grain boundaries.",Degradation and regeneration of the SOFC cathode material La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ in SO2-containing atmospheres,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.01.009

4,20536,It could be shown that a partial re-activation of the degraded specimen takes place at 750-850 degrees C even in an atmosphere with 2 ppm SO2.,Degradation and regeneration of the SOFC cathode material La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ in SO2-containing atmospheres,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.01.009
5,20536,This regeneration is ascribed to the in-situ formation of catalytically active LaCoO3 - delta nanoparticles at the surface.,Degradation and regeneration of the SOFC cathode material La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ in SO2-containing atmospheres,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.01.009
6,20536,"However, a subsequent degradation follows independently of the SO2 content of the atmosphere when the sample is kept for 1000 h at 850-900 degrees C. Post-test analyses indicate that this effect is due to a strong grain growth of the LaCoO3 - delta nanocrystals which leads to a loss in the catalytic activity.",Degradation and regeneration of the SOFC cathode material La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ in SO2-containing atmospheres,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.01.009
