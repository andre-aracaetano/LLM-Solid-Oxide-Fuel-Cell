1,6576,"In this study, pillar shaped yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) 3D microstructures with similar to 60 to 90 mu m diameter and 12 to 20 mu m height are fabricated by 3D inkjet printing to improve the topology of the electrolyte/cathode interface.",Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with 3D Inkjet Printing Modified LSM-YSZ Interface,10.1149/2162-8777/ad4fbf
2,6576,The microstructures increase the surface area of the cell by similar to 2.4% to 4.0% and enhance the connection between the dense YSZ electrolyte and mixed YSZ-lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) cathode.,Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with 3D Inkjet Printing Modified LSM-YSZ Interface,10.1149/2162-8777/ad4fbf
3,6576,The morphology and microstructure of the YSZ interface are characterized with scanning electron microscopy.,Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with 3D Inkjet Printing Modified LSM-YSZ Interface,10.1149/2162-8777/ad4fbf
4,6576,"Polarization curves confirm that the power density improves by 47% to 107% at 0.55 V, depending on the dimensions of the microstructures, in comparison to a flat interface.",Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with 3D Inkjet Printing Modified LSM-YSZ Interface,10.1149/2162-8777/ad4fbf
5,6576,The non-linear improvement in power density with the size of microstructures is confirmed by calculating the uncertainty with repeated tests.,Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with 3D Inkjet Printing Modified LSM-YSZ Interface,10.1149/2162-8777/ad4fbf
6,6576,"Based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and distribution of relaxation times analysis, the performance improvement is attributed to changes in the oxygen surface exchange kinetics and O2- diffusivity in the cathode.",Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with 3D Inkjet Printing Modified LSM-YSZ Interface,10.1149/2162-8777/ad4fbf
