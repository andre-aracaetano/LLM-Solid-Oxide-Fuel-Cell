7,1173,"tests, it was found that the use of chars obtained from coconut or hazelnut shells as solid fuels for solid oxide fuel cells, SOFC, allowed to obtain the power d. P in the range of 90-110 mW/cm(2) at 850 degrees C. For a hydrogen-oxygen SOFC, the power d. P was similar to 210 mW/cm(2) at 850 degrees C.",Utilization of waste materials from the food industry as fuels to power solid oxide fuel cells,10.15199/62.2022.12.11
