1,11267,"Uniform, dense, and conformal coatings of (La,Sr)MnO3-delta (LSM) have been successfully deposited on a silicon wafer and a dense (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-delta (LSCF) substrate using a stable LSM sol consisting of metal acetate and nitrate precursors dissolved in a mixed organic solvent of 2-methoxyethanol and acetic acid with enhanced wettability.",Preparation and Characterization of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ (LSM) Thin Films and LSM/LSCF Interface for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04614.x
2,11267,"The processing conditions are optimized for precise control of composition, morphology, microstructure, and thickness of the LSM films to examine the microstructure and chemical stability of an LSM film as a catalytic coating for an LSCF cathode.",Preparation and Characterization of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ (LSM) Thin Films and LSM/LSCF Interface for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04614.x
3,11267,The thicknesses of the LSM films are controlled within the range of 5-60 nm by spin-coating of LSM sol with different concentrations.,Preparation and Characterization of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ (LSM) Thin Films and LSM/LSCF Interface for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04614.x
4,11267,The LSM films grow epitaxially on the LSCF substrate grains after annealing at 800 degrees C for 1 h due to their structural similarity.,Preparation and Characterization of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ (LSM) Thin Films and LSM/LSCF Interface for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04614.x
5,11267,"The LSM coatings show good stability on LSCF substrates and may suppress strontium oxide segregation on LSCF surface during annealing at 850 degrees C for 900 h, implying that LSM-coated LSCF surfaces have better structural and chemical stability under typical fuel cell operating conditions.",Preparation and Characterization of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ (LSM) Thin Films and LSM/LSCF Interface for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.04614.x
