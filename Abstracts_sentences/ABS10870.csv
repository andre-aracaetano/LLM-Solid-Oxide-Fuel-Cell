1,10870,Thin films of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9-delta (CGO) are deposited by flame spray deposition with a deposition rate of about 30 nm min(-1).,Properties of Flame Sprayed Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9-δ Electrolyte Thin Films,10.1002/adfm.201001622
2,10870,"The films (deposited at 200 degrees C) are dense, smooth, and particle-free and show a biphasic amorphous/nanocrystalline microstructure.",Properties of Flame Sprayed Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9-δ Electrolyte Thin Films,10.1002/adfm.201001622
3,10870,Isothermal grain growth and microstrain are determined as a function of dwell time and temperature and correlated to the electrical conductivity.,Properties of Flame Sprayed Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9-δ Electrolyte Thin Films,10.1002/adfm.201001622
4,10870,"CGO films annealed for 10 h at 600 degrees C present the best electrical conductivity of 0.46 S m(-1) measured at 550 degrees C. Reasons for the superior performance of films annealed at low temperature over higher-temperature-treated samples are discussed and include grain-size evolution, microstrain relaxation, and chemical decomposition.",Properties of Flame Sprayed Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9-δ Electrolyte Thin Films,10.1002/adfm.201001622
5,10870,Nanoindentation measurements are conducted on the CGO thin films as a function of annealing temperature to determine the hardness and elastic modulus of the films for potential application as free-standing electrolyte membranes in low-temperature micro-SOFCs (solid oxide fuel cells).,Properties of Flame Sprayed Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9-δ Electrolyte Thin Films,10.1002/adfm.201001622
