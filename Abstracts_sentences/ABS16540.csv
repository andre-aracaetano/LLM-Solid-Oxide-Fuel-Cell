2,16540,"Nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ), nickel/scandia-stabilized zirconia (Ni/ScSZ) cermets, ScSZ, Ce(0.8)Gd(0.2)d(1.9) (CGO), and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-CGO were used as materials of anode substrate, anode functional layer, electrolyte, interlayer and cathode, respectively.",A study of multilayer tape casting method for anode-supported planar type solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.07.110
3,16540,"The powders of these functional layers were ball milled with organic additives to form slurries, which were assembled together with the multilayer tape casting procedure to get the green tapes.",A study of multilayer tape casting method for anode-supported planar type solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.07.110
4,16540,"After dryness, the green tape was co-sintered at 1400 degrees C for 4 h in air to get the large area anode-supported electrolyte film (thickness similar to 15 mu m).",A study of multilayer tape casting method for anode-supported planar type solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.07.110
5,16540,"For cells preparation, LSCF-CGO composite cathode was deposited by screen-printing method and sintered at 1100 degrees C for 3 h. The area-specific resistance (ASR) of the obtained single cell was found to be similar to 0.99 Omega cm(2) at 850 degrees C with H-2/O-2 as the operating gases, and the maximum power density achieved similar to 0.63 W cm(-2).",A study of multilayer tape casting method for anode-supported planar type solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.07.110
