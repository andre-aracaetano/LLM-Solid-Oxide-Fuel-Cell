1,1166,"In this study, we compare the performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) having composite Cu-based anodes but made with the following low-temperature electrolytes: samaria-doped ceria (SDC), Sr- and Mg-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM), and scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ).",Development of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells for direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuels,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.019
2,1166,Performance (V-I) curves and impedance spectra were measured using H-2 and n-butane fuels at 973 K.,Development of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells for direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuels,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.019
3,1166,"The results suggest that the use of electrolyte materials with higher ionic conductivity can lead to improved anodes for direct-utilization SOFC, although the performance of each of the cells in n-butane appears to be at least partially limited by the electrochemical oxidation reaction.",Development of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells for direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuels,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.019
