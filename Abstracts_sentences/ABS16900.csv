2,16900,S cm(-1) at moderate temperatures (similar to 500-900 degrees C) offer the possibility for solid oxide fuel cells to operate with less maintenance.,Anisotropic oxide ion conduction in melilite intermediate temperature electrolytes,10.1039/c4ta05132g
3,16900,"This study of [A(1+x)B(1-x)](2)[Ga](2)[Ga2O7+x/2](2) (0 <= x <= 0.5) (A = La, Nd; B = Ca, Sr) layered-melilite found that in large single crystals intralayer oxide ion conduction is dominant.",Anisotropic oxide ion conduction in melilite intermediate temperature electrolytes,10.1039/c4ta05132g
4,16900,"This anisotropic behavior arises by relaxation about the interstitial oxygen through changes in the interlayer A and Ga coordination, and at 850 degrees C conductivities are similar to 0.008 S cm(-1) along the c direction and similar to 0.036 S cm(-1) perpendicular to the c axis.",Anisotropic oxide ion conduction in melilite intermediate temperature electrolytes,10.1039/c4ta05132g
5,16900,It is found that the ionic conductivity can be optimized by increasing the number of interstitial oxygen and reducing the size of interlayer cations.,Anisotropic oxide ion conduction in melilite intermediate temperature electrolytes,10.1039/c4ta05132g
