1,18785,Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3 (La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8) powders have been successfully synthesized from carbonate and oxides based on the principle of gelcasting.,Processing and electrical properties of doped-LaGaO3 by gelcasting,10.1016/S0272-8842(01)00013-X
2,18785,"X-ray diffraction patterns indicate the perovskite structure is formed without any second phases after sintering the powders at 1400 degreesC for 6 h. Compacts of the gelcast powders heated at 1000 degreesC were sintered to densities greater than 97% of theoretical at 1450 degreesC for 6-18 h; then the relative density decreased to 95.5% sintered for 36 h. From the XRD patterns and SEM photographs, some impure phases were observed for long-sintering samples.",Processing and electrical properties of doped-LaGaO3 by gelcasting,10.1016/S0272-8842(01)00013-X
3,18785,"The total electrical conductivity was greatly depended on the sintering time, whereas peak values were obtained when the pellet was sintered at 1450 degreesC for 24 h. A transitional temperature T* (at about 675 degreesC) in the plot of ln(sigmaT) vs 1000/T exhibits a somewhat higher activation energy at lower temperatures, due to the trapping of vacancies by the dopant cations for all sintering conditions.",Processing and electrical properties of doped-LaGaO3 by gelcasting,10.1016/S0272-8842(01)00013-X
