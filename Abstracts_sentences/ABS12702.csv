1,12702,"In order to improve product design efficiency and guarantee the high temperature struc-tural integrity during the long-term creep of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), the creep strength design method is studied by using the finite element method (FEM) and the response surface method (RSM) with considering the interaction between the geometric parameters.",High temperature creep strength design and optimization of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.261
2,12702,A multi-regression model representing the correlation between the sealant failure proba-bility and the geometric parameters is established for rapid estimation of creep strength and optimization design of geometric dimensions.,High temperature creep strength design and optimization of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.261
3,12702,The sealant failure probability is decreased from 0.994 to 0.015 by the optimization of SOFC geometrical size.,High temperature creep strength design and optimization of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.261
4,12702,And the error between results predicted by the FEM and results predicted by the multi-regression model is less than 10%.,High temperature creep strength design and optimization of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.261
