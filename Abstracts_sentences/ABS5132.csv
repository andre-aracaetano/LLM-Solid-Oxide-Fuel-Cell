1,5132,Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) membranes were developed in which zirconia-based electrolyte thin films were supported by a porous composite metal/ceramic current collector and were subjected to rapid thermal cycling between 475 and 1075 K (200 and 800 degreesC).,Metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell membranes for rapid thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.056
2,5132,The effects of this cycling on membrane performance were evaluated.,Metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell membranes for rapid thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.056
3,5132,"The membranes, not yet optimized for performance, showed a peak power density of 350 mW/cm(2) at 1175 K (900 degreesC) in laboratory-sized SOFCs, while rapid thermal cycling had only a marginal effect on cell performance.",Metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell membranes for rapid thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.056
4,5132,This resistance to cycling degradation is attributed to the close matching of thermal expansion coefficient of the porous cermet supporting current collector (PCC) with that of the zirconia electrolyte.,Metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell membranes for rapid thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.056
