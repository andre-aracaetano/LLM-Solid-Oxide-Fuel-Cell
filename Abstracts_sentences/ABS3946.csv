1,3946,The mixed gas of CH4 (50%) and CO2 (50%) was fed into the porous compacts of alumina-supported Ni (30 vol%) catalyst heated at 673-973 K. Hydrogen was produced by the reaction of the mixed gas (CH4 + CO2 -> 2CO + 2H(2)).,Synthesis of hydrogen and carbon monoxide from methane and carbon dioxide over Ni-Al2O3 catalyst,10.2109/jcersj2.116.374
2,3946,"A part of produced CO decomposed to CO2 and C (2CO -> CO2 + C) below 873 K. As a parallel reaction, the decomposition of CH4 occurred in the wide temperature range from 673-973 K. The carbon deposition suppressed the flow of the outlet gas.",Synthesis of hydrogen and carbon monoxide from methane and carbon dioxide over Ni-Al2O3 catalyst,10.2109/jcersj2.116.374
