1,10212,A necessary step in the use of natural gas (methane) in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is its preliminary conversion to hydrogen and carbon monoxide.,Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
2,10212,To perform methane conversion within fuel cells and avoid catalyst carbonization the molar ratio between methane and steam (or steam with carbon dioxide) should be 1:2 or higher at the SOFC inlet.,Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
3,10212,In this article two possible technological approaches to provide this desirable ratio in a combined SOFC-gas turbine system are compared.,Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
4,10212,The first approach involves generation of the required steam in the coupled gas turbine cycle.,Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
5,10212,The second (which is more traditional) involves recycling some part of the exhaust gases around the anodes of the SOFC stack.,Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
6,10212,"Exergy and energy analyses for the two SOFC-gas turbine systems are conducted to determine their efficiencies and capabilities to generate power at different rates of oxygen conductivity through the SOFC electrolyte (ion conductive membrane), as well as various efficiencies for natural gas conversion to electricity in the SOFC stack.",Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
7,10212,It is determined that with a fixed SOFC stack the scheme with recycling has higher exergy and energy efficiencies (requiring less natural gas for a fixed electricity output) and the scheme with steam generation is associated with a higher capability for power generation.,Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
8,10212,"The question of which scheme permits a higher reduction in natural gas consumption (per unit of time), in the case of its implementation instead of a contemporary combined gas turbine-steam power cycle is considered.",Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
9,10212,The greater capability of power generation while retaining high efficiency of fuel consumption in the scheme with steam generation makes its implementation more favorable.,Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
10,10212,This scheme provides a better relative reduction in natural gas consumption (relative to the scheme with exhaust gas recycling) calculated per unit of time which reaches values of about 20%.,Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
11,10212,"At higher values of oxygen conductivity and efficiency of natural gas conversion to electricity in the SOFC stack this relative reduction becomes less significant, remaining in the range of 3-8%.",Performance comparison of two combined SOFC-gas turbine systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.069
