2,12744,"However, ceria cannot be efficiently used with hydrogen and wet hydrocarbon fuels because its structure change (Ce(4+)-> Ce(3+)) causes a decline of mechanical strength under a reducing atmosphere.",Structural Stability of the GDC Electrolyte for Low Temperature SOFCs Depending on Fuels,10.1149/1.3465324
3,12744,"In this work, the structural stability test of the GDC electrolyte was investigated under H(2) and dry CH(4) atmospheres depending on the fuels at 650 degrees C.",Structural Stability of the GDC Electrolyte for Low Temperature SOFCs Depending on Fuels,10.1149/1.3465324
4,12744,"This study clearly confirmed from the scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and mechanical strength data that many more Ce(4+) ions transform into Ce(3+) ions under the reducing (H(2)) atmosphere",Structural Stability of the GDC Electrolyte for Low Temperature SOFCs Depending on Fuels,10.1149/1.3465324
