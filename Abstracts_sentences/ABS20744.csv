9,20744,The charge compensation for the divalent ion on the A-site is provided by the formation of Fe4+ ions on the B-site (in preference to Co4+ ions) and vacancies on the oxygen sublattice for low values of x. The large increase in the conductivity with x in the range from 0.6 to 0.8 is attributed to the substitution of Fe4+ ions by Co4+ ions.,"Crystal structure, thermal expansion and electrical conductivity of Nd0.7Sr0.3Fe1-xCoxO3 (0≤x≤0.8)",10.1016/S0921-5107(02)00058-2
