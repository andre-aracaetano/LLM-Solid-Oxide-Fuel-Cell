1,19467,Sodium bismuth titanate (NBT) based compounds have drawn significant attention because of high oxygen-ion conductivity which makes them a promising electrolyte candidate for solid oxide fuel cells.,Long-term conductivity stability of acceptor-doped Na0.54Bi0.46TiO3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.12.009
2,19467,The present work investigates the long-term conductivity stability of Na0.54Bi0.46TiO3-delta doped with acceptor cations such as Mg2+ and Ga3+ in 5% H-2-95% N-2 environment at 600 degrees C for 100 h. In-situ conductivity measurement performed using impedance spectroscopy indicates a significant loss in the conductivity in the first 20 h of ageing.,Long-term conductivity stability of acceptor-doped Na0.54Bi0.46TiO3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.12.009

6,19467,SEM analysis reveals the change in grain morphology during the course of ageing with the microstructure of 100 h aged sample is shown to contain several ruptured grains.,Long-term conductivity stability of acceptor-doped Na0.54Bi0.46TiO3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.12.009
7,19467,XPS results indicate the partial reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ which possibly leads to high n-type electronic conductivity in aged samples.,Long-term conductivity stability of acceptor-doped Na0.54Bi0.46TiO3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.12.009
8,19467,The conductivity loss is attributed to the decomposition of the perovskite phase while the sudden conductivity increase after 40 h of ageing is explained through n-type electronic conduction inside the NBT lattice.,Long-term conductivity stability of acceptor-doped Na0.54Bi0.46TiO3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.12.009
