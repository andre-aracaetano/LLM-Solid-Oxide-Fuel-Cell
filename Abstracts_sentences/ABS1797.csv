1,1797,"Solid oxide fuel cells comprised of an anode made from sintered and reduced mesoporous-NiO-YSZ are shown to provide stable current and power densities at the operating temperature of 800 degreesC and show better performance than cells with anode cermets made from mechanical mixtures of NiO and YSZ, attributable to the unique anode microstructure.",Practical solid oxide fuel cells with anodes derived from self-assembled mesoporous-NiO-YSZ,10.1039/b207393e
