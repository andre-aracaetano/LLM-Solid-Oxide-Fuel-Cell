1,13926,This work analyses the long-term behaviour of MoNi-CeO2 (MoNi-Ce) anode in a direct internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell (DIR-SOFC) fed by biogas containing simultaneously sulphur and siloxanes.,Long-term operation of a solid oxide fuel cell with MoNi-CeO2 as anode directly fed by biogas containing simultaneously sulphur and siloxane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229048
2,13926,Both impurities are common in biogas and it is considered that they damage SOFC performance.,Long-term operation of a solid oxide fuel cell with MoNi-CeO2 as anode directly fed by biogas containing simultaneously sulphur and siloxane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229048
3,13926,"An electrolyte supported cell with MoNi-Ce was operated under load demand (140 mA cm(-2)) at 750 degrees C in clean biogas for 116 h, followed by biogas with 10 ppm(v) H2S and 0.5 ppm(v) D4 siloxane (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) for 1737 h, and finally, clean biogas again for 96 h. Cell performance was periodically evaluated using electrochemical methods.",Long-term operation of a solid oxide fuel cell with MoNi-CeO2 as anode directly fed by biogas containing simultaneously sulphur and siloxane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.229048
