4,8847,Electrochemical performance of the Ni1-xCux-SDC anode supported cells was investigated at 600 degrees C when humidified (3% H2O) biomass-produced gas (BPG) was used as the fuel and stationary air as the oxidant.,Ni1-xCux alloy-based anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with biomass-produced gas as fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.025
5,8847,"With Ni-Cu alloys as anodes, carbon deposition was substantially suppressed and electrochemical performance of the cells was sustained for much longer periods of time.",Ni1-xCux alloy-based anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with biomass-produced gas as fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.025
6,8847,"For example, the power export of a Ni-SDC supported cell was only 50% of the initial value (200 mW cm(-2) at 0.5 V) after 20 min, while Ni0.8Cu0.2-SDC supported cells could maintain 90% of the initial power density (250 mW cm(-2) at 0.5 V) over a period of 10 h. The improved performance of the Ni-Cu alloy-based anodes is worth considering in developing SOFCs fueled directly with dilute hydrocarbons such as gases derived from biomass.",Ni1-xCux alloy-based anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with biomass-produced gas as fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.025
