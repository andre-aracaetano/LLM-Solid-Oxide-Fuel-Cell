1,10538,The cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) usually consist of Ni and an oxygen ion conductor such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and doped ceria (DCO).,"Ni-LnOx (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.035
2,10538,"In this work, Ni-LnO(x) cermets (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd), in which LnO(x) is not an oxygen ion conductor, are primarily investigated as the anodes for intermediate-temperature SOFCs.","Ni-LnOx (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.035
3,10538,The electrochemical performances of the Ni-LnO(x) anodes are characterized using single SOFCs with Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 composite cathodes and Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 electrolytes.,"Ni-LnOx (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.035
4,10538,"When humidified H-2 is used as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant, Ni-CeO2 and Ni-Gd2O3 anodes have exhibited very high performance, which is comparable to that of Ni-DCO anodes, the state-of-the-art electrodes for intermediate-temperature SOFCs; with ceria electrolytes.","Ni-LnOx (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.035
5,10538,"The performance is further improved by increasing the anode porosity: peak power density up to 730 mW cm(-2) and total interfacial polarization resistance down to 0.12 Omega cm(2) are achieved for Ln = Sm, Eu, Ce, and Gd.","Ni-LnOx (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.035
6,10538,The low interfacial polarization resistance and high power densities might be related to the high catalytic activity of LnO(x) and the optimized microstructures by increasing the porosity.,"Ni-LnOx (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.035
7,10538,These results suggest a promising alternative to the conventional anodes for SOFCs.,"Ni-LnOx (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.035
