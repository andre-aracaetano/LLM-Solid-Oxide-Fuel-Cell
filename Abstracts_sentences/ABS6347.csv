1,6347,A new cobalt-free perovskite oxide Pr0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-delta (PSFC) has been synthesized and evaluated as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Preparation and characterization of new cobalt-free cathode Pr0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.164
2,6347,"The chemical compatibility of PSFC with Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte has be proven by XRD, and its electrical conductivity reaches the maximum value of 264.1 S cm(-1) at 475 degrees C. Symmetrical cells with the configuration of PSFC/SDC/PSFC are used for the impedance study and the polarization resistance (Rp) of PSFC cathode is as low as 0.050 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Single cells, consisting of Ni-YSZ/YSZ/SDC/PSFC structure, are assembled and tested from 550 degrees C to 800 degrees C with wet hydrogen (similar to 3% H2O) as fuel and static air as oxidant.",Preparation and characterization of new cobalt-free cathode Pr0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.164
