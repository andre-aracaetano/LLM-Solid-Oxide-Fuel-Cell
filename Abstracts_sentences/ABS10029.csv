1,10029,The oxidation behavior of Haynes 242 alloy was studied at 700 - 900 degrees C in Ar + 4 vol % H-2 + 3 vol % H2O which corresponds to the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode environment.,Investigation on Haynes 242 alloy as SOFC interconnect in simulated anode environment,10.1149/1.2176084
2,10029,"The oxidation kinetics was found to obey a parabolic law and the oxidation activation energy (181.5 kJ mol(-1)) was close to that for the self-diffusion of the Cr cation in Cr2O3, indicating that the oxidation process was mainly controlled by outward diffusion of the Cr cation in Cr2O3.",Investigation on Haynes 242 alloy as SOFC interconnect in simulated anode environment,10.1149/1.2176084
3,10029,"The oxide scale was composed mainly of Cr2O3 with a thin (Mn,Cr)(3)O-4 spinel top layer.",Investigation on Haynes 242 alloy as SOFC interconnect in simulated anode environment,10.1149/1.2176084
4,10029,The area specific resistance of the oxide scale formed in the reducing atmosphere was found to be higher than that formed in air.,Investigation on Haynes 242 alloy as SOFC interconnect in simulated anode environment,10.1149/1.2176084
