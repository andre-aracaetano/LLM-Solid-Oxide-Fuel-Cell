3,4881,"In this paper, a comprehensive study of mica seals is presented.",Compressive mica seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/105994906X117215
4,4881,"Two natural micas, muscovite and phlogopite, were investigated in either a monolithic single-crystal sheet form or a paper form composed of discrete mica flakes.",Compressive mica seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/105994906X117215
5,4881,"A hybrid mica seal, developed after identification of the major leak paths in compressive mica seals, demonstrated leak rates that were hundreds to thousands times lower than leak rates for conventional mica seals.",Compressive mica seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/105994906X117215
6,4881,The hybrid mica seals were further modified by infiltration with wetting materials; these infiltrated micas showed excellent thermal cycle stability with very low leak rates (10(-3) sccm/cm).,Compressive mica seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/105994906X117215
7,4881,The micas were also subjected to studies to evaluate thermal stability in a reducing environment as well as the effect of compressive stresses on leak rates.,Compressive mica seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/105994906X117215
