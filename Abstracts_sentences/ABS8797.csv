4,8797,"Impregnation of nano-YSZ particles primarily decreases the electrode polarization resistance at high frequencies, which indicates that the main role of the impregnated YSZ is to extend the three-phase boundary areas into the bulk of the nickel anode.",Performance and electrode behaviour of nano-YSZ impregnated nickel anodes used in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.042
5,8797,The results suggest that the electrode process at low frequencies may be dominated by the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen.,Performance and electrode behaviour of nano-YSZ impregnated nickel anodes used in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.042
