5,10900,This model of SOFC takes into account the kinetics of the steam reforming reaction in the catalyst layer in order to assess the influence of the steam to carbon ratio and the cell polarization.,MODELLING OF GRADUAL INTERNAL REFORMING PROCESS OVER NI-YSZ SOFC ANODE WITH A CATALYTIC LAYER,10.1002/cjce.22113
6,10900,"Because the risk of carbon formation is greater under GIR operation, a detailed thermodynamic analysis was carried out.",MODELLING OF GRADUAL INTERNAL REFORMING PROCESS OVER NI-YSZ SOFC ANODE WITH A CATALYTIC LAYER,10.1002/cjce.22113
7,10900,Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations allowed us to predict the conditions of carbon formation occurrence.,MODELLING OF GRADUAL INTERNAL REFORMING PROCESS OVER NI-YSZ SOFC ANODE WITH A CATALYTIC LAYER,10.1002/cjce.22113
