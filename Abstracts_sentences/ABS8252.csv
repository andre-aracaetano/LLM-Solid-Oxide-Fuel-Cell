1,8252,"Composites of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were prepared by impregnating porous YSZ with salts of Sr, La, and Mn to 40 wt % LSM.",Characterization of LSM-YSZ composites prepared by impregnation methods,10.1149/1.1926669
2,8252,The effect of calcination temperature on cathode performance at 973 K was then studied using both symmetric cells and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Characterization of LSM-YSZ composites prepared by impregnation methods,10.1149/1.1926669
3,8252,"Following calcination at 1123 K, the LSM in the composite remained porous.",Characterization of LSM-YSZ composites prepared by impregnation methods,10.1149/1.1926669
4,8252,"In symmetric-cell tests, LSM(1123)-YSZ electrodes exhibited a low loss, 0.5 Omega cm(2), which was unchanged by polarization; however, in fuel cell tests, the performance was poor at current densities above 0.2 A/cm(2).",Characterization of LSM-YSZ composites prepared by impregnation methods,10.1149/1.1926669
5,8252,"Following calcination at 1323 or 1523 K, LSM formed a dense layer coating on the YSZ.",Characterization of LSM-YSZ composites prepared by impregnation methods,10.1149/1.1926669
6,8252,"In symmetric-cell tests, the composite exhibited an ASR greater than 4 Omega cm(2), but this decreased, reversibly, upon cathodic polarization or upon heating in humidified H-2 at 973 K.",Characterization of LSM-YSZ composites prepared by impregnation methods,10.1149/1.1926669
7,8252,"In fuel cell tests, the performance of composites calcined at 1323 K was superior to ones at 1523 K, primarily because the ohmic resistance of the cell was 0.25 Omega cm(2) higher after 1523 K, probably due to solid-state reactions with the electrolyte.",Characterization of LSM-YSZ composites prepared by impregnation methods,10.1149/1.1926669
8,8252,The optimal conditions for forming impregnated LSM-YSZ cathodes and the reasons for the observed hysteresis in cathode polarization are discussed based on these results.,Characterization of LSM-YSZ composites prepared by impregnation methods,10.1149/1.1926669
