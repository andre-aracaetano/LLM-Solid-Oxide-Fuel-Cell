4,19458,"The average grain size of the pellets after sintering at 1400 degrees C for 2 h is submicron in scale (from 200 nm to 600 nm) with various pH values, and the pellets are smaller than those obtained from other synthesis processes.",Synthesis and properties of samaria-doped ceria electrolyte for IT-SOFCs by EDTA-citrate complexing method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.098
5,19458,"Dense pellets with pH values of 10 (relative density of 99%) are obtained with precursor powder calcination at 900 degrees C for 3 h. Electrical conductivity is dependent on the calcination temperature and pH value of the solution, and the maximum electrical conductivity is 0.01 S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C with a pH value of 10.",Synthesis and properties of samaria-doped ceria electrolyte for IT-SOFCs by EDTA-citrate complexing method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.098
