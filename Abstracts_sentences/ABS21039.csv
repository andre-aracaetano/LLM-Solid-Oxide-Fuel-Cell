4,21039,Our approach combines surface chemical analysis with X-ray photoelectron and Auger electron spectroscopy on model dense thin films and computational analysis with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and analytical models.,Cation Size Mismatch and Charge Interactions Drive Dopant Segregation at the Surfaces of Manganite Perovskites,10.1021/ja3125349
5,21039,"Elastic energy differences were systematically induced in the system by varying the radius of the selected dopants (Ca, Sr, Ba) with respect to the host cations (La, Sm) while retaining the same charge state.",Cation Size Mismatch and Charge Interactions Drive Dopant Segregation at the Surfaces of Manganite Perovskites,10.1021/ja3125349
6,21039,Electrostatic energy differences were introduced by varying the distribution of charged oxygen and cation vacancies in our models Varying the oxygen chemical potential in our experiments induced changes in both the elastic energy and electrostatic interactions.,Cation Size Mismatch and Charge Interactions Drive Dopant Segregation at the Surfaces of Manganite Perovskites,10.1021/ja3125349
7,21039,Our results quantitatively demonstrate that the mechanism of dopant segregation on perovskite oxides includes both the elastic and electrostatic energy contributions.,Cation Size Mismatch and Charge Interactions Drive Dopant Segregation at the Surfaces of Manganite Perovskites,10.1021/ja3125349
8,21039,A smaller size mismatch between the host and dopant cations and a chemically expanded lattice were found to reduce the segregation level of the dopant and to enable more stable cathode surfaces Ca doped LaMnO3 was found to have the most stable surface composition with the least cation segregation among the compositions surveyed.,Cation Size Mismatch and Charge Interactions Drive Dopant Segregation at the Surfaces of Manganite Perovskites,10.1021/ja3125349
9,21039,"The diffusion kinetics of the larger dopants, Ba and Sr, was found to be slower and can kinetically trap the segregation at reduced temperatures despite the larger elastic energy driving force.",Cation Size Mismatch and Charge Interactions Drive Dopant Segregation at the Surfaces of Manganite Perovskites,10.1021/ja3125349
