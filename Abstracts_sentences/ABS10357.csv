1,10357,We have investigated the deposition of 91% ZrO(2) - 9% Y(2)O(3) thin films by a variety of sputtering techniques for the application as electrolytes in thin film solid oxide fuel cells.,Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/BF02376039
2,10357,The deposition by RF sputtering was accomplished by using an oxide target of the desired composition.,Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/BF02376039
3,10357,The deposition rate in these initial tests was limited to 0.5 mu m/hr and the morphology of the film was substantially modified by deposition rate and substrate temperature.,Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/BF02376039
4,10357,Using DC magnetron sputtering we deposited metallic films from a metallic target with the desired chemical composition.,Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/BF02376039
5,10357,"We introduced oxygen into the sputtering chamber to reactively deposit the desired 91% ZrO(2) - 9% Y(2)O(3) thin films; however, we encountered problems with target oxidation and growth rate reproducibility.",Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/BF02376039
6,10357,"We subsequently demonstrated that controlled oxidation of the metallic films could result in adhering, non porous yttria stabilized zirconia films.",Thin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/BF02376039
