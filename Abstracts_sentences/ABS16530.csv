1,16530,"La1-yCayFe0.5+x(Mg,Mo)(0.5-x)O3-delta oxides with the orthorhombic GdFeO3-type perovskite structure have been synthesized at 1573 K. Transmission electron microscopy study for selected samples shows the coexistence of domains of perovskite phases with ordered and disordered B-cations.","High-temperature properties of (La,Ca)(Fe,Mg,Mo)O3-δ perovskites as prospective electrode materials for symmetrical SOFC",10.1016/j.jssc.2017.10.005
2,16530,"Mossbauer spectroscopy studies performed at 300 K and 573 K show that while compositions with low Ca-content (La0.55Ca0.45Fe0.5Mg0.2625Mo0.2375O3-delta and La0.5Ca0.5Fe0.6Mg0.175Mo0.225O3-delta) are nearly oxygen stoichiometric, La0.2Ca0.8Fe0.5Mg0.2625Mo0.2375O3-delta is oxygen deficient with delta approximate to 0.15.","High-temperature properties of (La,Ca)(Fe,Mg,Mo)O3-δ perovskites as prospective electrode materials for symmetrical SOFC",10.1016/j.jssc.2017.10.005

4,16530,"No additional phases have been observed at XRPD patterns of all studied perovskites and Ce1-xGdxO2-x/2 electrolyte mixtures treated at 1173-1373K, while Fe-rich compositions (x >= 0.1) react with Zr1-xYxO2-x/2 electrolyte above 1273 K. Dilatometry studies reveal that all samples show rather low thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) in air of 11.4-12.7 ppm K-1.","High-temperature properties of (La,Ca)(Fe,Mg,Mo)O3-δ perovskites as prospective electrode materials for symmetrical SOFC",10.1016/j.jssc.2017.10.005
