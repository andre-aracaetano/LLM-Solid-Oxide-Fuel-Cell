5,21107,Major degradation issues relating to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are relatively better understood than those for SOECs.,Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
6,21107,"Some of the degradation mechanisms in SOFCs include contact problems between adjacent cell components, microstructural deterioration (coarsening) of the porous electrodes, and blocking of the reaction sites within the electrodes.",Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
7,21107,"Contact problems include delamination of an electrode from the electrolyte, growth of a poorly (electronically) conducting oxide layer between the metallic interconnect plates and the electrodes, and lack of contact between the interconnect and the electrode.",Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
8,21107,INL's test results on high temperature electrolysis (HTE) using solid oxide cells do not provide clear evidence of whether different events lead to similar or drastically different electrochemical degradation mechanisms.,Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
9,21107,Post-test examination of the solid oxide electrolysis cells showed that the hydrogen electrode and interconnect get partially oxidized and become nonconductive.,Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
10,21107,This is most likely caused by the hydrogen stream composition and flow rate during cool down.,Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
11,21107,The oxygen electrode side of the stacks seemed to be responsible for the observed degradation due to large areas of electrode delamination.,Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
12,21107,"Based on the oxygen electrode appearance, the degradation of these stacks was largely controlled by the oxygen electrode delamination rate.",Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787

14,21107,This model is under continued development.,Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
15,21107,"It shows that electronic conduction through the electrolyte, however small, must be taken into account for determining local oxygen chemical potential, within the electrolyte.",Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
16,21107,The chemical potential within the electrolyte may lie out of bounds in relation to values at the electrodes in the electrolyzer mode.,Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
17,21107,"Under certain conditions, high pressures can develop in the electrolyte just under the oxygen electrode (anode)/electrolyte interface, leading to electrode delamination.",Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
18,21107,This theory is being further refined and tested by introducing some electronic conduction in the electrolyte.,Degradation Issues in Solid Oxide Cells During High Temperature Electrolysis,10.1115/1.4003787
