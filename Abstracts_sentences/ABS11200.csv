1,11200,"Electrically conducting oxides have been proposed as alternatives to Ni-based cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to overcome issues such as coking and impurity poisoning, but their electrochemical performance is typically inferior to that of Ni-based cermets.","Ni-Substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 SOFC Anodes: Achieving High Performance via Metal Alloy Nanoparticle Exsolution",10.1016/j.joule.2018.02.006
2,11200,"Here we show that a new oxide composition, Sr-0.95(Ti0.3Fe0.63Ni0.07)O3-delta, yields anode polarization resistance competitive with Ni cermets, and substantially better than that of the corresponding Ni-free compound, SrTi0.3Fe0.7O3-delta.","Ni-Substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 SOFC Anodes: Achieving High Performance via Metal Alloy Nanoparticle Exsolution",10.1016/j.joule.2018.02.006
3,11200,"Exposure to fuel results in exso-lution and nucleation of Ni0.5Fe0.5 nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on the Ni-substituted perovskite surface, whereas no nanoparticles are observed on SrTi0.3Fe0.7O3-delta.","Ni-Substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 SOFC Anodes: Achieving High Performance via Metal Alloy Nanoparticle Exsolution",10.1016/j.joule.2018.02.006
4,11200,A general thermodynamic model is developed that quantitatively predicts exsolved nanoparticle composition.,"Ni-Substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 SOFC Anodes: Achieving High Performance via Metal Alloy Nanoparticle Exsolution",10.1016/j.joule.2018.02.006
5,11200,"The reduction in anode polarization resistance by the nanoparticles, by as much as 4 times, is most pronounced at cell operating temperatures below 800 degrees C and low H-2 partial pressures, suggesting that the nanoparticles improve performance by promoting H-2 adsorption.","Ni-Substituted Sr(Ti,Fe)O3 SOFC Anodes: Achieving High Performance via Metal Alloy Nanoparticle Exsolution",10.1016/j.joule.2018.02.006
