1,7515,"The effect of cathode composition, processing and structure on the performance of medium-temperature (600-800 degrees C) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is described.",Effect of LSM-YSZ cathode on thin-electrolyte solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00524-3
2,7515,"The cathodes and physical supports for the SOFCs were two-phase mixtures of (La1-xSrx)(1-y)MnO3 (LSM) and Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (YSZ), the electrolytes were < 10 mu m thick YSZ, and the anodes were Ni-YSZ with Y-doped CeO2 interfacial layers.",Effect of LSM-YSZ cathode on thin-electrolyte solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00524-3
3,7515,It was found that the cathode overpotential was the primary factor limiting cell power densities during operation with air as the oxidant and humidified hydrogen as the fuel.,Effect of LSM-YSZ cathode on thin-electrolyte solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00524-3
4,7515,Increasing the YSZ volume fraction in LSM-YSZ cathodes from 0 to 60% reduced the low-current area-specific resistance of the cells (in air and humidified hydrogen) from similar to 3.3 to 0.7 Omega cm(2).,Effect of LSM-YSZ cathode on thin-electrolyte solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00524-3
5,7515,The use of LSM with y = 0.1 suppressed the formation of zirconate phases during cathode sintering.,Effect of LSM-YSZ cathode on thin-electrolyte solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00524-3
6,7515,Optimal cathode porosity was approximate to 40%.,Effect of LSM-YSZ cathode on thin-electrolyte solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00524-3
7,7515,Decreasing the cathode porosity below approximate to 30% resulted in a mass transport limitation at high current densities due to the small pore size (< 0.5 mu m) and large cathode thickness (approximate to 1 mm).,Effect of LSM-YSZ cathode on thin-electrolyte solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00524-3
8,7515,The maximum power densities measured in humidified H-2 and air ranged from similar to 110 mW cm(-2) at 600 to 470 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C.,Effect of LSM-YSZ cathode on thin-electrolyte solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00524-3
