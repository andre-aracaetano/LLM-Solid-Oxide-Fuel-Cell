4,1868,Different simulations are performed and the contribution of the local entropy generation rate is computed.,Study of the entropy generation in a SOFC for different operating conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.027
5,1868,"The results show different trends for the current density, temperature, species, activation loss, ohmic loss and concentration loss throughout the fuel cell, and indicate that the prediction of thermodynamic irreversibilities is strongly affected by the choice of the operating conditions (e.g. inlet temperature) and the electrolyte thickness.",Study of the entropy generation in a SOFC for different operating conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.027
