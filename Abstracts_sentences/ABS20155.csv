1,20155,"Surface area measurements are important for characterizing porous solids, but commonly used methods such as Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) gas adsorption and computed nanotomography are lacking for certain applications such as the development of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes, which often have absolute surface areas <1 m(2) and contain nanoscale features.",Atomic layer deposition for surface area determination of solid oxide electrodes,10.1039/d2ta09060k
2,20155,"Presented is a novel method for the surface area determination of samples with total measurable areas of 1-1000 cm(2) with a standard deviation +/- 1 cm(2), utilizing the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 over microstructurally complex internal porosity.",Atomic layer deposition for surface area determination of solid oxide electrodes,10.1039/d2ta09060k
3,20155,The volume of alumina is then quantified using plasma spectroscopy and converted to an area using the known ALD layer thickness.,Atomic layer deposition for surface area determination of solid oxide electrodes,10.1039/d2ta09060k
4,20155,"Under the modest ALD reactor soak times used (8.5 s), the precursor penetration depth is found to be similar to 50 mu m, exceeding the requirement for uniformly coating SOFC functional layers.",Atomic layer deposition for surface area determination of solid oxide electrodes,10.1039/d2ta09060k
5,20155,"A model system, (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3-delta/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (LSM/GDC) scaffolds of similar to 2.7 m(2) g(-1), was measured using the technique and compared against the BET method, and comparable results were obtained but with 1000 times less material needed.",Atomic layer deposition for surface area determination of solid oxide electrodes,10.1039/d2ta09060k
6,20155,"The technique is demonstrated for measurements in two example areas of active SOFC research: exsolved (Ni, Fe) nanoparticles on an Sr(Ti, Fe, Ni)O3-delta electrode and PrOx catalyst nanoparticles infiltrated onto LSM/GDC scaffolds.",Atomic layer deposition for surface area determination of solid oxide electrodes,10.1039/d2ta09060k
7,20155,The technique may be broadly useful wherever the accurate surface area determination of small absolute quantities of porous ceramic structures on the order of 0.1-50 m(2) g(-1) is sought.,Atomic layer deposition for surface area determination of solid oxide electrodes,10.1039/d2ta09060k
