1,18012,"Spark plasma sintering (SPS) technology was adopted to reduce the detrimental effect Of SiO2 and Cr2O3 contaminants on 8 mol-% yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, Contamination of SiO2 not only significantly reduces the ionic conductivity of the YSZ electrolyte, especially grain boundary conductivity, it also retards the densification process during sintering.",Reducing effect of contaminants in solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte by spark plasma sintering,10.1179/174367605X16680
2,18012,"Also, the addition of 0.5 wt-%Cr2O3, whilst marginally reducing grain boundary conductivity, can promote the densification process regardless of sintering technique adopted, be it conventional electrical resistance heating or SPS.",Reducing effect of contaminants in solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte by spark plasma sintering,10.1179/174367605X16680
3,18012,"The effects of SIPS sintering conditions, such as sintering temperature, isothermal dwell time, applied uniaxial pressure and number of repeated SPS cycles on the relative density and ionic conductivity of the contaminated YSZ electrolytes were investigated in detail.",Reducing effect of contaminants in solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte by spark plasma sintering,10.1179/174367605X16680
4,18012,"The results showed that SPS sintering could alleviate the harmful effect of contaminants on grain boundary conductivity, with minimal effect on the grain interior conductivity.",Reducing effect of contaminants in solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte by spark plasma sintering,10.1179/174367605X16680
