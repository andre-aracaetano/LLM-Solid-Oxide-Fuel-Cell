1,20656,"The purpose of this work is to quantitatively compare the energy cost of design alternatives for a process to produce ammonia (NH3) from air, water, and renewable electricity.","Green ammonia from air, water, and renewable electricity: Energy costs using natural gas reforming, solid oxide electrolysis, liquid water electrolysis, chemical looping, or a Haber-Bosch loop",10.1063/5.0101709
2,20656,It is assumed that a Haber-Bosch (H-B) synthesis loop is available to produce 1000 metric tons (tonnes) of renewable NH3 per day.,"Green ammonia from air, water, and renewable electricity: Energy costs using natural gas reforming, solid oxide electrolysis, liquid water electrolysis, chemical looping, or a Haber-Bosch loop",10.1063/5.0101709
3,20656,"The overall energy costs per tonne of NH3 will then be estimated at U.S.$195, 197, 158, and 179 per tonne of NH3 when H-2 is supplied by (i) natural gas reforming (reference), (ii) liquid phase electrolysis, (iii) solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) of water only, and (iv) simultaneous SOE of water and air.","Green ammonia from air, water, and renewable electricity: Energy costs using natural gas reforming, solid oxide electrolysis, liquid water electrolysis, chemical looping, or a Haber-Bosch loop",10.1063/5.0101709
4,20656,"A renewable electricity price of U.S.$0.02 per kWh(electric), and U.S.$6 per 10(6) BTU for natural gas is assumed.","Green ammonia from air, water, and renewable electricity: Energy costs using natural gas reforming, solid oxide electrolysis, liquid water electrolysis, chemical looping, or a Haber-Bosch loop",10.1063/5.0101709
5,20656,SOE provides some energy cost advantage but incurs the inherent risk of an emerging process.,"Green ammonia from air, water, and renewable electricity: Energy costs using natural gas reforming, solid oxide electrolysis, liquid water electrolysis, chemical looping, or a Haber-Bosch loop",10.1063/5.0101709
6,20656,"The last consideration is replacement of the H-B loop with atmospheric pressure chemical looping for ammonia synthesis (CLAS) combined with SOE for water electrolysis, and separately oxygen removal from air to provide N-2, with energy costs of U.S.$153 per tonne of NH3.","Green ammonia from air, water, and renewable electricity: Energy costs using natural gas reforming, solid oxide electrolysis, liquid water electrolysis, chemical looping, or a Haber-Bosch loop",10.1063/5.0101709
7,20656,"Overall, the most significant findings are (i) the energy costs are not substantially different for the alternatives investigated here and (ii) the direct SOE of a mixture of steam and air, followed by a H.-B. synthesis loop, or SOE to provide H-2 and N-2 separately, followed by CLAS may be attractive for small scale production, modular systems, remote locations, or stranded electricity resources with the primary motivation being process simplification rather than significantly lower energy cost.","Green ammonia from air, water, and renewable electricity: Energy costs using natural gas reforming, solid oxide electrolysis, liquid water electrolysis, chemical looping, or a Haber-Bosch loop",10.1063/5.0101709
