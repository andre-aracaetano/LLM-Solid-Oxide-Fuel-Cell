6,20492,"It is found that the concepts, in which novel technology (the hydrogen membrane separation reformer--MSR-H2, the advanzed zero emission power plant-AZEP, the solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine-SOFC + GT and the chemical looping combustion-CLC concepts) is employed, exhibit the best performance with respect to both efficiency and in most cases also CO2 capture (capture rates close to 100%).",A quantitative comparison of gas turbine cycles with CO2 capture,10.1016/j.energy.2006.02.006

8,20492,"The SOFC + GT concept exhibits the best cycle performance and even better than a standard CC plant, however, any realization of a SOFC-GT 400 MW plant has a very distant future perspective.",A quantitative comparison of gas turbine cycles with CO2 capture,10.1016/j.energy.2006.02.006
