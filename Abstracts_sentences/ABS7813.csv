1,7813,"Glass-based materials are usually considered as excellent seals for jointing adjacent components in planar solid oxide fuel cells, but the uncontrollable crystallization in the glass may cause delamination and micro-cracks in such seals.",Performance of Al2O3 particle reinforced glass-based seals in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.256
2,7813,"To solve this problem, Al2O3 ceramic particles were added to a BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass system to reduce negative effects caused by crystalline phase on the gas tightness and the joint strength in the seals.",Performance of Al2O3 particle reinforced glass-based seals in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.256
3,7813,"At an operating temperature of 750 degrees C, the glass-based seals with 20 wt% Al2O3 addition (GA80) exhibited extremely low leakage rates (similar to 0.002 sccm/cm under an input gas pressure of 13.6 kPa) and higher shear strength (3.31 MPa).",Performance of Al2O3 particle reinforced glass-based seals in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.256
4,7813,The Al2O3 ceramic addition and the crystalline phase BaAl2Si2O8 reinforced the glass matrix.,Performance of Al2O3 particle reinforced glass-based seals in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.256
5,7813,"Further thermal cycle analyses indicated that leakage rates for the GA80 seals remained at around 0.0025 sccm/cm after 10 thermal cycles, which was consistent with minor microstructural change and good interface bonding.",Performance of Al2O3 particle reinforced glass-based seals in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.256
6,7813,"Single cell testing with of GA80 seals was performed and the results demonstrated stable electrochemical performance through 6 thermal cycles at an open circuit voltage of 1.16-1.18 V, as well as a power density above 546 mW/cm2 at a current density of 925 mA/cm2.",Performance of Al2O3 particle reinforced glass-based seals in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.256
7,7813,These results showed the high thermal cycle stability of the glass/Al2O3 composite seals in intermediate temperature planar solid oxide fuel cells.,Performance of Al2O3 particle reinforced glass-based seals in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.256
