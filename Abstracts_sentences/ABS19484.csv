1,19484,"To make full use of the advantages of solid oxide cells (SOCs) under actual operating conditions, hetero-structured La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta/LaSrCoO4 +/-delta (LSC113/214) thin film electrodes are prepared and investigated by a novel high temperature micro-probe electrochemical test platform for SOCs.","Measurement of oxygen reduction/evolution kinetics enhanced (La,Sr)CoO3/(La,Sr)2CoO4 hetero-structure oxygen electrode in operating temperature for SOCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.128
2,19484,The results show that the surface exchange coefficient (k(q)) of LSC113/214 thin films is 3-10 times higher than that of single phase LSC113 in 773-1123 K. ToF-SIMS and XPS characterizations show that LSC113/214 hetero-interface leads to Sr enrichment at interfacial region and stabilizes it against detrimental Sr segregation.,"Measurement of oxygen reduction/evolution kinetics enhanced (La,Sr)CoO3/(La,Sr)2CoO4 hetero-structure oxygen electrode in operating temperature for SOCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.128
3,19484,This hetero-interface further induces increased number of active oxygen vacancies and leads to accelerated oxygen exchange kinetics by raising O 2p center closer to Fermi level.,"Measurement of oxygen reduction/evolution kinetics enhanced (La,Sr)CoO3/(La,Sr)2CoO4 hetero-structure oxygen electrode in operating temperature for SOCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.128
4,19484,This work provides significantly enhanced ORR/OER activity of hetero-structured LSC113/214 oxygen electrode at operation conditions and brings substantial technical benefits for the SOC systems.,"Measurement of oxygen reduction/evolution kinetics enhanced (La,Sr)CoO3/(La,Sr)2CoO4 hetero-structure oxygen electrode in operating temperature for SOCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.128
