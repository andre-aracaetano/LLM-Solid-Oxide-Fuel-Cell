1,6447,Electrode materials which exhibit high conductivities in both oxidising and reducing atmospheres are in high demand for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolytic cells (SOECs).,A perovskite oxide with high conductivities in both air and reducing atmosphere for use as electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/srep31839
2,6447,"In this paper, we investigated Cu-doped SrFe0.9Nb0.1O3-delta finding that the primitive perovskite oxide SrFe0.8Cu0.1Nb0.1O3-delta (SFCN) exhibits a conductivity of 63 Scm(-1)and 60 Scm(-1) at 415 degrees C in air and 5% H-2/Ar respectively.",A perovskite oxide with high conductivities in both air and reducing atmosphere for use as electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/srep31839
3,6447,It is believed that the high conductivity in 5% H-2/Ar is related to the exsolved Fe (or FeCu alloy) on exposure to a reducing atmosphere.,A perovskite oxide with high conductivities in both air and reducing atmosphere for use as electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/srep31839
4,6447,"To the best of our knowledge, the conductivity of SrFe0.8Cu0.1Nb0.1O3-delta in a reducing atmosphere is the highest of all reported oxides which also exhibit a high conductivity in air.",A perovskite oxide with high conductivities in both air and reducing atmosphere for use as electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/srep31839
5,6447,"Fuel cell performance using SrFe0.8Cu0.1Nb0.1O3-delta as the anode, (Y2O3)(0.08)(ZrO2)(0.92) as the electrolyte and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta as the cathode achieved a power density of 423 mWcm(-2)",A perovskite oxide with high conductivities in both air and reducing atmosphere for use as electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/srep31839
6,6447,at 700 degrees C indicating that SFCN is a promising anode for SOFCs.,A perovskite oxide with high conductivities in both air and reducing atmosphere for use as electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/srep31839
