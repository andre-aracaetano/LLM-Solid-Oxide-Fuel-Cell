1,9314,The aim of this project was to study whether the oxidation resistance of cells is affected while working under high fuel utilization.,Electrochemical Behavior of Metal-Supported SOFCs Under High Fuel Utilization and Their Durability,10.1115/1.4005616
2,9314,"A previous study measured the weak oxidation resistance for very porous samples (measured porosity similar to 70%) in H-2 with high H2O content (over 50%) in the interval from 600 to 800 degrees C. Thus, additional tests were carried out with cells.",Electrochemical Behavior of Metal-Supported SOFCs Under High Fuel Utilization and Their Durability,10.1115/1.4005616
3,9314,Crofer22APU-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were produced by scalable cost competitive routes.,Electrochemical Behavior of Metal-Supported SOFCs Under High Fuel Utilization and Their Durability,10.1115/1.4005616
4,9314,"One of the highly porous cells (calculated porosity 45%) was run under high fuel utilization conditions (calculated fuel utilization 56%), and a further two in H-2-50%H2O. Another cell, with low porosity (calculated porosity 20%), was kept working in the same H-2-50%H2O atmosphere for many hours.",Electrochemical Behavior of Metal-Supported SOFCs Under High Fuel Utilization and Their Durability,10.1115/1.4005616
5,9314,Durability tests with cells of different porosities confirmed that this is the main variable concerning degradation issues while working under high fuel utilization.,Electrochemical Behavior of Metal-Supported SOFCs Under High Fuel Utilization and Their Durability,10.1115/1.4005616
