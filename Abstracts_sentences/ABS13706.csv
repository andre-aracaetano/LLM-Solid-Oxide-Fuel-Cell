2,13706,"Varying the temperature of sintering of the PLCO-xGDC electrode layer to the surface of GDC solid electrolyte shows that the minimum polarization resistance (R-eta) is reached at the temperature of 850 degrees C. For the PLCO-xGDC composition containing 40 wt % GDC, in the temperature range of 600-750 degrees C, the maximum electrochemical activity in oxygen reduction reaction is observed as indicated by 10-fold decrease in R-eta as compared with single-phase PLCO (from 0.87 (x = 0) to 0.08 Omega cm(2) (x = 40) at 700 degrees C in air).",Electrochemical Properties of Composite Cathode Materials Pr1.95La0.05CuO4-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1134/S1023193518060137
