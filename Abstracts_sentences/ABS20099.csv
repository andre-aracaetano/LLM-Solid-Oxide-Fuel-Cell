6,20099,Simulation shows that a 33% drop in maximum power and a 30 degrees C increase in temperature difference are induced by uneven gas distribution and unequal stack resistances for an MSM with serial electrical arrangement.,Investigating the performance of a solid oxide electrolyzer multi-stack module with a multiphysics homogenized model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.234019
7,20099,"It is also shown that the parallel arrangement is less susceptible to non -ideal factors than the serial arrangement, which enlightened the possibility of optimizing the stack arrangement to improve the MSM's performance.",Investigating the performance of a solid oxide electrolyzer multi-stack module with a multiphysics homogenized model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.234019
