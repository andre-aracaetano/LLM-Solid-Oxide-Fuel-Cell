3,13213,"Then, the printing resolution (line width of the printed paste) is evaluated by extruding the paste under various printing conditions to determine the appropriate stage speed and flow rate for cell fabrication.",Microextrusion printing for increasing electrode-electrolyte interface in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227682
4,13213,"A mathematical model is also developed to predict the printing resolution from the printing parameters, and the experimental data of the line width agree well with the predicted values, particularly when the contact angle between the paste and substrate is considered.",Microextrusion printing for increasing electrode-electrolyte interface in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227682
