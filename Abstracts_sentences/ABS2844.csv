4,2844,"At 750 degrees C, the value of the cathode polarization resistance (R-p) is only 0.11 Omega cm(2) for an ion-impregnated LSM-ESB cathode, which also shows high stability during a period of 200 h. For the performance testing of single cells, the maximum power density is 0.74 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C for a cell with the LSM-ESB cathode.",La0.84Sr0.16MnO3-δ cathodes impregnated with Bi1.4Er0.6O3 for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.070
