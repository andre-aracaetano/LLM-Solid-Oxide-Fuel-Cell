1,7010,"Al2O3-based compressive seals were fabricated by tape casting with Al2O3 and 0-30 wt% aluminum powders, and their sealing effectiveness, thermal cycle stability between 200 and 750 degrees C and applicability in planar intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells were evaluated.",Thermal cycle stability of Al2O3-based compressive seals for planar intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.086
2,7010,"The results indicate that increasing the aluminum content from 0 to 30 wt% in the seals decreases the leakage rate and increases the thermal cycle stability under various inlet gas (N-2) pressures of 3.5, 7.0 and 10.5 kPa.",Thermal cycle stability of Al2O3-based compressive seals for planar intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.086
3,7010,"Especially, with the seal containing 30 wt% of aluminum (ACS3), the initial leakage rate was below 0.03 sccm cm(-1) under an inlet pressure of 10.5 kPa, and the leakage rates during 96 thermal cycles were below 0.04 sccm cm(-1) under the same inlet gas pressure.",Thermal cycle stability of Al2O3-based compressive seals for planar intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.086
4,7010,"The interfaces in the interconnect/seal/ cell assembly with the ACS3 seal retained integrity after 50 thermal cycles, demonstrating the applicability of the Al2O3-based compressive seals in the planar intermediate temperature SOFCs.",Thermal cycle stability of Al2O3-based compressive seals for planar intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.086
