6,4014,It has been found that the support layer on fuel electrode supported cells has to be treated differently in terms of diffusion than the active layer.,Simulation of a reversible SOFC with Aspen Plus,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.189
7,4014,"Simulation results show that for the investigated cell parameters, the positive effect of adding CO2 to the steam feed on the electrolysis process is due to water gas-shift reactions and not CO2 electrolysis.",Simulation of a reversible SOFC with Aspen Plus,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.189
8,4014,An analysis of outlet gas compositions in electrolysis mode showed that the assumption of the cell as an equilibrium reactor was justified.,Simulation of a reversible SOFC with Aspen Plus,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.189
9,4014,"A parameter study has been conducted, showing that increasing the operation temperature and pressure can improve the overall performance, while changing the inlet gas compositions in general improves either fuel cell or electrolysis mode and deteriorates performance for the other mode.",Simulation of a reversible SOFC with Aspen Plus,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.189
