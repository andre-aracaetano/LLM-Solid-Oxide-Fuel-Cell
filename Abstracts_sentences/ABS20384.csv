2,20384,A comprehensive multi-physics coupled model is constructed to conduct parameter sensitivity analysis to reveal the primary and secondary factors on the SOEC performance and optimal rib width.,Optimization Design of Rib Width and Performance Analysis of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.3390/en13205468
3,20384,It is found that the parameters of the O-2 electrode have almost no influence on the optimal rib width at the H-2 electrode side and vice versa.,Optimization Design of Rib Width and Performance Analysis of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.3390/en13205468
4,20384,"The optimized rib width is not sensitive to the electrode porosity, thickness, electrical conductivity and gas composition.",Optimization Design of Rib Width and Performance Analysis of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.3390/en13205468
5,20384,"The optimal rib width at the H-2 electrode side is sensitive to the contact resistance at the interface between the electrode and interconnect rib, while the extremely small concentration loss at the O-2 electrode leads to the insensitivity of optimal rib width to the parameters influencing the O-2 diffusion.",Optimization Design of Rib Width and Performance Analysis of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.3390/en13205468
6,20384,"In addition to the contact resistance, the applied cell voltage and pitch width also has a dramatic influence on the optimal rib width of the fuel electrode.",Optimization Design of Rib Width and Performance Analysis of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.3390/en13205468
