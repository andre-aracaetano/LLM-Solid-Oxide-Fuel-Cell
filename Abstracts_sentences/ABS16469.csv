1,16469,"This paper describes a manometric method for the determination of chemical diffusion coefficients from gas/solid equilibration kinetics for electrode materials of the type (La,Sr)(Mn,Fe,Co)O-3.",A manometric method for the determination of chemical diffusion in perovskite-type cathode materials of the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00098-5
2,16469,The equilibration kinetics was monitored by measurements of the p(O-2) changes during a reaction between oxygen and the electrode material involving both oxidation and reduction experiments in the temperature range 773-1123 K. Activation energy of the chemical diffusion measurements at different temperatures was determined during both oxidation and reduction experiments.,A manometric method for the determination of chemical diffusion in perovskite-type cathode materials of the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00098-5
3,16469,The chemical diffusion coefficients measured by the present manometric method on La0.8Sr0.2 MnO3-delta have been compared with those reported in the literature.,A manometric method for the determination of chemical diffusion in perovskite-type cathode materials of the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00098-5
