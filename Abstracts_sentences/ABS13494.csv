2,13494,"For perovskite-type titanates, Sr1-yTi1-xMxO3, the lattice constant a was found to increase with the amount of dopant (x) added, to maximum values of 3.927 and 3.930 (A) over circle for M = Nb and Ta respectively, regardless of Sr deficiency (y).",Stability and electrical conductivity of Nb- or Ta- doped SrTiO3 perovskites for interconnectors in solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.16251
3,13494,"X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the Ta-substituted strontium titanate possesses a wider stable region in its perovskite-type structure against the amount of added dopant (x) and strontium deficiency (y), compared with the Nb-substituted structure.",Stability and electrical conductivity of Nb- or Ta- doped SrTiO3 perovskites for interconnectors in solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.16251
4,13494,"Even in the single phase regions of SrTi1-xMxO3 (M = Nb and Ta) perovskites, scanning electron microscopy images confirmed that after firing at 1500 degrees C for 10 h some SrTi0.9Ta0.1O3 grains showed strontium and tantalum enrichment and titanium dilution, whereas no inhomogeneity was found in SrTi0.9Nb0.1O3.",Stability and electrical conductivity of Nb- or Ta- doped SrTiO3 perovskites for interconnectors in solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.16251
5,13494,This cationic compositional fluctuation is consistent with the lower electrical conductivity of SrTi0.9Ta0.1O3 compared with SrTi0.9Nb0.1O3 at low temperatures.,Stability and electrical conductivity of Nb- or Ta- doped SrTiO3 perovskites for interconnectors in solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.16251
