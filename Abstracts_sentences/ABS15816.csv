3,15816,"Herein, to further optimize the cathode functionality of LNCA, a fluorine anion (F-) doping strategy is ap-plied to develop highly active LNCAF0.1 and LNCAF0.2 cathodes for Sm-doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte-based SOFCs.",F-doped LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2-? cathodes with enhanced ORR catalytic activity for LT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.168837
4,15816,"It is found the successful doping of F- in the oxygen site of LNCA leads to improved oxygen ionic conductivity and facilitated surface exchange and bulk diffusion of oxygen in LNCAF0.1 and LNCAF0.2, which thus gain distinctly promoted ORR catalytic activity at 450-550 degrees C, as confirmed by the decreased area specific resistances (ASR) and activation energy on symmetrical cells.",F-doped LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2-? cathodes with enhanced ORR catalytic activity for LT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.168837
