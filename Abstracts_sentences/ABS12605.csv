2,12605,"Firstly, a thermal management oriented kW scale SOFC stand-alone system (primarily comprising a planar SOFC stack, a burner, and two heat exchangers) is developed, in which a special consideration for stack spatial temperature management is conducted by introducing an air bypass manifold around heat exchangers.",Thermal management oriented steady state analysis and optimization of a kW scale solid oxide fuel cell stand-alone system for maximum system efficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.052

4,12605,"Secondly, based on the system model, the effects of operating parameters including fuel utilization (FU), air excess ratio (AE), bypass ratio (BR), and stack voltage (SV) on the system steady-state performances (e.g. system efficiency, stack inlet, stack outlet, and burner temperatures) are revealed.",Thermal management oriented steady state analysis and optimization of a kW scale solid oxide fuel cell stand-alone system for maximum system efficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.052
5,12605,"Particularly, an optimal relationship between the system efficiency and the operating parameters is proposed; the maximum system efficiency can certainly be obtained at the inlet outlet temperature critical point of the BR-AE or FU-AE planes for all SV operating points.",Thermal management oriented steady state analysis and optimization of a kW scale solid oxide fuel cell stand-alone system for maximum system efficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.052
6,12605,"Finally, according to the optimal relationship, a traverse optimization process is designed, and the maximum system efficiency and safe operating parameters at any efficient SV operating point are calculated.",Thermal management oriented steady state analysis and optimization of a kW scale solid oxide fuel cell stand-alone system for maximum system efficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.052

8,12605,"Moreover, the results reveal two important system characteristics: (1) the burner operates within safe temperature zone as long as the temperature of the upstream stack is well controlled; (2) the control design for the system is a nonlinear optimal control with switching structure, which is a challenging control issue.",Thermal management oriented steady state analysis and optimization of a kW scale solid oxide fuel cell stand-alone system for maximum system efficiency,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.052
