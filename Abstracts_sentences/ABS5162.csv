1,5162,Ni-MnOx-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) composites are synthesized and investigated as anode materials of solid oxide fuel cells fed with methanol.,Effects of manganese oxides on the activity and stability of Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode for solid oxide fuel cells with methanol as the fuel,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.01.014
2,5162,The lowest anodic polarization resistance is obtained when the molar ratio of Mn to Ni is 0.05:0.95.,Effects of manganese oxides on the activity and stability of Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode for solid oxide fuel cells with methanol as the fuel,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.01.014
3,5162,The high catalytic activity is attributed to the transfer of electrons from Ni to Mn and the increase of the content of the lattice oxygen in the anode.,Effects of manganese oxides on the activity and stability of Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode for solid oxide fuel cells with methanol as the fuel,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.01.014
4,5162,The single cell with that anode and SDC-carbonate composite electrolyte exhibits a maximum power density of 722 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C. Mn also increases the resistance to carbon deposition of the anode due to the high lattice oxygen content and the redox cycle of the Mn species.,Effects of manganese oxides on the activity and stability of Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode for solid oxide fuel cells with methanol as the fuel,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.01.014
5,5162,The stability of the single cell is enhanced with the increase of the content of Mn in the anode.,Effects of manganese oxides on the activity and stability of Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode for solid oxide fuel cells with methanol as the fuel,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.01.014
