4,14291,"The final conditions for this process were: feedstock solid load of 65 vol%; a combination of solvent debinding in heptane and thermal debinding at 600 degrees C. Subsequently, the YSZ electrolyte layer is deposited by dip coating and the sintering parameters are optimized to achieve a dense layer at 1500 degrees C during 2 h. For the cathode, an LSM (lanthanum strontium manganite)-YSZ layer with an active area of similar to 1 cm(2) is deposited by dip coating.",Design of industrially scalable microtubular solid oxide fuel cells based on an extruded support,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.010
