7,240,"Among the low-temperature fuel cells, proton-exchange membrane fuel cells require H-2 as the fuel and thus nearly CO-free and sulfur-free gas feed must be produced from fuel processor.","Fuel processing for low-temperature and high-temperature fuel cells - Challenges, and opportunities for sustainable development in the 21st century",10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00231-6
8,240,"High-temperature fuel cells such as solid oxide fuel cells can use both CO and H2 as fuel, and thus fuel processing can be achieved in less steps.","Fuel processing for low-temperature and high-temperature fuel cells - Challenges, and opportunities for sustainable development in the 21st century",10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00231-6
9,240,Hydrocarbon fuels and alcohol fuels can both be used as fuels for reforming on-site or on-board.,"Fuel processing for low-temperature and high-temperature fuel cells - Challenges, and opportunities for sustainable development in the 21st century",10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00231-6
10,240,"Alcohol fuels have the advantages of being ultra-clean and sulfur-free and can be reformed at lower temperatures, but hydrocarbon fuels have the advantages of existing infrastructure of production and distribution and higher energy density.","Fuel processing for low-temperature and high-temperature fuel cells - Challenges, and opportunities for sustainable development in the 21st century",10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00231-6

12,240,"More effective ways for on-site or on-board deep removal of sulfur before and after fuel reforming, and more energy-efficient and stable catalysts and processes for reforming hydrocarbon fuels are necessary for both high-temperature and low-temperature fuel cells.","Fuel processing for low-temperature and high-temperature fuel cells - Challenges, and opportunities for sustainable development in the 21st century",10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00231-6
13,240,"In addition, more active and robust (non-pyrophoric) catalysts for water-gas-shift (WGS) reactions, more selective and active catalysts for preferential CO oxidation at lower temperature, more CO-tolerant anode catalysts would contribute significantly to development and implementation of low-temperature fuel cells, particularly proton-exchange membrane fuel cells.","Fuel processing for low-temperature and high-temperature fuel cells - Challenges, and opportunities for sustainable development in the 21st century",10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00231-6
