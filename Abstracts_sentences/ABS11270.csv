3,11270,"This work comparatively investigates three small scale combined heat and power (CHP) configurations that integrate these technologies: (a) gasification at 4 bar and MGT, (b) gasification at 1.4 bar and SOFC and (c) gasification at 4 bar and SOFC-MGT.",Integrated CHP with autothermal biomass gasification and SOFC-MGT,10.1016/j.enconman.2007.06.013
4,11270,Aspenplus (TM) process simulation software was used for modelling each major and peripheral component of the CHP.,Integrated CHP with autothermal biomass gasification and SOFC-MGT,10.1016/j.enconman.2007.06.013
5,11270,"Interestingly, the MGT system proved more efficient than the atmospheric SOFC, both of which were surpassed by SOFC-MGT performance that reached an exergetic electrical efficiency of 35.6% using an SOFC of 100 m(2) active surface area and nominal biomass throughput of 200 kg/h. An exergy analysis allowed optimisation of the SOFC fuel utilisation factor (U-f) and efficiency impact of system capacity and level of product gas moistening prior to the cell.",Integrated CHP with autothermal biomass gasification and SOFC-MGT,10.1016/j.enconman.2007.06.013
