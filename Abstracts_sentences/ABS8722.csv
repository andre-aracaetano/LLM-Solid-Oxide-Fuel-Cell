1,8722,"Ln(0.6)Sr(0.4)CoO(3-delta) (Ln=La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) perovskite oxides have been synthesized and compared as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).","Comparison of Ln0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2172572
2,8722,"Both the electrical conductivity and the oxide ion vacancy concentration decrease from Ln=La to Gd, which leads to a decrease in the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction in SOFC.","Comparison of Ln0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2172572
3,8722,"However, the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) decreases favorably from Ln=La to Gd due to a decreasing ionicity of the Ln-O bond and a suppression of the tendency to lose oxygen from the lattice with increasing temperature.","Comparison of Ln0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2172572
4,8722,"Therefore, Ln(0.6)Sr(0.4)CoO(3-delta) cathodes with an intermediate lanthanide ion such as Nd3+ or Sm3+ offer a trade-off between electrocatalytic activity and TEC.","Comparison of Ln0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2172572
5,8722,"Also, the differences in dependence of the properties of the Ln(1-x)Sr(x)CoO(3-delta) and Ln(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3) systems on the Ln(3+) ions are discussed.","Comparison of Ln0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2172572
