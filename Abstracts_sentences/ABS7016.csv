1,7016,"A numerical model is developed to evaluate ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cells (E-SOFCs) with a Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (Ni-BZCYYb) external reformer owing to its high hydrophilia, carbon deposition resistance, and catalytic properties.",Numerical modeling of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with a Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7 Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ external reformer,10.1007/s11581-020-03613-6
2,7016,This model is validated by the ethanol conversion and product selectivity with the introduction of the steam for adjusting the water-carbon ratio.,Numerical modeling of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with a Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7 Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ external reformer,10.1007/s11581-020-03613-6
3,7016,"The simulated E-SOFCs provide a suitable porosity and thickness for the Ni-BZCYYb external reformer, and the optimal control conditions are that the porosity is around 0.4, and the thickness is more than 4 mm for the best reforming effect, which can decrease the concentration polarization loss and improve cell performance.",Numerical modeling of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with a Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7 Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ external reformer,10.1007/s11581-020-03613-6
4,7016,The carbon deposition boundaries and the equilibrium composition can be predicted by the thermodynamic equilibria calculation for E-SOFCs.,Numerical modeling of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with a Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7 Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ external reformer,10.1007/s11581-020-03613-6
5,7016,The proposed model can give the optimization of the geometry design and operating conditions to avoid carbon deposition and improve the electrochemical performance of E-SOFCs.,Numerical modeling of ethanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cells with a Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7 Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ external reformer,10.1007/s11581-020-03613-6
