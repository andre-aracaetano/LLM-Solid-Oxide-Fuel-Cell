1,1043,"Doping a LaMnO3 cathode with the Ca element produces a La0.5Ca0.5MnO3-delta cathode, which shows high performance for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells, surpassing all similar cells, although the low basicity of Ca makes it an inappropriate doping element in traditional thinking.",Tailoring a LaMnO3 cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells: integration of high performance and excellent stability,10.1039/d1ta01221e
2,1043,"Furthermore, rather than compromising electrochemical performance for chemical stability, La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 also shows excellent chemical stability, making it promising for application in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells.",Tailoring a LaMnO3 cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells: integration of high performance and excellent stability,10.1039/d1ta01221e
