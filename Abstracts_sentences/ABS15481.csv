1,15481,"Sr0.02La0.98Nb1-xTaxO4 (SLNT, with x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4) proton conducting oxides were synthesized by solid state reaction for application as electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells operating below 600 degrees C. Dense pellets were obtained after sintering at 1600 degrees C for 5 h achieving a larger average grain size with increasing the tantalum content.",Tailoring phase stability and electrical conductivity of Sr0.02La0.98Nb1-xTaxO4 for intermediate temperature fuel cell proton conducting electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.019
2,15481,"Dilatometric measurements were used to obtain the SLNT expansion coefficient as a function of tantalum content (x), and it was found that the phase transition temperature increased with increasing the tantalum content, being T = 561, 634, and 802 degrees C for x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4, respectively.",Tailoring phase stability and electrical conductivity of Sr0.02La0.98Nb1-xTaxO4 for intermediate temperature fuel cell proton conducting electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.019
