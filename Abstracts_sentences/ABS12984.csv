2,12984,"The newly formed nanosized electrolyte material on the cathode surface, leading the increase in electrochemical performances is mainly attributed to the creation of electrolyte/cathode phase boundaries, which considerably increases the electrochemical sites for oxygen reduction reaction.",Characterization of nanosized Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9-infiltrated Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Cu0.2O3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.012
3,12984,"Based on the experiment results, the 0.4 M SDC infiltration reveals the lowest cathode polarization resistance (R-p), the cathode polarization resistances (R-p) are 0.117, 0.033, and 0.011 Omega cm(2) at 650, 750, and 850 degrees C, and the highest peak power density, are 439, 659, and 532 mW cm(-2) at 600, 700, and 800 degrees C, respectively.",Characterization of nanosized Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9-infiltrated Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Cu0.2O3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.012
