1,4036,The oxygen-deficient perovskite Sr0.7Y0.3CoO2.65-delta contains Co2O(6/2) (001) planes alternating with oxygen-deficient Co1O(1.15-delta) planes having 0.15-delta O4 oxygen in the plane capping tetrahedral site Co 1.,Oxygen-Deficient Perovskite Sr0.7Y0.3CoO2.65-δ as a Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm202542q
2,4036,"With ordering of the O4 atoms below 300 degrees C, the oxide exhibits n-type polaronic conduction associated with localized high-spin 3d electronic configurations on Co2+ in Col sites; a transition to itinerant-hole conduction occurs on disordering of O4 ions over the range 350 <",Oxygen-Deficient Perovskite Sr0.7Y0.3CoO2.65-δ as a Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm202542q

4,4036,"C. Above 600 degrees C, Sr0.7Y0.3CoO2.65-delta is a mixed oxide-ion/electronic conductor exhibiting good activity for the oxygen-reduction reaction, which makes it a competitive cathode material for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell.",Oxygen-Deficient Perovskite Sr0.7Y0.3CoO2.65-δ as a Cathode for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/cm202542q
