1,3,"There are at least four basic fuel cell thermodynamic features: maximum intrinsic thermal efficiency (electrical efficiency), reversible potential, and two new ones-intrinsic cooling requirement and intrinsic exergetic efficiency.",Basic Electrochemical Thermodynamic Studies of Fuel Cells Using MALT2,10.1115/1.3080545
2,3,"A basic electrochemical thermodynamic analysis of fuel cells using MALT reveals that it is probably for thermodynamic reasons that cooling strategies other than excess oxidant, such as water cooling, have generally been adopted for lower temperature fuel cells such as polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) and phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC).",Basic Electrochemical Thermodynamic Studies of Fuel Cells Using MALT2,10.1115/1.3080545
3,3,"One can mathematically demonstrate that for a simple hybrid system, any fuel cell, any operating temperature, and any pressure, the maximum reversible work is equal to the free energy of reaction at the standard state.",Basic Electrochemical Thermodynamic Studies of Fuel Cells Using MALT2,10.1115/1.3080545
4,3,This study gives information of new opportunity fuels having increasing importance is all future energy scenarios.,Basic Electrochemical Thermodynamic Studies of Fuel Cells Using MALT2,10.1115/1.3080545
5,3,The results of this analysis show that ammonia and direct methanol give greater maximum intrinsic thermal efficiency than hydrogen oxidation.,Basic Electrochemical Thermodynamic Studies of Fuel Cells Using MALT2,10.1115/1.3080545
6,3,"From these simple studies alone, one would conclude that the great payoff in terms of theoretical efficiency potential for research is direct carbon fuel cell (DCFT), PEFC, and direct oxidation of methane, intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and simple fuel cell turbine hybrids.",Basic Electrochemical Thermodynamic Studies of Fuel Cells Using MALT2,10.1115/1.3080545
