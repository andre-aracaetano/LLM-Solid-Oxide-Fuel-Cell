6,15388,"An increase of glycine content in the initial synthesis gel, decreases the average nanoparticles size from similar to 20 to similar to 6 nm, narrows the distribution crystallite size, and increases the specific surface area of the LSCM nanopowders from similar to 14 to similar to 30 m(2)/g.",Synthesis and characterization of pure-phase La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ nanocrystallites for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1007/s11051-012-1104-1
7,15388,"The evolution of crystalline phases of the as-synthesized LSCM nanopowders after calcination at various temperatures was studied: pure-phase La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta perovskites with particle-size distribution between 100 and 300 nm, have been obtained after calcination at 1,000 degrees C for 6 h. The crystalline structural analyses showed that the LSCM nanocrystallites have trigonal/rhombohedral symmetry in the R-3c space group.",Synthesis and characterization of pure-phase La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ nanocrystallites for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1007/s11051-012-1104-1
8,15388,These final LSCM nanopowders present microstructures with low densification and open porosity but probably with sufficient integrity to enable them to be used as efficient electrodes in S-SOFC.,Synthesis and characterization of pure-phase La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ nanocrystallites for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1007/s11051-012-1104-1
