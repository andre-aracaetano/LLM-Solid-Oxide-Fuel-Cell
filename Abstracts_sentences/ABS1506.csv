4,1506,The model results have been validates well with experimental data obtained from a full-size prototype of IP-SOFC technology for the second generation hybrid application; it is found that the ohmic and cathode activation overpotentials represent a major loss in fuel cell voltage.,Thermo-fluid and electrochemical modeling of a multi-bundle IP-SOFC - Technology for second generation hybrid application,10.1016/j.enconman.2009.06.023
5,1506,The results obtained from both strips also demonstrated acceptable performance and good reproducibility bundles to bundles at 900 degrees C. These results indicated weak effect of parameter variation on the bundles to bundles performances.,Thermo-fluid and electrochemical modeling of a multi-bundle IP-SOFC - Technology for second generation hybrid application,10.1016/j.enconman.2009.06.023
