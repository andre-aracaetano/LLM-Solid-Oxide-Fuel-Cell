1,8346,A generic solid oxide fuel cell test fixture intended to evaluate candidate materials under realistic conditions was developed.,"Evaluation of a Single Cell and Candidate Materials with High-Water-Content Hydrogen in a Generic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack Test Fixture, Part I: Test Fixture and Electrochemical Performance",10.1111/j.1744-7402.2010.02564.x
2,8346,A commerical NiO-YSZ-supported YSZ electrolyte and LSM-YSZ cathode cell was tested to evaluate the stability of candidate materials.,"Evaluation of a Single Cell and Candidate Materials with High-Water-Content Hydrogen in a Generic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack Test Fixture, Part I: Test Fixture and Electrochemical Performance",10.1111/j.1744-7402.2010.02564.x
3,8346,"The cell was tested in two stages of low- and high-water-content fuel at 800 degrees C. Part I of the work will describe the test fixture, electrochemical performance of the cell, and postmortem analysis.","Evaluation of a Single Cell and Candidate Materials with High-Water-Content Hydrogen in a Generic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack Test Fixture, Part I: Test Fixture and Electrochemical Performance",10.1111/j.1744-7402.2010.02564.x
