1,17869,"This paper describes the synthesis of 18 oxides of Ce(1-x)Ln(x)O(2) (Ln: Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ and Ho3+), with x = 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15 mol% by use of a wet chemical route that involving the obtention of coordination compounds type citrate, which allow the generation of a number of chemical and surface properties with potential catalytic applications in solid oxide fuel cells technologies.","SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CERIUM FLUORITES BASED ON Ce1-xLnxO2-δ SYSTEM (Ln: Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ AND Ho3+)",
2,17869,"The materials obtained by this route, has a high purity and homogeneity, enabling calcination temperatures and residence times considerably brief, in comparison with conventional synthetic routes.","SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CERIUM FLUORITES BASED ON Ce1-xLnxO2-δ SYSTEM (Ln: Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ AND Ho3+)",
3,17869,"All oxides, were calcined at 300 degrees C under flow oxygen and were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), from obtained results, we confirmed the presence of a pure fluorite structure of CeO2 consistent with the ICSD pattern reference of 072155 with space group Fm-3m (225).","SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CERIUM FLUORITES BASED ON Ce1-xLnxO2-δ SYSTEM (Ln: Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ AND Ho3+)",
4,17869,"Subsequent physicochemical characterization by TPR and electron microscopy (SEM-TEM), confirm that cerium oxides could be reduced in two single steps at different temperatures, kinetically detectable and clearly prolonged as well as the obtention of nanostructured solids with a crystallite size between 32-47 nm.","SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CERIUM FLUORITES BASED ON Ce1-xLnxO2-δ SYSTEM (Ln: Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ AND Ho3+)",
5,17869,"According with obtained results, the solids show a high surface area as result of the low calcination temperature.","SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CERIUM FLUORITES BASED ON Ce1-xLnxO2-δ SYSTEM (Ln: Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ AND Ho3+)",
6,17869,"The electrical characterization by impedance spectroscopy (IS), revealed an important concentration of charge carriers in fluorite oxides, mainly in the sample of GDC5, which is a crucial characteristic in advanced materials for SOFC applications.","SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CERIUM FLUORITES BASED ON Ce1-xLnxO2-δ SYSTEM (Ln: Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ AND Ho3+)",
7,17869,"The catalytic studies, conducted on materials at 700 degrees C under stable reaction conditions, confirm that the methane conversion levels change throughout the series GDC5 -> NDC5 -> HDC5 -> EDC5 -> DDC5 -> SDC5, which established that the GDC5 solid, exhibits the most promising results.","SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CERIUM FLUORITES BASED ON Ce1-xLnxO2-δ SYSTEM (Ln: Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ AND Ho3+)",
8,17869,"Finally, a stability test was achieved with the GDC5 catalyst under the same reaction conditions established in previous form, for a period of 240 hours of continuous flux, establishing the effectiveness of the proposed method to choice the most promissory material.","SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CERIUM FLUORITES BASED ON Ce1-xLnxO2-δ SYSTEM (Ln: Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ AND Ho3+)",
9,17869,The results confirmed as the methane conversion vary as function of time and the obtained syngas levels change for potential technological applications.,"SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CERIUM FLUORITES BASED ON Ce1-xLnxO2-δ SYSTEM (Ln: Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Dy3+ AND Ho3+)",
