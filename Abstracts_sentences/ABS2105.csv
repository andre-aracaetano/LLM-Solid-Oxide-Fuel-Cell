1,2105,Results of studies of solid-electrolyte membranes with the composition of 89 mol % ZrO2-10 mol % Sc2O3-1 mol % CeO2 obtained using the technique of slip casting on a moving tape are presented.,Ceramic membranes based on scandium-stabilized ZrO2 obtained by tape casting technique,10.1134/S1023193514080138
2,2105,Optimization of technological parameters of membrane casting and sintering allowed manufacturing parallel plane gastight plates with the thickness of 200-250 mu m that were tested in model solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) of planar design with standard electrodes based on nickel-containing cermets and lanthanum-strontium manganite.,Ceramic membranes based on scandium-stabilized ZrO2 obtained by tape casting technique,10.1134/S1023193514080138
3,2105,"It is shown that though conductivity of such membranes is lower as compared to that of compacted and sintered compacted samples due to diffusion of the aluminum oxide admixture in the course of the manufacturing process, power density of SOFC is sufficiently high and reaches 430 mW/cm(2) at 850A degrees C.",Ceramic membranes based on scandium-stabilized ZrO2 obtained by tape casting technique,10.1134/S1023193514080138
