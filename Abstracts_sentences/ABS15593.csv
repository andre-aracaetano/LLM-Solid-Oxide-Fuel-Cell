3,15593,"In this work, the Ni-Nb and Sr were partially doped to Fe and La sites of LFO, respectively, to evaluate the doping effect on ORR ability.",A first-principles study of doping effect on enhancing ORR performance of Sr-Ni-Nb co-doped LaFeO3 perovskite,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.366
4,15593,"The increased formation energy illustrated that Nb-doping significantly enhanced the stability of LFO, while Ni-3d band emerged as the minimum conductive band mainly contributed to reduce the band gap.",A first-principles study of doping effect on enhancing ORR performance of Sr-Ni-Nb co-doped LaFeO3 perovskite,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.366
5,15593,"Moreover, the overpotential of LFO with Sr-doping (LSFO) was sharply reduced from 0.60 V to 0.34 V, which was possibly attributed to the decrease of eg-filling (less than 2), and hence increased the binding energy.",A first-principles study of doping effect on enhancing ORR performance of Sr-Ni-Nb co-doped LaFeO3 perovskite,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.366
6,15593,"Although surface O-vacancy (Ov) is more favorable to be induced than sublayer, the sublayer Ov facilitates to reduce the ORR overpotential.",A first-principles study of doping effect on enhancing ORR performance of Sr-Ni-Nb co-doped LaFeO3 perovskite,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.366
