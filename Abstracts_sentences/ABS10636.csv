2,10636,16 mm in diameter were successfully fabricated with electrophoretic deposition (EPD) techniques and subsequent co-firing processes.,Performance of anode-supported SOFCs fabricated with EPD techniques,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.032
3,10636,Obtained ScSZ films were 5 to 8 mum thick and were dense enough as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolyte.,Performance of anode-supported SOFCs fabricated with EPD techniques,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.032
4,10636,"Results of single-cell tests with lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) cathode revealed the following: (1) the observed open circuit voltage (OCV) values confirmed the ScSZ film to be dense enough as SOFC electrolyte and (2) the anode ohmic and polarization losses did not change at fuel utilizations from 15% to 81%, indicating that the anode microstructure is well fabricated.",Performance of anode-supported SOFCs fabricated with EPD techniques,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.032
