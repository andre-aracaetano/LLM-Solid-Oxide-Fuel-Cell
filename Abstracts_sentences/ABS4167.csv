1,4167,"Internal partial oxidation reforming of butane and steam reforming of ethanol were investigated using microtubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) supported on nickel-gadolinia doped ceria (Ni-GDC) anodes for portable power sources in emergency situations and for mobilities, such as vehicles, robots and drones.",Internal Partial Oxidation Reforming of Butane and Steam Reforming of Ethanol for Anode-supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700154
2,4167,"At an oxygen/carbon (O/C) ratio of 1.0, which is a coking condition in the equilibrium, the Ni-GDC anode deteriorated for 28 h by internal partial oxidation of butane at 650 degrees C. However, power generation was also impossible after 8 h and 79 h at steam/carbon (S/C) = 1.0 and 1.5, respectively, by internal steam reforming of ethanol despite of no carbon deposition condition in the equilibrium at 650 degrees C. Power can be generated for more than 100 h at O/C = 1.5 in butane and at S/C = 2.0 in ethanol.",Internal Partial Oxidation Reforming of Butane and Steam Reforming of Ethanol for Anode-supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700154
3,4167,"For internal partial oxidation reforming of methane and steam reforming of ethanol in SOFCs, the O/C and S/C ratios are significantly important to prevent carbon deposition on the Ni-GDC anode.",Internal Partial Oxidation Reforming of Butane and Steam Reforming of Ethanol for Anode-supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700154
