3,10959,"IR spectra showed a significant effect of Bi2O3 addition in the BaO-SiO2-B2O3 glass structure, causing a progressive conversion of [BO3] to [BO4] unit in the glasses.",Effect of bismuth oxide on crystallization and sealing behavior of barium borosilicate glass sealant for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2019.01.028
4,10959,The Bi2O3 addition made the BaO-SiO2-B2O3 glass network less rigid resulting in a decrease of a glass transition temperature and a softening point but still maintains the thermal expansion match between the Bi2O3-containing glasses and samaria-doped ceria solid electrolyte as well as an iron-chromium metallic interconnect.,Effect of bismuth oxide on crystallization and sealing behavior of barium borosilicate glass sealant for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2019.01.028
