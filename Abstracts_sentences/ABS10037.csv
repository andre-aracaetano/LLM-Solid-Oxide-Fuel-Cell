2,10037,A YSZ supported SOFC with pure LSCrM anode and La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) cathode exhibits the maximum power density (P-max) of 58.7 and 5.2 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C in dry H-2 and dry CH4.,Cobalt-impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.057
3,10037,"After the modification of anode with Co nitrate, the P-max reaches 196.2 mW cm(-2) in dry H-2 and 28.5 mW cm(-2) in dry CH4, about 3.34 times and 5.48 times increase, respectively.",Cobalt-impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.057
