6,9829,"The P1.1BCOF0.1 cathode-based fuel cell delivers a peak power density of 1102 mW/cm2, along with an excellent operating stability at 700 degrees C. Moreover, the current density of 1335 mA/cm2 is achieved in the P1.1BCOF0.1 anode-based electrolysis cell at 1.8 V toward CO2 reduction reaction at 750 degrees C. These results here highlight the performance origin and bifunctional activity of fluorine-doped perovskite materials, which may help us rationally design the oxide catalysts.(c) 2023",Unveiling positive impacts of fluorine anion doping on extraordinary catalytic activity of bifunctional-layered double perovskite electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.mtchem.2023.101469
