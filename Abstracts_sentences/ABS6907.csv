1,6907,"The cubic perovskite phase, Ba0.9Sr0.1Co0.9In0.1O3-delta (BSCI), has been investigated as an alternative cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Ba0.9Sr0.1Co0.9In0.1O3-δ perovskite as cathode material for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.03.257
2,6907,The BSCI exhibited a good chemical compatibility with the Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte at 1000 degrees C for 5 h. The In-doping resulted in a dramatic reduced thermal expansion coefficient.,Ba0.9Sr0.1Co0.9In0.1O3-δ perovskite as cathode material for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.03.257
3,6907,Its electrical conductivity is 8.7-13.6 S cm(-1) over the temperature range of 600-800 degrees C.,Ba0.9Sr0.1Co0.9In0.1O3-δ perovskite as cathode material for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.03.257
4,6907,"The area specific polarization resistance of BSCI cathode in air are 0.079 Omega cm(2), 0.151 Omega cm(2), and 0.376 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, 650 degrees C and 600 degrees C, respectively.",Ba0.9Sr0.1Co0.9In0.1O3-δ perovskite as cathode material for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.03.257
