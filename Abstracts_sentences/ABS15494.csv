1,15494,The influence of La doping concentration and A-site deficiency concentration on the electrical conductivity of La substituted SrTiO3 and its high-temperature chemical compatibility with ScSZ was investigated.,Influence of La doping concentration and A-site deficiency on electrical conductivity of La substituted SrTiO3 and its chemical compatibility with ScSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.046
2,15494,It was found that the chemical compatibility between (LaxSr1-x)1-yTiO3-delta ((LxS1-x)1-yT) and 1CeO2-10Sc2O3-89ZrO2 (ScSZ) gradu-ally deteriorates with the increase of La doping concentration from 10% to 40%.,Influence of La doping concentration and A-site deficiency on electrical conductivity of La substituted SrTiO3 and its chemical compatibility with ScSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.046
3,15494,"When the La doping concen-tration is 30-40%, chemical reaction will occur between LxS1-xT and ScSZ and La2Zr2O7 (LZO) will be generated, and the diffusion of Sc3+and Zr4+ in ScSZ to LxS1-xT is aggravated.",Influence of La doping concentration and A-site deficiency on electrical conductivity of La substituted SrTiO3 and its chemical compatibility with ScSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.046
4,15494,A-site deficient (LxS1-x)1-yT can effectively inhibit the interfacial reaction and element interdiffusion between it and ScSZ.,Influence of La doping concentration and A-site deficiency on electrical conductivity of La substituted SrTiO3 and its chemical compatibility with ScSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.046
5,15494,The first principle computation results indicate that the influence of La doping concentration and A-site deficiency on the vacancy formation energy (VFE) of Ti in (LxS1-x)1-yT determines its chemical compatibility with ScSZ.,Influence of La doping concentration and A-site deficiency on electrical conductivity of La substituted SrTiO3 and its chemical compatibility with ScSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.046
6,15494,"The results of electrical conductivity test and the first principle computation indicate that the La doping concentration and A-site defi-ciency will simultaneously influence the amount of Ti4+ to Ti3+ and the oxygen vacancy concentration in (LxS1-x)1-yT in reducing atmosphere, thus affecting its conductivity.",Influence of La doping concentration and A-site deficiency on electrical conductivity of La substituted SrTiO3 and its chemical compatibility with ScSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.06.046
