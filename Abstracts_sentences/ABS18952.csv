2,18952,"In this paper, we report for the first time, the interfacial reaction between Hf-containing borosilicate glass-ceramics and 8 mol.% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) electrolyte.",Reducing the interfacial reaction between boro silicate sealant and yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte by addition of HfO2,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.02.010
3,18952,The results show that the interdiffusion between the glass-ceramics and the 8YSZ can be confined to a similar to 2 mu m zone at the interface.,Reducing the interfacial reaction between boro silicate sealant and yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte by addition of HfO2,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.02.010
4,18952,"Additionally, the HfO2 dopant can inhibit the formation of monoclinic ZrO2 and zirconates in the reaction couples of glass-ceramics and 8YSZ, which can be attributed to the Hf-containing phase formation, e.g., Ca6Hf19O44 and Ca3HfSi2O9.",Reducing the interfacial reaction between boro silicate sealant and yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte by addition of HfO2,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.02.010
5,18952,"Moreover, the formation of the Hf-containing phases contributes to a low conductivity of the glass-ceramics, e.g., 1.9 x 10(-7) to 1.6 x 10(-6)",Reducing the interfacial reaction between boro silicate sealant and yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte by addition of HfO2,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.02.010
