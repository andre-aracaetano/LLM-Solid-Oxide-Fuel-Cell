1,4690,The Pechini method was used to synthesize nanopowders of CeO2-based solid solutions with the formula Ce0.8-xGd0.2SrxO2-delta for 0<0.1.,IONIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE CeO2-Gd2O3-SrO SYSTEM,10.2478/v10172-011-0143-4
2,4690,All powders and sinters were found to be ceria-based cubic solid solutions.,IONIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE CeO2-Gd2O3-SrO SYSTEM,10.2478/v10172-011-0143-4
3,4690,The electrical properties of the ceria-based solid solutions were studied by the a.c impedance spectroscopy method within a temperature range of 200-700 degrees C.,IONIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE CeO2-Gd2O3-SrO SYSTEM,10.2478/v10172-011-0143-4
4,4690,It was found that by adding a small amount of cation Sr2+ into the solid solution Ce0.8-xGd0.2SrxO2-delta<0.05 allowed us to slightly improve the ionic conductivity of a Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 delta oxide electrolyte.,IONIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE CeO2-Gd2O3-SrO SYSTEM,10.2478/v10172-011-0143-4
5,4690,Selected materials from the CeO2-Gd2O3-SrO system were tested as oxide electrolytes in the solid oxide fuel cells operating in a temperature range of 600-700 degrees C. Two kinds of cathode oxide materials were used: monophase Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 and the composite cathode Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-5% wt. Ag.,IONIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE CeO2-Gd2O3-SrO SYSTEM,10.2478/v10172-011-0143-4
6,4690,It was found that a solid oxide fuel cell with a Ce0.78Gd0.2Sr0.02O2 electrolyte exhibited higher power and current densities compared to IT-SOFC involving Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 as an oxide electrolyte.,IONIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE CeO2-Gd2O3-SrO SYSTEM,10.2478/v10172-011-0143-4
7,4690,The utilization of a Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-5% wt. composite cathode into IT-SOFC could be an additional factor improving its performance in the temperature range 600-700 degrees C.,IONIC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE CeO2-Gd2O3-SrO SYSTEM,10.2478/v10172-011-0143-4
