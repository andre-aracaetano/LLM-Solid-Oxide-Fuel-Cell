4,12464,"The condensed glass structure and increasing residual glass content play opposite roles on the interfacial reaction, consequently resulting in a maximum fraction of Cr6+ in reaction couples between Cr2O3 and glass containing 6 mole% Al2O3 at 700 degrees C.",Tuning the interfacial reaction between CaO-SrO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 sealing glass-ceramics and Cr-containing interconnect: Crystalline structure vs. glass structure,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.01.023
5,12464,"In addition, the good bonding can be observed at the interface between Cr-containing interconnect (Crofer 22APU) and glass containing 4 mole% Al2O3, held at 700 degrees C for 100 h. The reported results support the suitability of the prepared glass ceramics as sealing materials for SOFC applications.",Tuning the interfacial reaction between CaO-SrO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 sealing glass-ceramics and Cr-containing interconnect: Crystalline structure vs. glass structure,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.01.023
