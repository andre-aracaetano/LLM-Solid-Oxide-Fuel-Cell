3,8668,The polarization resistance of electrode was measured in the two-electrode symmetric cell configuration and an electrolyte-supported cell was prepared to assess Ce0.8Fe0.2O2-delta anode performance of running on methane fuel.,Performance of Ce/Fe oxide anodes for SOFC operating on methane fuel,10.1016/j.materresbull.2009.01.006
4,8668,The results suggested that Ce0.8Fe0.2O2-delta has a significant effect on the electrochemical oxidation of methane.,Performance of Ce/Fe oxide anodes for SOFC operating on methane fuel,10.1016/j.materresbull.2009.01.006
5,8668,"A maximum power density of single cell was 52 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C and little carbon deposition was shown on the anode operating in humidified methane for 20 h. Therefore, Ce0.8Fe0.2O2-delta is a promising candidate for anode of solid oxide fuel cell running on methane fuel, which breaks a new path to solve the problem of carbon deposition in methane.",Performance of Ce/Fe oxide anodes for SOFC operating on methane fuel,10.1016/j.materresbull.2009.01.006
