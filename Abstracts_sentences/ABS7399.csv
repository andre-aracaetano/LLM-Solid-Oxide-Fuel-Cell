1,7399,A 20 mum thick coating of La0.8Ca0.2CrO3 perovskite on Fe-25Cr steel substrates was obtained by the screen-printing method.,"Microstructure of Fe-25Cr/(La, Ca)CrO3 composite interconnector in solid oxide fuel cell operating conditions",10.1016/S0254-0584(03)00041-5
2,7399,"The interaction of the (La, Ca)CrO3 coating with the steel substrate occur-ring during oxidation in air at 1073 K for 200h was investigated.","Microstructure of Fe-25Cr/(La, Ca)CrO3 composite interconnector in solid oxide fuel cell operating conditions",10.1016/S0254-0584(03)00041-5
3,7399,"The microstructure, phase and chemical analyses of the coating after oxidation were examined.","Microstructure of Fe-25Cr/(La, Ca)CrO3 composite interconnector in solid oxide fuel cell operating conditions",10.1016/S0254-0584(03)00041-5
4,7399,"It has been revealed that the metal substrate-coating interfacial zone has a two-layer structure built of mainly FeCr2O4 and LaCrO3, which provide the electric contacts between the interconnector material and the film, thus creating conditions for prolonged exploitation of solid oxide fuel cells.","Microstructure of Fe-25Cr/(La, Ca)CrO3 composite interconnector in solid oxide fuel cell operating conditions",10.1016/S0254-0584(03)00041-5
