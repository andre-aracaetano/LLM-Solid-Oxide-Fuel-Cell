2,18321,We show that the oxide ion conductivity decreases in reducing the size of the rare earth.,The synthesis and characterisation of new apatite-type oxide ion conductors,10.4028/www.scientific.net/SSP.90-91.195
3,18321,"For Ln=Y, the undoped apatite phase, Y(9.33)Si(6)O(26) could not be prepared, but the apatite structure could be stabilised by the presence of divalent cations, i.e. Y(8)M(2)Si(6)O(26)",The synthesis and characterisation of new apatite-type oxide ion conductors,10.4028/www.scientific.net/SSP.90-91.195

6,18321,"The results showed that the oxide ion conductivity is maximised for non stoichiometric samples (x>0, y>0), with the conductivities of samples stoichiometric on both cation and anion sites, i.e. La(8)M(2)Si(6)O(26), being low.",The synthesis and characterisation of new apatite-type oxide ion conductors,10.4028/www.scientific.net/SSP.90-91.195
7,18321,"For samples containing excess oxygen, i.e. La(9)MSi(6)O(26.5), conductivities higher than that of yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) were observed at intermediate temperatures (approximate to500degreesC), with lower activation energies for oxide ion conduction.",The synthesis and characterisation of new apatite-type oxide ion conductors,10.4028/www.scientific.net/SSP.90-91.195
