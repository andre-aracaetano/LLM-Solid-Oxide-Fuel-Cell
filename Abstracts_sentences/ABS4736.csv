1,4736,Direct ammonia solid oxide fuel cell (DA-SOFC) is superior to low-temperature direct ammonia fuel cell using anion exchange membrane because of much improved anode reaction kinetics at elevated temperature.,"Infiltrated NiCo Alloy Nanoparticle Decorated Perovskite Oxide: A Highly Active, Stable, and Antisintering Anode for Direct-Ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/smll.202001859
2,4736,"However, significant performance degradation due to severe sintering of conventional nickel cermet anode under operating conditions is a big challenge for realizing its practical use.","Infiltrated NiCo Alloy Nanoparticle Decorated Perovskite Oxide: A Highly Active, Stable, and Antisintering Anode for Direct-Ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/smll.202001859
3,4736,"Herein, a high-performance anode based on La0.55Sr0.30TiO3-delta (LST) perovskite substrate with its surface decorated with in situ exsolved and strongly coupled NiCo alloy nanoparticles (NPs) is designed and fabricated for DA-SOFCs, exhibiting superior catalytic activity for NH3 decomposition reaction due to balanced NH3 adsorption and N-2 desorption processes.","Infiltrated NiCo Alloy Nanoparticle Decorated Perovskite Oxide: A Highly Active, Stable, and Antisintering Anode for Direct-Ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/smll.202001859
4,4736,"An electrolyte-supported single cell with infiltrated NiCo/LST on Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 scaffold anode delivers a maximum power density of 361 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C in NH3 fuel, superior to similar SOFCs with Ni or Co NP-decorated LST based anodes (161 and 98 mW cm(-2)).","Infiltrated NiCo Alloy Nanoparticle Decorated Perovskite Oxide: A Highly Active, Stable, and Antisintering Anode for Direct-Ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/smll.202001859
5,4736,"Furthermore, the SOFC with this newly developed anode displays favorable operational stability without obvious performance degradation at 700 degrees C for a test period of approximate to 120 h, attributed to its high antisintering capability.","Infiltrated NiCo Alloy Nanoparticle Decorated Perovskite Oxide: A Highly Active, Stable, and Antisintering Anode for Direct-Ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/smll.202001859
