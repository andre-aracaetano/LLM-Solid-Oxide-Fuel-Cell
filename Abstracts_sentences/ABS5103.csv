1,5103,A porous nickel tubular support of 1 mm diam was successfully created by heat-treating a commercial nickel tube.,Porous metal tubular support for solid oxide fuel cell design,10.1149/1.2218301
2,5103,"The resulting tube contained uniform pores, whose diameters ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 mu m, depending on treatment temperature.",Porous metal tubular support for solid oxide fuel cell design,10.1149/1.2218301
3,5103,The porous metal obtained is a promising candidate for support materials for microfuel cells or gas separation membranes because it has the necessary gas permeability and mechanical strength.,Porous metal tubular support for solid oxide fuel cell design,10.1149/1.2218301
4,5103,It was also confirmed that a solid oxide fuel cell design employing the porous nickel tube as a supporting anode could be operated.,Porous metal tubular support for solid oxide fuel cell design,10.1149/1.2218301
