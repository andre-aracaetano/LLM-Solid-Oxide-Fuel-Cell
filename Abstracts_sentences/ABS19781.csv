2,19781,"Their electrodes' materials mostly belong to the perovskite family, which in their versatile composition are numerous; here we focus on the perovskite LaCoxFe1-xO3 and examine its electronic structure for x <= 0.5 using density functional theory with a plane wave basis and pseudopotentials.",An ab initio characterization of the electronic structure of LaCoxFe1-xO3 for x ≤ 0.5,10.1002/pssb.201600141
3,19781,"The resulting lattice parameters show good agreement with experiment, and the Mulliken and Bader charges show that iron and cobalt mostly remain as Fe3+ and Co3+ throughout an increasing Co: Fe ratio.",An ab initio characterization of the electronic structure of LaCoxFe1-xO3 for x ≤ 0.5,10.1002/pssb.201600141

5,19781,"Density of states and partial density of states analyses reveal that increasing the ratio of Co to Fe in oxygen stoichiometric materials decreases their relative, semiconducting nature toward insulating, by virtue of the decrease in the number of (conducting) O-Fe-O bonds and the increase in (insulating) O-Co-O bonds.",An ab initio characterization of the electronic structure of LaCoxFe1-xO3 for x ≤ 0.5,10.1002/pssb.201600141
6,19781,"The appearance of an intermediate spin state of Co and examination of its PDOS confirms the hypothesis that Co-O, d-p hybridization is a necessary factor for its occurrence.",An ab initio characterization of the electronic structure of LaCoxFe1-xO3 for x ≤ 0.5,10.1002/pssb.201600141
