1,3152,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) formed on a stainless-steel plate having through holes was studied.,Power Generation Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Equipped With an Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte Formed Over a Support Metal Plate,10.1080/00219592.2024.2346077
2,3152,The obtained metal-supported SOFC can be operated at high temperatures such as 750 degrees C because it comprises an yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte.,Power Generation Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Equipped With an Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte Formed Over a Support Metal Plate,10.1080/00219592.2024.2346077
3,3152,It was confirmed that the aperture ratio of the support metal plate affected the power generation performance of the metal-supported SOFC.,Power Generation Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Equipped With an Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte Formed Over a Support Metal Plate,10.1080/00219592.2024.2346077
4,3152,The power density of the obtained SOFC at 0.8 V was increased from 0.22 W/cm2 to 0.85 W/cm2 at 750 degrees C by increasing the aperture ratio from 0.2% to 5.3%.,Power Generation Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Equipped With an Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte Formed Over a Support Metal Plate,10.1080/00219592.2024.2346077
5,3152,"Thus, it was found that the SOFC formed on a support metal plate having through-holes could show a power density comparable to or higher than that of previously reported SOFCs formed on porous sintered metal supports.",Power Generation Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Equipped With an Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte Formed Over a Support Metal Plate,10.1080/00219592.2024.2346077
