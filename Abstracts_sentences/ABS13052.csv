1,13052,Nanocomposite electrodes of (Sr0.7Pr0.3)(0.95)TiO3 +/-delta-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 are directly prepared by spray-pyrolysis deposition on Zr0.82Y0.16O1.92 electrolytes and their properties are compared with those obtained by the traditional screen-printing powder method.,Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells based on titanate nanocomposite electrodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.11.059
2,13052,"The structural, microstructural and electrical characteristics are investigated for their potential use as both cathode and anode in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells.",Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells based on titanate nanocomposite electrodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.11.059
3,13052,"The nanocomposite electrodes with reduced particle size similar to 30 nm achieved a polarization resistance at 700 degrees C of 0.50 and 0.46 Omega cm(2) in air and pure H-2, respectively, outperforming those obtained for the analogous screen-printed electrodes with particle size of 450 nm, i.e. 4.8 and 3.9 Omega cm(2), respectively.",Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells based on titanate nanocomposite electrodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.11.059
4,13052,"An electrolyte-supported cell with symmetrical electrodes reached a maximum and stable power density of 354 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. These results demonstrate that the performance of electrode materials with modest electrochemical properties but high phase stability, such as doped-SrTiO3, can be highly improved by preparing nanocomposite electrodes directly on the electrolyte surface.",Symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells based on titanate nanocomposite electrodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.11.059
