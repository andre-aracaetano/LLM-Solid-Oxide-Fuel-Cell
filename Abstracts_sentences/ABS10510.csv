8,10510,"Among the studied samples, the x = 40 wt% cathode exhibited the highest ORR catalytic activity characteristic of the lowest ASR values ranging from 0.005 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C to 0.288 Omega cm(2) 500 degrees C with Ea of 1.02eV. An anode supported single cell was fabricated based on the x = 40 wt% cathode, and high peak powder densities, such as 1171 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and 917 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C were achieved, further demonstrating its high ORR catalytic activity as a promising cathode material.",Properties of composite cathodes composed of Pr3+-deficient perovskite oxide and ionic conductor Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.04.051
