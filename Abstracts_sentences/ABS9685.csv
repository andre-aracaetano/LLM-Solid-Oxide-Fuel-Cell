1,9685,A model for a 1000 kW class solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system running on biogas from a sewage sludge digestion plant was implemented in a process flow scheme using external steam reforming.,Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
2,9685,The model stack consisted of planar anode supported cells operated at 800 degreesC displaying state-of-the-art electrochemical performance (0.15 W/cm(2) at 80% fuel utilisation).,Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
3,9685,Real annual data from an existing sewage plant were used as input to the model.,Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
4,9685,"From the input of 43 m(3)/h biogas (63% CH4), equivalent to 269 kW (higher heating value, HHV), the SOFC stack was calculated to deliver 131 kW,l electricity (48.7%) using a steam-to-carbon ratio of 0.5.",Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
5,9685,"This would allow the sewage site to more than cover its own electrical needs, hence to depollute the waste stream at negative energy cost.",Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
6,9685,"In its current exploitation using a low efficient gas engine (130 M), the site is only approximate to50% self-sufficient.",Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
7,9685,Special attention was given to the thermal balance of the stack.,Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
8,9685,"The stack developed heat (143 kW) could be balanced by endothermal reforming (78 kW) and by cathode excess air lambda (=3), allowing a temperature difference between stack inlet and outlet of 200 K.",Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
9,9685,The case was compared to other fuel scenarios.,Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
10,9685,Steam-added biogas behaves basically identically to steam-reformed methane.,Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
11,9685,"For partial oxidation of biogas or pure hydrogen feeding, electrical efficiency drops to under 43% while needs to be raised to 4.5 to maintain the 200 K thermal gradient over the stack.",Process flow model of solid oxide fuel cell system supplied with sewage biogas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.013
