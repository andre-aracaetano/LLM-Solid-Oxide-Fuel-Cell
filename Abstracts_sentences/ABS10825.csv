1,10825,Direct assembly is a newly developed technique in which a cobaltite- based perovskite (CBP) cathode can be directly applied to a barrier-layer-free Y2O3-ZrO2 (YSZ) electrolyte with no hightemperature pre-sintering steps.,Highly Stable Sr-Free Cobaltite-Based Perovskite Cathodes Directly Assembled on a Barrier-Layer-Free Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201601645
2,10825,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on directly assembled CBPs such as La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta show high performance initially but degrade rapidly under SOFC operation conditions at 750 degrees C owing to Sr segregation and accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface.,Highly Stable Sr-Free Cobaltite-Based Perovskite Cathodes Directly Assembled on a Barrier-Layer-Free Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201601645
3,10825,"Herein, the performance and interface of Sr-free CBPs such as LaCoO3-delta (LC) and Sm0.95CoO3-delta (SmC) and their composite cathodes directly assembled on YSZ electrolyte was studied systematically.",Highly Stable Sr-Free Cobaltite-Based Perovskite Cathodes Directly Assembled on a Barrier-Layer-Free Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201601645
4,10825,"The LC electrode underwent performance degradation, most likely owing to cation demixing and accumulation of La on the YSZ electrolyte under polarization at 500 mAcm(-2) and 750 degrees C. However, the performance and stability of LC electrodes could be substantially enhanced by the formation of LC-gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) composite cathodes.",Highly Stable Sr-Free Cobaltite-Based Perovskite Cathodes Directly Assembled on a Barrier-Layer-Free Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201601645
5,10825,"Replacement of La by Sm increased the cell stability, and doping of 5% Pd to form Sm0.95Co0.95Pd0.05O3-delta d (SmCPd) significantly improved the electrode activity.",Highly Stable Sr-Free Cobaltite-Based Perovskite Cathodes Directly Assembled on a Barrier-Layer-Free Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201601645
6,10825,"An anode-supported YSZ-electrolyte cell with a directly assembled SmCPdGDC composite electrode exhibited a peak power density of 1.4 Wcm(-2) at 750 degrees C, and an excellent stability at 750 degrees C for over 240 h.",Highly Stable Sr-Free Cobaltite-Based Perovskite Cathodes Directly Assembled on a Barrier-Layer-Free Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201601645
7,10825,The higher stability of SmC as compared to that of LC is most likely a result of the lower reactivity of SmC with YSZ.,Highly Stable Sr-Free Cobaltite-Based Perovskite Cathodes Directly Assembled on a Barrier-Layer-Free Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201601645
8,10825,This study demonstrates the new opportunities in the design and development of intermediate-temperature SOFCs based on the directly assembled high-performance and durable Sr-free CBP cathodes.,Highly Stable Sr-Free Cobaltite-Based Perovskite Cathodes Directly Assembled on a Barrier-Layer-Free Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/cssc.201601645
