2,11802,They appear to be chemically compatible with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ),Lanthanum Strontium Vanadate as Potential Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3058585
3,11802,", at least up to 1300 degrees C. Electrode performance is evaluated by impedance spectroscopy and dc polarization between 800 and 1000 degrees C. Good electrode performance is achieved with LSV (x = 0.2, 0.3 0.4, 0.5)-YSZ composite anodes, both in pure H-2 and wet CH4 (3% H2O, saturated at 25 degrees C).",Lanthanum Strontium Vanadate as Potential Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3058585
4,11802,"For half-cells with La0.6Sr0.4VO3-YSZ anode, polarization resistance is 0.85 and 1.38 Omega cm(2) at 900 degrees C in pure H-2 and wet CH4.",Lanthanum Strontium Vanadate as Potential Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3058585

6,11802,"When drawing a current of 0.2 A/cm(2) at 900 degrees C, the overpotential is 0.13 V in pure H-2, and slightly higher in wet CH4, 0.20 V. Further optimization of electrode microstructures is needed to maximize the performance of LSV for potential SOFC application.",Lanthanum Strontium Vanadate as Potential Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3058585
