1,1923,We have developed a I kW class solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack composed of 50 anode-supported planar 120-mm-diameter SOFCs.,Development of 1 kW class solid oxide fuel cell stack using anode-supported planar cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.083
2,1923,"Intermediate plates, which exhibited negligible deformation under operating conditions, were placed in the stack to cancel out the cumulative error related to the position and angle of the stack parts.",Development of 1 kW class solid oxide fuel cell stack using anode-supported planar cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.083
3,1923,"The stack provided an electrical conversion efficiency of 54% (based on the lower heating value (LHV) of the methane used as a fuel) and an output of 1120W when the fuel utilization, current density, and operating temperature were 67%, 0.28 Acm(-2), and 1073 K, respectively.",Development of 1 kW class solid oxide fuel cell stack using anode-supported planar cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.083
4,1923,The stack operated stably for almost 700 h. (C) 2008,Development of 1 kW class solid oxide fuel cell stack using anode-supported planar cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.083
