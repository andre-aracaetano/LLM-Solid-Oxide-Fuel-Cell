1,19479,The properties of supported Pt-containing granular (Pt/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 - delta) and structured catalysts (Pt/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 - delta/eta-Al2O3/FeCrAl) in methanol decomposition to synthesis gas for feeding solid oxide fuel cells have been studied.,Methanol Decomposition to Synthesis Gas over Supported Platinum-Containing Catalysts,10.1134/S2070050423040037
2,19479,It has been shown that the use of a structured catalyst for the methanol decomposition reaction is promising.,Methanol Decomposition to Synthesis Gas over Supported Platinum-Containing Catalysts,10.1134/S2070050423040037
3,19479,It has been found that the addition of a small amount of oxygen to the feed mixture hinders the formation of carbon and thereby increases the on-stream stability of the catalyst.,Methanol Decomposition to Synthesis Gas over Supported Platinum-Containing Catalysts,10.1134/S2070050423040037
