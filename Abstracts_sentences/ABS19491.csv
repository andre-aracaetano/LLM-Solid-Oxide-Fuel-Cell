1,19491,The chemical compatibility of thin electrolyte layers and their support materials at high temperatures is crucial for the performance in solid oxide cells and membranes.,Interaction between proton conducting BaCe0.2Zr0.7Y0.1O3 electrolyte and structural ceramics during sintering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2023.12.050
2,19491,"This work describes the chemical interaction between the electrolyte material, BaCe0.2Zr0.7Y0.1O3 + 0.5 wt% NiO (BCZY), and structural ceramics Al2O3, 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (8YSZ), TiO2, CeO2 and MgO during sintering.",Interaction between proton conducting BaCe0.2Zr0.7Y0.1O3 electrolyte and structural ceramics during sintering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2023.12.050
3,19491,"1:1 wt% powder mixtures of the electrolyte material and structural ceramics were annealed at 1500 degrees C for 5 h, with the phase composition being determined through XRD analysis at room temperature.",Interaction between proton conducting BaCe0.2Zr0.7Y0.1O3 electrolyte and structural ceramics during sintering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2023.12.050
4,19491,"Subsequently, the material interaction between BCZY films deposited on the most promising structural ceramic MgO was investigated by SEM and EDS.",Interaction between proton conducting BaCe0.2Zr0.7Y0.1O3 electrolyte and structural ceramics during sintering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2023.12.050
5,19491,"In particular, the complex sintering requirements to form single-phase BCZY electrolyte layers is troubled upon coating and sintering BCZY on MgO. Hereby, the diffusion of NiO into the MgO support leads to a deficiency of NiO in the BCZY layer, making the solution and precipitation mechanism required to form the perovskitic phase unable to occur.",Interaction between proton conducting BaCe0.2Zr0.7Y0.1O3 electrolyte and structural ceramics during sintering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2023.12.050
6,19491,"In extreme scenarios, the electrolyte layer depletion of NiO can even cause the decomposition of a single-phase BCZY into BaZrO3, Ce-Y fluorite and a BCZY perovskite phase of undefined composition.",Interaction between proton conducting BaCe0.2Zr0.7Y0.1O3 electrolyte and structural ceramics during sintering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2023.12.050
