2,10874,Thermal expansion measurements showed that TiO2 contributes to the reduction of the thermal expansion coefficient values of the cermet material.,5 mol% TiO2-doped Ni-YSZ anode cermets for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00392-1
3,10874,"The incorporation of TiO2 into the YSZ lattice was found to reduce slightly the ionic conductivity of the pure ceramic, while under reducing conditions the electronic contribution, due to the reduction of Ti+4 to Ti+3, results in a decrease of the activation energy for conduction in the order of 13%.",5 mol% TiO2-doped Ni-YSZ anode cermets for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00392-1
4,10874,"For the TiO2-doped cermets the electrical conductivity was always better than that of the undoped, exhibiting a lower degradation rate at 1000 degreesC. Based on microstructure examination of the samples, this degradation was attributed to the lower agglomeration trend of the Ni-particles of the doped cermets compared to the Ni-YSZ cermet.",5 mol% TiO2-doped Ni-YSZ anode cermets for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00392-1
