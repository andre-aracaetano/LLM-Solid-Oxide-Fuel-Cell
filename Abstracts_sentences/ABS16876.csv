1,16876,Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) has widely been used as electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Research on sintering process of YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/S1001-0521(08)60083-2
2,16876,The microstructure of YSZ related to the fabrication process was discussed in the paper.,Research on sintering process of YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/S1001-0521(08)60083-2
3,16876,"With YSZ nano-powders about 40-100 nm as raw material, the YSZ adobe was manufactured by tape calendering process.",Research on sintering process of YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/S1001-0521(08)60083-2
4,16876,"The named three-step sintering process was performed at 1000 degrees C for 2 h, then raised the temperature with normal rate and as soon as up to 1400 degrees C, the furnace was controlled at 1250-1300 degrees C for 10-20 h. The high dense YSZs with the relative density of 96%-99% were obtained; the grain size of YSZ could be reduced to 0.5-3 mu m. The above result is benefited to co-fired in the electrode-supported SOFCs.",Research on sintering process of YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/S1001-0521(08)60083-2
