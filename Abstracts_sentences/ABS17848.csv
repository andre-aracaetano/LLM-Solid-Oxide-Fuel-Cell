5,17848,104 W/cm(2) and a short circuit current density of 500 mA/cm(2) of the cell was achieved at 750 degreesC by using (CeO2)(0.9)(SmO1.5)(0.1) electrolyte.,Electrolyte and electrode materials of intermedium-temperature SOFC prepared by glycine-nitrate process,
6,17848,"The inferior SOFC performance of the (CeO2)(0.8)(SmO1.5)(0.2) electrolyte was due to the physical discontinuity at the clearly grain boundary and could effectively introduce barriers to ionic conduction in reducing atmosphere, while the (CeO2)(0.9)(SmO1.5)(0.1) electrolyte's boundary tends to be merged.",Electrolyte and electrode materials of intermedium-temperature SOFC prepared by glycine-nitrate process,
