1,6875,Electrochemical vapor deposition (EVD) is a key technology for making thin layers of the solid electrolyte as well as the interconnection material of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,THIN-FILM TECHNIQUES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90076-2
2,6875,In addition to EVD several advanced deposition techniques for SOFC components and SOFC stacks have recently been reported.,THIN-FILM TECHNIQUES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90076-2
3,6875,"Among these techniques are thermal spraying and laser spraying techniques, while the chemical aerosol deposition technology holds promise for utilisation in SOFC technology.",THIN-FILM TECHNIQUES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90076-2
4,6875,One of the major drawbacks of gas-phase deposition techniques is the low growth rate.,THIN-FILM TECHNIQUES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90076-2
5,6875,To circumvent this problem a combination of the EVD process and thermophoresis assisted chemical vapor deposition (TA-CVD) has been developed by the present authors.,THIN-FILM TECHNIQUES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90076-2
6,6875,This latter process is also referred to as particle precipitation aided-CVD (PP-CVD).,THIN-FILM TECHNIQUES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90076-2
7,6875,With the PP-CVD technique growth rate increases in the order of 100-1000 can be achieved.,THIN-FILM TECHNIQUES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90076-2
8,6875,The principles of these advanced deposition techniques will be reviewed.,THIN-FILM TECHNIQUES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90076-2
9,6875,Characteristics of layers of SOFC components and SOFC stacks will be discussed.,THIN-FILM TECHNIQUES FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90076-2
