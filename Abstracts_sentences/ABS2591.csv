2,2591,"Transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy observations showed that Ru nanoclusters precipitated onto La(0.8)Sr(0.2)Cr(0.82)Ru(0.19)O(3-delta) Surfaces after exposure to hydrogen at 800 degrees C, with Ru cluster size stabilizing at <= 5 nm for the longest times tested, similar to 300 h. Solid oxide fuel cell tests were done in humidified hydrogen at 800 degrees C with La(0.8)Sr(0.2)Cr(0.82)Ru(0.18)O3-delta-GDC (GDC = Gd-doped ceria) anodes on LSGM electrolyte-supported cells.",Nucleation of nanometer-scale electrocatalyst particles in solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.080
3,2591,Cell power density increased over the first similar to 50 h of cell operation from similar to 200 to 400 mW cm(-2) due to an anode polarization resistance decrease from similar to 0.6 to < 0.2 Omega cm(2).,Nucleation of nanometer-scale electrocatalyst particles in solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.080
