1,7945,The performance of a Victorian brown coal with minimal pre-treatment was assessed in a solid oxide electrolyte based direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) at 700 and 800 degrees C.,Direct carbon fuel cell operation on brown coal,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.046
2,7945,"In order to evaluate the effect of inherent inorganic species in the coal on the electrochemical performance of DCFCs (voltage - power density current density), characteristics of button cells fuelled with raw and acid washed (demineralised) coal were compared along with commercially available XC72 carbon black.",Direct carbon fuel cell operation on brown coal,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.046
3,7945,"Peak power densities of 65 and 67 mW cm(-2) were observed for demineralised coal char and carbon black respectively at 800 degrees C, whereas the raw coal char achieved a superior power density of 89 mW cm(-2).",Direct carbon fuel cell operation on brown coal,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.046
