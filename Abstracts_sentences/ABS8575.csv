1,8575,Ni/Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (Ni/GDC) anodes were infiltrated with various amounts of the proton conductor SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-alpha (SCYb) with the goal of improving the performance of solid oxide fuel cells.,Effect of Proton Conductor SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-α on Electrochemical Characteristics of Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Anode in Dry Methane,10.1149/1.3462983
2,8575,"First, the electrochemical characteristics of the Ni/GDC and Ni/GDC-SCYb anodes were evaluated in humidified hydrogen (1% H2O) fuel and in dry methane fuel at 1173 K, and then the durability of the anodes against carbon deposition was evaluated using an accelerated degradation test.",Effect of Proton Conductor SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-α on Electrochemical Characteristics of Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Anode in Dry Methane,10.1149/1.3462983
3,8575,"Results revealed that the maximum power density of the Ni/GDC-SCYb anode was 50% higher than that of the Ni/GDC anode, namely 0.648 W/cm(2) in humidified H-2 and 0.438 W/cm(2) in dry methane.",Effect of Proton Conductor SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-α on Electrochemical Characteristics of Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Anode in Dry Methane,10.1149/1.3462983
4,8575,"In conclusion, the performance of Ni/GDC anodes can be improved in either humidified hydrogen fuel or dry methane fuel by infiltration with SCYb.",Effect of Proton Conductor SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-α on Electrochemical Characteristics of Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Anode in Dry Methane,10.1149/1.3462983
