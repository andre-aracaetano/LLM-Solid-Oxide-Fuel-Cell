1,6158,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on the proton conducting BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY) electrolyte were prepared and tested in 500-700 degrees C using humidified H-2 as fuel (100 cm(3) min(-1) with 3% H2O) and dry O-2 (50 cm(3) min(-1)) as oxidant.,Preparation of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Anode Functional Layers by Tape Casting,10.1002/fuce.201000147
2,6158,"Thin NiO-BZCY anode functional layers (AFL) with 0, 5, 10 and 15 wt.% carbon pore former were inserted between the NiO-BZCY anode and BZCY electrolyte to enhance the cell performance.",Preparation of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Anode Functional Layers by Tape Casting,10.1002/fuce.201000147
3,6158,"The anode/AFL/BZCY half cells were prepared by tape casting and co-sintering (1,300 degrees C/8 h), while the Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) cathodes were prepared by thermal spray deposition.",Preparation of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Anode Functional Layers by Tape Casting,10.1002/fuce.201000147
4,6158,Well adhered planar SOFCs were obtained and the test results indicated that the SOFC with an AFL containing 10 wt.% pore former content showed the best performance: area specific resistance as low as 0.39 Omega cm(2) and peak power density as high as 0.863 W cm(-2) were obtained at 700 degrees C. High open circuit voltages ranging from 1.00 to 1.12 V in 700-500 degrees C also indicated negligible leakage of fuel gas through the electrolyte.,Preparation of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Anode Functional Layers by Tape Casting,10.1002/fuce.201000147
