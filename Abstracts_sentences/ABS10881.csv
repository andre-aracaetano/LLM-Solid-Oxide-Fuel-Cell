1,10881,"Here we report a new process termed reverse friction deposition, wherein the parent rod used as a consumable tool in a friction stir welding machine curls up and gets deposited as a seamless tube over itself.",A novel method to process oxide dispersed strengthened alloy interconnect,10.1016/j.mtla.2019.100229
2,10881,The process parameters were optimized and oxide dispersed strengthened (ODS) ferritic stainless tube was processed.,A novel method to process oxide dispersed strengthened alloy interconnect,10.1016/j.mtla.2019.100229
3,10881,The formed tube exhibited a fine-grained structure and improved oxidation behavior.,A novel method to process oxide dispersed strengthened alloy interconnect,10.1016/j.mtla.2019.100229
4,10881,The weight gain after oxidation was lower in the tubes compared to that in the parent rod.,A novel method to process oxide dispersed strengthened alloy interconnect,10.1016/j.mtla.2019.100229
5,10881,The dispersion of oxide (zirconia) particles in the ODS alloy retarded the outward chromium diffusion by pinning down the grain boundaries which might have been the faster diffusion paths for Cr in absence of the particles.,A novel method to process oxide dispersed strengthened alloy interconnect,10.1016/j.mtla.2019.100229
