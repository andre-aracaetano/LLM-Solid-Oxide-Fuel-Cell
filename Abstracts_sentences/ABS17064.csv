3,17064,"In this study, various compositions of LaSr(GaMg)(1-x)MnxO3 or xLSM-(1-x)LSGM (x=0-1) system were prepared to identify the possible reaction products and to see their effects on the electrical conductivity.",Phase characterization and electrical conductivity of LaSr(GaMg)1-xMnxO3 system,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00120-0
4,17064,"Powder compacts were prepared by using the solid-state reaction method and sintered at 1500 degreesC for 6 h. The phase, analyzed from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, changed from the single-phase cubic (0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.12) to the mixture of cubic and hexagonal phases (0.12<0.20) and finally to the mixture of hexagonal and orthorhombic phases (0.2<1).",Phase characterization and electrical conductivity of LaSr(GaMg)1-xMnxO3 system,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00120-0
