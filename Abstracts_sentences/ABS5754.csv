1,5754,"Considered as an electrode for SOFC, the system Gd1-xSrxCoO3 was studied for the electrical conductivity, cathodic polarization and reactivity between Gd1-xSrxCoO3 and YSZ (8 mol% Y2O3 doped zirconia).",Gd1-xSrxCoO3 for the electrode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00285-8
2,5754,"Although the cathodic activity is excellent and similar to the La1-xSrxCoO3 system, the formation of SrZrO3 at the interface between Gd1-xSrxCoO3 and YSZ was observed at higher temperature, which causes the deterioration of the cathodic activity.",Gd1-xSrxCoO3 for the electrode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00285-8
3,5754,"However, GdCoO3, being different from LaCoO3, yields no reaction product with YSZ at high temperature and shows no deterioration in the cathodic activity for the electrode even when sintered at 1000 degrees C.",Gd1-xSrxCoO3 for the electrode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/0167-2738(96)00285-8
