2,13640,The composite sealant with 10wt%-30wt% ZrO2-filler in the Bi2O3-BaO-SiO2(BiBaSi) glass were researched in order to improve sealing properties at high temperature.,Properties of Bi2O3-BaO-SiO2-RxOy Glass with ZrO2-filler Composite Sealant,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2010.01058
3,13640,"As a result, the coefficients of thermal expansion of the composite sealants were increased than that of basic glass.",Properties of Bi2O3-BaO-SiO2-RxOy Glass with ZrO2-filler Composite Sealant,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2010.01058
4,13640,"The suitable sealing temperatures of composite sealant vary from the 720 degrees C of base glass to 780 degrees C, 860 degrees C and 900 degrees C of BiBaSi-10Zr, BiBaSi-20Zr, BiBaSi-30Zr, respectively.",Properties of Bi2O3-BaO-SiO2-RxOy Glass with ZrO2-filler Composite Sealant,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2010.01058
5,13640,"ZrO2-fillers in base glass have two roles Parts of ZrO2-fillers as skeletal structure materials always exist in base glass, which help to maintain the required shape and size of sealant.",Properties of Bi2O3-BaO-SiO2-RxOy Glass with ZrO2-filler Composite Sealant,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2010.01058
6,13640,The other ZrO2-fillers can also drop into the network of the BiBaSi glass and therefore form a new phase Bi4Si3O12.,Properties of Bi2O3-BaO-SiO2-RxOy Glass with ZrO2-filler Composite Sealant,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2010.01058
