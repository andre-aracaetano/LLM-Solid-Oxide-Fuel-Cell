1,4268,A major degradation mechanism in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is poisoning of the cathode by chromium from volatilization of the interconnect material.,Effect of cathode and electrolyte transport properties on chromium poisoning in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.005
2,4268,The chromium deposition has been attributed to both chemical and electrochemical mechanisms.,Effect of cathode and electrolyte transport properties on chromium poisoning in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.005
3,4268,"For an electrochemical reaction, deposition can occur only where both ions and electrons are available, which, for a purely ionic conducting electrolyte and a purely electronic conducting cathode, can occur only at the three-phase gas-electrolyte-electrode interface.",Effect of cathode and electrolyte transport properties on chromium poisoning in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.005
4,4268,"However, the introduction of ionic conductivity into the cathode or electronic conductivity into the electrolyte can allow deposition to occur away from this three-phase interface, and thus alter its effect on the fuel cell performance.",Effect of cathode and electrolyte transport properties on chromium poisoning in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.005
