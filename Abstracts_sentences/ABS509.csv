6,509,"The choice of hybrid configuration will depend on the application, but from this analysis it is shown that a recuperated gas turbine cycle with a fuel cell ahead of the combustor is a good choice for power generation at small/medium scale.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles. Part 2: hybrid model for various integration schemes,10.1243/09576500260049052
7,509,"This cycle achieved a thermal efficiency of 64.1 per cent at a relatively low pressure ratio of 14; the specific power, although lower than that of other configurations explored, was found to be reasonable at 520 kW/kg s.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles. Part 2: hybrid model for various integration schemes,10.1243/09576500260049052
8,509,"The addition of an intercooler to this cycle indicated a further increase in efficiency at 69.6 per cent and a considerable increase in specific power; the corresponding pressure ratio was 30, which would lead to a significantly different gas turbine.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles. Part 2: hybrid model for various integration schemes,10.1243/09576500260049052
9,509,The maximum efficiency of all cases was found for a cycle containing a primary fuel cell (ahead of the combustor) and a reheat fuel cell (in-between the high-pressure and low-pressure turbine) with a numerical value of 76.4 per cent at a low pressure ratio but leading to a much reduced power (200 kW/kg s); a peak specific power of 489 kW/kg s was found but at much higher pressure ratios.,Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles.
