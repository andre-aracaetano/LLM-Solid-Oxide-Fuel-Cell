2,13798,"In this study, the relationship between the Sr doping content and microstructure, chemical stability against CO2, and conductivity of the sintered Ba1-xSrxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-delta pallets are systematically investigated using XRD, SEM, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and dc two-probe measurements.",Strontium doping effect on phase homogeneity and conductivity of Ba1-xSrxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-δ proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.043
3,13798,"All sintered Ba1-xSrxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-delta oxides exhibit excellent chemical stability after being exposed to the CO2 ambient at 600 degrees C for a long duration; nevertheless, their microstructures and conductivities are very sensitive to the Sr doping amount.",Strontium doping effect on phase homogeneity and conductivity of Ba1-xSrxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-δ proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.043
4,13798,"The Sr incorporation is found to apparently suppress the formation of CeO2-like second phase, and enhance the grain growth in sintered oxides.",Strontium doping effect on phase homogeneity and conductivity of Ba1-xSrxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-δ proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.043

6,13798,"This result can be attributed to the competition between the elimination of CeO2- or (Zr,Ce,Y)O-2-like phase inhomogeneity and enhanced grain growth in sintered oxides, both of which adversely influence the ionic conductivity.",Strontium doping effect on phase homogeneity and conductivity of Ba1-xSrxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-δ proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.043
7,13798,This work demonstrates that Ba1-xSrxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-delta would be a promising electrolyte for H+-SOFC applications if the Sr doping is well controlled.,Strontium doping effect on phase homogeneity and conductivity of Ba1-xSrxCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-δ proton-conducting oxides,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.043
