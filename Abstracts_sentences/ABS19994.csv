6,19994,"Sr substitutional doping not only facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, i.e., the number of diffusion carriers, but also affects the diffusivity by locally lowering the formation energy.",Mechanism for the Enhancement of the Oxygen Diffusivity by Cation Substitution in La2-xSrxCuO4,10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c03072
7,19994,"Two competing effects of Sr, weakly trapping the oxygen vacancies and alleviating the bottleneck of the above hopping, are quantified using our realistic random walk simulation, and the resulting diffusion coefficients reveal that the latter dominates at all doping concentrations, but the effect is saturated at x similar to 0.3.",Mechanism for the Enhancement of the Oxygen Diffusivity by Cation Substitution in La2-xSrxCuO4,10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c03072
