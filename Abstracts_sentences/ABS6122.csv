1,6122,Chromia (Cr2O3) forming ferritic stainless steels are being developed for interconnect application in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC).,Oxidation resistance of novel ferritic stainless steels alloyed with titanium for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.02.010
2,6122,A problem with these alloys is that in the SOFC environment chrome in the surface oxide can evaporate and deposit on the electrochemically active sites within the fuel cell.,Oxidation resistance of novel ferritic stainless steels alloyed with titanium for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.02.010
3,6122,This poisons and degrades the performance of the fuel cell.,Oxidation resistance of novel ferritic stainless steels alloyed with titanium for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.02.010
4,6122,The development of steels that can form conductive outer protective oxide layers other than Cr2O3 or (CrMn)(3)O-4 such as TiO2 may be attractive for SOFC application.,Oxidation resistance of novel ferritic stainless steels alloyed with titanium for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.02.010

6,6122,The effect of Cr content (6-22 wt.%) and the application of a Ce-based surface treatment on the oxidation behavior (at 800 degrees C in air + 3% H2O) of the alloys was investigated.,Oxidation resistance of novel ferritic stainless steels alloyed with titanium for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.02.010
7,6122,The alloys themselves failed to form an outer TiO2 scale even though the large negative Delta G of this compound favors its formation over other species.,Oxidation resistance of novel ferritic stainless steels alloyed with titanium for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.02.010
8,6122,"It was found that in conjunction with the Ce-surface treatment, a continuous outer TiO2 oxide layer could be formed on the alloys, and in fact the alloy with 12 wt.% Cr behaved in an identical manner as the alloy with 22 wt.% Cr.",Oxidation resistance of novel ferritic stainless steels alloyed with titanium for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.02.010
