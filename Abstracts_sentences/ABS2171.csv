1,2171,"By synthesizing the nominal PrxSr0.5MnO3-d materials (x = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8), new Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3-d (PSM50)+ PrO2_(x) composite cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were developed.",In-situ exsolution of PrO2_x nanoparticles boost the performance of traditional Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3-d cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2023.06.054
2,2171,"The structure analysis and morphology observations verified the exsolution of PrO2_(x) particles, and the amount of exsolved PrO2_(x) increased with the amount of Pr in PrxSr0.5MnO3-d. An H-SOFC with a Pr0.7Sr0.5MnO3-d (PSM70) cathode enabled the highest reported fuel cell output for H-SOFCs with manganate cathodes.",In-situ exsolution of PrO2_x nanoparticles boost the performance of traditional Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3-d cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2023.06.054
3,2171,"The construction of a PSM50/PrO2 heterostructure interface can reduce the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, hence accelerating the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, as confirmed by oxygen diffusion and surface exchange experiments.",In-situ exsolution of PrO2_x nanoparticles boost the performance of traditional Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3-d cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2023.06.054
4,2171,"The excellent electrochemical performance was combined with its good chemical stability against CO2 and H2O, allowing a stable operation of the cell for over 100 h, indicating that PSM70, which was in fact PSM50 +PrO2_(x), was a highly efficient and durable cathode material for H-SOFCs.",In-situ exsolution of PrO2_x nanoparticles boost the performance of traditional Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3-d cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2023.06.054
