1,609,The main goal of this work is the transient analysis of hybrid systems based on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Transient analysis of solid oxide fuel cell hybrids - Part I: Fuel cell models,10.1115/1.2056529
2,609,"The work is divided into three parts: in the first, the fuel cell transient models are presented and discussed, whereas in the subsequent parts of the paper the anodic recirculation system (Part B: Ferrari, M.L., Traverso, A., Massardo, 2004, ASME Paper No. 2004-GT-53716) and the entire hybrid transient performance (Part C: Magistri, L., Ferrari, M.L., Traverso, A., Costamagna, P., Massardo, A.F., 2004, ASME Paper No. 2004-GT-53845) are investigated.",Transient analysis of solid oxide fuel cell hybrids - Part I: Fuel cell models,10.1115/1.2056529
3,609,In this paper the transient behavior of a solid oxide fuel cell is analyzed through the use of two different approaches macroscopic and detailed SOFC models.,Transient analysis of solid oxide fuel cell hybrids - Part I: Fuel cell models,10.1115/1.2056529
4,609,"Both models are presented in this paper, and their simulation results are compared to each other and to available experimental data.",Transient analysis of solid oxide fuel cell hybrids - Part I: Fuel cell models,10.1115/1.2056529
5,609,As a first step the transient response of the fuel cell was studied using a very detailed model in order to completely describe this phenomenon and to highlight the critical aspects.,Transient analysis of solid oxide fuel cell hybrids - Part I: Fuel cell models,10.1115/1.2056529
6,609,"Subsequently, some modifications were made to this model to create an apt simulation tool (macroscopic fuel cell model) for the whole plant analysis.",Transient analysis of solid oxide fuel cell hybrids - Part I: Fuel cell models,10.1115/1.2056529
7,609,The reliability of this model was verified by comparing several transient responses to time results obtained with the detailed model.,Transient analysis of solid oxide fuel cell hybrids - Part I: Fuel cell models,10.1115/1.2056529
8,609,"In the subsequent papers (Parts B and C), the integration of the macroscopic fuel cell model into the whole plant model will be.",Transient analysis of solid oxide fuel cell hybrids - Part I: Fuel cell models,10.1115/1.2056529
9,609,described and the transient study of the hybrid plant will be presented.,Transient analysis of solid oxide fuel cell hybrids - Part I: Fuel cell models,10.1115/1.2056529
