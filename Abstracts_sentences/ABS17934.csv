4,17934,"The simulations indicate amorphization of the Ni surface, partial decohesion (delamination) at the interface, and coking, which have indeed all been observed experimentally.",ReaxFF Reactive Force-Field Modeling of the Triple-Phase Boundary in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/jz501891y
5,17934,They also allowed us to derive the mechanism of the butane conversion at the Ni/YSZ interface.,ReaxFF Reactive Force-Field Modeling of the Triple-Phase Boundary in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/jz501891y
6,17934,Many steps of this mechanism are similar to the pyrolysis of butane.,ReaxFF Reactive Force-Field Modeling of the Triple-Phase Boundary in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/jz501891y
7,17934,"The products obtained in our simulations are the same as those in experiment, which indicates that the developed ReaxFF potential properly describes complex physicochemical processes, such as the oxide-ion diffusion, fuel conversion, water formation reaction, coking, and delamination, occurring at the TPB and can be recommended for further computational studies of the fuel/electrode/electrolyte interfaces in a SOFC.",ReaxFF Reactive Force-Field Modeling of the Triple-Phase Boundary in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/jz501891y
