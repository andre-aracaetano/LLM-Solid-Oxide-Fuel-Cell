5,19915,"Consequently, the electrolyzer exhibits a relatively high electrolysis current density of -1.107 A cm(-2) and a significantly low electrode polarization resistance of 0.32 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C and 1.3 V when the cathode and anode are exposed to 67% CO2-33% CO and ambient air, respectively, resulting from remarkably decreased concentration and activation polarization.","A Highly-Performed, Dual-Layered Cathode Supported Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell for Efficient CO2 Electrolysis Fabricated by Phase Inversion Co-Tape Casting Method",10.1149/2.0841712jes
6,19915,"Thermodynamics calculations imply that the cells may suffer from the carbon coke issue in the CO-rich atmospheres, but no evidence of coking has been observed by SEM and Raman Spectroscopy, indicating that further work should be done to deeper understand the coking issue during the CO2 electrolysis process.","A Highly-Performed, Dual-Layered Cathode Supported Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell for Efficient CO2 Electrolysis Fabricated by Phase Inversion Co-Tape Casting Method",10.1149/2.0841712jes
