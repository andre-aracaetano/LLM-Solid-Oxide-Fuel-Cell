2,2022,"We suggest here a design that yields the electrode overpotential with only a negligible ohmic contribution from the solid electrolyte bulk, is quite insensitive to small inaccuracy in the electrode positioning, and can serve as a standard configuration for electrode evaluation.",Preferred position for the reference electrode in solid state electrochemistry,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00177-7
