3,18122,"(NBT) is a well-known lead-free piezoelectric material; however, it is often reported to possess high leakage conductivity that is problematic for its piezo- and ferroelectric applications(10-15).",A family of oxide ion conductors based on the ferroelectric perovskite Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3,10.1038/NMAT3782
4,18122,Here we report this high leakage to be oxide ion conduction due to Bi-deficiency and oxygen vacancies induced during materials processing.,A family of oxide ion conductors based on the ferroelectric perovskite Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3,10.1038/NMAT3782
5,18122,"Mg-doping on the Ti-site increases the ionic conductivity to similar to 0.01 S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C, improves the electrolyte stability in reducing atmospheres and lowers the sintering temperature.",A family of oxide ion conductors based on the ferroelectric perovskite Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3,10.1038/NMAT3782
6,18122,"This study not only demonstrates how to adjust the nominal NBT composition for dielectric-based applications, but also, more importantly, gives NBT-based materials an unexpected role as a completely new family of oxide ion conductors with potential applications in intermediate-temperature SOFCs and opens up a new direction to design oxide ion conductors in perovskite oxides.",A family of oxide ion conductors based on the ferroelectric perovskite Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3,10.1038/NMAT3782
