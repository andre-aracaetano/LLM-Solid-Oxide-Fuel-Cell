1,7459,"Composites of Sr-doped LaMnO(3) (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were prepared by sequential electrodeposition of La and Mn species from nitrate salts in Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) into a porous, carbon-coated YSZ substrate, followed by the infiltration of Sr(NO(3))(2).",Fabrication of LSM-YSZ Composite Electrodes by Electrodeposition,10.1149/1.3484096
2,7459,The La and Mn species were uniformly deposited throughout the depth of a 50 mu m porous layer to the interface with a dense YSZ electrolyte.,Fabrication of LSM-YSZ Composite Electrodes by Electrodeposition,10.1149/1.3484096
3,7459,The LSM perovskite phase was formed after heating to 1373 K. Solid oxide fuel cell cathodes prepared by single-step electrodeposition showed similar performance to LSM-YSZ electrodes prepared by wet impregnation using many steps.,Fabrication of LSM-YSZ Composite Electrodes by Electrodeposition,10.1149/1.3484096
