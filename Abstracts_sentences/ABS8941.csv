1,8941,An aqueous combustion synthesis is used to produce powders of La0.8Sr0.2CrO3 perovskite.,Aqueous combustion synthesis of strontium-doped lanthanum chromite ceramics,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03439.x
2,8941,It is shown that interaction between chromium nitrate and glycine controls the process.,Aqueous combustion synthesis of strontium-doped lanthanum chromite ceramics,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03439.x
3,8941,"In addition, it is suggested that glycine reacts with products of nitrate decomposition to yield an intermediate compound, which decomposes exothermically providing high-temperature conditions for complex oxide formation.",Aqueous combustion synthesis of strontium-doped lanthanum chromite ceramics,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03439.x
4,8941,"It is remarkable that although reaction temperature is high (up to 800degreesC) and characteristic time is small (similar to1 s) for synthesis under the self-propagating high-temperature mode, the produced perovskites have high specific surface area (similar to40 m(2)/g) and well-defined crystalline structure.",Aqueous combustion synthesis of strontium-doped lanthanum chromite ceramics,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03439.x
5,8941,"As a result, ceramics sintered by using these powders are dense (similar to96% of theoretical) and possess high electronic and low ionic conductivities, important for interconnect applications in solid oxide fuel cells.",Aqueous combustion synthesis of strontium-doped lanthanum chromite ceramics,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03439.x
