1,11803,"Preparation, thermal expansion, electrical conductivity and polarization of La0.6Sr0.4C1-xGaxO3-delta (LSCG) (x=0.0-0.4) were studied in order to estimate the potential as a new material for cathode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFC).","Preparation, thermal expansion and electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xGaxO3-δ (x=0.0-0.4) as a new cathode material of SOFC",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.029
2,11803,"Within xless than or equal to0.4, hexagonally distorted perovskite single phase of La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xGaxO3-delta was obtained.","Preparation, thermal expansion and electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xGaxO3-δ (x=0.0-0.4) as a new cathode material of SOFC",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.029
3,11803,"Thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of the specimens with x<0.3 showed higher values than those of electrolyte materials, such as Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 or La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.85Mg0.15O2.825, whereas those of specimens with x=0.3 showed close value.","Preparation, thermal expansion and electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xGaxO3-δ (x=0.0-0.4) as a new cathode material of SOFC",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.029
4,11803,"The electrical conductivity decreased with increasing Ga content; however, the conductivity for x=0.4 is still in the order of 10(2) S/cm at 800 degreesC. Polarization measurements showed that cathode performance decreased with increasing Ga content; however, the sample with x=0.4 still has sufficient activity as a new cathode material of ITSOFC.","Preparation, thermal expansion and electrical conductivity of La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xGaxO3-δ (x=0.0-0.4) as a new cathode material of SOFC",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.029
