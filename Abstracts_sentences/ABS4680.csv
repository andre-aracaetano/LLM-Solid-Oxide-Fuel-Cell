2,4680,Oxidation behavior and oxide scale electrical property of the coated steels corresponding to the SOFC cathode environment were investigated.,"(Cu, Fe)3O4 Spinel Coating Thermally Converted from Cu-Fe2O3 Composite on Steel Interconnect Via Electrophoresis-Electroplating",10.1007/s11085-023-10152-8
3,4680,"After oxidation for 5 weeks in air at 800 celcius, the oxide scale exhibits a tri-layer structure including an inner layer of Cr2O3, a middle layer of (Cu, Fe, Cr)(3)O-4 and an outer layer of (Cu, Fe)(3)O-4.","(Cu, Fe)3O4 Spinel Coating Thermally Converted from Cu-Fe2O3 Composite on Steel Interconnect Via Electrophoresis-Electroplating",10.1007/s11085-023-10152-8
4,4680,"The results demonstrate that the (Cu, Fe)(3)O-4 spinel converted from Cu-Fe2O3 composite coating not only significantly suppresses the out-diffusion of Cr and reduces the growth rate of Cr2O3, but also lowers the area specific resistance (ASR) of the oxide scales.","(Cu, Fe)3O4 Spinel Coating Thermally Converted from Cu-Fe2O3 Composite on Steel Interconnect Via Electrophoresis-Electroplating",10.1007/s11085-023-10152-8
