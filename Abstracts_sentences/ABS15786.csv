1,15786,"in this paper, the effects of aluminum on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and high temperature dual atmosphere tolerance of silver and silver-copper oxide filler metals were investigated.",Mechanical properties and dual atmosphere tolerance of Ag-Al based braze,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.043
2,15786,It was found that joints brazed with binary Ag-Al braze foils containing more than 2 at% Al retained a metallic form of aluminum within the metallic braze filler matrix after brazing at 1000 degrees C in air.,Mechanical properties and dual atmosphere tolerance of Ag-Al based braze,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.043
3,15786,The bend strengths of these joints decreased with increasing aluminum content due to the formation of interfacial aluminum oxide.,Mechanical properties and dual atmosphere tolerance of Ag-Al based braze,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.043
4,15786,"However, the existence of metallic aluminum in the braze filler matrix appeared to enhance the high-temperature dual atmosphere tolerance of the silver-based braze filler, which displayed measurably less porosity after 1000h of exposure at 800 degrees C in a dual reducing/oxidizing atmosphere environment than unalloyed silver.",Mechanical properties and dual atmosphere tolerance of Ag-Al based braze,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.043
5,15786,A series of binary and ternary braze pastes based on the Ag-Al(-Cu) system were also formulated as potential pSOFC (planar solid oxide fuel cell) sealants.,Mechanical properties and dual atmosphere tolerance of Ag-Al based braze,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.043
6,15786,Model alumina joints brazed with these pastes exhibited an increase in bend strength with increasing copper content.,Mechanical properties and dual atmosphere tolerance of Ag-Al based braze,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.043
7,15786,"However, unlike the binary Ag-Al filler metals, the ternary compositions often retained no protective metallic aluminum after brazing.",Mechanical properties and dual atmosphere tolerance of Ag-Al based braze,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.043
8,15786,"Thus, while the addition of copper improves filler metal wettability and, therefore, joint strength in the Ag-Al alloys, it appears to reduce the dual atmosphere tolerance of these filler metals.",Mechanical properties and dual atmosphere tolerance of Ag-Al based braze,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.12.043
