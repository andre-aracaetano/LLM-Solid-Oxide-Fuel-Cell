1,8459,"This paper studies the electrochemical feasibility of the direct conversion of low-concentration, oxygen-bearing coal-bed methane (CBM, 30 vol % CH4) to electricity via solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Direct Operation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells on Low-Concentration Oxygen-Bearing Coal-Bed Methane with High Stability,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b02968
2,8459,"A fuel cell with the LiLaNi-Al2O3/Cu catalyst layer was developed, and a maximum power output of, similar to 1068 mW cm(-2) was achieved at 850 degrees C using 30 vol % CBM fuel, which is only modestly lower than that from a cell based on hydrogen fuel.",Direct Operation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells on Low-Concentration Oxygen-Bearing Coal-Bed Methane with High Stability,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b02968
3,8459,"The stability test showed that the cell operation was quite stable during the 120-h test period, which is, similar to 40-fold longer than that of the cell without catalyst layer.",Direct Operation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells on Low-Concentration Oxygen-Bearing Coal-Bed Methane with High Stability,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b02968
4,8459,"The partial oxidation of methane (POM) occurring in the anode may play an important role when using 30 vol % CBM fuel, which not only supplies highly active gaseous fuels (H-2 and CO) but also suppresses the carbon deposition on the anode.",Direct Operation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells on Low-Concentration Oxygen-Bearing Coal-Bed Methane with High Stability,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b02968
5,8459,"By modifying the anode with a LiLaNi-Al2O3/Cu catalyst layer, the POM of 30 vol % CBM was further promoted and the carbon deposition over the anode was mitigated more efficiently.",Direct Operation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells on Low-Concentration Oxygen-Bearing Coal-Bed Methane with High Stability,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b02968
6,8459,"Therefore, the strategy of direct conversion of low-concentration, oxygen-bearing CBM via the SOFCs with an anode catalyst layer may pave an alternative way to utilize this abundant resource efficiently and cleanly.",Direct Operation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells on Low-Concentration Oxygen-Bearing Coal-Bed Methane with High Stability,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b02968
