1,12168,Degradation rates of electrical current during constant voltage operation of SOFCs with anodes made using NiO precursor powders from two different manufacturers with and without the addition of aluminum titanate (ALT) added by either mechanical mixing or anode infiltration have been quantified using a novel MATLAB algorithm.,Degradation rate quantification of solid oxide fuel cell performance with and without Al2TiO5 addition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.06.115
2,12168,"Because the algorithm has been used to quantify degradation rates for many different SOFC tests, it is thought that the method can be applied to most measured SOFC data to quantify the instantaneous cell degradation rate as a function of time for the entire SOFC performance measurement.",Degradation rate quantification of solid oxide fuel cell performance with and without Al2TiO5 addition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.06.115
3,12168,"Degradation rates determined at different times have been plotted against varying concentrations of ALT addition, facilitating the estimation of optimum ALT concentration for SOFC anodes made with NiO from a specific manufacturer.",Degradation rate quantification of solid oxide fuel cell performance with and without Al2TiO5 addition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.06.115
