1,7085,"In this work, a highly active cathode with perovskite structure for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is designed.",A highly active cathode material of Cu-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-020-04898-z
2,7085,"The structural, chemical compatibility, and electrochemical properties of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 partially doped with Cu (Sr2Fe1.5-xCuxMo0.5O6-delta, SFCxM) are investigated.",A highly active cathode material of Cu-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-020-04898-z
3,7085,"The results show that SFCxM retains the perovskite structure when Fe element in Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 is partially replaced by Cu, but its unit cell expands as the doping amount of Cu increasing.",A highly active cathode material of Cu-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-020-04898-z
4,7085,"The thermal expansion coefficient of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 increases with Cu doping remarkably, so doping with excessive Cu is not conducive to the chemical compatibility between SFCxM cathode and samarium-doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte.",A highly active cathode material of Cu-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-020-04898-z
5,7085,Analysis of SFCxM cathode impedance data indicates that the properties of Sr2Fe1.5-xCuxMo0.5O6-delta cathode can be improved by Cu substitution.,A highly active cathode material of Cu-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-020-04898-z
6,7085,"The conductivity of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 (SFM) is improved by doping with appropriate content of Cu, while the interface impedance of the SFCxM cathode decreases with Cu doping and reaches the smallest value of 0.26 ohm cm(2) at the dopant content of x = 0.1.",A highly active cathode material of Cu-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-020-04898-z
7,7085,"Furthermore, the interface impedance of the composite cathode consists of appropriate mass ratio of SFC0.1M, and SDC is lower than that of SFC0.1M. As a result, the composite cathode consists of appropriate mass ratio of SFC0.1M, and SDC is a potential cathode material for solid oxide fuel cell.",A highly active cathode material of Cu-doped Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-020-04898-z
