1,8090,A modified reaction model of hydrogen oxidation around a triple phase boundary (TPB) is proposed for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a Ni/oxide ion conductor cermet anode containing proton conductor particles in order to describe the mechanism of anode overpotential reduction.,Theoretical analysis of hydrogen oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cell anode based on species territory adsorption model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.160
2,8090,"In this model, three kinds of TPBs consisting of nickel metal, oxide ion conductors, proton conductors, and gas phases were considered.",Theoretical analysis of hydrogen oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cell anode based on species territory adsorption model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.160
3,8090,It was assumed that the chemical species could be adsorbed within a finite narrow area on each material around the TPB.,Theoretical analysis of hydrogen oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cell anode based on species territory adsorption model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.160
4,8090,The reaction rate in the anode was controlled by the surface reaction between the adsorbed hydrogen and adsorbed oxygen; all other reactions took place under chemical equilibrium.,Theoretical analysis of hydrogen oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cell anode based on species territory adsorption model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.160
5,8090,"Based on the reaction model, analytical expressions of current density with oxygen activity and anode overpotential with current density could be obtained.",Theoretical analysis of hydrogen oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cell anode based on species territory adsorption model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.160
6,8090,"The latter could combine the anode overpotential at low- and high-current-density regions, which were conventionally expressed independently.",Theoretical analysis of hydrogen oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cell anode based on species territory adsorption model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.160
7,8090,The analytical results were in good agreement with the experimental results for both the conventional anode and the new anode incorporating a proton conductor.,Theoretical analysis of hydrogen oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cell anode based on species territory adsorption model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.160
8,8090,"Especially, the anode overpotential reduction could be explained by the additional supply of adsorbed hydrogen from the proton conductor to the TPB.",Theoretical analysis of hydrogen oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cell anode based on species territory adsorption model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.160
