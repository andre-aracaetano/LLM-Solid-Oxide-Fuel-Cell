3,8467,"However, despite this promising prospect, the practical usefulness for fuel cell catalysts has not been verified yet.",Exploration of a Ce0.65Zr0.25Pr0.1O2-d-Based Electrocatalyst That Exhibits Rapid Performance Deterioration Despite Its High Oxygen Storage Capability,10.1021/acsaem.2c00468
4,8467,"According to our electro-chemical analysis on a Pr-doped CZO (PrCZO)-based anode, the electrochemical performance does not remain stable; instead, the performance rapidly deteriorates over time even though it is initially much better than that of a conventional anode.",Exploration of a Ce0.65Zr0.25Pr0.1O2-d-Based Electrocatalyst That Exhibits Rapid Performance Deterioration Despite Its High Oxygen Storage Capability,10.1021/acsaem.2c00468
5,8467,"From the thorough investigations to identify the cause of the rapid deterioration of PrCZO-based anode via computational analyses using density functional theory and defect chemical analysis, it can be concluded that the fast degradation of PrCZO-based anode is mainly due to the inactive substances precipitated on the PrCZO surface caused by the inherent thermodynamic instability and enhanced phase separation kinetics under SOFC operating conditions, where more mobile cationic defects (interstitial cations) are generated and an easier pathway with a lower migration energy is available.",Exploration of a Ce0.65Zr0.25Pr0.1O2-d-Based Electrocatalyst That Exhibits Rapid Performance Deterioration Despite Its High Oxygen Storage Capability,10.1021/acsaem.2c00468
