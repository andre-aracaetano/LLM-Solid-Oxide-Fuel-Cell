2,5271,This combined system makes the best use of the advantages of combustion with pure oxygen but fails to prevent the efficiency deterioration caused by high power demand for oxygen production.,Combined carbon-dioxide-capturing high-performance power generation system using a solid oxide fuel cell operating on pressurized fuel/air,10.1002/eej.20010
3,5271,"In the present study, the authors modified this previous system and proposed an improved combined carbon-dioxide-capturing power generation system using SOFC/MHD characterized by a higher overall thermal efficiency.",Combined carbon-dioxide-capturing high-performance power generation system using a solid oxide fuel cell operating on pressurized fuel/air,10.1002/eej.20010
4,5271,"In this system, pure oxygen is supplied only to the combustor to reduce the power required for the oxygen production, and pressurized air is used as the oxidant gas in the SOFC.",Combined carbon-dioxide-capturing high-performance power generation system using a solid oxide fuel cell operating on pressurized fuel/air,10.1002/eej.20010
5,5271,"The power saving amounts to about 5% of the thermal input, resulting in a very high total thermal efficiency of 67.53% (HHV) or 74.94% (LHV), which is considered to be the highest possible value of the overall thermal efficiency of carbon-dioxide-capturing systems.",Combined carbon-dioxide-capturing high-performance power generation system using a solid oxide fuel cell operating on pressurized fuel/air,10.1002/eej.20010
