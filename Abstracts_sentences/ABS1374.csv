1,1374,"This work describes different models, developed by the Thermochemical Power Group at the University of Genoa (Italy), for the simulation of solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine hybrid systems.",Modelling of pressurised hybrid systems based on Integrated Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IP-SOFC) technology,10.1002/fuce.200400068
2,1374,The paper focuses on both cores of the system: the fuel cell stack on the one hand and the turbo-machinery and the auxiliaries on the other hand.,Modelling of pressurised hybrid systems based on Integrated Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IP-SOFC) technology,10.1002/fuce.200400068
3,1374,"Therefore, in the first part of the paper the models developed for the analysis of the Rolls-Royce Integrated Planar SOFC cells are presented; the results are,compared to experimental data, and carefully analysed and discussed.",Modelling of pressurised hybrid systems based on Integrated Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IP-SOFC) technology,10.1002/fuce.200400068
4,1374,"In the second part of the paper, design and off design models of IP-SOFC pressurised hybrid systems in the range 250 kW-20 MW are presented; the hybrid performance results are presented and discussed, also taking ambient condition effects and a possible control strategy into account.",Modelling of pressurised hybrid systems based on Integrated Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IP-SOFC) technology,10.1002/fuce.200400068
5,1374,"Finally, using an in-house general purpose.,transient system, analysis code (TRANSEO code), where chemical composition, heat transfer, and fluid dynamic influences vs. time are considered in detail, a preliminary time dependent investigation of a pressurised hybrid system behaviour is presented.",Modelling of pressurised hybrid systems based on Integrated Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IP-SOFC) technology,10.1002/fuce.200400068
