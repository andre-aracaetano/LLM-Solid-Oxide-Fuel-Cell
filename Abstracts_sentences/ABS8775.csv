1,8775,"A number of composite materials in the Ni-Fe-LSGMC family have been studied as potential anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on strontium, magnesium, and cobalt doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte (LSGMC).",Promising Ni-Fe-LSGMC anode compatible with lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.02.002
2,8775,"The results show that Ni reacts with LSGMC especially under reducing conditions at high temperatures, resulting in high contact resistance, large electrode polarization, and poor performance.",Promising Ni-Fe-LSGMC anode compatible with lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.02.002
3,8775,"The reaction between Ni and LSGMC depends strongly on the composition and pre-sintering temperature of LSGMC, the concentration of iron in the electrode, and the processing and operating temperatures.",Promising Ni-Fe-LSGMC anode compatible with lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.02.002
4,8775,"Under proper conditions, Ni-Fe-LSGMC5 could be a promising high-performance anode with good compatibility with LSGMC5 electrolyte.",Promising Ni-Fe-LSGMC anode compatible with lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.electacta.2009.02.002
