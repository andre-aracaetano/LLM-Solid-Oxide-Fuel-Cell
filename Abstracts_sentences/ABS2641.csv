1,2641,The impact of operating cost savings in a plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (P-ALD) process to fabricate the ultrathin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells is quantitatively evaluated by comparison with a thermal atomic layer deposition (T-ALD) process considering the two cost factors: (1) operating costs of power consumption and precursor/gas usages and (2) capital costs of plasma generator installations.,Operating Cost Savings in the Atomic Layer Deposition Process of Ultrathin Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Applying Oxygen Plasma,10.1007/s12541-022-00626-1
2,2641,"Because of lower precursor/gas usages and lower power consumption of the P-ALD YSZ process, it is evaluated that the specific operating costs of the P-ALD YSZ process is similar to 47% lower than that of the T-ALD YSZ process.",Operating Cost Savings in the Atomic Layer Deposition Process of Ultrathin Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Applying Oxygen Plasma,10.1007/s12541-022-00626-1
3,2641,"For annual production of 2.6 kW fuel cell systems of 100 units, it is estimated that the cumulative cost savings of the P-ALD YSZ process versus the T-ALD YSZ process amounts to $678,000 in the fifth year.",Operating Cost Savings in the Atomic Layer Deposition Process of Ultrathin Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Applying Oxygen Plasma,10.1007/s12541-022-00626-1
