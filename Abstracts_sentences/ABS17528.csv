1,17528,The goal of this work is to identify suitable cathode contact materials (CCM) to bond and electrically connect LSCF cathode to Mn1.5Co1.5O4-coated 441 stainless steel after sintering at the relatively low temperature of 900-1000 degrees C. A wide variety of CCM candidates are synthesized and characterized.,Selection of cathode contact materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.044

3,17528,"From this screening, LSCF, LSCuF, LSC, and SSC are selected as the most promising candidates.",Selection of cathode contact materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.044
4,17528,"These compositions are applied to LSCF and Mn1.5Co1.5O4-coated 441 stainless steel coupons and subjected to 200 h ASR testing at 800 degrees C. After area-specific resistance testing, the specimens are cross-sectioned and analyzed for interdiffusion across the CCM/LSCF or CCM/Mn1.5Co1.5O4 interfaces.",Selection of cathode contact materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.044
