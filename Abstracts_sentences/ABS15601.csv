2,15601,"One of the solutions to that, is to replace nickel with compounds that exhibit low volume changes between oxidising and reducing conditions.",Redox Tolerant SOFC Anodes with High Electrochemical Performance,10.1002/fuce.200800142
3,15601,This paper gives the results obtained on anode assemblies with functional layer consisting of gadolinia doped ceria mixed with highly dispersed nickel and anode contact layer consisting of Ni and the perovskite La(0.9)Mn(0.8)Ni(0.2)O(3-delta).,Redox Tolerant SOFC Anodes with High Electrochemical Performance,10.1002/fuce.200800142
4,15601,"The results indicate that electrical conduction of this perovskite under SOFC anode conditions allows for anode assemblies with reduced nickel content, which results in increased redox resistance while high electrochemical performance is maintained.",Redox Tolerant SOFC Anodes with High Electrochemical Performance,10.1002/fuce.200800142
5,15601,"The redox tolerance that was investigated at 850 degrees C on electrolyte supported cells, is highest for anode functional layer consisting of 80 wt.-% Gd(0.1)Ce(0.9)O(1.95) 20 wt.-% highly dispersed nickel combined with anode contact layer consisting of 70 wt.-% nickel and 30 wt.-% La(0.9)Mn(0.8)Ni(0.2)O(3-delta), with a degradation of the current density at 0.7 V of 10% after 50 redox cycles, and 23% after 100 redox cycles.",Redox Tolerant SOFC Anodes with High Electrochemical Performance,10.1002/fuce.200800142
6,15601,The driving force for the observed degradation is nickel agglomeration that occurs even when the nickel content is below the nickel percolation threshold.,Redox Tolerant SOFC Anodes with High Electrochemical Performance,10.1002/fuce.200800142
