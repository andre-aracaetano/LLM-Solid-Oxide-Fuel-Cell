1,11054,Lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) is widely used in cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) because of its long-term stability and performance at higher operating temperatures (850-900 degrees C).,Mn Valence Determination for Lanthanum Strontium Manganite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3625279
2,11054,"The conductivity of LSM depends on the Mn valence, which in turn depends on the level of strontium doping, the ratio of (La+Sr) to Mn, and the operating environment of the cell (temperature and atmosphere).",Mn Valence Determination for Lanthanum Strontium Manganite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3625279
3,11054,"Consequently, determining Mn valences is a key issue in understanding the relationship between conductivity and operating conditions.",Mn Valence Determination for Lanthanum Strontium Manganite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3625279
4,11054,"Although the defect chemistry of LSM has been investigated extensively, this study is the first that compares new measurements of Mn valence from two direct, independent techniques: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).",Mn Valence Determination for Lanthanum Strontium Manganite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3625279
5,11054,"Furthermore, we have examined surfaces and interfaces of LSM in cathode-symmetric SOFCs, and XPS results from surfaces in LSM exposed to a range of atmospheres and temperatures.",Mn Valence Determination for Lanthanum Strontium Manganite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3625279
