1,20723,"In order to lower the raw materials cost and develop a novel cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell(ITSOFC), using mixed rare earth replacing the expensive pure La2O3 as the raw materials, the powders of Ln(0.7)Sr(0.3-x)Ca(x)Co(0.9)Fe(0.1)O(3-delta) (Ln = the mixed rare earth, x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) for the applications as the cathode materials were prepared by microwave sintering process.",Electrical properties and microwave synthesis of mixed rare earth oxide Ln0.7Sr0.3-xCaxCo0.9Fe0.1O3-δ,
2,20723,"The crystal structure and the particles morphology of the obtained powders were characterized by XRD and SEM, the electrical conductivity of all samples sintered at 1200 degrees C for 3 h was also measured as the function of the temperature from 100 to 800 degrees C by DC four-probe method in air.",Electrical properties and microwave synthesis of mixed rare earth oxide Ln0.7Sr0.3-xCaxCo0.9Fe0.1O3-δ,
3,20723,"The experimental results show that due to the influence of mixed rare earth the powders of Ln(0.7)Sr(0.3-x)Ca(x)Co(0.9)Fe(0.1)O(3-delta) synthesized at 1200 degrees C for 0.5 h with the mean particle size of 1 similar to 20 mu m was of perovskite and cubic fluorite phase as well a little SrO phase, the electrical conductivity of the samples decreases with the adding Ca2+ content, and are all higher than 100 S (.)",Electrical properties and microwave synthesis of mixed rare earth oxide Ln0.7Sr0.3-xCaxCo0.9Fe0.1O3-δ,
