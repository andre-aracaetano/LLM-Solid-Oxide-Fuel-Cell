1,15921,The performance and degradation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) were studied under severe operating conditions.,Solid oxide fuel cell performance under severe operating conditions,10.1002/fuce.200500112
2,15921,"The cells studied were manufactured in a small series by ECN, in the framework of the EU funded CORE-SOFC project.",Solid oxide fuel cell performance under severe operating conditions,10.1002/fuce.200500112
3,15921,The cells were of the anode-supported type with a double layer LSM cathode.,Solid oxide fuel cell performance under severe operating conditions,10.1002/fuce.200500112
4,15921,They were operated at 750 degrees C or 850 degrees C in hydrogen with 5% or 50% water at current densities ranging from 0.25 A cm(-2) to 1 A cm(-2) for periods of 300 hours or more.,Solid oxide fuel cell performance under severe operating conditions,10.1002/fuce.200500112
5,15921,"The area specific cell resistance, corrected for fuel utilisation, ranged between 0.20 Omega cm(2) and 0.34 Omega cm(2) at 850 degrees C and 520 mV, and between 0.51 Omega cm(2) and 0.92 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C and 520 mV. The degradation of cell performance was found to be low (ranging from 0 to 8%/1,000 hours) at regular operating conditions.",Solid oxide fuel cell performance under severe operating conditions,10.1002/fuce.200500112
6,15921,"Voltage degradation rates of 20 to 40%/1,000 hours were observed under severe operating conditions, depending on the test conditions.",Solid oxide fuel cell performance under severe operating conditions,10.1002/fuce.200500112
7,15921,"Data analysis revealed a critical cell voltage of ca 750 mV, above which the degradation rates were trivial, but below which they were significant.",Solid oxide fuel cell performance under severe operating conditions,10.1002/fuce.200500112
8,15921,Some cells were also tested using a different procedure to that usually applied at Riso.,Solid oxide fuel cell performance under severe operating conditions,10.1002/fuce.200500112
9,15921,"This gave a different aging behaviour, indicating that the detailed test circumstances may be decisive to the outcome.",Solid oxide fuel cell performance under severe operating conditions,10.1002/fuce.200500112
