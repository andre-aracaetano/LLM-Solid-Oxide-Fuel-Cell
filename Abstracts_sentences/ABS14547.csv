6,14547,"Moreover, growth of multi-layers of materials with different compositions on the very same single crystalline electrolyte substrate combined with in situ impedance measurements allow excellent comparability of different materials.","Performance modulation through selective, homogenous surface doping of lanthanum strontium ferrite electrodes revealed by in situ PLD impedance measurements",10.1039/d1ta08634k
7,14547,"Even a 5 nm layer of Pt doped LSF (1.5 at% Pt), i.e. a Pt loading of 80 ng cm(-2), improved the polarization resistance by a factor of about 2.5.","Performance modulation through selective, homogenous surface doping of lanthanum strontium ferrite electrodes revealed by in situ PLD impedance measurements",10.1039/d1ta08634k
8,14547,"In addition, p(O-2) and temperature dependent impedance measurements on both pure and Pt doped LSF were performed in situ and obtained similar activation energies and p(O-2) dependence of the polarization resistance, which allow us to make far reaching mechanistic conclusions indicating that Pt4+ introduces additional active sites.","Performance modulation through selective, homogenous surface doping of lanthanum strontium ferrite electrodes revealed by in situ PLD impedance measurements",10.1039/d1ta08634k
