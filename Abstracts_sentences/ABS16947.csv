2,16947,"The spray parameters including carrying gas flow rate, spraying distance, argon flow rate and hydrogen flow rate were investigated by an orthogonal experiment to fabricate gas-permeable anode cermets coatings.","Development and characterisation of (Ni, Cu, Co)-YSZ and Cu-Co-YSZ cermets anode materials for SOFC application",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.09.009
3,16947,Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction are used to characterise the morphology and structure of coated films respectively.,"Development and characterisation of (Ni, Cu, Co)-YSZ and Cu-Co-YSZ cermets anode materials for SOFC application",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.09.009
4,16947,The porosity was deduced by the statistical image analysis.,"Development and characterisation of (Ni, Cu, Co)-YSZ and Cu-Co-YSZ cermets anode materials for SOFC application",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.09.009
5,16947,"By proper selection of the spray parameters to decrease the particles velocity and temperature, the sprayed coatings monometallic and bimetallic ones show that the cross porosity is dependent of metal weight ratio.","Development and characterisation of (Ni, Cu, Co)-YSZ and Cu-Co-YSZ cermets anode materials for SOFC application",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.09.009
6,16947,"In fact, when the metal percentage increases, the porosity decreases.","Development and characterisation of (Ni, Cu, Co)-YSZ and Cu-Co-YSZ cermets anode materials for SOFC application",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.09.009
7,16947,"Monometallic Ni-YSZ, Cu-YSZ and Co-YSZ cermets with a weight ratio of (3:2) appear to be less porous than those with (1:1) and (2:3) ones respectively, to reach a maximum porosity of 21.57% for Co-YSZ cermet of (2:3) weight ratio.","Development and characterisation of (Ni, Cu, Co)-YSZ and Cu-Co-YSZ cermets anode materials for SOFC application",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.09.009
8,16947,Cu-Co-YSZ bimetallic cermet coating with weight ratio of (0.5:1:2.5) is more porous than those with (1:23) and (2:1:2) weight ratios respectively.,"Development and characterisation of (Ni, Cu, Co)-YSZ and Cu-Co-YSZ cermets anode materials for SOFC application",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.09.009
9,16947,Its porosity is about 19.15% which is closed to that of Ni-YSZ (2:3) coating.,"Development and characterisation of (Ni, Cu, Co)-YSZ and Cu-Co-YSZ cermets anode materials for SOFC application",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.09.009
10,16947,The X-ray diffraction results showed that the metal content in the cermets have a negligible influence on the crystalline phase structure.,"Development and characterisation of (Ni, Cu, Co)-YSZ and Cu-Co-YSZ cermets anode materials for SOFC application",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.09.009
11,16947,"Such bimetallic materials anode are very interesting because Co diffuses in Cu lattice offering thus, best electronic conductivity, thermal stability and an avoided carbon formation, by replacing Ni with an electron conductor such as Cu that does not catalyze carbon formation.","Development and characterisation of (Ni, Cu, Co)-YSZ and Cu-Co-YSZ cermets anode materials for SOFC application",10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.09.009
