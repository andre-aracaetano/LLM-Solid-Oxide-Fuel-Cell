2,455,The reactivity and stability of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO)-based thin-film solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are improved by applying ALD YSZ electrolyte.,Atomic layer deposition of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films for enhanced reactivity and stability of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.094
3,455,"The fuel cell fabricated by ALD shows a peak power density of 154.6 mW cm (-2) at 450 degrees C, whereas the fuel cell fabricated' by sputtering demonstrates a peak power density of 66.2 mW cm (-2).",Atomic layer deposition of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films for enhanced reactivity and stability of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.094
4,455,The amorphous and nanogranular microstructure of the ALD YSZ film is ascribed for a significant improvement in the cathodic reactivity of the AAO-based thin-film fuel cells.,Atomic layer deposition of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films for enhanced reactivity and stability of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.094
5,455,"Moreover, the smooth and uniform surface of the ALD YSZ electrolytes mitigates the agglomeration of the Pt cathode layer, and thus the thermal stability of the thin-film fuel cell is remarkably improved at 450 degrees C.
