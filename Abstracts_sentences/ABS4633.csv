3,4633,"A double-layer oxide structure with an highly conductive, Cr-free (Fe,Co,Ni)(3)O-4 spinel outer layer and a thin protective Cr2O3 inner layer was formed on the alloy surface upon thermal exposure in air at 800 degrees C.",A low-Cr metallic interconnect for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.022
