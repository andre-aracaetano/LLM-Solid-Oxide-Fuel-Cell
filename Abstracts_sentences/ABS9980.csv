2,9980,The SrO content in the Ce1-xSrxO2-x solid solution affects the porous structure of the starting anode support comprising of the sintered NiO and Ce1-xSrxO2-x grains and denseness of the SDC layer by co-sintering.,SrO Doping Effect on Fabrication and Performance of Ni/Ce1-xSrxO2-x Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Direct Methane Utilization,10.2320/matertrans.MT-M2021125
3,9980,The cell using the 5 mol% SrO-doped CeO2 shows the highest cell performance without time-dependent degradation even at 750 degrees C.,SrO Doping Effect on Fabrication and Performance of Ni/Ce1-xSrxO2-x Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Direct Methane Utilization,10.2320/matertrans.MT-M2021125
4,9980,This cell (the 5SrDC cell) also provides better cell performance with decreasing operating temperature than the conventional Ni/YSZ anode-supported cell (the YSZ cell); the maximum power density of the 5SrDC cell is higher than that of the YSZ cell by 73% at 650 degrees C.,SrO Doping Effect on Fabrication and Performance of Ni/Ce1-xSrxO2-x Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Direct Methane Utilization,10.2320/matertrans.MT-M2021125
