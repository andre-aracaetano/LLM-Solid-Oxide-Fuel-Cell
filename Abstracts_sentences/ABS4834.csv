1,4834,A thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (9 mol% YSZ) film was successfully fabricated on a NiO-YSZ anode substrate by a screen-printing technique.,Screen-printed thin YSZ films used as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.013
2,4834,The scanning electron microscope (SEM) results suggested that the YSZ film thickness was about 31 mu m after sintering at 1400 degrees C for 4 h in air.,Screen-printed thin YSZ films used as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.013
3,4834,A 60 wt% La0.7Sr0.3WO3 + 40 wt% YSZ was screen-printed onto the YSZ film surface as cathode.,Screen-printed thin YSZ films used as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.013
4,4834,"A single cell was tested from 650 to 850 degrees C using hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant, which showed an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.02 V and a maximum power density of 1.30 W cm(-2) at 850 degrees C.",Screen-printed thin YSZ films used as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.013
5,4834,"The OCV was higher than 1.0 V, which suggested that the YSZ film was quite dense and that the fuel gas leakage through the YSZ film was negligible.",Screen-printed thin YSZ films used as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.013
6,4834,Screen-printing can be a promising method for manufacturing YSZ films for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Screen-printed thin YSZ films used as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.013
