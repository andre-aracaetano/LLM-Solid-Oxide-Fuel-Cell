6,19142,"In solid oxide fuel cell electrode materials, oxygen transport pathways in double perovskites PrBaCo2O5+delta, and NdBaCo2O5+delta, were elucidated by neutron diffraction measurements under atmosphere with oxygen partial pressures (pO(2)) of 10(-1) to 10(-4) (achieved using mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen) and temperatures from 575 to 850 degrees C. In another example, the potential oxygen storage material La1-xSrxFeO3 was measured under alternating flows of 15% CH(4 )in N(2 )and air (20%O-2 in N-2 ) at temperatures from 135 to 835 degrees C. From the oxygen stoichiometry, the optimal composition for oxygen storage was determined.",AGES: Automated Gas Environment System for in situ neutron powder diffraction,10.1063/1.5031432
