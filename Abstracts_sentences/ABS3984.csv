2,3984,The effect on the cell performance by adding lanthanum strontium ruthenium titanate (LSRT) into the anode were investigated.,Direct Conversion of Ammonia to Electricity on a PCFC and an SOFC,10.1149/1945-7111/accbef
3,3984,"The performance of PCFCs in NH3 was found to resemble that in H-2 and remain stable; by contrast, the SOFC was subject to a rigorous fluctuation of voltages in NH3, followed by performance loss.",Direct Conversion of Ammonia to Electricity on a PCFC and an SOFC,10.1149/1945-7111/accbef
4,3984,Surface characterization evidenced that phase separation between nickel and electrolyte YSZ is a major reason to the deactivation of SOFCs.,Direct Conversion of Ammonia to Electricity on a PCFC and an SOFC,10.1149/1945-7111/accbef
