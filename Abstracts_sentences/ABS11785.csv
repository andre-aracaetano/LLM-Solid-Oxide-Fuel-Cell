2,11785,"Ceramic foams are prepared using the slurry of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) by the polymeric sponge method, which is followed by spray coating for increasing the number of coatings-sinterings on polyurethane foams of 30, 45 and 60 ppi (pores per linear inch).","Mechanical, electrical and micro-structural properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 perovskite-based ceramic foams",10.1088/0022-3727/41/3/032003
3,11785,"An increase in the number of coatings-sinterings and ppi improved the compressive strength, density and electrical conductivity by decreasing the porosity to similar to 76%, as also observed by the SEM study.","Mechanical, electrical and micro-structural properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 perovskite-based ceramic foams",10.1088/0022-3727/41/3/032003
4,11785,The three-times coated-sintered ceramic foams (60 ppi) exhibited optimum values of compressive strength of similar to 1.79MPa and relative density of similar to 0.24 at 25 degrees C and electrical conductivity of similar to 22 S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C with an activation energy of similar to 0.22 eV indicating its suitability as a solid oxide fuel cell current collector.,"Mechanical, electrical and micro-structural properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 perovskite-based ceramic foams",10.1088/0022-3727/41/3/032003
5,11785,The experimental results are discussed in terms of the Gibson and Ashby theoretical model.,"Mechanical, electrical and micro-structural properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 perovskite-based ceramic foams",10.1088/0022-3727/41/3/032003
