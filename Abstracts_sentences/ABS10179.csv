1,10179,Reducing the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to intermediate (650-850 degrees C) or even lower levels (400-650 degrees C) is an important practical requirement.,Textured Sr2Sc0.1Nb0.1Co1.5Fe0.3O6-2 Thin Film Cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.3390/ma12050777
2,10179,"However, the main obstacle to lowering the operating temperature is the poor oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity on the cathode side and, therefore, it is essential to explore cathode materials with good ORR activity in these temperature ranges.",Textured Sr2Sc0.1Nb0.1Co1.5Fe0.3O6-2 Thin Film Cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.3390/ma12050777
3,10179,"In this work, we investigated the possibility of using Sr2Sc0.1Nb0.1Co1.5Fe0.3O6-2 (SSNCF) as a suitable intermediate temperature cathode material.",Textured Sr2Sc0.1Nb0.1Co1.5Fe0.3O6-2 Thin Film Cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.3390/ma12050777
4,10179,"SSNCF thin films with different orientations were prepared using the pulsed laser deposition technique, and the relationship of the surface chemical states and ORR activity was discussed in terms of crystallographic orientation.",Textured Sr2Sc0.1Nb0.1Co1.5Fe0.3O6-2 Thin Film Cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.3390/ma12050777
5,10179,The results showed that the SSNCF/YSZ grown along the [110] direction exhibited superior ORR activity compared to the SSNCF/SDC/YSZ thin film electrode grown along the [100] direction.,Textured Sr2Sc0.1Nb0.1Co1.5Fe0.3O6-2 Thin Film Cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.3390/ma12050777
6,10179,This was explained by the variation in the Sr-surface enrichment and cobalt ion oxidation state using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy.,Textured Sr2Sc0.1Nb0.1Co1.5Fe0.3O6-2 Thin Film Cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.3390/ma12050777
