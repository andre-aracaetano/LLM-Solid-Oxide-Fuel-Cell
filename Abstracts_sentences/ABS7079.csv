1,7079,This paper is concerned with predictive control of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) based on a benchmark model commonly studied in the dynamic SOFC modeling/control literature.,Data-driven predictive control for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jprocont.2006.09.004
2,7079,It has been shown in previous studies that control of SOFC is challenging owing to the slow response and tight operating constraints.,Data-driven predictive control for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jprocont.2006.09.004
3,7079,"In this paper, we apply a data-driven predictive control approach to solving the control problem of the SOFC system.",Data-driven predictive control for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jprocont.2006.09.004
4,7079,The predictive control applied is completely data based.,Data-driven predictive control for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jprocont.2006.09.004
5,7079,"In addition, unlike other data-driven predictive control designs, the proposed approach can deal with systems without complete on-line measurement of all output variables.",Data-driven predictive control for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jprocont.2006.09.004
6,7079,Simulation results have demonstrated the feasibility of the control application.,Data-driven predictive control for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jprocont.2006.09.004
