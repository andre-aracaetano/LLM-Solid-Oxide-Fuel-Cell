4,5018,These Ni nanoparticles become the catalytic active sites for the H-2 oxidation reaction in proton conducing anodes and the electrode performance is substantially improved regarding to pure LSC.,Catalytic surface promotion of highly active La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ anodes for La5.6WO11.4-δ based proton conducting fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2013.08.044
5,5018,"Ni nanoparticle infiltration further improves the catalytic promotion of the anode, reducing the polarization resistance (R-p) previously limited by low frequency surface related processes.",Catalytic surface promotion of highly active La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ anodes for La5.6WO11.4-δ based proton conducting fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2013.08.044
6,5018,"Indeed, the R-p, values achieved for LSCN infiltrated with Ni, e.g. 0.47 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, suggest the practical application of this kind of anodes in proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells (PC-SOFC).",Catalytic surface promotion of highly active La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ anodes for La5.6WO11.4-δ based proton conducting fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2013.08.044
