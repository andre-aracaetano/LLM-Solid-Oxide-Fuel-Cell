3,5866,Rectangular pellets were prepared and sintered at 1400 degrees C in pure H-2.,Nano-CeO2 and -LaCrO3 dispersed ferritic stainless steels as potential interconnect materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.03.181
4,5866,The microstructural analysis of the sintered pellets showed a uniform distribution of oxide particles.,Nano-CeO2 and -LaCrO3 dispersed ferritic stainless steels as potential interconnect materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.03.181
5,5866,"Long-term area specific resistance (ASR) of the pellets was monitored using the four probe DC method at 800 degrees C for 1000 h in air, revealing that an increase in the CeO2 amount from 0.5 to 3 and 5 wt % increased the oxidation resistance of the steel.",Nano-CeO2 and -LaCrO3 dispersed ferritic stainless steels as potential interconnect materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.03.181
