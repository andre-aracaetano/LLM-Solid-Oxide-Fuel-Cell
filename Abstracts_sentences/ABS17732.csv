1,17732,The time-dependent degradation of the oxygen exchange kinetics of the solid oxide fuel cell cathode material La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) is investigated at 600 degrees C. Special emphasis is placed on systematic long-term dc-conductivity relaxation measurements (t>1000 h) in dry as well as in humidified atmospheres in order to obtain representative trends for the application of LSCF in intermediate-temperature SOFCs.,Oxygen exchange kinetics of La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 at 600 °C in dry and humid atmospheres,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.03.019

3,17732,The slow decrease of k(chem) by a factor of 2 during exposure of the sample to a dry O-2-Ar reference atmosphere for 1000 h at 600 degrees C can be ascribed to an enrichment of La and Sr in correlation with an elevated oxygen concentration within about 30-35 nm depth.,Oxygen exchange kinetics of La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 at 600 °C in dry and humid atmospheres,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.03.019

9,17732,"These results indicate, that with LSCF as a cathode in ambient (humid) air in SOFC stacks containing various Si-sources, such as glass or glass-ceramic seals, and thermal insulation materials a significant decrease of the surface oxygen exchange coefficient can occur, even at temperatures as low as 600 degrees C.",Oxygen exchange kinetics of La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 at 600 °C in dry and humid atmospheres,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.03.019
