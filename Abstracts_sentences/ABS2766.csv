3,2766,The Bi0.5Sr0.5Fe0.90Zr0.10O3_delta (BSFZ0.10) cathode shows the lowest Rp values ranging from 0.52 to 0.11 U cm2 in the temperature range of 600-700 degrees C and the corresponding activation energy is about 1.135 eV. A single fuel cell with BSFZ0.10 cathode delivers a satisfactory electrocatalytic performance with a peak power density (PPD) as high as 1.2 W cm_2 at 700 degrees C.,Synergistically improving electrocatalytic performance and CO2 tolerance of Fe-based cathode catalysts for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.energy.2022.124050
