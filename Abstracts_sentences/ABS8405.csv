6,8405,"A cell with a dense 7.5-mu m-thick YSZ layer, a 2-mu m-thick SDC buffering layer and a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) cathode was fabricated; this cell delivered a PPD of 1040 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and a high open circuit voltage (OCV) of approximately 1.10 V. The described technique provides a facile method for the fabrication of electrolytes for SOFCs with precise thickness control.",Thermal inkjet printing of thin-film electrolytes and buffering layers for solid oxide fuel cells with improved performance,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.025
