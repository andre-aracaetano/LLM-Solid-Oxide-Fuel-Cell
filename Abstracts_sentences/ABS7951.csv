1,7951,Methanol is a promising fuel for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) because of its low cost and ease of storage and transportation.,Power Generation by Flat-Tube Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Enhanced Internal Reforming of Methanol,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c00518
2,7951,"In this work, the performance and long-term durability of direct methanol flat-tube SOFCs are investigated under different steam/carbon (S/C) ratios.",Power Generation by Flat-Tube Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Enhanced Internal Reforming of Methanol,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c00518
3,7951,It is confirmed that the S/C ratio exhibits little influence on cell performance but strongly affects long-term stability.,Power Generation by Flat-Tube Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Enhanced Internal Reforming of Methanol,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c00518
4,7951,"The cell is discharged stably under high S/C ratios of 1.5 and 1.2, while it fails abruptly under a low S/C ratio of 1 due to severe catalyst is added into the anode channels to serve as a prereformer.",Power Generation by Flat-Tube Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Enhanced Internal Reforming of Methanol,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c00518
5,7951,"With improved internal reforming, the methanol conversion rate is promoted to 95% under S/C = 1, higher than that without extra catalyst and most results reported in the literature, and carbon deposition within the anode is significantly suppressed.",Power Generation by Flat-Tube Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Enhanced Internal Reforming of Methanol,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c00518
6,7951,"Thus, no performance degradation is observed for 300 h of discharge under S/C = 1.",Power Generation by Flat-Tube Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Enhanced Internal Reforming of Methanol,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c00518
7,7951,"On the basis of the experimental and simulating results, the mechanism of methanol conversion within the flat-tube cells is discussed.",Power Generation by Flat-Tube Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Enhanced Internal Reforming of Methanol,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c00518
