3,11848,"It is found that 3 mol% Bi2O3 doped BZY (BZY-3) improves its shrinkage from 10.4% to 19.02% at about 1480 degrees C, with the maximum shrinkage rate increasing from -0.20 mm min(-1) to -0.34 mm min(-1).",Sintering and electrochemical performance of Y2O3-doped barium zirconate with Bi2O3 as sintering aids,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.065

5,11848,"The SEM images confirms that it is porous for BZY without Bi2O3 (BZY-0), but that less small pores could be seen for BZY-3 and 5 mol% Bi2O3 doped BZY (BZY-5) sintered at 1400 degrees C for 24 h. Bi2O3 addition decreases the grain boundary conductivity for BZY-3 and BZY-5 obviously, but is less significant for BZY-2.",Sintering and electrochemical performance of Y2O3-doped barium zirconate with Bi2O3 as sintering aids,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.065
