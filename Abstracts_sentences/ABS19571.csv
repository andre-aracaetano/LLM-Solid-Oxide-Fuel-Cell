1,19571,Two Co-alloy-coated steels with 1.0 wt% and 3.0 wt% Mn content were subjected to 1000 h of thermal exposure (750 degrees C) in air.,"Influence of Mn Content in the Alloy on the Oxidation, Electrical and Volatilization Behavior of Co-Coated Steel Interconnects",10.1149/1945-7111/acba49
2,19571,The coated alloys displayed an increased oxidation rate as the Mn content varied between 1.0 wt% and 3.0 wt%.,"Influence of Mn Content in the Alloy on the Oxidation, Electrical and Volatilization Behavior of Co-Coated Steel Interconnects",10.1149/1945-7111/acba49
3,19571,"And Co coating was thermally converted into a three-layer structure composed of Cr-rich oxide (inner layer), mixed oxide with Co, Fe, Mn and Cr (middle layer) and doped Co3O4 spinel oxide (outer layer).","Influence of Mn Content in the Alloy on the Oxidation, Electrical and Volatilization Behavior of Co-Coated Steel Interconnects",10.1149/1945-7111/acba49
4,19571,"Regardless of the Mn content, only a small amount of Mn was incorporated in the Co3O4 spinel.","Influence of Mn Content in the Alloy on the Oxidation, Electrical and Volatilization Behavior of Co-Coated Steel Interconnects",10.1149/1945-7111/acba49

6,19571,Mn was as low as 5.37 m omega cm(2) subsequent to oxidation (lasting for 1000 h).,"Influence of Mn Content in the Alloy on the Oxidation, Electrical and Volatilization Behavior of Co-Coated Steel Interconnects",10.1149/1945-7111/acba49
7,19571,"Compared to the cathode with the uncoated alloy present, the polarization resistance of the cathode in the presence of the Co-coated alloy increased very slowly under the conditions of open circuit potential set as 750 degrees C and 200 h, and Cr deposition on the cathode surface declined noticeably.","Influence of Mn Content in the Alloy on the Oxidation, Electrical and Volatilization Behavior of Co-Coated Steel Interconnects",10.1149/1945-7111/acba49
8,19571,This showed that the Co coating effectively inhibited outward diffusion of Cr to poison the cathode during long-term exposure.,"Influence of Mn Content in the Alloy on the Oxidation, Electrical and Volatilization Behavior of Co-Coated Steel Interconnects",10.1149/1945-7111/acba49
