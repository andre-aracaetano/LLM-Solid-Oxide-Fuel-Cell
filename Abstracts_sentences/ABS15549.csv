1,15549,"The effect of the degree of dispersion and the ratio of initial components of metalloceramic composites based on Ni and Sc2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (Ni/ScSZ) on the kinetics of sintering, conductivity, and polarization resistance of the corresponding anodes in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is studied.",Effect of structural parameters of Ni-ScSZ cermet components on the SOFC anodes characteristics,10.1134/S1023193516070181
2,15549,"The composites are prepared from nano- and submicrosized powders of NiO and ScSZ (10.5 mol % Sc2O3) containing particles with the average size of 0.02-0.33 mu m. Anode composites of three types differing in the ratio of initial components (NiO-ScSZ) with different degrees of dispersion: micro-micro, nano-micro, and nano-nano are studied.",Effect of structural parameters of Ni-ScSZ cermet components on the SOFC anodes characteristics,10.1134/S1023193516070181
3,15549,"Due to the ratio of particle sizes, the anodic composites of the nano-nano type demonstrate the preferential electronic conduction (the percolation threshold) starting from the Ni content of about 35 vol %, in contrast to the other two types of anodic composites for which this threshold is achieved at 30 vol %.",Effect of structural parameters of Ni-ScSZ cermet components on the SOFC anodes characteristics,10.1134/S1023193516070181

5,15549,The use of one or both components in the nanosized state makes it possible to decrease the anodic polarization up to two times.,Effect of structural parameters of Ni-ScSZ cermet components on the SOFC anodes characteristics,10.1134/S1023193516070181
6,15549,It is demonstrated that an active cermet anode for SOFC can be fabricated in the form of a planar three-layer structure Ni/ScSZ-ScSZ-Ni/ScSZ prepared from nanosized powders by the tape casting technique and cosintering.,Effect of structural parameters of Ni-ScSZ cermet components on the SOFC anodes characteristics,10.1134/S1023193516070181
