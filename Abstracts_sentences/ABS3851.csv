3,3851,"In this study, we developed the LST44-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) composite anodes, and investigated their electrochemical performance and redox stability on La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte-based SOFCs.",A-site deficient La0.4Sr0.4TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composites as efficient and redox stable anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.02.180
4,3851,"During galvanostatic long-term stability tests combined with in situ redox cycles, power out-put performance of the LST44-GDC employed SOFC was initially increased by similar to 53% to 0.26 W cm(-2) and maintained the high performance over 350 h at 800 degrees C. Analysis of the accumulated electrochemical impedance spectra during the long-term stability test showed that the electrochemical activity of the LST44-GDC anode was promoted at the initial redox cycling.",A-site deficient La0.4Sr0.4TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composites as efficient and redox stable anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.02.180
