1,15700,"Four-probe dc conductivities, capacitances, and thermopower have been measured in the temperature range of 80-1123 K for La1-xSrxGa1/2Mn1/2O3-delta, which is a desirable cathode material for lanthanum-gallate electrolytes of solid oxide fuel cells.",Multielectronic conduction in La1-xSrxGa1/2Mn1/2O3-δ as solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1063/1.1587888
2,15700,"The dc conductivities in the specimens (0.1 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.3) are insensitive to x but the thermopower is very sensitive to x, although the x = 0 specimen exhibits a somewhat different conduction behavior.",Multielectronic conduction in La1-xSrxGa1/2Mn1/2O3-δ as solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1063/1.1587888
3,15700,"At T < 300 K, a relaxation process has shown in dielectric loss factor with the activation energy higher than that for dc conduction in every specimen.",Multielectronic conduction in La1-xSrxGa1/2Mn1/2O3-δ as solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1063/1.1587888
4,15700,"These results at T < 300 K have been numerically analyzed within the framework of the multielectronic conduction consisting of the polaronic conduction of Mn 3d e(g) holes created by Sr doping, the band conduction of O 2p holes and the hopping conduction of Mn 3 d e(g) electrons, where the 0 2p holes and Mn 3 d e 9 electrons are created by thermal excitation of electrons from O2p bands to Mn 3d e(g) narrow bands.",Multielectronic conduction in La1-xSrxGa1/2Mn1/2O3-δ as solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1063/1.1587888

6,15700,The ionic conduction due to O2- migration seems difficult to contribute directly to the dc conduction even at high temperature.,Multielectronic conduction in La1-xSrxGa1/2Mn1/2O3-δ as solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1063/1.1587888
