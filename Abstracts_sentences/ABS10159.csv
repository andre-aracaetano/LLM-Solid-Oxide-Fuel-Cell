1,10159,"Due to mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion of various layers in the positive/electrolyte/negative (PEN) structures of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), thermal stresses and warpage on the PEN are unavoidable due to the temperature changes from the stress-free sintering temperature to room temperature during the PEN manufacturing process.",Global failure criteria for positive/electrolyte/negative structure of planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.03.012
2,10159,"In the meantime, additional mechanical stresses will also be created by mechanical flattening during the stack assembly process.",Global failure criteria for positive/electrolyte/negative structure of planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.03.012
3,10159,"In order to ensure the structural integrity of the cell and stack of SOFC, it is necessary to develop failure criteria for SOFC PEN structures based on the initial flaws occurred during cell sintering and stack assembly.",Global failure criteria for positive/electrolyte/negative structure of planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.03.012
4,10159,"In this paper, the global relationship between the critical energy release rate and critical curvature and maximum displacement of the warped cells caused by the temperature changes as well as mechanical flattening process is established so that possible failure of SOFC PEN structures may be predicted deterministically by the measurement of the curvature and displacement of the warped cells.",Global failure criteria for positive/electrolyte/negative structure of planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.03.012
