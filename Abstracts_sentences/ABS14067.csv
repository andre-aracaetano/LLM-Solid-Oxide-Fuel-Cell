1,14067,"In order to examine degradation of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes due to a trace of SOx in air, sulfur poisoning of SOFC cathodes was investigated in an accelerated mode using SO2-concentrated air at T = 1073 K. Two different cathode materials, Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (SSC) and (La0.85Sr0.15)(0.95)MnO3 (LSM), were fired on button-type La(0.8)Sr(0.2)Ga(0.8)Mg(0.15)Co(0.0)5O(3-delta) electrolytes.",Sulfur Poisoning of SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3090169
2,14067,SO2-concentrated air (98 ppm SO2-air mixture) was selected as the source of sulfur in order to accelerate degradations due to sulfur poisoning.,Sulfur Poisoning of SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3090169
3,14067,"By exposure to SO2, the performance of SSC cathode rapidly declined, because both ohmic and polarization resistances increased.",Sulfur Poisoning of SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3090169
4,14067,"The performance of the LSM cathode slightly decreased after exposure to SO2, and the performance recovered by interrupting the feed of SO2.",Sulfur Poisoning of SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3090169
5,14067,Secondary phases such as strontium sulfate were formed on SSC cathode after exposing SO2 and were not clearly detected on LSM cathode.,Sulfur Poisoning of SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3090169
6,14067,The LSM cathode was more stable in SO2 concentrated air than the SSC cathode.,Sulfur Poisoning of SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3090169
7,14067,This can be explained by the difference in the activity of strontium oxide in LSM and SSC.,Sulfur Poisoning of SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3090169
