1,13392,"We study the regularities of changes in the microstructure, strength, electric conductivity, and micromechanism of fracture of 50% (ZrO2-8 mole% Y2O3-2 wt.% Al2O3) + 50% (NiO-5 wt.% CuO) ceramics and the corresponding cermet [intended for manufacturing of the anodes (substrates) in solid-oxide fuel cells] caused by reduction in high-temperature (600 degrees C) Ar-5% H-2 and N-2-10% H-2-5% CO2 gas mixtures.",Influence of Reducing Media on the Structure and Physicomechanical Properties of Ceramics of the ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3-NiO - CuO System,10.1007/s11003-021-00503-8
2,13392,It is shown that the investigated cermet has a higher strength and electric conductivity if the calcination temperature of the initial powders is lowered from 900 degrees C to 700 degrees C and their sintering temperature is lowered from 1450 degrees C to 1400 degrees C.,Influence of Reducing Media on the Structure and Physicomechanical Properties of Ceramics of the ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3-NiO - CuO System,10.1007/s11003-021-00503-8
3,13392,The signs of pollution of this material with carbon compounds were not detected.,Influence of Reducing Media on the Structure and Physicomechanical Properties of Ceramics of the ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3-NiO - CuO System,10.1007/s11003-021-00503-8
4,13392,We also did not reveal any decrease in its strength and electric conductivity after reduction carried out at 600 degrees C in a N-2-10% H-2-5% CO2 gas mixture as compared to the characteristics of the same material reduced in an Ar-5% H-2 mixture.,Influence of Reducing Media on the Structure and Physicomechanical Properties of Ceramics of the ZrO2-Y2O3-Al2O3-NiO - CuO System,10.1007/s11003-021-00503-8
