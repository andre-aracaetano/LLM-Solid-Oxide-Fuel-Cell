3,17937,"Characterization studies were realized with thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), mass spectroscopy (MS), high temperature FT-IR (HT-FTIR) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD).",Preparation and characterization of 10 mol% Gd doped CeO2 (GDC) electrolyte for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.030
4,17937,"A single-phase with a fluorite type structure was found to form at a relatively low calcination temperature of 500 degrees C. Dense GDC pellets having 98% of the relative density were obtained at sintering temperature of 1400 degrees C/6 h, which gave significantly higher total ionic conductivity of 3.4 x 10(-2)",Preparation and characterization of 10 mol% Gd doped CeO2 (GDC) electrolyte for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.05.030
