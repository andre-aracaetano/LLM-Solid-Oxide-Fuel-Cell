1,3211,Double-proveskite YBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta (YBSC) was investigated as potential cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Performance of double-proveskite YBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.090
2,3211,"YBSC material exhibited a good chemical compatibility with the La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.115Co0.085O2.85 (LSGMC) electrolyte up to 950 degrees C for 2 h. The substitution of Sr for Ba significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity of the YBSC sample compared to undoped YBaCo2O5+delta, and also slightly increased the thermal expansion coefficient.",Performance of double-proveskite YBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.090
3,3211,At 325 degrees C a semiconductor-metal transition was observed and the maximum electrical conductivity of YBSC was 668 S cm(-1).,Performance of double-proveskite YBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.090
