3,12875,"For any given set of cell dimensions and characteristics, power density was maximized at an optimal cell length - the power decreased at larger cell lengths due to electrode lateral resistance loss and decreased at smaller cell lengths due to a decreasing fraction of cell active area.",Design considerations for segmented-in-series fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.002
4,12875,"For cell lengths well above the optimal value, electrolyte current was often confined to the portion of the cell nearest to where the less conductive electrode (i.e. the cathode) connected to the interconnect.",Design considerations for segmented-in-series fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.002
5,12875,"Assuming dimensions expected for screen printing, i.e. approximate to 20 mu m thick electrodes and lateral print accuracy of approximate to 100 mu m, and area specific resistance values typical of SOFCs, optimal cell lengths typically ranged from 1 to 3 turn.",Design considerations for segmented-in-series fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.002
6,12875,"Shunting currents increased with decreasing cell lengths, but were found to have little effect on power density assuming partially-stabilized zirconia supports and temperatures <= 800 degrees C.
