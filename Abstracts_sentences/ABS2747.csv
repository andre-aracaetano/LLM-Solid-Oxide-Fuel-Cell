1,2747,"High temperature fuel cell technologies, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs), are considered for their potential application to carbon dioxide emission control.",Carbon dioxide separation from high temperature fuel cell power plants,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00395-6
2,2747,"Both technologies feature electrochemical oxidisation of natural gas reformed fuels, avoiding the mixture of air and fuel flows and dilution with nitrogen and oxygen of the oxidised products; a preliminary analysis shows how the different mechanism of ion transport attributes each technology a specific advantage for the application to CO2 separation.",Carbon dioxide separation from high temperature fuel cell power plants,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00395-6
3,2747,"The paper then compares in the first part the most promising cycle configurations based on high efficiency integrated SOFC/gas turbine hybrid cycles, where CO2 is separated with absorption systems or with the eventual adoption of a second SOFC module acting as an afterburner.",Carbon dioxide separation from high temperature fuel cell power plants,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00395-6
4,2747,"The second part of the paper discusses how a MCFC plant could be retrofitted to a conventional fossil-fuel power station, giving the possibility of draining the majority Of CO2 from the stack exhaust while keeping the overall cycle electrical efficiency approximately unchanged.",Carbon dioxide separation from high temperature fuel cell power plants,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00395-6
