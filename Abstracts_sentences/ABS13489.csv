1,13489,"The early-stage degradation behaviour of a porous lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) cathode in a solid oxide fuel cell is investigated at a low temperature of 600 degrees C by operating four cells under different conditions: in dry air and at open circuit voltage (Dry-OCV), in dry air and under bias (Dry-bias), in wet air and at OCV (Wet-OCV), and in wet air and under bias (Wet-bias).",Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
2,13489,"Compared with Dry-OCV, either H2O or bias shows a negative effect on the electrochemical and transport characteristics, resulting in the most severe degradation in Wet-bias.",Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
3,13489,"The mechanism is explained in terms of LSCF deterioration, which is intensively studied on a micro- to atomic scale.",Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
4,13489,"No surface segregation is observed in the as-prepared cathode; however, sulfur is found to be incorporated into the lattice of the LSCF(110) surface.",Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
5,13489,"After operation, nano-segregation occurs in all the cathodes.",Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
6,13489,SrSO4 particles form in all the cathodes while Sr(OH)2 flakes precipitate under wet conditions.,Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
7,13489,The size and distribution of segregations vary with the conditions.,Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
8,13489,"For example, some of the SrSO4 particles in Dry-bias grow into bar-like ones (up to 280 nm) compared with smaller ones (36 nm) in Dry-OCV indicating that the kinetics of Sr diffusion and O vacancy formation is accelerated by bias.",Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
9,13489,"Their distribution is limited in the cathode surface layer (CSL) in Dry-OCV, Dry-bias and Wet-OCV, while it extends to the cathode/electrolyte interface in Wet-bias, which is caused by the decrease of SO2 adsorption/dissociation kinetics in the CSL in the presence of competitive H2O species (for SrSO4) and the enhancement of H2O mass transport driven by the O2 concentration gradient under bias (for Sr(OH)2).",Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
10,13489,"With the formation of segregation, other deteriorations such as sulfur incorporation into the surface, Sr-deficiency in the subsurface, and La-Co-rich regions near the surface occur and evolve in LSCF grains.",Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
11,13489,"All these changes lead to the deactivation of the surface O exchange, which is believed to be the dominant reason for the performance degradation.",Towards an atomic scale understanding of the early-stage deterioration mechanism of LSCF,10.1039/d3ta04585d
