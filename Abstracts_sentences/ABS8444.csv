1,8444,We report solutions (durable material and degradation prevention method) to minimize the performance degradation of cell components occurring in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operation.,Robust NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ cathode material and its degradation prevention operating logic for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.080
2,8444,Reliability testing is carried out with the Ni-Nd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (NDC) anode-supported intermediate temperature-SOFCs.,Robust NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ cathode material and its degradation prevention operating logic for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.080
3,8444,"For the cathode materials, single perovskite structured Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) and double perovskite structured NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (NBSCF) are prepared and evaluated under harsh SOFC operating conditions.",Robust NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ cathode material and its degradation prevention operating logic for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.080
4,8444,The double perovskite NBSCF cathode shows excellent stability in harsh SOFC environments of high humidity and low flow rate of air.,Robust NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ cathode material and its degradation prevention operating logic for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.080
5,8444,"Furthermore, we propose the concurrent fuel and air starvation mode, in which the cell potential is temporarily reduced due to the formation of both fuel-starvation (in the anode) and air-depletion (in the cathode) concurrently under a constant load.",Robust NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ cathode material and its degradation prevention operating logic for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.080
6,8444,This is carried out in order to minimize the performance decay of the stable NBSCF-cell through the periodic and extra reduction of a(H2O) (and a(O2)) in the anode.,Robust NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ cathode material and its degradation prevention operating logic for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.080
7,8444,"The operating-induced degradation of SOFCs, which are ordinarily assumed to be unrecoverable, can be completely circumvented by the proposed periodical operation logic to prevent performance degradation (concurrent fuel-starvation and air-depletion mode).",Robust NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ cathode material and its degradation prevention operating logic for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.080
