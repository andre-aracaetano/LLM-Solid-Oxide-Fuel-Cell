1,374,"Direct carbon fuel cells offer highly efficient means of converting carbon from waste, biomass or coal to electricity producing an exhaust stream that is well-suited to CO2 sequestration and, hence could underpin a new, clean carbon economy.","Demonstration of high power, direct conversion of waste-derived carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell",10.1039/c2ee03510c
2,374,"If this technology is to contribute significantly to improving our impending global energy crisis, three aspects must first be addressed: competitive performance with extant fuel cell technologies, development of practical systems to handle available carbon resources and demonstration of sufficient durability, i.e. 40 000 hours minimum for system.","Demonstration of high power, direct conversion of waste-derived carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell",10.1039/c2ee03510c
3,374,"In the present study, we demonstrate excellent performance from a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell based upon an yttrium-stabilised zirconia electrolyte to use solid carbons as fuels directly.","Demonstration of high power, direct conversion of waste-derived carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell",10.1039/c2ee03510c
4,374,"Good stability of the zirconia is observed during and after fuel cell testing and in corrosion tests under reducing conditions; however, significant intergrain erosion is observed under oxidising conditions.","Demonstration of high power, direct conversion of waste-derived carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell",10.1039/c2ee03510c
5,374,"The carbon fuel chosen is a waste product, Medium Density Fibreboard, which is widely available and difficult to recycle.","Demonstration of high power, direct conversion of waste-derived carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell",10.1039/c2ee03510c
6,374,"Cells exhibit excellent electrochemical performance at 750 degrees C, with a maximum power density of 390 mW cm(-2) using a lanthanum doped strontium manganite (LSM) cathode and 878 mW cm(-2) using a lanthanum doped strontium cobalt (LSC) cathode under flowing air.","Demonstration of high power, direct conversion of waste-derived carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell",10.1039/c2ee03510c
7,374,This is comparable with current commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and significantly in excess of commercial Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) performance.,"Demonstration of high power, direct conversion of waste-derived carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell",10.1039/c2ee03510c
8,374,"This hybrid direct carbon fuel cell therefore offers the clean utilisation of coal, waste and renewable carbon sources and hence merits development as a realistic alternative technology.","Demonstration of high power, direct conversion of waste-derived carbon in a hybrid direct carbon fuel cell",10.1039/c2ee03510c
