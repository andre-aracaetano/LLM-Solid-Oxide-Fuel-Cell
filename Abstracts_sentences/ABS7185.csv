1,7185,An organic precursor-mixing route has been developed for preparation of 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) ceramics.,Eight mole percent yttria stabilized zirconia powders by organic precursor route,10.1016/j.ceramint.2007.02.013
2,7185,"Polymeric salt of succinic acid with yttrium and zirconium has been prepared separately by treating sodium succinate with yttrium chloride and zirconyl chloride followed by washing with water and drying at 120 degrees C. Thorough mixing of the two salts in stoichiometric proportions by planetary ball milling followed by calcination at 850 degrees C resulted in a precursor powder containing nanocrystalline (similar to 40 nm) monoclinic zirconia, tetragonal YSZ, cubic YSZ and yttria.",Eight mole percent yttria stabilized zirconia powders by organic precursor route,10.1016/j.ceramint.2007.02.013
3,7185,Compacts prepared after deagglomeration of powder by planetary ball milling produce 8YSZ ceramics having density 99.3% TD on sintering at 1550 degrees C for 2 h.
