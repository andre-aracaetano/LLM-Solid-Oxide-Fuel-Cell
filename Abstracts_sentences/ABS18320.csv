1,18320,"Catalyst layers (4-20 mu m) of rhodium (1 wt%) supported on alumina, titania, and ceria-zirconia (Ce0.5Zr0.5O2) were coated on stainless-steel corrugated sheets by dip-coating in very stable colloidal dispersions of nanoparticles in water.",Catalytic coatings on steel for low-temperature propane prereforming to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application,10.1016/j.jcis.2009.04.079
2,18320,Catalytic performances were studied for low-temperature (<= 500 degrees C) steam reforming of propane at a steam to carbon ratio equal to 3 and low contact time (approximate to 0.01 s).,Catalytic coatings on steel for low-temperature propane prereforming to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application,10.1016/j.jcis.2009.04.079
3,18320,The best catalytic activity for propane steam reforming was observed for titania and ceria-zirconia supports for which propane conversion started at 250 degrees C and was more than three times better at 350 degrees C than conversion measured on alumina catalyst.,Catalytic coatings on steel for low-temperature propane prereforming to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application,10.1016/j.jcis.2009.04.079
4,18320,For all catalysts a first-order kinetics was found with respect to propane at 500 degrees C. Addition of PEG 2000 in titania and ceria-zirconia sols eliminated the film cracking observed without additive with these supports.,Catalytic coatings on steel for low-temperature propane prereforming to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application,10.1016/j.jcis.2009.04.079
5,18320,"Besides, the PEG addition strongly expanded the porosity of the layers, so that full catalytic efficiency was maintained when the thickness of the ceria-zirconia and titania films was increased.",Catalytic coatings on steel for low-temperature propane prereforming to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application,10.1016/j.jcis.2009.04.079
