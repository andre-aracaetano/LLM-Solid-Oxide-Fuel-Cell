1,9087,"Anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) were fabricated by addition of various metal oxides such as Fe2O3, Co3O4 and TiO2 to thin anode functional layers between the electrolyte (yttria-stabilized zirconia, YSZ) and electrode materials (anode support: YSZ-NiO).",Compositional Effect of Thin Electrode Functional Layers on the Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4004470
2,9087,Effect of the additives on the power density and impedance spectra of SOFC was studied.,Compositional Effect of Thin Electrode Functional Layers on the Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4004470
3,9087,"It was found that addition of Co3O4 to anode functional layer was most effective towards improvement of power densities and reduction of the total ohmic resistance as well as the area specific resistance of the cells, while addition of TiO2 to anode functional layer resulted in lower power densities.",Compositional Effect of Thin Electrode Functional Layers on the Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4004470
4,9087,Possible mechanisms on the relationship between the additives in electrode functional layers and the cell performance were briefly discussed.,Compositional Effect of Thin Electrode Functional Layers on the Performance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4004470
