1,2139,"The anodic performances of Ni/CeO2-Sm2O3(Ni/SDC) modified by the addition of alkaline earth metal oxides (MgO, CaO, and SrO) were investigated for direct oxidation of CH4 in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Improvement of Ni/SDC anode by alkaline earth metal oxide addition for direct methane-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2009.05.042
2,2139,"Although the initial power density of cell with Ni/SDC anode modified by the addition of CaO was slightly lower than that of cell with Ni/SDC, the former anode exhibited an excellent stability compared to the latter one.",Improvement of Ni/SDC anode by alkaline earth metal oxide addition for direct methane-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2009.05.042
3,2139,Such a high stability of Ni-CaO/SDC anode may come from the inhibition of carbon deposition in addition to the retained ionic conductivity of anode.,Improvement of Ni/SDC anode by alkaline earth metal oxide addition for direct methane-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2009.05.042
