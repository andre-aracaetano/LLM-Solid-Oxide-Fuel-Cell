2,18156,The ceramic method (powder mixing method) resulted in inhomogeneous distributions of the calcium content (x) in the perovskite phase (La1-xCaxCrO3-delta) after calcining at a temperature from 1223 to 1373 K. More homogeneous powder was obtained by the liquid mixing method.,EFFECT OF PREPARATION METHOD ON CHEMICAL-STABILITY OF SINTERABLE CALCIUM-DOPED LANTHANUM CHROMITES,
3,18156,"The distribution of calcium content caused a large amount of second phases such as calcium oxychromates (Ca(m)(CrO4)n) in a powder prepared by the ceramic method, and an excess amount of the second phase remained as Ca5(CrO4)3OH on the surface of the ceramics after sintering at 1573 K. During a treatment in an H-2 + H2O gaseous mixture at 1273 K for 627 h, Ca(m)(CrO4)n decomposed to CaO and alpha-CaCr2O4, and the decomposition was enhanced by the existence of silicon-containing impurities.",EFFECT OF PREPARATION METHOD ON CHEMICAL-STABILITY OF SINTERABLE CALCIUM-DOPED LANTHANUM CHROMITES,
