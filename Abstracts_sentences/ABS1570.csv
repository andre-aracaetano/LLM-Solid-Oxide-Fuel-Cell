1,1570,This study investigates the electrical performance of a planar solid oxide fuel cell unit with cross-flow configuration when the fuel utilization gets higher and the fuel inlet flows are nonuniform.,Electrical and Thermal Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Unit With Nonuniform Inlet Flow and High Fuel Utilization,10.1115/1.4002228
2,1570,"A numerical code, solving the two-dimensional, simultaneous, partial differential equations of mass, energy, and electrochemistry and neglecting the stack direction variation effect, is developed.",Electrical and Thermal Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Unit With Nonuniform Inlet Flow and High Fuel Utilization,10.1115/1.4002228
3,1570,"The results show that the fuel utilization increases with a decrease in the molar flow rate, and the average current density decreases when the molar flow rate drops.",Electrical and Thermal Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Unit With Nonuniform Inlet Flow and High Fuel Utilization,10.1115/1.4002228
4,1570,"In addition, nonuniform pattern A induces more severe happening of nonreaction area in the corner of the fuel exit and the air inlet.",Electrical and Thermal Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Unit With Nonuniform Inlet Flow and High Fuel Utilization,10.1115/1.4002228
5,1570,This nonreaction area deteriorates the average current density and then reduces the electrical performance to 7%.,Electrical and Thermal Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Unit With Nonuniform Inlet Flow and High Fuel Utilization,10.1115/1.4002228
6,1570,"This study suggests that the fuel inlet manifold should be located far from the inlet of air, which is able to decrease the deterioration to below 3% when using nonuniform profile of pattern B. On the other hand, employing a suitable air flow rate, we can easily control the operating temperature of a solid oxide fuel cell unit and the effect of nonuniform inlet air flow rate on the temperature distribution becomes negligible.",Electrical and Thermal Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Unit With Nonuniform Inlet Flow and High Fuel Utilization,10.1115/1.4002228
