1,12486,Pr2NiO4+ delta was wet infiltrated into porous LSGM scaffolds to form solid oxide cell oxygen electrodes on LSG-Melectrolyte symmetrical cells.,Oxygen electrode characteristics of Pr2NiO4+δ-infiltrated porous (La0.9Sr0.1)(Ga0.8Mg0.2)O3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.03.030
2,12486,"The minimum calcination temperature required to form this nickelate phase was between 950 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. X-ray diffraction measurements of electrodes tested at 650 degrees C showed little evidence of any phase change, in contrast to 650 degrees C annealed Pr2NiO4+ delta powders that decomposed to Pr4Ni3O10 and Pr6O11.",Oxygen electrode characteristics of Pr2NiO4+δ-infiltrated porous (La0.9Sr0.1)(Ga0.8Mg0.2)O3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.03.030
3,12486,"Polarization resistance followed an Arrhenius temperature dependence with an activation barrier of 1.40 eV, and a value as low as 0.11 Omega.cm(2) was observed at 650 degrees C for a Pr2NiO4+ delta loading of 14 vol.%.",Oxygen electrode characteristics of Pr2NiO4+δ-infiltrated porous (La0.9Sr0.1)(Ga0.8Mg0.2)O3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.03.030
4,12486,"The present resistance values appear to be the lowest reported to date for a Ruddlesden-Popper phase electrode, and are competitive with perovskite-structure electrodes.",Oxygen electrode characteristics of Pr2NiO4+δ-infiltrated porous (La0.9Sr0.1)(Ga0.8Mg0.2)O3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.03.030
5,12486,"The low resistance, combined with the good stability of infiltrated Pr2NiO4+ delta and the advantages of being CO- arid Sr-free, make this an exciting new contender for intermediate-temperature solid oxide cell applications.",Oxygen electrode characteristics of Pr2NiO4+δ-infiltrated porous (La0.9Sr0.1)(Ga0.8Mg0.2)O3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.03.030
