1,9813,"A lanthanum-, magnesium-, and cerium-doped nickel oxide, Ni0.85La0.05Mg0.05Ce0.05Ox-delta (NLMC), was prepared by a glycine nitrate process and evaluated as an anode catalyst for direct biogas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells.",Ni0.85La0.05Mg0.05Ce0.05Ox-δ Based Anode Catalyst for Biogas-Fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/sam.2017.3186
2,9813,The cell performance was characterized by measuring I-V curves and impedance spectra.,Ni0.85La0.05Mg0.05Ce0.05Ox-δ Based Anode Catalyst for Biogas-Fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/sam.2017.3186
3,9813,A single cell with the NLMC-YSZ anode exhibited a maximum power density of 0.51 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C with synthetic biogas (60% CH4 and 40% CO2).,Ni0.85La0.05Mg0.05Ce0.05Ox-δ Based Anode Catalyst for Biogas-Fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/sam.2017.3186
4,9813,"Furthermore, the NLMC-YSZ based cell was stable when operated under the biogas for 52 h, while the conventional NiO-YSZ based cell failed in 11 h.",Ni0.85La0.05Mg0.05Ce0.05Ox-δ Based Anode Catalyst for Biogas-Fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/sam.2017.3186
5,9813,"The results indicated that the incorporation of La2O3, MgO, and CeO2 into NiO caused a uniform distribution of Ni with a smaller particle size and enhanced coking resistance.",Ni0.85La0.05Mg0.05Ce0.05Ox-δ Based Anode Catalyst for Biogas-Fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/sam.2017.3186
