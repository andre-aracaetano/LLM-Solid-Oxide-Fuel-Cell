1,12888,A critical issue to tackle before successful commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) can be achieved is the long-term thermal stability required for SOFCs to operate reliably without significant performance degradation despite enduring thermal cycling.,Degradation Mechanisms of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Various Thermal Cycling Conditions,10.1021/acsami.1c13779
2,12888,"In this work, the impact of thermal cycling on the durability of NiO-yttria-stabilized zirconia-based anode-supported cells is studied using three different heating/cooling rates (1, 2, and 5 degrees C min(-1)) as the temperature fluctuated between 400 and 700 degrees C.",Degradation Mechanisms of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Various Thermal Cycling Conditions,10.1021/acsami.1c13779
3,12888,"Our experiments simulate time periods when power from SOFCs is not required (e.g., as might occur at night or during an emergency shutdown).",Degradation Mechanisms of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Various Thermal Cycling Conditions,10.1021/acsami.1c13779
4,12888,"The decay ratios of the cell voltages are 8.8% (82 mu V h(-1)) and 19.1% (187 mu V h(-1)) after thermal cycling testing at heating/cooling rates of 1 and 5 degrees C min(-1), respectively, over a period of 1000 h. The results indicate SOFCs that undergo rapid thermal cycling experience much greater performance degradation than cells that experience slow heating/cooling rates.",Degradation Mechanisms of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Various Thermal Cycling Conditions,10.1021/acsami.1c13779
5,12888,"The changes in total resistance for thermally cycled cells are determined by measuring the R-pol of the electrodes (whereas the ohmic resistances of the cells remain unchanged from their initial value), signifying that electrode deterioration is the main degradation mechanism for SOFCs under thermal cycling.",Degradation Mechanisms of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Various Thermal Cycling Conditions,10.1021/acsami.1c13779
6,12888,"In particular, fast thermal cycling leads to severe degradation in the anode part of SOFCs with substantial agglomeration and depletion of Ni particles seen in our characterizations with field emission-scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis.",Degradation Mechanisms of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Various Thermal Cycling Conditions,10.1021/acsami.1c13779
7,12888,"In addition, the mean particle size in the cathode after thermal cycling testing increases from 0.104 to 0.201 mu m for the 5 degrees C min(-1) cell.",Degradation Mechanisms of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Various Thermal Cycling Conditions,10.1021/acsami.1c13779
8,12888,"Further, the presence of Sr-enriched regions is more significant in the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta cathode after fast thermally cyded SOFCs.",Degradation Mechanisms of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells under Various Thermal Cycling Conditions,10.1021/acsami.1c13779
