1,8626,"In order to improve the performance of a micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC), a porous material was inserted in the free space between the cell and the gas chamber.","Modelling of novel porous inserted micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SC-SOFCs)",10.1016/j.cej.2011.11.001
2,8626,"Four different cases were studied, namely: case 1) bare gas-chamber, i.e., with no porous inserts, case 2) completely filled porous gas-chamber, case 3) half filled porous gas-chamber, and case 4) partially filled porous gas-chamber ensuring free equal volume for gas flow around both electrodes.","Modelling of novel porous inserted micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SC-SOFCs)",10.1016/j.cej.2011.11.001
3,8626,The three porous arrangements were used to reduce the un-utilized gas mixture that would otherwise bypass the cell.,"Modelling of novel porous inserted micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SC-SOFCs)",10.1016/j.cej.2011.11.001
4,8626,"The results of porous gas-chamber (i.e., cases 2-4) were compared with the bare gas-chamber (i.e., case 1).","Modelling of novel porous inserted micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SC-SOFCs)",10.1016/j.cej.2011.11.001
5,8626,"It is concluded that case 4 appears to be the best amongst other investigated cases, as it improves the power output by 16.96% as compared to case 1.","Modelling of novel porous inserted micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SC-SOFCs)",10.1016/j.cej.2011.11.001
6,8626,The best power output obtained in case 4 is due to better gas management around both electrodes which enhances the convective transport within the porous electrodes.,"Modelling of novel porous inserted micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SC-SOFCs)",10.1016/j.cej.2011.11.001
7,8626,The lower concentration polarization in case 4 is believed to be the enhancement factor that was limiting the cell performance in case 1.,"Modelling of novel porous inserted micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SC-SOFCs)",10.1016/j.cej.2011.11.001
