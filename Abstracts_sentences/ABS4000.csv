1,4000,Single chamber solid oxide fuel cells (SC-SOFCs) based on the system Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95/Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.90 were investigated.,Single chamber solid oxide fuel cells with integrated current-collectors,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.022
2,4000,Pt-meshes that were embedded in both electrodes were used as current collectors in order to achieve low overpotentials.,Single chamber solid oxide fuel cells with integrated current-collectors,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.022
3,4000,The cells generated 271 mW/cm(2) at 500 degrees C and 468 mW/cm(2) at 600 degrees C on a gas mixture of methane and air (CH4/O-2 = 1.6) with a total flow of 1500 ml/min.,Single chamber solid oxide fuel cells with integrated current-collectors,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.022
4,4000,"The air flow was varied (260, 780, 1120, and 1340 ml/min) while the flow of methane was kept at 380 ml/min.",Single chamber solid oxide fuel cells with integrated current-collectors,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.022
5,4000,It was found that the open circuit voltage (OCV) and the maximum power density (P-max) were strongly dependent on the airflow and the operating temperature.,Single chamber solid oxide fuel cells with integrated current-collectors,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.022
6,4000,The influences of Palladium-addition to the anode as well as Co-doping of the electrolyte on the OCV and P-max have been studied and compared to an unmodified cell.,Single chamber solid oxide fuel cells with integrated current-collectors,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.022
7,4000,Pd-containing anodes allow for higher power outputs at low airflow.,Single chamber solid oxide fuel cells with integrated current-collectors,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.022
8,4000,The presence of Co in the electrolyte raises the OCV but decreases the maximum power density.,Single chamber solid oxide fuel cells with integrated current-collectors,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.022
