1,3047,"Reducing the operating temperatures of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to the intermediate-temperature range (IT, 400-650 degrees C) can bring about several benefits including cost effectiveness, prolonged lifetime and flexible sealing.",SrCo0.8Ti0.1Ta0.1O3-δ perovskite: A new highly active and durable cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2021.108726
2,3047,"Nevertheless, the accompanying deterioration of cathodic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) introduces a large obstacle for commercial applications of IT-SOFCs.",SrCo0.8Ti0.1Ta0.1O3-δ perovskite: A new highly active and durable cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2021.108726
3,3047,"Herein, a new perovskite SrCo0.8Ti0.1Ta0.1O3-delta (SCTT) is developed by co-doping titanium and tantalum into the B-site of parent SrCoO3 oxide, which may tackle this problem.",SrCo0.8Ti0.1Ta0.1O3-δ perovskite: A new highly active and durable cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2021.108726
4,3047,"At 400-650 degrees C, SCTT shows high electrical conductivities (65-142 S cm(-1)), appropriate oxygen vacancy concentrations (0.23-0.27) and high bulk diffusion capability due to a synergy between the two dopants in SCTT.",SrCo0.8Ti0.1Ta0.1O3-δ perovskite: A new highly active and durable cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2021.108726
5,3047,"Consequently, SCTT exhibits a favorable ORR activity with an area-specific resistance of only 0.17 Omega cm(2) at 500 degrees C on samaria-doped ceria electrolyte, and the corresponding cell generates a high peak power density (PPD) of 0.90 W cm(-2) at 500 degrees C with negligible performance decay for 180 h. Additionally, SCTT performs well in protonic ceramic fuel cells, achieving a PPD of 0.78 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C and a high durability for similar to 176 h at 550 degrees C.",SrCo0.8Ti0.1Ta0.1O3-δ perovskite: A new highly active and durable cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2021.108726
