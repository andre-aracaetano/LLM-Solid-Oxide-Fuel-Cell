1,1068,"The pomelo peel char (PC) was prepared and used as fuel for solid oxide electrolyte direct carbon fuel cells with nickel-yttrium stabilized zirconia anode, thin-film YSZ electrolyte, and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode.",A solid oxide carbon fuel cell operating on pomelo peel char with high power output,10.1002/er.4097
2,1068,"The power densities of fuel cells operating on PC and catalyst-loaded PC (PCC) fuels achieved 309 and 518 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, respectively, which are among the highest power densities reported in the literature on DCFCs.",A solid oxide carbon fuel cell operating on pomelo peel char with high power output,10.1002/er.4097
3,1068,The PC exhibited superior gasification reactivity than coal char due to its unique reticulated foam carbon structure with a homogeneously distributed inherent catalyst.,A solid oxide carbon fuel cell operating on pomelo peel char with high power output,10.1002/er.4097
4,1068,"The stability tests at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and 825 degrees C indicate that the cell using PC fuel operated in a more stable manner than that using PCC, and the fuel availabilities for PC and PCC were 47.25% and 34.71%, respectively.",A solid oxide carbon fuel cell operating on pomelo peel char with high power output,10.1002/er.4097
5,1068,The results suggest that PC is a promising solid carbonaceous fuel for solid oxide electrolyte direct carbon fuel cells based on its adequate gasification reactivity and high compatibility with the fuel cells.,A solid oxide carbon fuel cell operating on pomelo peel char with high power output,10.1002/er.4097
