6,16292,"In both fuel cell and electrolysis cell operation modes, the proton-conducting solid oxide cells with the A-site-deficient Ba0.95Fe0.5Sn0.2Bi0.3O3-delta oxygen electrode demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance, giving a peak power density of 0.69 W cm-2 (increased by 19.0%) and an electrolysis current density of 1.64 A cm-2 (increased by 30.2%) at 700 degrees C. Moreover, even at 600 degrees C with 50% high steam partial pressure, electrolysis for hydrogen production is maintained for about 100 h without significant attenuation, confirming the vital role of A-site defect engineering in the design of advanced oxygen electrode materials.",Improving Electrocatalytic Activity of Cobalt-Free Barium Ferrite- Based Perovskite Oxygen Electrodes for Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Cells via Introducing A-Site Deficiency,10.1021/acsaem.3c00014
