1,6949,Ni-CeO2 doped with 20 mol.% Gd3+ (GDC) cermet was investigated as the anode of an intermediate temperature operating solid oxide fuel cell using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte.,Nickel-Gd-doped CeO2 cermet anode for intermediate temperature operating solid oxide fuel cells using LaGaO3-based perovskite electrolyte,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00660-3
2,6949,"It was found that the anodic overpotential decreased by mixing Ni with mixed electronic-ionic conductor, in particular, mixing with doped CeO2 is the most effective for decreasing the overpotential of the anode.",Nickel-Gd-doped CeO2 cermet anode for intermediate temperature operating solid oxide fuel cells using LaGaO3-based perovskite electrolyte,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00660-3
3,6949,Anodic overpotential became a minimum at 10 vol.% GDC to NiO. Using Ni-GDC cermet is also effective for improving the stability of the power density at the constant current output.,Nickel-Gd-doped CeO2 cermet anode for intermediate temperature operating solid oxide fuel cells using LaGaO3-based perovskite electrolyte,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00660-3
4,6949,"Impedance analysis suggests that the improvement of anodic activity by mixing Ni with GDC was brought about by decreasing the diffusion overpotential, which was a result of the enlarged effective electrode area.",Nickel-Gd-doped CeO2 cermet anode for intermediate temperature operating solid oxide fuel cells using LaGaO3-based perovskite electrolyte,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00660-3
