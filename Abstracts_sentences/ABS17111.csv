1,17111,We have developed a high conductivity bilayered ceria/bismuth oxide anolyte/electrolyte that uses the p(O2) gradient to obtain stability at the anolyte-electrolyte interface and reduced electronic conduction due to the electrolyte region.,Stable high conductivity ceria/bismuth oxide bilayered electrolytes,10.1149/1.1837390
2,17111,Results in terms of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) performance and stability are presented.,Stable high conductivity ceria/bismuth oxide bilayered electrolytes,10.1149/1.1837390
3,17111,"These results include a 90 to 160 mV increase in open-circuit potential, depending on temperature, with the bilayered structure as compared to SOFCs fabricated from a single ceria layer.",Stable high conductivity ceria/bismuth oxide bilayered electrolytes,10.1149/1.1837390
4,17111,An open-circuit potential of >1.0 V was obtained at 500 degrees C with the bilayered structure.,Stable high conductivity ceria/bismuth oxide bilayered electrolytes,10.1149/1.1837390
5,17111,"This increase in open-circuit potential is obtained without any measurable increase in cell resistance and is stable for over 1400 h of testing, under both open-circuit and maximum power conditions.",Stable high conductivity ceria/bismuth oxide bilayered electrolytes,10.1149/1.1837390
6,17111,"Moreover, SOFCs fabricated from the bilayered structure result in a 33% greater power density as compared to cells with a single ceria electrolyte layer.",Stable high conductivity ceria/bismuth oxide bilayered electrolytes,10.1149/1.1837390
