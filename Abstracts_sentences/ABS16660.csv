2,16660,A strongly acidic precursor solution with appropriate amounts of glycine fuel added increased the specific surface area of the synthesized composite powders.,Preparation of nanocrystalline nickel oxide-yttria-stabilized zirconia composite powder by solution combustion with ignition of glycine fuel,10.1557/JMR.2001.0496
3,16660,This results from the increased binding of metal ions and glycine under strongly acidic solution (pH = 0.5) conditions.,Preparation of nanocrystalline nickel oxide-yttria-stabilized zirconia composite powder by solution combustion with ignition of glycine fuel,10.1557/JMR.2001.0496
4,16660,"After sintering and reducing treatment of nanocrystalline NiO/YSZ composite, the Ni/YSZ pellet showed an ideal microstructure: fine Ni particles of 3 to 5 mum were distributed uniformly, and fine micropores around Ni metal particles were formed, thus leading to an increase in the triple phase boundary area among gas, Ni and YSZ.",Preparation of nanocrystalline nickel oxide-yttria-stabilized zirconia composite powder by solution combustion with ignition of glycine fuel,10.1557/JMR.2001.0496
