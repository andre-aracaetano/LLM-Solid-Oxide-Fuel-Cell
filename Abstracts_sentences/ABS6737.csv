5,6737,"The single cell with this novel NiFe@SFM-SDC anode delivers an outstanding power density of 0.595 Wcm(-2) for H-2 fuel at 700 degrees C, and shows a stable operation for over 80 h. Moreover, a comparable performance of 0.503 Wcm(-2) is achieved for CH4-CO2 fuel, as well as the stability for 55 h. Last, but not least, the anode shows no obvious carbon deposition, while highly concentrated syngas of H-2 and CO is steadily yielded from the anode chamber.",Surface-engineered ceramic anode with asymmetric microchannels for efficient power and syngas co-generation in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131098
