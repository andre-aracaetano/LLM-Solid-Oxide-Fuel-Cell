2,4764,"The main strategies for the waste management are the increase of material recovery (MR), which can reduce the landfill disposal, the improvement of energy recovery (ER) from waste and the minimization of the environmental impact.",From waste to electricity through integrated plasma gasification/fuel cell (IPGFC) system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.008
3,4764,"These two last objectives can be achieved by introducing a novel technology for waste treatment based on a plasma torch gasification system integrated with a high efficiency energy conversion system, such as combined cycle power plant or high-temperature fuel cells.",From waste to electricity through integrated plasma gasification/fuel cell (IPGFC) system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.008
4,4764,This work aims to evaluate the performance of an Integrated Plasma Gasification/Fuel Cell system (IPGFC) in order to establish its energy suitability and environmental feature.,From waste to electricity through integrated plasma gasification/fuel cell (IPGFC) system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.008
5,4764,The performance analysis of this system has been carried out by using a numerical model properly defined and implemented in Aspen Plus (TM) code environment.,From waste to electricity through integrated plasma gasification/fuel cell (IPGFC) system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.008
6,4764,"The model is based on the combination of a thermochemical model of the plasma gasification unit, previously developed by the authors (the so-called EguiPlasmaJet model), and an electrochemical model for the SOFC fuel cell stack simulation.",From waste to electricity through integrated plasma gasification/fuel cell (IPGFC) system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.008
7,4764,"The EPJ model has been employed to predict the syngas composition and the energy balance of an RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) plasma arc gasifier (that uses air as plasma gas), whereas the SOFC electrochemical model, that is a system-level model, has allowed to forecast the stack performance in terms of electrical power and efficiency.",From waste to electricity through integrated plasma gasification/fuel cell (IPGFC) system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.008
8,4764,Results point out that the IPGFC system is able to produce a net power of 4.2 MW per kg of RDF with an electric efficiency of about 33%.,From waste to electricity through integrated plasma gasification/fuel cell (IPGFC) system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.008
9,4764,This efficiency is high in comparison with those reached by conventional technologies based on RDF incineration (20%).,From waste to electricity through integrated plasma gasification/fuel cell (IPGFC) system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.008
