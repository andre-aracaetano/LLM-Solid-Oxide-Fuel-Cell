1,4371,Understanding the temperature dependence of electrode reactions is attempted with a commercial 100 cm2 class planar solid oxide fuel cell.,Effect of temperature on the electrode reactions in a planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2023.117753
2,4371,"Experimental investigations are conducted using a specially designed setup, i.e., inert gas step addition (ISA) and reactant gas step addition (RA) methods, to measure the electrode overpotential behaviour at temperatures ranging from 923 to 1073 K.",Effect of temperature on the electrode reactions in a planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2023.117753
3,4371,The ISA reveals that the gas-phase mass transfer resistance at the anode is more substantial and becomes immensely larger with increasing temperature due to the effect of pore diffusion resistance (PDR).,Effect of temperature on the electrode reactions in a planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2023.117753
4,4371,"On the other hand, the gas-phase mass transfer resistance of the cathode shows an unclear dependence on temperature, indicating little resistance in the cathode.",Effect of temperature on the electrode reactions in a planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2023.117753
5,4371,"The RA method represents that the H2-inducing mass transfer resistance increases with increasing temperature due to the PDR effect, while the O2-inducing mass transfer resistance decreases with increasing temperature because of the reducing solid-phase mass transfer resistance of oxide ions.",Effect of temperature on the electrode reactions in a planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2023.117753
