2,19609,"In this study, a promising cathode material, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF), was prepared as a nanostructured thin film using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC)-buffered YSZ single crystal substrates having (100) and (111) orientations.",Oxygen surface exchange properties and surface segregation behavior of nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin film cathodes,10.1039/c9cp00606k
3,19609,Characterization revealed intrinsic differences among the as-grown LSCF thin films in terms of dominant crystalline orientation and nanostructure depending on GDC preparation as well as the YSZ substrate orientation.,Oxygen surface exchange properties and surface segregation behavior of nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin film cathodes,10.1039/c9cp00606k
4,19609,Evaluation of the oxygen exchange properties using the isotope exchange depth profile method revealed that LSCF thin films grown on (111) GDC/YSZ exhibited higher values of the apparent surface exchange coefficient compared to LSCF thin films grown on (100) GDC/YSZ.,Oxygen surface exchange properties and surface segregation behavior of nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin film cathodes,10.1039/c9cp00606k
5,19609,"However, when subjected to long-term annealing at high temperatures, the former exhibited a stronger tendency to surface segregation as compared to the latter.",Oxygen surface exchange properties and surface segregation behavior of nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin film cathodes,10.1039/c9cp00606k
6,19609,"These behaviors are correlated with the intrinsic properties of LSCF thin films, including the nanostructure, the possible effects attributed to SrO activity, and the stability of perovskite surfaces which would drive surface segregation.",Oxygen surface exchange properties and surface segregation behavior of nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin film cathodes,10.1039/c9cp00606k
7,19609,These results have implications for tailoring the performance of cathode thin films by understanding the dependence of oxygen exchange properties and surface segregation on driving forces such as surface chemistry and nanostructure.,Oxygen surface exchange properties and surface segregation behavior of nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin film cathodes,10.1039/c9cp00606k
