1,7365,The performance of Nd2-xLaxNiO4+delta as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was evaluated in this paper.,"Nd2-xLaxNiO4+δ, a mixed ionic/electronic conductor with interstitial oxygen, as a cathode material",10.1016/j.ssi.2007.01.013
2,7365,Substitution of smaller Nd3+ ion for La3+ in La2NO4+delta increased the retention of mobile interstitial oxygen defects (O-i ions).,"Nd2-xLaxNiO4+δ, a mixed ionic/electronic conductor with interstitial oxygen, as a cathode material",10.1016/j.ssi.2007.01.013
3,7365,The concentration of the O-i ions in Nd2NiO4+delta was stabilized at delta approximate to 0.12 at 800 degrees C in air after thermal cycling.,"Nd2-xLaxNiO4+δ, a mixed ionic/electronic conductor with interstitial oxygen, as a cathode material",10.1016/j.ssi.2007.01.013
4,7365,"As a mixed oxide-ion/clectronic conductor (MIEC), Nd2NiO4+delta gave a performance comparable to that of the best perovskite cathode material, SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (SCF), for the Sm-doped cerin (SDC) electrolyte-supported SOFC.","Nd2-xLaxNiO4+δ, a mixed ionic/electronic conductor with interstitial oxygen, as a cathode material",10.1016/j.ssi.2007.01.013
5,7365,"However, the Nd2NiO4+delta cathode exhibited a higher overpotential with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 (LSGM) as the electrolyte, presumably due to the interdiffusion of La3+ and Nd3+ ions across the electrolyte/cathode interface and subsequent formation of ion-blocking phases at the interface.","Nd2-xLaxNiO4+δ, a mixed ionic/electronic conductor with interstitial oxygen, as a cathode material",10.1016/j.ssi.2007.01.013
6,7365,"La1.2N0.8NiO4+delta, on the other hand, provided La isoactivity across the LSGMjcathode interface and therefore an improved performance with the LSGM electrolyte.","Nd2-xLaxNiO4+δ, a mixed ionic/electronic conductor with interstitial oxygen, as a cathode material",10.1016/j.ssi.2007.01.013
7,7365,"Since Nd2-xLaxNiO4+delta contains neither Sr nor Co, as a cathode, it might be compatible with the electrolytes such as yttria-stabilized zirconia without the need of a buffer layer.","Nd2-xLaxNiO4+δ, a mixed ionic/electronic conductor with interstitial oxygen, as a cathode material",10.1016/j.ssi.2007.01.013
