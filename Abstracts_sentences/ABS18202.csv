1,18202,The conventional relations for calculating the fracture stresses consider only elastic deformation but ignore viscoelastic and viscoplastic behaviors.,Advanced analysis of flexural test results of sealant for solid oxide cells,10.1111/ijac.13842
2,18202,Measuring the joining strength of a composite glass sealant-metallic interconnect specimen at solid oxide cell application relevant at high temperatures is a case where such effects can become significant.,Advanced analysis of flexural test results of sealant for solid oxide cells,10.1111/ijac.13842
3,18202,"In the current study, three-point and four-point bending test results were analyzed using the finite element method (FEM) to assess systematic and random errors.",Advanced analysis of flexural test results of sealant for solid oxide cells,10.1111/ijac.13842
4,18202,"It is shown that plastic deformation of the steel interconnect material at high temperature, although having a large effect on the stress distribution in the steel/glass-ceramic/steel specimen, does not cause a significant difference in the FEM-derived true and the standard equation-based analytically derived flexural stress values.",Advanced analysis of flexural test results of sealant for solid oxide cells,10.1111/ijac.13842
5,18202,"It is also observed that even if the viscous flow of the glass-ceramic is considered in the simulations, the samples' behavior in a realistic testing condition is not biased significantly by inelastic behavior due to the short testing time.",Advanced analysis of flexural test results of sealant for solid oxide cells,10.1111/ijac.13842
