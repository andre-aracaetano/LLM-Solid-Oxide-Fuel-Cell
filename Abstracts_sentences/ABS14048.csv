1,14048,Substrate- and thickness-related effects on the oxygen surface exchange of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) thin films were investigated to understand better cathode reactivity in solid oxide fuel cells.,Substrate and Thickness Effects on the Oxygen Surface Exchange of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 Thin Films,10.1021/am300194n
2,14048,Epitaxial (100)-oriented LSM films were fabricated on (100)-SrTiO3 and (110)-NdGaO3 substrates and were characterized using electrical conductivity relaxation.,Substrate and Thickness Effects on the Oxygen Surface Exchange of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 Thin Films,10.1021/am300194n
3,14048,"A strong substrate effect on the chemical surface exchange coefficient (k(chem)) was observed, with a higher k(chem), found for films on SrTiO3 than those on NdGaO3.",Substrate and Thickness Effects on the Oxygen Surface Exchange of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 Thin Films,10.1021/am300194n
4,14048,"Two distinct activation energies (E-a) were observed for k(chem), which were assigned to two parallel exchange processes; the relative contributions from each depended on the substrate, film thickness, and temperature.",Substrate and Thickness Effects on the Oxygen Surface Exchange of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 Thin Films,10.1021/am300194n
5,14048,"For films coherently strained to the substrates, k(chem) values differed by almost an order of magnitude, whereas E-a was similar to 4.5 (+/- 0.1) eV on both substrates.",Substrate and Thickness Effects on the Oxygen Surface Exchange of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 Thin Films,10.1021/am300194n
6,14048,"For relaxed films, k(chem) values differed only by a factor of 2, and E-a was similar to 0.75 (+/- 0.1) eV on both substrates.",Substrate and Thickness Effects on the Oxygen Surface Exchange of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 Thin Films,10.1021/am300194n
7,14048,We discuss the strain effect relative to the native surface exchange and the thickness effect relative to the extended defect populations in the films.,Substrate and Thickness Effects on the Oxygen Surface Exchange of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 Thin Films,10.1021/am300194n
8,14048,The outcome of this study sheds light on how microstructural features affect surface chemistry in modified cathodes.,Substrate and Thickness Effects on the Oxygen Surface Exchange of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 Thin Films,10.1021/am300194n
