7,964,"Results indicate that using functionally graded electrodes with grading index m = 1 significantly improves the fuel cell's performance, with an improvement in power density reaching around 60%.",Performance and thermal stresses in functionally graded anode-supported honeycomb solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.131
8,964,"In addition, the most beneficial improvement is to reduce thermal stresses at elevated temperatures, for which the maximum value of equivalent stress is reduced to 85% less than the conventional electrode at a temperature of 1150 degrees C. Accordingly, the fuel cell's maximum power density can be obtained by operating at elevated temperatures with safe thermal stresses.",Performance and thermal stresses in functionally graded anode-supported honeycomb solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.131
