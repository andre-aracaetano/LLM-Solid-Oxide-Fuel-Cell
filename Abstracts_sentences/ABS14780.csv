1,14780,This study is focused on the electrochemical performance of perovskite-type materials based on doped LaGaO3.,Characteristics and performance of lanthanum gallate electrolyte-supported SOFC under ethanol steam and hydrogen,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.068
2,14780,"La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) and La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.115Co0.085O3-delta (LSGMC) were used as electrolytes and (Pr0.7Ca0.3)(0.9)MnO3 (PCM) and La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.25Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) as cathode and anode material, respectively.",Characteristics and performance of lanthanum gallate electrolyte-supported SOFC under ethanol steam and hydrogen,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.068
3,14780,LSGM and LSGMC electrolytes were prepared by tape casting with a thickness of about 600 mu m.,Characteristics and performance of lanthanum gallate electrolyte-supported SOFC under ethanol steam and hydrogen,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.068
4,14780,"The performance of LSCM/LSGMC/PCM was slightly superior to that obtained on LSCM/LSGM/PCM at different temperatures in both humidified hydrogen and ethanol steam atmospheres, good values of power Output in LSCM/LSGMC/PCM were 182 and 169 mW cm(-2) using humidified hydrogen and ethanol steam as fuel, respectively, and oxygen as oxidant at 850 degrees C. Cell stability tests indicate no significant degradation in performance after 60h of cell testing when LSCM anode was exposed to ethanol steam at 750 degrees C.",Characteristics and performance of lanthanum gallate electrolyte-supported SOFC under ethanol steam and hydrogen,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.068
5,14780,"Almost no carbon deposits were detected after testing in ethanol steam at 750 degrees C for >60 h on the LSCM anodes, Suggesting that carbon deposition was limited during cell operation.",Characteristics and performance of lanthanum gallate electrolyte-supported SOFC under ethanol steam and hydrogen,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.068
