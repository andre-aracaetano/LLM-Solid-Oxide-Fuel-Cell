1,871,"A precursor of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-alpha electrolyte was synthesized by the sol-gel method and sintered at 1400 similar to 1500 degreesC, which was 150 similar to 250 degreesC lower than that used by traditional high temperature solid state reaction.",Synthesis and electrical properties of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-α,
2,871,"Using the sintered samples as solid electrolyte and porous platinum as electr odes, hydrogen and oxygen concentration cells as well as hydrogen-air fuel cells were constructed.",Synthesis and electrical properties of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-α,
3,871,Proton and oxide-ion transport numbers as well as fuel cell peformance of the BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-alpha sinter were compared with the corresponding values of the BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-alpha prepared by high temperature solid state reaction.,Synthesis and electrical properties of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-α,
4,871,The results indicated that the proton transport number and fuel cell performance of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-alpha synthesized by sol-gel method could be obviously affected by sintering temperature.,Synthesis and electrical properties of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-α,
5,871,"When the sintering temperature wasgreater than or equal to 1450 degreesC, the proton transport number was approximately 1 and the fuel cell performance was good.",Synthesis and electrical properties of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-α,
6,871,"However, when the sintering temperature was < 1450 degreesC, the proton transport number was smaller than I and the fuel cell performance was poor.",Synthesis and electrical properties of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-α,
7,871,"Among the samples sintered at 1400 similar to 1500 degreesC, the sample sintered at 1450 degreesC exhibited the optimal fuel cell performance, which was close to that of the sample prepared by high temperature solid state reaction.",Synthesis and electrical properties of BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-α,
