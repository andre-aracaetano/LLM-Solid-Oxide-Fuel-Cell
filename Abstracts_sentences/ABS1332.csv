4,1332,"In evaluating the co-generating SOFC, the methane-coupling design was compared to two other possible competing designs, namely, a regular SOFC plant (complete oxidation of methane to CO(2) and H(2)O) and an SOFC plant coproducing synthesis gas.",Technical and Economic Evaluation of a Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1007/BF02390215
5,1332,It was found that the rate of return for the regular fuel cell exceeded 25% whereas that for the ethylene plant was about 21%.,Technical and Economic Evaluation of a Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1007/BF02390215
6,1332,The synthesis gas plant was well behind at about 17%.,Technical and Economic Evaluation of a Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1007/BF02390215
