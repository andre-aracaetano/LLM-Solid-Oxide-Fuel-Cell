1,16392,"La0.7-xPrxCa0.3MnO3 (LPCM) perovskites previously synthesized by the microwave-assisted method at 4 min and with different stoichiometry (x = 0.35, 0.52 and 0.63) were evaluated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), electrical conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer- Emmet- Teller (BET) analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as an electrolyte.",Microwave irradiation synthesis to obtain La0.7-xPrxCa0.3MnO3 perovskites: Electrical and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.156882
2,16392,The results are discussed in terms of the potential as cathode material to be applied in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) applications at temperatures from 600 to 800 degrees C. Results derived from TGA showed that Pr promotes the uncoupling oxygen and oxygen vacancies favoring the fuel combusting.,Microwave irradiation synthesis to obtain La0.7-xPrxCa0.3MnO3 perovskites: Electrical and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.156882
