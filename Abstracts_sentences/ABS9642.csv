1,9642,"To enhance the power density of a solid oxide fuel cell, a mesoscale-structure control of an electrode/electrolyte interface was proposed; here, the mesoscale means a size range of 10-100 mu m, which is larger than the microscale of the electrode particles but smaller than the macroscale of the cell geometries.",Mesoscale-structure control at anode/electrolyte interface in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.025
2,9642,"Therefore, the mesoscale structure does not only change the local thickness of the electrolyte and electrode but also enlarge the electrode/electrolyte interface area, and thus influence the cell performance.",Mesoscale-structure control at anode/electrolyte interface in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.025
3,9642,"First, to find effective conditions for the mesoscale-structure control, a preliminary theoretical analysis in a conventional flat cell was performed focusing on the ratio of the ion-conducting resistance to the reaction resistance.",Mesoscale-structure control at anode/electrolyte interface in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.025
4,9642,"In the light of this basic knowledge, as a second step, the effects of the mesoscale structure on an anode side of an electrolyte-supported cell were studied numerically and experimentally.",Mesoscale-structure control at anode/electrolyte interface in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.025
5,9642,A 2D numerical simulation based on an equivalent electrical circuit model and the dusty-gas model was carried out.,Mesoscale-structure control at anode/electrolyte interface in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.025
6,9642,"As a result, the mesoscale-grooved structure was found to be effective for enhancement of the power generation, if the groove scale is sufficiently larger than that of the active reaction region of the electrode.",Mesoscale-structure control at anode/electrolyte interface in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.025
7,9642,Qualitatively similar results were obtained from the experiments using a segmented electrode with both flat and mesoscale-grooved surface in a button-type cell.,Mesoscale-structure control at anode/electrolyte interface in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.025
