2,8070,The charge state of lanthanide ions remained at 3+ and the binding energies of the lanthanide ions in Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d) were located in a relatively lower range compared to those of conventional lanthanide oxides.,"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study of direct reforming catalysts Ln0.5Sr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.5O3±d (Ln = La, Nd, and Sm) for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.01.014
3,8070,Mn and Ti were regarded as charge compensation components in Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d); Mn was more influential than Ti.,"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study of direct reforming catalysts Ln0.5Sr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.5O3±d (Ln = La, Nd, and Sm) for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.01.014
4,8070,"In the cases of substituting Nd and Sm into Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d), some portion of Ti showed metallic behavior; the specific Mn satellite peak indicating an electro-catalytic effect had occurred.","X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study of direct reforming catalysts Ln0.5Sr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.5O3±d (Ln = La, Nd, and Sm) for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.01.014
5,8070,"Three types of oxygen species comprised of lattice oxygen, carbonate species, and adsorbed oxygen species were observed in Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3 +/- d) from the 0 is spectra; a high portion of lattice oxygen was observed in both Nd0.5Sr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.5O3 +/- d (NSTM) and Sm0.5Sr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.5O3 +/- d (SSTM).","X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study of direct reforming catalysts Ln0.5Sr0.5Ti0.5Mn0.5O3±d (Ln = La, Nd, and Sm) for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.01.014
