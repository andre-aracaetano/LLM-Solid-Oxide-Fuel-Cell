2,18693,GDC thin films were grown by evaporating (Ce0.9Gd0.1)O-1.95 ceramic powder.,Microstructure of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films formed by electron beam deposition,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.04.223
3,18693,Operating technical parameters that influence thin film microstructure and crystallite size were studied.,Microstructure of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films formed by electron beam deposition,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.04.223
4,18693,The GDC thin films were deposited on two different types of substrates: porous nickel oxide-yttrium stabilized zirconium (NiO-YSZ) and Alloy 600 (Fe-Ni-Cr).,Microstructure of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films formed by electron beam deposition,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.04.223
5,18693,The influence of electron gun power on thin film (2-5 mu m of thickness) structure and surface morphology were investigated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.,Microstructure of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films formed by electron beam deposition,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.04.223
6,18693,It was found that electron gun power (changed in the range of 0.66-1.05 kW) has the influence on the crystallite size (it varied between 9.8 and 20.9 nm) of GDC thin films and decreased linearly increasing e-beam gun power.,Microstructure of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films formed by electron beam deposition,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.04.223
7,18693,"Also, it was found that a bias voltage applied to the substrate during the deposition of thin films has an influence on the densification and crystallite size of GDC layers.",Microstructure of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films formed by electron beam deposition,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.04.223
