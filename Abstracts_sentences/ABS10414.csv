1,10414,"Perovskite (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O-3 (BSCF) cathodes are highly electrochemically active in the oxygen reduction process for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).","Prevention of Reaction between (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 Cathodes and Yttria-stabilized Zirconica Electrolytes for Intermediate-temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.092
2,10414,"However, the phase of perovskite zirconate is formed between the BSCF cathode and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, which increased the cathode polarization resistance.","Prevention of Reaction between (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 Cathodes and Yttria-stabilized Zirconica Electrolytes for Intermediate-temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.092
3,10414,"In the present work, the (Ba, Sr)ZrO3 formation was not prevented by the insertion of a porous gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) interlayer between the cathode and the electrolyte, when the BSCF cathode was sintered at 1100 degrees C. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed that the product of (Ba, Sr)ZrO3 formed between BSCF and YSZ was thicker than that of SrZrO3 formed between a conventional (La, Sr)(Co, Fe)O-3 (LSCF) and YSZ.","Prevention of Reaction between (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 Cathodes and Yttria-stabilized Zirconica Electrolytes for Intermediate-temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.092
4,10414,"When a BSCF cathode was sintered at 900 degrees C, no (Ba,Sr)ZrO3 formation was observed between the cathode and the electrolyte.","Prevention of Reaction between (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 Cathodes and Yttria-stabilized Zirconica Electrolytes for Intermediate-temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.092
5,10414,The maximum power density at 650 degrees C was improved from 7.5 to 740 mW/cm(2) by decreasing the sintering temperature of BSCF cathode from 1100 degrees C to 900 degrees C. Distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis showed that the polarization resistance of the oxygen exchange process in the BSCF cathode sintered at 900 degrees C was lower than that in the LSCF cathode.,"Prevention of Reaction between (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 Cathodes and Yttria-stabilized Zirconica Electrolytes for Intermediate-temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.092
