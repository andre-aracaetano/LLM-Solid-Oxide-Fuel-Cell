3,14057,"Current-voltage characteristics for the methanol-based fuel are comparable to those for the simulated reformed gas at 1000degreesC because of fast kinetics for thermal decomposition of methanol with H2O. With increasing carbon number of alcohols and/or with decreasing operational temperature of SOFCs, a decrease in cell voltage is observed associated with slower decomposition and/or reforming kinetics of alcohols.",Direct-alcohol SOFCs: Current-voltage characteristics and fuel gas compositions,10.1149/1.1756884
