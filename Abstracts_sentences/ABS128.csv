1,128,The development of a detailed thermodynamic model of a fuel cell is presented.,Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles. Part 1: fuel cell thermodynamic modelling,10.1243/09576500260049043
2,128,This model predicts the performance of a gas turbine and fuel cell systems integrated together in hybrid power generation cycles.,Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles. Part 1: fuel cell thermodynamic modelling,10.1243/09576500260049043
3,128,"The achievement of this goal involved the independent modelling of each component (prereformer, internal reformer, active area, combustion zone and fuel preheating) using numerical methods in the form normally required by cycle calculations used in gas turbine design.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles. Part 1: fuel cell thermodynamic modelling,10.1243/09576500260049043
4,128,"The fuel cell model was based on the principle of operation of the Westinghouse tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) design, involving internal reforming and prereforming of methane.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles. Part 1: fuel cell thermodynamic modelling,10.1243/09576500260049043
5,128,"Its performance was examined under a wide range of operating conditions leading to exhaust temperatures in the range 370-935 degreesC. Fuel cell system efficiencies as high as 56 per cent were predicted at low current densities (150 mA/cm(2)), while the efficiency dropped to 38.7 per cent at high current densities (600 mA/cm2) owing to the irreversibilities developed.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles. Part 1: fuel cell thermodynamic modelling,10.1243/09576500260049043
6,128,"Pressurized operation of the fuel cell was assessed in the range 1-25 atm; high-pressure operation leads to an increased power output, particularly at high current densities, but it also produces a significant decrease in electrical efficiency (from 55 to 37 per cent).",Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles. Part 1: fuel cell thermodynamic modelling,10.1243/09576500260049043
7,128,"Pressurized operation should only be contemplated when the fuel cell is integrated with a gas turbine, as shown in Part 2 of this paper, where the hybrid configuration will be shown to give an impressive 76.4 per cent maximum electrical efficiency.",Integration of solid oxide fuel cells into gas turbine power generation cycles.
