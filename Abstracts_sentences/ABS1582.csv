4,1582,"As a result, Pr0.7Ba0.3Co0.6Fe0.2Ni0.2O3-delta (PBCFN2) shows better ORR activity with lower polarization resistance (0.043 Omega cm(2)) and higher power output (1.61 W cm(-2)) for H-SOFC at 700 degrees C. Meanwhile, PBCFN2 also shows suitable durability at 600 degrees C (0.919 A cm(-2) for similar to 105 h).",Pr0.7Ba0.3Co0.8-xFe0.2NixO3-δ perovskite: High activity and durable cathode for intermediate-to-low-temperature proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.115
