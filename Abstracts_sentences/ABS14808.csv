2,14808,"The Cr deposition and poisoning on BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta(BZCY) proton conducting electrolyte are initially studied, in order to understand and develop the compatibility for proton conducting SOFC (H-SOFCs).",The effect of Cr deposition and poisoning on BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ proton conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.009
3,14808,"The XRD results imply that Cr2O3 is not chemically compatible with BZCY and BaCrO4 is formed at high temperature above 600 degrees C. To simulate the Cr volatilization from interconnect and poisoning on BZCY surface, the BZCY bar sample is heat-treated in the presence of Cr2O3 at 600 degrees C, 700 degrees C, and 800 degrees C for 50 h.",The effect of Cr deposition and poisoning on BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ proton conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.009
