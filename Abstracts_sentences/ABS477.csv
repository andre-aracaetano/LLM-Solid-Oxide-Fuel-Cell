4,477,"Although pure methane did reduce the nickel oxide, it also resulted in severe carbon coking over the anode and serious distortion of the fuel cell.",Initialization of a methane-fueled single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell with NiO plus SDC anode and BSCF plus SDC cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.030
5,477,"In situ initialization by hydrogen led to simultaneous reduction of both the anode and cathode; however, the cell still delivered a maximum power density of similar to 350 mW cm(-2), attributed to the re-formation of the BSCF phase under the methane-air atmosphere at high temperatures.",Initialization of a methane-fueled single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell with NiO plus SDC anode and BSCF plus SDC cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.030
