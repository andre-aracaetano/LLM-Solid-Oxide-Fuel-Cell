1,5953,Nickel (Ni) -gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) is one of the promising anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Operando observation of patterned nickel-gadolinium doped ceria solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230670
2,5953,"However, they are not as stable as Ni -yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anodes at reducing atmosphere, since both Ni and GDC migrate and porous microstructure changes.",Operando observation of patterned nickel-gadolinium doped ceria solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230670
3,5953,The degradation behavior of the Ni-GDC anode is thus more complex than that of Ni-YSZ.,Operando observation of patterned nickel-gadolinium doped ceria solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230670
4,5953,"In the present study, novel operando observations of the morphological changes of patterned Ni on a GDC substrate as well as conventional ex-situ measurements are conducted under SOFC operation.",Operando observation of patterned nickel-gadolinium doped ceria solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230670
5,5953,"Both Ni and GDC moved dynamically in the range of several tens of microns during 51 h operation, where the three phase boundary (TPB) length dynamically changed during the operation.",Operando observation of patterned nickel-gadolinium doped ceria solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230670
6,5953,"Nano-size GDC particles appeared on the Ni surface and the GDC surface was strongly roughened, which were the distinctive morphological changes of the patterned Ni-GDC anode.",Operando observation of patterned nickel-gadolinium doped ceria solid oxide fuel cell anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230670
