1,18136,The exceptional oxide ionic conductivity of the high-temperature phase of bismuth oxide gives rise to a characteristic quasielastic broadening of its neutron scattering spectrum.,Liquid-like Ionic Diffusion in Solid Bismuth Oxide Revealed by Coherent Quasielastic Neutron Scattering,10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02374
2,18136,We show that the oscillating form of this broadening can be fit using a modified version of a jump diffusion model previously reserved for liquid ionic conductors.,Liquid-like Ionic Diffusion in Solid Bismuth Oxide Revealed by Coherent Quasielastic Neutron Scattering,10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02374
3,18136,Fit parameters include a quantitative jump distance and a semiquantitative diffusion coefficient.,Liquid-like Ionic Diffusion in Solid Bismuth Oxide Revealed by Coherent Quasielastic Neutron Scattering,10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02374
4,18136,"In the case presented here, the results show that diffusion is isotropic (liquid-like) even though some directions present shorter oxygen vacancy distances, an insight corroborated by computational dynamics simulations.",Liquid-like Ionic Diffusion in Solid Bismuth Oxide Revealed by Coherent Quasielastic Neutron Scattering,10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02374
5,18136,"More broadly, the results show for the first time that quasielastic neutron scattering can be directly analyzed to yield quantitative insights into the atomic-scale mechanisms of solid-state ionic conduction, even when the diffusing species is a coherent neutron scatterer such as oxygen.",Liquid-like Ionic Diffusion in Solid Bismuth Oxide Revealed by Coherent Quasielastic Neutron Scattering,10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02374
6,18136,"This shows its power as a tool for studying functional solid-state materials, notably for solid-oxide fuel cells and, potentially, lithium-ion batteries.",Liquid-like Ionic Diffusion in Solid Bismuth Oxide Revealed by Coherent Quasielastic Neutron Scattering,10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02374
