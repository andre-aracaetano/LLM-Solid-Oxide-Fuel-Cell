1,13416,"In this study, Ni-CGO anodes hollow fibre with controlled asymmetric structures, i.e. adjustable ratios between thickness of the outer sponge-like and the inner finger-like layers, have been developed for intermediate temperature micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), using a combined phase inversion/sintering technique followed by a post-reduction process.",Morphological studies of macrostructure of Ni-CGO anode hollow fibres for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2010.05.040
2,13416,"The control over the asymmetric structure is achieved by employing ethanol as a non-solvent to adjust the initial properties of the spinning suspensions, which affects the phase inversion process and results in a series of asymmetric structures from very thin sponge-like layer supported on considerably thicker finger-like layer (0 wt.% ethanol), to the one consisting of nearly a full sponge-like structure (35 wt.% ethanol).",Morphological studies of macrostructure of Ni-CGO anode hollow fibres for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2010.05.040
3,13416,The characteristic of the anode hollow fibre is found significantly affected by such changes in asymmetric structures.,Morphological studies of macrostructure of Ni-CGO anode hollow fibres for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2010.05.040
4,13416,"For example, the experimental results show that the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity increase up to 241 MPa and 11,2465 cm(-1), respectively, but with high resistance for the fuel transport for a full sponge-like structure of the fibres prepared with 35 wt.% of ethanol.",Morphological studies of macrostructure of Ni-CGO anode hollow fibres for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2010.05.040
