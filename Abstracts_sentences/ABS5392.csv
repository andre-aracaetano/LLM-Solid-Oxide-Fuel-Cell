3,5392,"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and oxygen temperature-programmed desorption characterizations show that Zn-doped La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 exhibits notably high surface oxygen, causing higher catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than that of nondoped La0.9Sr0.1CoO3.","Effect of Fe, Ni and Zn dopants in La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 on the electrochemical performance of single-component solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.116
4,5392,"Fe or Ni doping into La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 decreases surface oxygen, resulting in a lower catalytic activity toward ORR than La0.9Sr0.1CoO3.","Effect of Fe, Ni and Zn dopants in La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 on the electrochemical performance of single-component solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.116
5,5392,"Furthermore, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations prove that after reduction, Fe-doped La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 is reduced to Co0.72Fe0.28 alloy-oxide core-shell nanoparticles, resulting in a high catalytic activity for hydrogen oxygen reaction (HOR).","Effect of Fe, Ni and Zn dopants in La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 on the electrochemical performance of single-component solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.116
6,5392,"However, NiCo2O4 are formed during the reduction of Ni-doped La0.9Sr0.1CoO3, exhibiting a low catalytic activity for the HOR.","Effect of Fe, Ni and Zn dopants in La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 on the electrochemical performance of single-component solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.116
7,5392,"Similarly, the low catalytic activity of reduced Zn-doped La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 for the HOR is caused by the formation of ZnCo2O4.","Effect of Fe, Ni and Zn dopants in La0.9Sr0.1CoO3 on the electrochemical performance of single-component solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.116
