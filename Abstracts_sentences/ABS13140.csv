3,13140,A fabricated two-or three-layer structured anode with a detector layer consisting of 50% Ni and 50% Al2O3 for the two-layer anode or 10% Ni and 90% YSZ for the three-layer anode was used.,Carbon deposition influenced by gas concentration in a Ni/YSZ anode of an internal-reforming solid oxide fuel cell using a detector layer inside the anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232153
4,13140,FE-SEM images of the detector layer in the three-layer structured anode clearly suggest the important roles of electrochemical reactions in suppressing carbon deposition by providing oxygen ions and increasing water concentration inside the anode.,Carbon deposition influenced by gas concentration in a Ni/YSZ anode of an internal-reforming solid oxide fuel cell using a detector layer inside the anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232153
5,13140,"In addition, the observed carbon deposition at the Ni/Al2O3 top detector layer of the two-layer structured electrode indicates that the surface of the electrode is more likely to be the location for carbon deposition than the vicinity of the electrolyte.",Carbon deposition influenced by gas concentration in a Ni/YSZ anode of an internal-reforming solid oxide fuel cell using a detector layer inside the anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232153
