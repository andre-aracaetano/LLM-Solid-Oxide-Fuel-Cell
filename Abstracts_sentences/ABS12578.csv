3,12578,The electrical conductivities of the sintered samples were measured as a function of x in the temperature range 30 to 1000 degrees C.,"Ln(1-x)Sr(x)CoO(3) (Ln=Sm, Dy) for the electrode of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00360-3
4,12578,The highest conductivity of around 500 Slcm at 1000 degrees C was found in Sm0.7Sr0.3CoO3.,"Ln(1-x)Sr(x)CoO(3) (Ln=Sm, Dy) for the electrode of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00360-3
5,12578,"The reactivity of all the samples with YSZ was examined at 800-1000 degrees C for 96 h. The Sr-doped perovskite oxides were more reactive with YSZ and produced SrZrO3 at 900 degrees C after 96 h. However, no reaction product between SmCoO3 and YSZ was observed at 1000 degrees C for 96 h.","Ln(1-x)Sr(x)CoO(3) (Ln=Sm, Dy) for the electrode of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00360-3
