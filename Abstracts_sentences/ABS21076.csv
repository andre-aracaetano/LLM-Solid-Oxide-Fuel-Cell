2,21076,"The ageing studies have been performed on the samples of ZrO2 co-doped with 10 mol% of Sc2O3 and 1 mol% MO2, where M = Ce or Hf (denoted respectively 1Ce10ScSZ and 1Hf10ScSZ) in oxidising and reducing atmospheres, at 600 degrees C for 3000 h. At 600 degrees C, these compositions show initial conductivity of around 9-12 mS-cm(-1) in air.","Conductivity ageing studies on 1M10ScSZ (M4+ = Ce, Hf)",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.02.016
