1,9225,Ni modified Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 (SFM) and La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 (LSCM) anodes have been studied as anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Ni modified ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.103
2,9225,Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results show that Ni promotes the oxidation of H-2 on SFM.,Ni modified ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.103
3,9225,"As a result, a cell with Ni-SFM as the anode, La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3 (LSGM) as the electrolyte, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) as the cathode shows a high peak power density of 1166 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C using H-2 as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant.",Ni modified ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.103
4,9225,Ni modified SFM also shows enhanced performance in CH4 (with 3 vol% H2O).,Ni modified ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.103
5,9225,"Compared with SFM, Ni-SFM anode demonstrates enhanced catalytic activity, resulting in higher open-circuit voltage and lower electrode polarization resistance in CH4.",Ni modified ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.103
6,9225,"However, due to the presence of Ni, the sulfur tolerance of these Ni-modified anodes is still low.",Ni modified ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.103
7,9225,The cell performance drops by almost 18% after the cell with Ni-SFM anode has been operating for 20 h in a fuel of H-2 with 100 ppm H2S at 800 degrees,Ni modified ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.103
8,9225,"C. However, the cell performance can be fully recoverable upon removal of H2S from the fuel stream.",Ni modified ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.103
9,9225,Similar cell performance improvements have also been observed on cells with Ni modified LSCM anodes.,Ni modified ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.103
10,9225,The cells with the Ni-LSCM anodes have shown relatively stable performance during the short-term durability test at 800 degrees C in CH4 at 800 degrees C. (C) 2011,Ni modified ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.103
