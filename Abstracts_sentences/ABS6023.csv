1,6023,One important challenge in the development of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) relates to the development of suitable sealant materials at intermediate temperatures (850 degrees C).,"Chemical compatibility of RO-BaO-SiO2 (R=Mg, Zn) glass-ceramic seals with SOFC components",
2,6023,"The system RO-BaO--SiO2 where R=Mg and Zn offers a promising combination of physicochemical properties, including suitable dilatometric characteristics and sintering/crystallisation behaviour which results in dense materials with the desired microstructure.","Chemical compatibility of RO-BaO-SiO2 (R=Mg, Zn) glass-ceramic seals with SOFC components",
3,6023,"In this work, the chemical stability of these seals versus the cell components, e.g. the electrolyte of yttria stabilised zirconia (8YSZ) and two metallic interconnect materials, FeCralloy and Crofer22, was studied.","Chemical compatibility of RO-BaO-SiO2 (R=Mg, Zn) glass-ceramic seals with SOFC components",
4,6023,The reaction mechanisms and the characteristics of adherence and joining were established in the different cell atmospheres.,"Chemical compatibility of RO-BaO-SiO2 (R=Mg, Zn) glass-ceramic seals with SOFC components",
5,6023,"The long term stability of the seals was evaluated through the effect of the degradation on the materials structure, properties and interfacial reaction products.","Chemical compatibility of RO-BaO-SiO2 (R=Mg, Zn) glass-ceramic seals with SOFC components",
