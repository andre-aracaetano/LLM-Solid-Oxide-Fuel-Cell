1,4205,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are functional electrochemical conversion devices whose performance is strongly dependent on electrode microstructure.,3D imaging and quantification of interfaces in SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.05.003
2,4205,Both the performance and lifetime of these electrochemical devices can be considerably enhanced by the ability to design better electrodes.,3D imaging and quantification of interfaces in SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.05.003
3,4205,Data acquired from high resolution 3D imaging techniques were used in the quantification of two electrode structures of different compositions.,3D imaging and quantification of interfaces in SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.05.003
4,4205,"The quantified nickel-based anode data through the analysis of particle sizes with their metal metal and ceramic ceramic neck sizes, metal ceramic interface sizes, volume fractions, and triple-phase boundary densities, demonstrate it is possible to understand how microstructure contributes to differences observed in electrochemical and mechanical performance; facilitating optimisation of electrode micro/nano structure towards improved performance.",3D imaging and quantification of interfaces in SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.05.003
