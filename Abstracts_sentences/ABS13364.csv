2,13364,"The Ni anode-supported cell with NCM-83 cathode exhibits maximum power density (Pmax) of 0.72 W cm-2 with H2 fuel at 600 & DEG;C. The symmetric cell with NCM-83 electrodes shows high Pmax of 0.465 W cm-2 with H2 fuel and 0.354 W cm-2 with CH4 fuel at 600 & DEG;C. And the Pmax of the cell with NCM-811 as anode and NCM-83 as cathode is 0.204W cm-2 with H2 fuel at 600 & DEG;C. The oxygen vacancies in NCM materials are conducive to the rapid oxygen ion conduction of the cathode, and in the anodic reduction atmosphere, the NCM materials will generate Ni/Co active particles in situ, proving the NCM materials can be advanced bifunctional electrode materials for hydrogen oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction at low temperature.",Electrochemical performances of LiNiCoMn bifunctional electrode for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.397
