2,2398,A mixture of Ni-Fe alloy and zirconia ceramics as the contact layer were employed to enhance the compatibility of the metal support and the anode (Ni-zirconia).,Electrochemical Performance of the Ni-Fe Based Metal-Support Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Ba-Sr-Co-Fe-O and La-Sr-Mn-O Cathodes,10.3365/KJMM.2022.60.7.523
3,2398,"Common materials, including acceptor-doped zirconia and perovskites (Ba-Sr-Co-Fo-O, La-Sr-Mn-O), were used for the solid electrolyte and cathode of the SOFC.",Electrochemical Performance of the Ni-Fe Based Metal-Support Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Ba-Sr-Co-Fe-O and La-Sr-Mn-O Cathodes,10.3365/KJMM.2022.60.7.523
4,2398,The electrode polarization resistance of the metal-supported SOFC manufactured in this way depended on the resistance between the cathode and electrolyte.,Electrochemical Performance of the Ni-Fe Based Metal-Support Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Ba-Sr-Co-Fe-O and La-Sr-Mn-O Cathodes,10.3365/KJMM.2022.60.7.523
5,2398,"For the SOFC with a Ba-Sr-Co-Fe-O cathode, not only large polarization resistance but also large ohmic resistance occurred due to the formation of an insulator phase on the surface of the solid electrolyte.",Electrochemical Performance of the Ni-Fe Based Metal-Support Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Ba-Sr-Co-Fe-O and La-Sr-Mn-O Cathodes,10.3365/KJMM.2022.60.7.523
