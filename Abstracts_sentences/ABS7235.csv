3,7235,"The work presented here examines experimentally two options for adding steam to the reformer inlet: (I) recycle of a simulated fuel cell anode exit gas (comprised of mainly CO2, H2O, and N-2 and some H-2 and CO) and (II) recycle of the reformate from the reformer exit back to the reformer inlet (mainly comprised of H-2, CO, and N-2, and some H2O and CO2).",Effects of fuel cell anode recycle on catalytic fuel reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.031
4,7235,"As expected, anode gas recycle reduced the carbon formation and increased the hydrogen concentration in the reformate.",Effects of fuel cell anode recycle on catalytic fuel reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.031
5,7235,"However, reformer recycle was not as effective due principally to the lower water content in the reformate compared to the anode gas.",Effects of fuel cell anode recycle on catalytic fuel reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.031
6,7235,"In fact, reformate recycle showed slightly increased carbon formation compared to no recycle.",Effects of fuel cell anode recycle on catalytic fuel reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.031
7,7235,"In an attempt to understand the effects of individual gases in these recycle streams (H-2, CO, CO2, N-2, and H2O), individual gas species were independently introduced to the reformer feed.",Effects of fuel cell anode recycle on catalytic fuel reforming,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.031
