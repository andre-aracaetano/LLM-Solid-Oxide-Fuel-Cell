7,8642,"In contrast, no Ni migration occurred in the Y2O3/YSZ composite porous structure, despite migration occurring in the neighboring smooth YSZ area in the same cell.",Ni migration on porous yttria-stabilized zirconia and yttria-micropatterned fuel electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234720
8,8642,"The Ni-migrated areas were separated by the Y2O3/YSZ porous area, indicating that Ni migration was not caused by microscale differences in temperature or supplied gas diffusion, and Ni moved only on the cell surface, not via Nicontaining gases because temperatures and gases cannot form micropatterns.",Ni migration on porous yttria-stabilized zirconia and yttria-micropatterned fuel electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234720
