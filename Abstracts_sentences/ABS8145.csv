1,8145,"Sealants have been widely used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), and glass sealants have shown considerable potentials due to their low leakage rate.",Feldspar-based CaO-K2O-Na2O-BaO silicate glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.046
2,8145,"We report a type of feldspar-based glass sealant, mainly composed of CaO-K2O-Na2O-BaO, with a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of 10.11 x 10(-6) k(-1), a glass transition temperature at 528 degrees C, and a softening temperature at 573 degrees C. Using this sealant to seal anode-supported SOFCs, the open-circuit voltage (OCV) remains at 1.08 V after five thermal cycles and 50-h aging at 750 degrees C, close to the theoretical OCV value.",Feldspar-based CaO-K2O-Na2O-BaO silicate glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.046
3,8145,"The SEM and EDS reveal stable interface between the glass sealant and the anode, indicating excellent performance of the CaO-K2O-Na2O-BaO glass sealant for SOFC sealing applications.",Feldspar-based CaO-K2O-Na2O-BaO silicate glass sealant for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.046
