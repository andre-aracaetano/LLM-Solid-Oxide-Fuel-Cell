2,20729,"Development of Cr-free, easy-to-manufacture, and low-cost ceramic ICs are, therefore, highly desirable for tubular SOCs.",Dense and Low Oxygen Permeability Bilayer Ceramic Interconnect for Tubular Anode-Support Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsaem.0c02279
3,20729,"Here we report a systematic study on the chemical and physical properties of Cr-free, Y- and Nb-doped SrTiO3-delta (Sr1-xYxTi1-yNbyO3, SYTN, 0 <= x, y <= 0.1) as a ceramic IC.",Dense and Low Oxygen Permeability Bilayer Ceramic Interconnect for Tubular Anode-Support Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsaem.0c02279
4,20729,"While similar systems have been studied in the literature, our study has focused on optimizing SYTN compositions, examining chemical compatibility between SYTN and anode substrate, fabricating bilayer structure, cosintering it with anode substrate, and testing its performance under practical oxidizing-reducing dual atmospheres.",Dense and Low Oxygen Permeability Bilayer Ceramic Interconnect for Tubular Anode-Support Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsaem.0c02279
5,20729,The results show that SYTN(Y0.08Nb0.02) is the best composition as an IC since it exhibits high electrical conductivity and can be cosintered with Ni-YSZ anode substrate into a dense microstructure without any chemical reactions.,Dense and Low Oxygen Permeability Bilayer Ceramic Interconnect for Tubular Anode-Support Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsaem.0c02279
6,20729,"A first-principles theoretical study reveals that Y-and Nb-doping transforms semiconducting SrTiO3 into itinerant large-polarons metal, confirming the high electrical conductivity.",Dense and Low Oxygen Permeability Bilayer Ceramic Interconnect for Tubular Anode-Support Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsaem.0c02279
7,20729,"A bilayer IC consisting of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) top-layer and SYTN(Y0.08Nb0.02) underlayer cosintered on the anode substrate is also demonstrated with dense microstructure, low area specific resistance and negligible oxygen permeability.",Dense and Low Oxygen Permeability Bilayer Ceramic Interconnect for Tubular Anode-Support Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsaem.0c02279
8,20729,"Overall, the cosintered bilayer ceramic IC is a promising candidate for next-generation durable, and low-cost tubular SOCs.",Dense and Low Oxygen Permeability Bilayer Ceramic Interconnect for Tubular Anode-Support Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsaem.0c02279
