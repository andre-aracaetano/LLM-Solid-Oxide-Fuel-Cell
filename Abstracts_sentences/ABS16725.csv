1,16725,Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) is used for the determination of elemental spatial distribution in ceramic multi-layer systems such as those found in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,LA-ICP-MS and EDS characterization of electrode/electrolyte interfaces in IT-SOFC materials,10.1007/s00339-012-7309-4
2,16725,"Because layer sintering occurs at high temperature (usually well over 1000 A degrees C), there may be mutual diffusion of ions from one layer to another, with dramatic consequences on cell performances.",LA-ICP-MS and EDS characterization of electrode/electrolyte interfaces in IT-SOFC materials,10.1007/s00339-012-7309-4
3,16725,"In this work, two model materials have been used to test LA-ICP-MS: La0.83Sr0.17Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.83 (LSGM), one of the most promising electrolytes for IT-SOFCs, and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM), a highly representative perovskite material, which are amply used to design electrode materials.",LA-ICP-MS and EDS characterization of electrode/electrolyte interfaces in IT-SOFC materials,10.1007/s00339-012-7309-4
4,16725,"A two-layer system screen printed onto an LSM pellet (LSM-LSGM-LSM pellet) was successively sintered at a typical processing temperature, i.e. 1300 A degrees C, for a short time (1 h).",LA-ICP-MS and EDS characterization of electrode/electrolyte interfaces in IT-SOFC materials,10.1007/s00339-012-7309-4
5,16725,Elemental spatial distribution was determined by line profile analyses carried out on fracture surfaces; for comparison SEM-EDS line profiles were tested on the same surface.,LA-ICP-MS and EDS characterization of electrode/electrolyte interfaces in IT-SOFC materials,10.1007/s00339-012-7309-4
6,16725,"LA-ICP-MS line profile analysis evidenced that, notwithstanding the relatively low sintering temperature and short firing time (1 h per sintering), manganese cation diffusion into LSGM is relatively abundant, in agreement with previous literature reports and present EDS results.",LA-ICP-MS and EDS characterization of electrode/electrolyte interfaces in IT-SOFC materials,10.1007/s00339-012-7309-4
7,16725,"While line scan EDS analyses are not as conclusive for Ga and Mg diffusion, LA-ICP-MS shows that both ions diffuse across both interfaces, and Ga diffuses even over very long distances into the LSM pellet; on the contrary, only trace amounts of Mg can be found far from the LSGM/LSM interface.",LA-ICP-MS and EDS characterization of electrode/electrolyte interfaces in IT-SOFC materials,10.1007/s00339-012-7309-4
