1,9255,Layered perovskite oxide GdBaCuCoO5+delta (GBCC) was investigated as a cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Layered Perovskite GdBaCuCoO5+δ Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3321725
2,9255,The GBCC cathode was chemically compatible with the electrolytes La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) and Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) at temperatures below 950 degrees C.,Layered Perovskite GdBaCuCoO5+δ Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3321725
3,9255,"Compared with LaBaCuCoO5+delta (LBCC) cathode, the electrical conductivity behaviors of GBCC and LBCC were quite distinct from each other in the studied temperature range due to the different electronic configurations of the rare-earth cations.",Layered Perovskite GdBaCuCoO5+δ Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3321725
4,9255,The GBCC sample exhibited a semiconductor-like behavior.,Layered Perovskite GdBaCuCoO5+δ Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3321725
5,9255,"For the LBCC sample, however, there was a transition of the electrical conductivity behavior from semiconductor-like to metal-like for temperatures higher than 475 degrees C.",Layered Perovskite GdBaCuCoO5+δ Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3321725
6,9255,"The thermal expansion coefficient of samples significantly decreased from 18.3x10(-6) K-1 for LBCC to 15.1x10(-6) K-1 for GBCC in the temperature range of 30-850 degrees C, although the area specific resistance (ASR) increased.",Layered Perovskite GdBaCuCoO5+δ Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3321725
7,9255,"The ASRs of the GBCC cathode on the LSGM and SDC electrolytes were 0.091 and 0.129 cm(2) at 750 degrees C, respectively.",Layered Perovskite GdBaCuCoO5+δ Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3321725
