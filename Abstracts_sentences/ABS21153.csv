2,21153,"On the basis of magnetic susceptibility measurements, the Pr4+/Pr3+ molar ratio of several oxides annealed at T = 700 degrees C under air was determined; the higher the Zr content, the lower the Pr4+ concentration.","Tuning the Pr Valence State To Design High Oxygen Mobility, Redox and Transport Properties in the CeO2-ZrO2-PrOx Phase Diagram",10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11469

4,21153,"The Pr4+ reduction starts at T = 250 degrees C and is maximum around T = 400 degrees C. For the most reducible compositions, which exhibit the lowest Zr content and the highest Pr rate, the reduction phenomena strongly depend on the Pr/Ce molar ratio.","Tuning the Pr Valence State To Design High Oxygen Mobility, Redox and Transport Properties in the CeO2-ZrO2-PrOx Phase Diagram",10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11469
5,21153,"As a remarkable result, Pr and Ce reductions can simultaneously take place at lower temperature (T > 430 degrees C) than for oxides of the CeO2-ZrO2 solid solution evidencing that the increase of Pr content also allows enhancing the reducibility of Ce4+ at low temperature.","Tuning the Pr Valence State To Design High Oxygen Mobility, Redox and Transport Properties in the CeO2-ZrO2-PrOx Phase Diagram",10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11469
6,21153,"On the basis of a discussion taking into account the probability of oxygen surroundings in disordered fluorite networks and the rate of oxygen released in materials after the first reduction step performed at T < 500 degrees C, a mapping of the most probable labile oxygen sites in the CZP phase diagram is proposed.","Tuning the Pr Valence State To Design High Oxygen Mobility, Redox and Transport Properties in the CeO2-ZrO2-PrOx Phase Diagram",10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11469
7,21153,"In particular, it is shown that for the oxides containing 10 atom % Zr, the most labile oxygen site should be systematically coordinated with one Zr atom, one Ce, and two Pr atoms.","Tuning the Pr Valence State To Design High Oxygen Mobility, Redox and Transport Properties in the CeO2-ZrO2-PrOx Phase Diagram",10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11469
8,21153,"In the same series (10 atom % Zr), the electronic transport properties allowed showing semiconducting behavior with a strong increase of the total conductivity as the Pr content increases.","Tuning the Pr Valence State To Design High Oxygen Mobility, Redox and Transport Properties in the CeO2-ZrO2-PrOx Phase Diagram",10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11469
9,21153,"On the basis of the thermal variation of the Seebeck coefficient, these phenomena are associated with hopping of electrons and holes, involving intra-atomic charge transfers, which depend on the reduction temperature of Pr4+ ions under air.","Tuning the Pr Valence State To Design High Oxygen Mobility, Redox and Transport Properties in the CeO2-ZrO2-PrOx Phase Diagram",10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11469
10,21153,"Finally, the oxygen mobility strongly increases with the Pr content in this series.","Tuning the Pr Valence State To Design High Oxygen Mobility, Redox and Transport Properties in the CeO2-ZrO2-PrOx Phase Diagram",10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11469
