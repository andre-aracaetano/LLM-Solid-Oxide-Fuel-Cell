1,554,"Sc ions are doped at the Mn site in the ABO(3)-type perovskite La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-delta (LSM), while the investigation from the density functional theory calculations makes the guidance that the doping of Sc into LSM could be beneficial for its application in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs) with decreased oxygen formation energy and hydration energy as well as improved oxygen reduction reaction ability.",A new Sc-doped La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-d cathode allows high performance for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e00409
2,554,"The subsequent experimental studies indicate that the Sc-doped LSM (LSMSc) could greatly boost its performance in H-SOFCs, leading to a high fuel cell output of 1221 mW cm(-2) at 700 ?, which is about 75% higher than that of the cell using Sc-free LSM cathode.",A new Sc-doped La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-d cathode allows high performance for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e00409
3,554,This fuel cell performance is also a record-high performance for LSM-based H-SOFCs compared with the literature reports.,A new Sc-doped La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-d cathode allows high performance for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e00409
4,554,"Furthermore, the good fuel cell performance is compatible with the excellent chemical stability of the material.",A new Sc-doped La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-d cathode allows high performance for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e00409
5,554,"The LSMSc material shows excellent stability against CO2 and H2O, allowing its stable operation in the fuel cell condition.",A new Sc-doped La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-d cathode allows high performance for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e00409
