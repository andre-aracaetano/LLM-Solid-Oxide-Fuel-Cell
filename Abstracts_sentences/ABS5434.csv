1,5434,"A low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell with a La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) modified interface between the Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) electrolyte and the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF)-GDC composite cathode was fabricated and showed lower ohmic resistance, lower polarization resistance, and higher exchange current densities than the unmodified cell.",Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell with a La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-modified cathode/electrolyte interface,10.1149/1.2823261
2,5434,"The higher power densities on the LSM-modified cell than the unmodified BSCF cell, especially at lower temperatures, are attributed to an improved electrode/electrolyte contact through high-temperature sintering and an enhancement of catalytic activity through the mutual diffusion of elements between LSM and BSCF during firing of the BSCF cathode.",Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell with a La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-modified cathode/electrolyte interface,10.1149/1.2823261
