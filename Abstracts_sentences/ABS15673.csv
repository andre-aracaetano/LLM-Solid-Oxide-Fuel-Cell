1,15673,A novel SOFC system control strategy has been developed for rapid load following.,Novel solid oxide fuel cell system controller for rapid load following,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.092
2,15673,The strategy was motivated from the performance of a baseline control strategy developed from control concepts in the literature.,Novel solid oxide fuel cell system controller for rapid load following,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.092
3,15673,The basis for the fuel cell system control concepts are explained by a simplified order of magnitude time scale analysis.,Novel solid oxide fuel cell system controller for rapid load following,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.092
4,15673,"The control concepts are then investigated in a detailed quasi-two-dimensional integrated dynamic system model that resolves the physics of heat transfer, chemical kinetics, mass convection and electrochemistry within the system.",Novel solid oxide fuel cell system controller for rapid load following,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.092
5,15673,The baseline control strategy is based on the standard operating method of constant utilization with no control of the combustor temperature.,Novel solid oxide fuel cell system controller for rapid load following,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.092
6,15673,Simulation indicates that with this control strategy large combustor transients can take place during load transients because the fuel flow to the combustor increases faster than the air flow.,Novel solid oxide fuel cell system controller for rapid load following,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.092
7,15673,"To alleviate this problem, a novel control structure that maintains the combustor temperature within acceptable ranges without any supplementary hardware was introduced.",Novel solid oxide fuel cell system controller for rapid load following,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.092
8,15673,The combustor temperature is controlled by manipulating the current to change the combustor inlet stoichiometry.,Novel solid oxide fuel cell system controller for rapid load following,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.092
9,15673,The load following capability of SOFC systems is inherently limited by anode compartment fuel depletion during the time of fuel delivery delay.,Novel solid oxide fuel cell system controller for rapid load following,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.092
10,15673,This research indicates that future SOFC systems with proper system and control configurations can exhibit excellent load following characteristics.,Novel solid oxide fuel cell system controller for rapid load following,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.092
