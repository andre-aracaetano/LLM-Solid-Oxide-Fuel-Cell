1,19626,"The biomass based power plants, especially those with the carbon capture unit, usually suffer the issue of low electric efficiency, which is adverse to their commercial application.","Energy, exergy and economic analyses of a novel biomass fueled power plant with carbon capture and sequestration",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.015
2,19626,"As one approach to solving this issue, a novel biomass fueled power plant with carbon capture and sequestration (BFP-CCS) is proposed in this work.","Energy, exergy and economic analyses of a novel biomass fueled power plant with carbon capture and sequestration",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.015
3,19626,The BFP-CCS subunit models are first validated before the integrated model of BFP-CCS is built.,"Energy, exergy and economic analyses of a novel biomass fueled power plant with carbon capture and sequestration",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.015
4,19626,"Then, the BFP-CCS characteristics are analyzed in terms of energy, exergy and economics, and the optimum operation condition of BFP-CCS is determined.","Energy, exergy and economic analyses of a novel biomass fueled power plant with carbon capture and sequestration",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.015
5,19626,"Based on this research, it is found that BFP-CCS performs best at the H2O/Mn2O3 mass ratio of 1.6, the H2O/O-2 molar ratio of 2.8, the O-2/biomass mass ratio of 022 and the fuel utilization factor of 0.65.","Energy, exergy and economic analyses of a novel biomass fueled power plant with carbon capture and sequestration",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.015
6,19626,"The corresponding net efficiency, the life cycle CO2 emission and the levelized cost of electricity of BFP-CCS are 51.7%, $0.0501 /kWh and -0.591 kg/kWh, respectively.","Energy, exergy and economic analyses of a novel biomass fueled power plant with carbon capture and sequestration",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.015
7,19626,"The biggest contributors of the energy and exergy losses are the steam turbine and the solid oxide fuel cell in BFP-CCS, respectively.","Energy, exergy and economic analyses of a novel biomass fueled power plant with carbon capture and sequestration",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.015
