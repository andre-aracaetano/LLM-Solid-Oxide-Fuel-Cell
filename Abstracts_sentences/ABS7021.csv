2,7021,"Inconel, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3, and La0.6Sr0.4CrO3 (LSCr) were used as the coating material.",Oxidation-resistant thin film coating on ferritic stainless steel by sputtering for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2008.02.045
3,7021,Each material was thinly coated on SS430 by using a radio frequency magnetron sputtering method.,Oxidation-resistant thin film coating on ferritic stainless steel by sputtering for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2008.02.045
4,7021,"LSCr-coated SS430 showed the lowest electrical resistance, reducing the resistance to 1/3 of the uncoated SS430.",Oxidation-resistant thin film coating on ferritic stainless steel by sputtering for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2008.02.045
5,7021,Long-term durability test performed at 700 degrees C for 1000 h showed that the LSCr layer also reduced the oxidation rate because the LSCr perovskite was formed and maintained throughout the measurement.,Oxidation-resistant thin film coating on ferritic stainless steel by sputtering for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2008.02.045
6,7021,This was verified by X-ray diffraction analysis.,Oxidation-resistant thin film coating on ferritic stainless steel by sputtering for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2008.02.045
7,7021,"On the other hand, the uncoated SS430 formed spinel structures, such as Mn3-xCrxO4, at the surface.",Oxidation-resistant thin film coating on ferritic stainless steel by sputtering for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2008.02.045
8,7021,Oxidative properties of the uncoated SS430 were inferior to the coated SS430 metals because the spinel structure has a relatively high oxidation rate and low electrical conductivity.,Oxidation-resistant thin film coating on ferritic stainless steel by sputtering for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2008.02.045
