1,10674,"An 8 nm-thick gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) layer was inserted as a cathodic interlayer between the nanoscale proton-conducting yttrium-doped barium zirconate (BZY) electrolyte and the porous platinum cathode of a micro-solid oxide fuel cell (mu-SOFC), which has effectively improved the cathode reaction kinetics and rendered high cell power density.",Proton-conducting Micro-solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Improved Cathode Reactions by a Nanoscale Thin Film Gadolinium-doped Ceria Interlayer,10.1038/srep22369
2,10674,The addition of the GDC interlayer significantly reduced the cathodic activation loss and increased the peak power density of the mu-SOFC by 33% at 400 degrees C.,Proton-conducting Micro-solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Improved Cathode Reactions by a Nanoscale Thin Film Gadolinium-doped Ceria Interlayer,10.1038/srep22369
3,10674,"The peak power density reached 445 mW/cm(2) at 425 degrees C, which is the highest among the reported mu-SOFCs using proton-conducting electrolytes.",Proton-conducting Micro-solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Improved Cathode Reactions by a Nanoscale Thin Film Gadolinium-doped Ceria Interlayer,10.1038/srep22369
4,10674,"The impressive performance was attributed to the mixed protonic and oxygen ionic conducting properties of the nano-granular GDC, and also to the high densities of grain boundaries and lattice defects in GDC interlayer that favored the oxygen incorporation and transportation during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the water evolution reaction at cathode.",Proton-conducting Micro-solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Improved Cathode Reactions by a Nanoscale Thin Film Gadolinium-doped Ceria Interlayer,10.1038/srep22369
