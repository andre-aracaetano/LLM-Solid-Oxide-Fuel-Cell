1,12333,"A two-dimensional transient simulation model for a cascaded (10 cascades) micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a common microtubular SOFC with a preheater tub was developed to calculate the distribution of gas species, the local current, voltage and temperature.",Two-dimensional transient model of a cascaded micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell fed with methane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.077
2,12333,The goal was to compare these two different SOFC designs under steady state and load change conditions with respect to power density.,Two-dimensional transient model of a cascaded micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell fed with methane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.077
3,12333,Steady state simulation results have shown that the cascaded cell concept is able to operate at higher average cell voltages in principle.,Two-dimensional transient model of a cascaded micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell fed with methane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.077
4,12333,Compared to the cascaded cell concept the average ohmic anodic and cathodic resistance of the common cell has to be 84 times lower to reach the same average power density at an average voltage of 0.7 V. The cascaded cell concept gives the opportunity to operate at a higher average voltage than the lowest Nernst voltage offers.,Two-dimensional transient model of a cascaded micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell fed with methane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.077
