1,3362,"A green BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY) electrolyte layer was deposited on porous anode substrate (BZCY:NiO=35:65, in weight ratio) by a suspension spray.",A simple and easy one-step fabrication of thin BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ electrolyte membrane for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2008.07.055
2,3362,"In this process, the suspension was prepared by directly ball-milling the mixed BaCO3, CeO2, ZrO2 and Y2O3 powders in ethanol for 24 h. Then the bilayers were co-sintered at 1400 degrees C for 5 h in air to obtain dense and uniform electrolyte membrane in the thickness of 10 mu m. With Nd0.7Sr0.3MnO3-delta a cathode, a fuel cell was assembled.",A simple and easy one-step fabrication of thin BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ electrolyte membrane for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2008.07.055
