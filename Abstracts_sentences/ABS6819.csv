6,6819,"Pellets were initially formed from powders at 5 MPa, after which they were isostatically pressed at 250 MPa and sintered at 1500 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine the electrical properties of the samples in both air (p(o2) = 0.021 MPa) and Ar-5%H-2 atmospheres.",ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF INDIUM AND YTTRIUM-DOPED BARIUM CERATE-BASED COMPOUNDS FOR USE AS CERAMIC FUEL CELL ELECTROLYTES,10.1515/amm-2015-0247
