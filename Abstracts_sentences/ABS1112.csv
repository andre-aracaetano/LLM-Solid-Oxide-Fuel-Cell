1,1112,Reluctant oxygen-reduction-reaction (ORR) activity has been a long-standing challenge limiting cell performance for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in both centralized and distributed power applications.,Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance with a Nanoparticles-Loaded Cathode,10.1021/nl5043566
2,1112,"We report here that this challenge has been tackled with coloading of (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSM) and Y2O3 stabilized zirconia (YSZ) nanoparticles within a porous YSZ framework.",Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance with a Nanoparticles-Loaded Cathode,10.1021/nl5043566
3,1112,"This design dramatically improves ORR activity, enhances fuel cell output (200-300% power improvement), and enables superior stability (no observed degradation within 500 h of operation) from 600 to 800 degrees C.",Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance with a Nanoparticles-Loaded Cathode,10.1021/nl5043566
4,1112,The improved performance is attributed to the intimate contacts between nanoparticulate YSZ and LSM particles in the three-phase boundaries in the cathode.,Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Performance with a Nanoparticles-Loaded Cathode,10.1021/nl5043566
