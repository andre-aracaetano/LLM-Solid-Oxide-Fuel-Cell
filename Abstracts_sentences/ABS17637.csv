1,17637,Atomistic simulations reveal that the chemical reactivity of ceria nanorods is increased when tensioned and reduced when compressed promising strain-tunable reactivity; the reactivity is determined by calculating the energy required to oxidize CO to CO2 by extracting oxygen from the surface of the nanorod.,Strain and Architecture-Tuned Reactivity in Ceria Nanostructures; Enhanced Catalytic Oxidation of CO to CO2,10.1021/cm3003436

4,17637,"We show the generality of the approach, and its relevance to a variety of important processes and applications, by using the method to help understand: TiO2 nanoparticles (photocatalysis), mesoporous ZnS (semiconductor band gap engineering), MgO (catalysis), CeO2/YSZ interfaces (strained thin films; solid oxide fuel cells/nanoionics), and Li-MnO2 (lithiation induced strain; energy storage).",Strain and Architecture-Tuned Reactivity in Ceria Nanostructures; Enhanced Catalytic Oxidation of CO to CO2,10.1021/cm3003436
