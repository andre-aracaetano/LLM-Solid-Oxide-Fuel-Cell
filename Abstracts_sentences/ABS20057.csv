6,20057,"The dramatic difference in electrical properties of NBT prepared using rutile and anatase TiO2 is related to the NBT formation process: the intermediate phase Bi12TiO20 is more stable during formation of NBT in the case of anatase TiO2, which reduces the volatility of Bi2O3 during solid-state reaction.",Dramatic impact of the TiO2 polymorph on the electrical properties of 'stoichiometric' Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 ceramics prepared by solid-state reaction,10.1039/d1ta09668k
7,20057,These results give plausible explanations for the large variation of sigma(b) reported in the literature and highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate TiO2 reagent when targeting controllable sigma(b) in NBT-based ceramics.,Dramatic impact of the TiO2 polymorph on the electrical properties of 'stoichiometric' Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 ceramics prepared by solid-state reaction,10.1039/d1ta09668k
