1,17730,"Anticipating the practical use of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), we investigated the manufacturing cost of a single cell.",Evaluation of the cost performance of the SOFC cell in the market,10.1016/0360-3199(95)00037-2
2,17730,"We investigated a total of six different types of cell: four Westinghouse-type tubular cells produced by different methods, a support-type planar cell, and a self-support type planar cell.",Evaluation of the cost performance of the SOFC cell in the market,10.1016/0360-3199(95)00037-2
3,17730,"Our cost estimation was made on the assumption that one million cells with an active area of about 400 cm(2) would be manufactured each year, by means of a fully developed mass production technique.",Evaluation of the cost performance of the SOFC cell in the market,10.1016/0360-3199(95)00037-2
4,17730,"The cost estimation has shown that for five cells, excluding the support-type planar cell, the manufacturing costs generally coincide, within the range of estimation error.",Evaluation of the cost performance of the SOFC cell in the market,10.1016/0360-3199(95)00037-2
5,17730,Cost-relevant factors were analyzed.,Evaluation of the cost performance of the SOFC cell in the market,10.1016/0360-3199(95)00037-2
6,17730,"The results revealed that cost is affected most strongly by power density and yield, and that if cells with 0.3 W/cm(2) or higher power densities were produced with yields of 90% or more at each stage, it would be possible to manufacture cells at U.S.$700/kW, the current target cost for practical cells.",Evaluation of the cost performance of the SOFC cell in the market,10.1016/0360-3199(95)00037-2
