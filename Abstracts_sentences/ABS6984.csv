1,6984,The objective of this effort is to explore the substitution of the A-site in an A(2)MgMoO(6) perovskite with Sr and Ba to improve the sulfur tolerance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,"A2MgMoO6 (A = Sr,Ba) for use as sulfur tolerant anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.004
2,6984,Perovskites have demonstrated superior sulfur tolerance but lack the high conductivity and catalytic activity of Ni/YSZ cermets.,"A2MgMoO6 (A = Sr,Ba) for use as sulfur tolerant anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.004
3,6984,"Sr2MgMoO6, a double perovskite, has been suggested as a material of interest because of its relatively high conductivity and catalytic potential.","A2MgMoO6 (A = Sr,Ba) for use as sulfur tolerant anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.004

6,6984,Electrochemical performance of the specimens was performed by pasting the material onto an LSGM disk and stability was measured in sulfurous H-2 (140 ppm H2S).,"A2MgMoO6 (A = Sr,Ba) for use as sulfur tolerant anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.004
7,6984,"Both SMMO and BMMO demonstrated superior stability when exposed to 140 ppm of H2S as compared to Ni/YSZ, but did exhibit performance degradations due to sulfur accumulation in the buffer layer.","A2MgMoO6 (A = Sr,Ba) for use as sulfur tolerant anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.004
