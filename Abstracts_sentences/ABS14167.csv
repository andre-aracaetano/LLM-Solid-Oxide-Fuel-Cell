1,14167,Tubular SOFC have the advantage over planar SOFC of the low temperature sealing and more resistance to thermal shock.,Mini-tubular YSZ based SOFC,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.173
2,14167,On the other hand the volumetric power density of tubular Fuel Cells goes with the inverse of the tube diameter which added to the faster warm-up kinetics makes low diameter tubular SOFC favorable for low power applications.,Mini-tubular YSZ based SOFC,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.173
3,14167,"Anode supported tubular SOFC of 3mm diameter and 150 mm length with YSZ electrolyte were fabricated and tested by V-I measurements using H-2-Ar (5, 10, 100 vol%) as fuel and air for the cathode.",Mini-tubular YSZ based SOFC,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.173
4,14167,The NiO-YSZ tubes of about 400 mu m thickness were produced by hydrostatic pressure and then coated with an YSZ film of 15-20 mu m.,Mini-tubular YSZ based SOFC,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.173
5,14167,The electrolyte was deposited using a manual aerograph.,Mini-tubular YSZ based SOFC,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.173
6,14167,After sintering either Pt paste or LSF (with YSZ or SDC) coatings of about 20-50 mu m thickness were deposited for the cathode.,Mini-tubular YSZ based SOFC,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.173
7,14167,"The OCV of the cells were excellent, very close to the expected Nernst law prediction indicating that there were not gas leaks.",Mini-tubular YSZ based SOFC,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.173
8,14167,The maximum electrical power of the cell was near to 500mW/cm(2) at 850 degrees C operation temperature.,Mini-tubular YSZ based SOFC,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.173
9,14167,Complex impedance measurements of the cells were performed in order to determine the resistance of the different cell components.,Mini-tubular YSZ based SOFC,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.173
