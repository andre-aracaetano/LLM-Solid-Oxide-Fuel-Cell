1,13885,Gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) is a promising electrolyte material for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).,Fabrication of Dense Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Coatings via Very-Low-Pressure Plasma Spray and Plasma Spray-Physical Vapor Deposition Process,10.3390/coatings9110717
2,13885,"Many works used ceramic sintering methods to prepare the GDC electrolyte, which was mature and reliable but presented difficulties in rapidly preparing a large area of GDC electrolyte without cracks.",Fabrication of Dense Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Coatings via Very-Low-Pressure Plasma Spray and Plasma Spray-Physical Vapor Deposition Process,10.3390/coatings9110717
3,13885,"The low-pressure plasma spray (LPPS) process has the potential to solve this problem, but few studies have been conducted to date.",Fabrication of Dense Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Coatings via Very-Low-Pressure Plasma Spray and Plasma Spray-Physical Vapor Deposition Process,10.3390/coatings9110717
4,13885,"In this work, submicron GDC powder was agglomerated by a spray drying method to achieve the proper granularity with D-50 about 10 mu m, and then two dense GDC coatings were fabricated with this agglomerated GDC powder using very-low-pressure plasma spray (VLPPS) and plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD), respectively.",Fabrication of Dense Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Coatings via Very-Low-Pressure Plasma Spray and Plasma Spray-Physical Vapor Deposition Process,10.3390/coatings9110717
5,13885,The results indicate that the two GDC coatings exhibited similar microstructure but with different densification mechanisms.,Fabrication of Dense Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Coatings via Very-Low-Pressure Plasma Spray and Plasma Spray-Physical Vapor Deposition Process,10.3390/coatings9110717
6,13885,"The VLPPS coating was mainly built up in the form of liquid splats, which had lower mechanical properties due to the lower density and crystallinity, while the PS-PVD coating was co-deposited with the vapor clusters and liquid splats, which had higher density, crystallinity, and mechanical properties.",Fabrication of Dense Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Coatings via Very-Low-Pressure Plasma Spray and Plasma Spray-Physical Vapor Deposition Process,10.3390/coatings9110717
7,13885,It can therefore be concluded that the GDC coating prepared by PS-PVD is more appropriate for the LT-SOFC application.,Fabrication of Dense Gadolinia-Doped Ceria Coatings via Very-Low-Pressure Plasma Spray and Plasma Spray-Physical Vapor Deposition Process,10.3390/coatings9110717
