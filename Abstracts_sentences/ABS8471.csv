2,8471,"In order to evaluate the cathode performance, the cathode resistances and the protonic ceramic fuel cell properties were examined using electrochemical cells with a BaCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3 - delta electrolyte disk at intermediate temperatures.",Preparation of nano-structured cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cell by bead-milling method,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.12.020
3,8471,The cells with a milled SSC55 cathode showed lower cathode resistance and higher power density compared to those with the SSC55 cathode prepared from the conventional method.,Preparation of nano-structured cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cell by bead-milling method,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.12.020
4,8471,The improvement is attributed to an increase in the cathode reaction sites caused by the use of the smaller particles and a good adhesion to the electrolyte surface.,Preparation of nano-structured cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cell by bead-milling method,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.12.020
