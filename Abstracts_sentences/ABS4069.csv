1,4069,The feasibility and benefits of using an oxygenated fuel for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operation were explored using dimethyl ether (DME).,Solid oxide fuel cells utilizing dimethyl ether fuel,10.1149/1.1496484
2,4069,A model for the flow tube chemistry was used to predict DME gas-phase decomposition kinetics and species concentration profiles for temperatures ranging from 550 to 750degreesC.,Solid oxide fuel cells utilizing dimethyl ether fuel,10.1149/1.1496484
3,4069,"The predictions, which were in good agreement with mass spectral measurements, showed that in the absence of a fuel cell DME decomposed primarily into equal amounts of H-2,CH4, and CO above about 675degreesC. The same decomposition species were observed in catalytic reaction experiments at Ni-based anodes, but the mole fractions of the decomposition gases were much higher, between 550 and 650degreesC. Current-voltage measurements were made using SOFCs with 100 mum thick yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte supports, (La, Sr)(Co, Fe)O-3 cathodes, and 50 vol % Ni-based anodes.",Solid oxide fuel cells utilizing dimethyl ether fuel,10.1149/1.1496484
4,4069,"Maximum power densities for SOFCs supplied directly with DME fuel were 0.10 and 0.21 W/cm(2) at 600 and 700degrees C, respectively.",Solid oxide fuel cells utilizing dimethyl ether fuel,10.1149/1.1496484
5,4069,No carbon deposition was observed in cells operated at temperatures up to 700degrees C. (C) 2002 The Electrochemical Society.,Solid oxide fuel cells utilizing dimethyl ether fuel,10.1149/1.1496484
