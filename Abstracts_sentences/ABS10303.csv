1,10303,A high-entropy ceramic oxide is used as the cathode for the first time for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs).,A high-entropy spinel ceramic oxide as the cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40145-022-0573-7
2,10303,"The Fe0.6Mn0.6Co0.6Ni0.6Cr0.6O4 (FMCNC) high-entropy spinel oxide has been successfully prepared, and the in situ chemical stability test demonstrates that the FMCNC material has good stability against CO2.",A high-entropy spinel ceramic oxide as the cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40145-022-0573-7
3,10303,"The first-principles calculation indicates that the high-entropy structure enhances the properties of the FMCNC material that surpasses their individual components, leading to lower O-2 adsorption energy for FMCNC than that for the individual components.",A high-entropy spinel ceramic oxide as the cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40145-022-0573-7
4,10303,"The H-SOFC using the FMCNC cathode reaches an encouraging peak power density (PPD) of 1052 mW.cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, which is higher than those of the H-SOFCs reported recently.",A high-entropy spinel ceramic oxide as the cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40145-022-0573-7
5,10303,"Additional comparison was made between the high-entropy FMCNC cathode and the traditional Mn1.6Cu1.4O4 (MCO) spinel cathode without the high-entropy structure, revealing that the formation of the high-entropy material allows the enhanced protonation ability as well as the movement of the O p-band center closer to the Fermi level, thus improving the cathode catalytic activity.",A high-entropy spinel ceramic oxide as the cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40145-022-0573-7
6,10303,"As a result, the high-entropy FMCNC has a much-decreased polarization resistance of 0.057 Omega.cm(2) at 700 degrees C, which is half of that for the traditional MCO spinel cathode without the high-entropy design.",A high-entropy spinel ceramic oxide as the cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40145-022-0573-7
7,10303,"The excellent performance of the FMCNC cell indicates that the high-entropy design makes a new life for the spinel oxide as the cathode for H-SOFCs, offering a novel and promising route for the development of high-performance materials for H-SOFCs.",A high-entropy spinel ceramic oxide as the cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40145-022-0573-7
