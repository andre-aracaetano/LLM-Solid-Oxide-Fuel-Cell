1,3964,"In this study, we prepared a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) cathode layer for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells using microwave sintering.",Improving the performance of the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for Check for proton-conducting SOFCs by microwave sintering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.281
2,3964,"Unlike traditional sintering, which is carried out at 1000 degrees C for a few hours, the microwave sintering method allows the BSCF cathode layer to adhere well with the electrolyte layer after sintering at 900 degrees C for 10 min.",Improving the performance of the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for Check for proton-conducting SOFCs by microwave sintering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.281
3,3964,"This strategy helps the cathode layer maintain a microstructure favourable for cathode reactions and mitigate the potential diffusion of elements between it and the BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta electrolyte, leading to improved cell resistance.",Improving the performance of the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for Check for proton-conducting SOFCs by microwave sintering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.281
4,3964,"The cell with the BSCF cathode layer sintered by the microwave method has a power output of 0.96 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, while the power output for the cell with a conventionally sintered cathode is 0.33 W cm(-2).",Improving the performance of the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for Check for proton-conducting SOFCs by microwave sintering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.281
