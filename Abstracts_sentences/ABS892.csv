1,892,Direct Carbon Fuel Cells (DCFCs) have great thermodynamic advantages over other high temperature fuel cells such as molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) and solid oxide fuel cell.,Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
2,892,"They can have 100% fuel utilization, no Nernst loss (at the anode), and the CO2 produced at the anode is not mixed with other gases and is ready for re-use or sequestration.",Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
3,892,So far only studies have been reported on cell development.,Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
4,892,In this paper we study in particular the integration of the production of clean and reactive carbon particles from methane as a fuel for the direct carbon fuel cell.,Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
5,892,In the thermal decomposition process heat is upgraded to chemical energy in the carbon and hydrogen produced.,Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
6,892,The hydrogen is seen as a product as well as the power and heat.,Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
7,892,"Under the assumptions given the net system electric efficiencies are 22.9% (based on methane lower heating value, LHV) and 20.7% (higher heating value, HHV).",Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
8,892,"The hydrogen production efficiencies are 65.5% (based on methane LHV) and 59.1% (HHV), which leads to total system efficiencies of 88.4% (LHV) and 79.8% (HHV).",Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
9,892,"Although a pure CO2 stream is produced at the anode outlet, which is seen as a large advantage of DCFC systems, this advantage is unfortunately reduced due to the need for CO2 in the cathode air stream.",Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
10,892,"Due to the applied assumed constraint that the cathode outlet stream should at least contain 4% CO2 for the proper functioning of the cathode, similar to MCFC cathodes, a major part of the pure CO2 has to be mixed with incoming air.",Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
11,892,Further optimization of the DCFC and the system is needed to obtain a larger fraction of the output streams as pure CO2 for sequestration or re-use.,Modeling of a Methane Fuelled Direct Carbon Fuel Cell System,10.1115/1.4001016
