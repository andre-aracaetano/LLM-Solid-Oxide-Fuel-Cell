1,2220,"This paper deals with degradation mechanisms of Ni-YSZ electrodes for solid oxide cells, mainly solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), but also to some extent solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Relation Between Ni Particle Shape Change and Ni Migration in Ni-YSZ Electrodes - a Hypothesis,10.1002/fuce.201600222
2,2220,Analysis of literature data reveals that several apparently different and even in one case apparently contradicting degradation phenomena are a consequence of interplay between loss of contact between the Ni-YSZ (and Ni-Ni particles) in the active fine-structured composite fuel electrode layer and migration of Ni via weakly oxidized Ni hydroxide species.,Relation Between Ni Particle Shape Change and Ni Migration in Ni-YSZ Electrodes - a Hypothesis,10.1002/fuce.201600222
3,2220,"A hypothesis that unravels the apparent contradiction and explains qualitatively the phenomena is presented, and as a side effect, light has been shed on a degradation phenomenon in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that has been observed during a decade.",Relation Between Ni Particle Shape Change and Ni Migration in Ni-YSZ Electrodes - a Hypothesis,10.1002/fuce.201600222
