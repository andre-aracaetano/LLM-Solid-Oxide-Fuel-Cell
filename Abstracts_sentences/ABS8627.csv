1,8627,"Compared to other fuel cell types, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) have a number of attractive features: fuel flexibility, components that are all solid state, no water management issues, and high quality surplus heat for combined heat and power (CHP).",Experimental Investigation of 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System with Hydrogen Fed Fuel and an Exhaust gas Burner,
2,8627,The aim of this paper is to investigate the optimal operation condition of porous media burner (so called after-burner) in a SOFC power system.,Experimental Investigation of 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System with Hydrogen Fed Fuel and an Exhaust gas Burner,
3,8627,The functions of after-burner are to increase the thermal efficiency and to decrease the harmful emissions of anode off gas for the SOFC operation.,Experimental Investigation of 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System with Hydrogen Fed Fuel and an Exhaust gas Burner,
4,8627,"In order to find the optimal operation condition of after-burner, the experimental investigation of after-burner control logic is needed.",Experimental Investigation of 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System with Hydrogen Fed Fuel and an Exhaust gas Burner,
5,8627,The key manipulation parameters and the optimal after-burner operation conditions are presented in this paper.,Experimental Investigation of 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System with Hydrogen Fed Fuel and an Exhaust gas Burner,
6,8627,"The experimental results show that the optimal after-burner operation is obtained when using an anode off-gas temperature of 650 degrees C, a cathode off-gas temperature of 330 degrees C, a flame barrier temperature of 700 degrees C, an excess air ratio of 2 and a fuel utilization of U(f)=0.6.",Experimental Investigation of 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System with Hydrogen Fed Fuel and an Exhaust gas Burner,
7,8627,Finally no extra fuel and additional cooling air are fulfilled under the long term operation of SOFC system and the simulations from burner ignition to SOFC long term operation period are also conducted.,Experimental Investigation of 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System with Hydrogen Fed Fuel and an Exhaust gas Burner,
