1,4842,"In this paper, the electrochemical performance of nanostructured LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-delta (LNF) infiltrated La2NiO4+delta (LNO) material was evaluated as a potential cathode for BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY)-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (H-SOFC).",Electrochemical performance of nanostructured LNF infiltrated onto LNO cathode for BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.09.008
2,4842,"The performance of LNO backbone cathodes with different loading amounts of LNF infiltrated phase were investigated, and electrochemical studies implied that the single cell with about 31 wt % LNF infiltrated cathode exhibited the lowest polarization resistance of 0.027 Omega cm(2) and the highest maximum power density of 969 mWcm(-2) at 700 degrees C, which were encouraging compared with that in previous reports of cobalt-free cathodes for H-SOFCs.",Electrochemical performance of nanostructured LNF infiltrated onto LNO cathode for BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.09.008
3,4842,This work demonstrated that the infiltrated LNF-LNO cathode had a great potential for H-SOFC and the optimization of the loading amount of LNF nanoparticles on LNO was critical for the fuel cell performance.,Electrochemical performance of nanostructured LNF infiltrated onto LNO cathode for BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.09.008
