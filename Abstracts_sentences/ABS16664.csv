1,16664,This paper reports the study of the densification of 20% Gd doped ceria (Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC)),"Gadolinium doped ceria interlayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells cathodes: Enhanced reactivity With sintering aids (Li, Cu, Zn), and improved densification by infiltration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.064
2,16664,"interlayers in SOFC cathodes through two different routes: the well-known addition of sintering elements, and an innovative densification process by infiltration.","Gadolinium doped ceria interlayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells cathodes: Enhanced reactivity With sintering aids (Li, Cu, Zn), and improved densification by infiltration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.064
3,16664,"First, Li, Cu, and Zn nitrates were added to GDC powders.","Gadolinium doped ceria interlayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells cathodes: Enhanced reactivity With sintering aids (Li, Cu, Zn), and improved densification by infiltration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.064
4,16664,"The effect of these additives on the densification was studied by dilatometry on pellets, and show a large decrease of the sintering temperature from 1330 degrees C (pure GDC), down to 1080 degrees C, 950 degrees C, and 930 degrees C for Zn, Cu, and Li addition, respectively.","Gadolinium doped ceria interlayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells cathodes: Enhanced reactivity With sintering aids (Li, Cu, Zn), and improved densification by infiltration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.064
5,16664,"However, this promising result does not apply to screen-printed layers, which are more porous than pellets and in which the shrinkage is constrained by the substrate.","Gadolinium doped ceria interlayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells cathodes: Enhanced reactivity With sintering aids (Li, Cu, Zn), and improved densification by infiltration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.064
6,16664,"The second approach consists in preparing a pre-sintered GDC layer, which is subsequently infiltrated with Ce and Gd nitrates and sintered at 1250 degrees C to increase its density.","Gadolinium doped ceria interlayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells cathodes: Enhanced reactivity With sintering aids (Li, Cu, Zn), and improved densification by infiltration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.064
7,16664,Such an approach results in highly dense GDC interlayers.,"Gadolinium doped ceria interlayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells cathodes: Enhanced reactivity With sintering aids (Li, Cu, Zn), and improved densification by infiltration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.064
8,16664,"Using La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) as electrode, the influence of the interlayers on the cathode performance was studied.","Gadolinium doped ceria interlayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells cathodes: Enhanced reactivity With sintering aids (Li, Cu, Zn), and improved densification by infiltration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.064
9,16664,"The addition of sintering aids dramatically increases the cell resistances, most likely because the additives increase the reactivity between GDC and either Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) or LSCF, thus losing the expected benefit related to the decrease of sintering temperatures.","Gadolinium doped ceria interlayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells cathodes: Enhanced reactivity With sintering aids (Li, Cu, Zn), and improved densification by infiltration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.064
10,16664,"The interlayers prepared by infiltration do not induce additional resistances in the cell, which results in power densities of single cells 40-50% higher than those of cells prepared with commercial GDC interlayers, making this approach a valuable alternative to sintering aids.","Gadolinium doped ceria interlayers for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells cathodes: Enhanced reactivity With sintering aids (Li, Cu, Zn), and improved densification by infiltration",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.064
