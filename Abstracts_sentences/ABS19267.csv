1,19267,IT-SOFC c athode material of Gd1-xSrxCoO3-delta(x=0 similar to 0.5) and Gd0.8Sr0.2Co1-yFeyO3-delta(y=0 similar to 1) were synthesized by glycine-nitrate process (GNP) and the stable perovskite phase was formed completely after calcination at 800 degrees C for 12 hours.,Preparation and Characterization of Gd1-xSrxCoO3-δ and Gd0.8Sr0.2Co1-yFeyO3-δ,
2,19267,"The results showed that the conductivity of Gd0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta was 559 S.cm(-1) at 600 degrees C; the interfacial impedance at 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C of the symmetrical electrode composed of Ce0.8Gd0.2O24 (GDC) electrolyte and GSC-25GDC composite was 0.170 Omega.cm(2) and 0.064 Omega.cm(2), and the activation energy was only 87.8 kJ.mol(-1), indicating that Gd0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta could he an ideal IT-SOFC cathode material.",Preparation and Characterization of Gd1-xSrxCoO3-δ and Gd0.8Sr0.2Co1-yFeyO3-δ,
3,19267,With the addition of Fe3+ the thermal expansion and the conductivity of Gd(0.8)Sr(0.2)Co(1-y)FeyO(3-delta) reduce fast.,Preparation and Characterization of Gd1-xSrxCoO3-δ and Gd0.8Sr0.2Co1-yFeyO3-δ,
4,19267,"In addition, Gd0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta/GDC composite cathode with good performance and matched thermal expansion coefficient to GDC electrolyte can he prepared by adjusting the proportion of Gd0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta and GDC.",Preparation and Characterization of Gd1-xSrxCoO3-δ and Gd0.8Sr0.2Co1-yFeyO3-δ,
