1,16036,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) seem to be a promising technology for the energy generation of tomorrow.,Experimental evaluation of the operating temperature impact on solid oxide anode-supported fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.042
2,16036,Such devices are very complex and performances are strictly dependent on the understanding of basic concepts and development of new materials.,Experimental evaluation of the operating temperature impact on solid oxide anode-supported fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.042
3,16036,The actual demonstrated target of SOFCs is around 1 W/cm(2) of power density at the operating temperature of 750 degrees C and practical fuel utilization (>50%); the goal for the next years is to reach 2 W/cm(2) at 650 degrees C of power density.,Experimental evaluation of the operating temperature impact on solid oxide anode-supported fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.042
4,16036,"The achievement of this goal depends mainly on the investigation of high-performance materials and on the developing of diagnostic and analytical techniques to deeply understand the cells' behaviour; moreover, the improvement of performance is strictly related to the manufacturing processes.",Experimental evaluation of the operating temperature impact on solid oxide anode-supported fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.042
5,16036,In this paper is shown a study dealing with a comparison of two planar anode-supported SOFCs differing for cathode materials.,Experimental evaluation of the operating temperature impact on solid oxide anode-supported fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.042
6,16036,in fact it is known that cathode overvoltage is a limiting factor for such cells' design.,Experimental evaluation of the operating temperature impact on solid oxide anode-supported fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.042

8,16036,"In the paper, results are presented concerning the characterization of planar circular-shaped cells from InDEC (R) with lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) and lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite oxide (LSCF) cathodes.",Experimental evaluation of the operating temperature impact on solid oxide anode-supported fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.042
9,16036,"It is shown that cell performance can be increased via material selection; in fact, the power density of around 0.8 W/cm(2) is reached at 850 degrees C for the cell with LSM cathode and at 750 degrees C for the cell with LSCF cathode.",Experimental evaluation of the operating temperature impact on solid oxide anode-supported fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.042
