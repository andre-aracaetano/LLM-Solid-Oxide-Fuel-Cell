1,707,"A Y-doped BaCeO3-perovskite based fuel cell is being developed, where the ceramic acts as the electrolyte material, exhibiting high protonic conductivity at elevated temperatures.",Nanoscale microstructure degradation of Y-BaCeO3 under service conditions,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1141
2,707,"The protonic ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) is fundamentally different from other fuel cell types currently being developed, because it relies on the conduction of protons through the electrolyte at higher temperatures than commonly employed for other proton-conducting materials.",Nanoscale microstructure degradation of Y-BaCeO3 under service conditions,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1141
3,707,"An additional advantage is that, when operating at 750 degreesC, the PCFC is ideal for the utilization of hydrocarbon fuels, such as natural gas.",Nanoscale microstructure degradation of Y-BaCeO3 under service conditions,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1141
4,707,"Proton conduction implies that water vapor is produced at the cathode, where it is swept away by air, rather than at the anode (as in a solid oxide fuel cell), where it dilutes the fuel.",Nanoscale microstructure degradation of Y-BaCeO3 under service conditions,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1141
5,707,"Therefore, since carbon dioxide is the only exhaust gas produced, higher fuel utilization is possible.",Nanoscale microstructure degradation of Y-BaCeO3 under service conditions,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1141
6,707,"However, detailed micro structural analysis via scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the material upon performance under severe service conditions (750 degreesC for 200 and 4000 hours) revealed an unexpected degradation of the matrix grains.",Nanoscale microstructure degradation of Y-BaCeO3 under service conditions,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1141
7,707,"Planar defects, which are aligned along {100} crystallographic planes of the perovskite structure, form with time.",Nanoscale microstructure degradation of Y-BaCeO3 under service conditions,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1141
