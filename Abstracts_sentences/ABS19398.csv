4,19398,"Because large internal resistance and large degradation during charge and discharge cycles were observed on the anode, there is a strong demand for improvements in discharge potential and cycle stability.","Ni-Fe-Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 cermet anode for rechargeable Fe-Air battery using LaGaO3 oxide ion conductor as electrolyte",10.1039/c2ra23370c
5,19398,This study investigates the use of a cermet anode consisting of a Ni-Fe alloy combined with an oxide ion conductor.,"Ni-Fe-Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 cermet anode for rechargeable Fe-Air battery using LaGaO3 oxide ion conductor as electrolyte",10.1039/c2ra23370c
6,19398,"It was observed that by using a cermet anode of Ni-Fe combined with Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2 (CMF), the observed capacity of the cell was improved to 1163 mAh g(-1) Fe-1 at 10 mA cm(-2) and 873 K.","Ni-Fe-Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 cermet anode for rechargeable Fe-Air battery using LaGaO3 oxide ion conductor as electrolyte",10.1039/c2ra23370c
7,19398,This is about 97% of the theoretical capacity by assuming the formation of Fe3O4 (1200 mAh g(-1) Fe-1).,"Ni-Fe-Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 cermet anode for rechargeable Fe-Air battery using LaGaO3 oxide ion conductor as electrolyte",10.1039/c2ra23370c
8,19398,Cycle stability of the cell was also considerably improved with the use of a Ni-Fe-CMF anode compared to a Ni-Fe anode because of the suppressed aggregation provided by the mixing of Ni with CMF.,"Ni-Fe-Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 cermet anode for rechargeable Fe-Air battery using LaGaO3 oxide ion conductor as electrolyte",10.1039/c2ra23370c
