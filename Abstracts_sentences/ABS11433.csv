1,11433,"In this study, Cu and Mo ions were doped in Ca3Co4O9-delta to improve the electrical conductivity and electrochemical behavior of Ca3Co4O9-delta ceramic and the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) single cell based on NiO-SDC/SDC/doped Ca3Co4O9-delta-SDC were examined.",Characteristics of Cu and Mo-doped Ca3Co4O9-δ cathode materials for use in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.037
2,11433,"Cu substitution in the monoclinic Ca3Co4O9-delta ceramic effectively enhanced the densification, slightly increased the grain size, and triggered the formation of some Ca3Co2O6; however, no second phase was found in porous Mo-doped Ca3Co4O9-delta ceramics even when the sintering temperature reached 1050 degrees C. Substitution of Cu ions caused slight increase in the Co3+ and Co4+ contents and decrease in the Co2+ content; however, doping with Mo ions showed the opposite trend.",Characteristics of Cu and Mo-doped Ca3Co4O9-δ cathode materials for use in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.037

5,11433,K-1 was chosen as the cathode to build SOFC single cells consisting of a 20 mu m SDC electrolyte layer.,Characteristics of Cu and Mo-doped Ca3Co4O9-δ cathode materials for use in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.037
6,11433,"Without optimizing the microstructure of the cathode or hermetically sealing the cell against the gas, a power density of 0.367 Wcm(-2) at 750 degrees C was achieved, demonstrating that Cu-doped Ca3Co4O9-delta can be used as a potential cathode material for IT-SOFCs.",Characteristics of Cu and Mo-doped Ca3Co4O9-δ cathode materials for use in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.037
