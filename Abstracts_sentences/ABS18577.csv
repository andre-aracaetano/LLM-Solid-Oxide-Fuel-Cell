3,18577,The first technical challenge was to modify the thermobalance to integrate it with polarization equipment without perturbation of measurement and of oxidation behavior.,In Situ Measurement of Electrical Behavior of Metal/Oxide System During Zirconium Oxidation at 850 °C,10.1007/s11085-020-10009-4
4,18577,"Surprisingly, the oxidation rate was found to remain independent on the applied voltage, despite a large range of applied potentials, +/- 200 V. Modeling of oxidation rates according to diffusion mechanism combined with investigation of polarization curves of the metal/oxide/electrode system has shown that a high electrical resistance appears at the oxide/electrode interface, even with addition of an intermediate gold layer.",In Situ Measurement of Electrical Behavior of Metal/Oxide System During Zirconium Oxidation at 850 °C,10.1007/s11085-020-10009-4
