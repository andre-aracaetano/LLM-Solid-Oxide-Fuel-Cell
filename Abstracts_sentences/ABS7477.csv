6,7477,"However, weak diffraction spots, where diffractions should be absent according to the structure factor of the cubic fluorite phase, are present in the patterns taken from the YSZ in the anode and the electrolyte.",Crystal defects of yttria stabilized zirconia in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and their evolution upon cell operation,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.008
7,7477,The appearance of kinematically forbidden spots in YSZ is unchanged after cell operation.,Crystal defects of yttria stabilized zirconia in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and their evolution upon cell operation,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.008
8,7477,Such weak diffraction spots can be interpreted as arising from a nanoscale (2-10 nm) irregularly-shaped tetragonal YSZ (t-YSZ) domain that is randomly distributed in the cubic YSZ (c-YSZ) matrix.,Crystal defects of yttria stabilized zirconia in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and their evolution upon cell operation,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.008
9,7477,"However, larger t-YSZ domains with thicknesses of 5-10 nm and lengths of 30 nm are observed by the Ni/YSZ interfaces in cells operated at 800 degrees C in coal-derived syngas for 550 h. The layered t-YSZ domains are accompanied by the c-YSZ domains, implying the migration of Y along the Ni/YSZ interface in response to cell operation.",Crystal defects of yttria stabilized zirconia in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and their evolution upon cell operation,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.11.008
