3,11299,It was found that the LSCu perovskite was obtained only When the addition of strontium fell in the range between 15 and 30%.,La1-xSrCuO2.5-δ as new cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0025-5408(02)01034-6
4,11299,"With more than 20% of strontium addition, this material showed excellent electrical property and immunity to the reaction with YSZ at 800 degreesC. The conductivities of LSCu were as high as 900 S/cm at 600 degreesC, and 800 S/cm, at 800 degreesC. The cathodic overpotential of this material was approximately 18 and 10.6 mV at a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at 850 and 750 degreesC, respectively.",La1-xSrCuO2.5-δ as new cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0025-5408(02)01034-6
