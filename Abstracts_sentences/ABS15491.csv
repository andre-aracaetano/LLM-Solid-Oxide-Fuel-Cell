1,15491,"Transition metal elements were employed to customize the standard Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6 (SFM) material, with the goal of improving the performance of the SFM cathode in protonconducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs).","New Sr2FeMo0.5X0.5O6 (X1/4Ni, Co, Mn, Zn) cathodes for proton-conducting SOFCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.118
2,15491,"Sr2FeMo0.5X0.5O6 (X = Ni, Co, Mn, Zn) materials were prepared, but it was discovered that only the dopants Ni and Co can form a pure phase, whereas the dopants Mn and Zn produced an obvious secondary phase.","New Sr2FeMo0.5X0.5O6 (X1/4Ni, Co, Mn, Zn) cathodes for proton-conducting SOFCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.118
3,15491,"When comparing oxygen vacancies and oxygen diffusion kinetics, utilizing the Co-dopant exhibited clear advantages.","New Sr2FeMo0.5X0.5O6 (X1/4Ni, Co, Mn, Zn) cathodes for proton-conducting SOFCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.118
4,15491,The Co-doped SFM had a higher oxygen vacancy content and faster oxygen diffusion kinetics than both the standard and Ni-doped SFM cathodes.,"New Sr2FeMo0.5X0.5O6 (X1/4Ni, Co, Mn, Zn) cathodes for proton-conducting SOFCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.118
5,15491,"The energy barrier for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the Co-doped SFM cathode was 0.76 eV, which was much lower than that for the SFM and Ni-doped SFM, which were 5.52 and 2.28 eV, respectively.","New Sr2FeMo0.5X0.5O6 (X1/4Ni, Co, Mn, Zn) cathodes for proton-conducting SOFCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.118
6,15491,"As a result, the Co-doped SFM's cathode reaction was greatly accelerated, resulting in a high fuel cell performance of 1306 mW cm-2 at 700 degrees C.","New Sr2FeMo0.5X0.5O6 (X1/4Ni, Co, Mn, Zn) cathodes for proton-conducting SOFCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.118
7,15491,"This finding suggests that using the appropriate dopant can alleviate the low-performance problem of the traditional SFM cathode, resulting in a promising cathode option for H-SOFCs.","New Sr2FeMo0.5X0.5O6 (X1/4Ni, Co, Mn, Zn) cathodes for proton-conducting SOFCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.118
