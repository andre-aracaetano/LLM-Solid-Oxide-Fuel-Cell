1,10131,"The promotion of the direct electrochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons in a solid oxide fuel cell was investigated using a ceria-based electrolyte with different noble metals-containing anode at 600 degreesC. The attempted approach toward this objective was to avoid interference from a large amount of steam and CO2 products, because they degrade the anode performance.",Intermediate-temperature SOFCs with ru-catalyzed Ni-cermet anodes,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.269.151
2,10131,Ru was an effective catalyst for removing these gases from the anode surface due to its high catalytic activity for the steam and CO2 reforming of hydrocarbons.,Intermediate-temperature SOFCs with ru-catalyzed Ni-cermet anodes,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.269.151
3,10131,"This permitted a smooth access of the unreacted hydrocarbons to the three-phase boundary, thus resulting in a noticeably high anode performance.",Intermediate-temperature SOFCs with ru-catalyzed Ni-cermet anodes,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.269.151
4,10131,"The resulting peak power density reached 750 MW cm(-2) with dry methane, which was comparable to the peak power density of 769 mW cm(-2) with wet hydrogen.",Intermediate-temperature SOFCs with ru-catalyzed Ni-cermet anodes,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.269.151
