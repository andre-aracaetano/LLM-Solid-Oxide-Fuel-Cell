5,12927,"high temperature solid oxide fuel cells can be directly fueled by ammonia and obtain good output characteristics, but the challenges inherent in high temperature solid oxide fuel cells greatly limit the implementation of this option.",Simulation and Study of PEMFC System Directly Fueled by Ammonia Decomposition Gas,10.3389/fenrg.2022.819939
6,12927,"Whereas PEMFC has gained initial commercial use, however, for PEMFC, ammonia is a toxic gas, so the general practice is to convert ammonia to pure hydrogen.",Simulation and Study of PEMFC System Directly Fueled by Ammonia Decomposition Gas,10.3389/fenrg.2022.819939
7,12927,"Ammonia to hydrogen requires decomposition under high temperature and purification, which increases the complexity of the fuel system.",Simulation and Study of PEMFC System Directly Fueled by Ammonia Decomposition Gas,10.3389/fenrg.2022.819939
8,12927,"In contrast, PEMFC that can use ammonia decomposition gas directly can simplify the fuel system, and this option has already obtained preliminary experimental validation studies.",Simulation and Study of PEMFC System Directly Fueled by Ammonia Decomposition Gas,10.3389/fenrg.2022.819939
