2,15072,This paper describes a novel and highly efficient method of utilising renewable and industrial waste gases using state-of-the-art solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology.,Highly efficient coproduction of electrical power and synthesis gas from biohythane using solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113854
3,15072,"Coproduction of energy and useful chemicals using SOFCs is demonstrated experimentally through investigations into the utilisation of biohythane, a gaseous mixture consisting of 60/30/10 vol% CH4/CO2/H-2 that is produced from an optimised two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) process.",Highly efficient coproduction of electrical power and synthesis gas from biohythane using solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113854
4,15072,"In this work, the gain in energy yield from two-stage AD is shown to be supplemented with additional gains in SOFC efficiency due to the presence of H-2 in biohythane, giving up to 77% increased electrical energy yields from biomass overall compared with utilisation of biogas from single-stage AD in SOFCs.",Highly efficient coproduction of electrical power and synthesis gas from biohythane using solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113854
5,15072,The results therefore show that biohythane production rather than biogas is a highly advantageous route to energy production from biomass.,Highly efficient coproduction of electrical power and synthesis gas from biohythane using solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113854
6,15072,Electrochemical measurements and quadrupole mass spectrometry were combined to gain clear new insights into the fuel conversion mechanisms present.,Highly efficient coproduction of electrical power and synthesis gas from biohythane using solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113854
7,15072,The wide range of products that can be obtained via coproduction has been demonstrated and the techniques reported could be used to dispose and add value to many problematic renewable and industrial waste gas streams.,Highly efficient coproduction of electrical power and synthesis gas from biohythane using solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113854
