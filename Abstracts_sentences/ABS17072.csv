2,17072,The Si substitution onto the B site of a Si-29 enriched Sr(1-y)CayMn(1-x)SixO(3-delta) perovskite system is confirmed by Si-29 MAS NMR measurements at low B-0 field.,Investigation into the effect of Si doping on the performance of Sr1-yCayMnO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1039/c3dt32561j
3,17072,The very large paramagnetic shift (similar to 3000-3500 ppm) and anisotropy (span similar to 4000 ppm) suggests that the Si4+ species experiences both Fermi contact and electron-nuclear dipolar contributions to the paramagnetic interaction with the Mn3+/4+ centres.,Investigation into the effect of Si doping on the performance of Sr1-yCayMnO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1039/c3dt32561j

5,17072,"The first of these is attributed to the tetrahedral coordination preference of Si leading to the introduction of oxide ion vacancies, and hence a partial reduction of Mn4+ to give mixed valence Mn.",Investigation into the effect of Si doping on the performance of Sr1-yCayMnO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1039/c3dt32561j
6,17072,"Secondly, for samples with high Sr levels, the undoped systems adopt a hexagonal perovskite structure containing face sharing of MnO6 octahedra, while Si doping is shown to help to stabilise the more highly conducting cubic perovskite containing corner linked octahedra.",Investigation into the effect of Si doping on the performance of Sr1-yCayMnO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1039/c3dt32561j
7,17072,"The level of Si, x, required to stabilise the cubic Sr(1-y)CayMn(1-x)Si(x)O(3-delta) perovskite in these cases is shown to decrease with increasing Ca content; thus cubic symmetry is achieved at x = 0.05 for the Sr0.5Ca0.5Mn1-xSixO3-delta series; x = 0.075 for Sr(0.7)Ca(0.3)Mn(1-x)SixO(3-delta); x = 0.10 for Sr(0.8)Ca(0.2)Mn(1-x)SixO(3-delta); and x = 0.15 for SrMn(1-x)SixO(3-delta).",Investigation into the effect of Si doping on the performance of Sr1-yCayMnO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1039/c3dt32561j
