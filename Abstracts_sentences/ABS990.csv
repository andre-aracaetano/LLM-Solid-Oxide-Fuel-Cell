1,990,Structure evaluation was comparably studied with the traditional thin anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells based on single-sided electrolyte (SSE-SOFCs) and the thick flat-tube solid oxide fuel cells based on double-sided electrolytes (DSE-SOFCs) under redox conditions.,Structure evaluation of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cells based on single/double-sided electrolyte(s) under redox conditions,10.1111/ijac.13429
2,990,"Results showed that the structure of DSE-SOFCs remained unchanged, especially the electrolyte kept un-cracked during the redox process, whereas SSE-SOFC was warped and, in some cases, cracked as the thickness of supported anode was less than 1 mm, which indicated that the DSE-SOFCs exhibited better redox stability than the SSE-SOFCs.",Structure evaluation of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cells based on single/double-sided electrolyte(s) under redox conditions,10.1111/ijac.13429
