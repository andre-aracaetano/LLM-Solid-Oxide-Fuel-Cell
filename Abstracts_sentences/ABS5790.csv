1,5790,BaCe0.7Sn0.1Gd0.2O3-sigma (BCSG) and BaCe0.8 Gd0.2O3-sigma (BCG) powders were prepared by solid-state reaction method.,A stable and easily sintering BaCe0.7Sn0.1Gd0.2O3-δ electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-008-0282-4
2,5790,"After exposure in 5% CO2+5% H2O+ 90% N-2 at 500 degrees C for 5 h, the BCSG powders were hardly affected while the BCG powders decomposed into CeO2 and BaCO3 phases.",A stable and easily sintering BaCe0.7Sn0.1Gd0.2O3-δ electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-008-0282-4
3,5790,"Moreover, the relative density of BCSG reaches 97%, while the BCG just displays 91% after sintering at 1,400 degrees C. The BCSG displays a conductivity of 0.01 S/cm at 700 degrees C in humid hydrogen, which is quite close to 0.012 S/cm for BCG.",A stable and easily sintering BaCe0.7Sn0.1Gd0.2O3-δ electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-008-0282-4
4,5790,"A fuel cell with BCSG exhibits 1.02 V for open circuit voltage, 420 mW/cm(2) for peak performance and 0.23 Omega cm(2) for interfacial resistance at 700 degrees C, respectively.",A stable and easily sintering BaCe0.7Sn0.1Gd0.2O3-δ electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-008-0282-4
