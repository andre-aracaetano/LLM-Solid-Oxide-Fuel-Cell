1,18955,"A series of materials La0.75Sr0.25-xCexCr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCCM, x = 0, 0.1, 0.13 and 0.15) were synthesized by the sol-gel process, and their structures were demonstrated using X-ray diffraction (XRD).",La0.75Sr0.25-xCexCr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ electrode material for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells with H2S-containing fuel,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.05.219
2,18955,"The best ratio of ceria-substitution in LSCCM series was studied in detail by H-2 temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), O-2 temperature programmed desorption (O-2-TPD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR).",La0.75Sr0.25-xCexCr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ electrode material for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells with H2S-containing fuel,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.05.219
3,18955,"The catalytic activity results of H-2-TPR and O-2-TPD prove that ceria-substitution x = 0.15 for La0.75Sr0.25-xCexCr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta has the best catalytic activity, but the FTIR results show the material with high ceria content is not resistant to sulfur.",La0.75Sr0.25-xCexCr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ electrode material for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells with H2S-containing fuel,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.05.219
4,18955,"Taking account both catalytic activity and sulfur tolerance, ceria-substitution x = 0.13 is an optimum for La0.75Sr0.25-xCexCr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta, with which maximal power density of 17.86 mW cm(-2) can be attained in 5% H2S-5% wet H-2 at 900 degrees C.
