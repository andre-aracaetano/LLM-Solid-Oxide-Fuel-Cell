8,15741,"An overall assessment of the two parts of this study indicates that the catalytic properties or the perovskite surface, which enhances adsorption and surface diffusion of oxygen, is more significant than processes involving the bulk material, such as fast oxygen exchange with the bulk and vacancy diffusion, in determining cathode performance.",Mathematical modeling of oxygen exchange and transport in air-perovskite-yttria-stabilized zirconia interface regions - II.
