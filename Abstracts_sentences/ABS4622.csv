1,4622,"To improve the power densities of anode-supported multilayer solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on an anode functional layer (AFL) and an anode support of Ni-YSZ (8 mol%Y2O3-ZrO2), we systematically investigated how the AFL thickness influenced power density and impedance spectra, preparing the AFL using 65 wt% NiO-35 wt% YSZ with the anode support using 60 wt% NiO-40 wt% YSZ.",Dependence of power density on anode functional layer thickness in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-016-1860-5
2,4622,"Among the prepared SOFCs with AFL thicknesses from 0 to 100 mu m, the similar to 10-mu m-AFL SOFC (AFL10) showed the highest power density.",Dependence of power density on anode functional layer thickness in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-016-1860-5
3,4622,Impedance spectroscopy of the prepared SOFCs was composed of an ohmic resistance as well as three constant phase elements (CPEs) resulting from activation- and concentration-polarizations.,Dependence of power density on anode functional layer thickness in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-016-1860-5
4,4622,The impedance spectroscopy showed that AFL10 effectively decreased both the contact- and activation polarization-resistances.,Dependence of power density on anode functional layer thickness in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-016-1860-5

6,4622,"As such, AFL10 exhibited the highest power density among the prepared SOFC samples.",Dependence of power density on anode functional layer thickness in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-016-1860-5
