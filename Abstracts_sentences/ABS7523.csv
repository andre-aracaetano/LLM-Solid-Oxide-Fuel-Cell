1,7523,Planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with CuO/gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) supporting anode were produced and tested in H-2 and in CH4/CO2 mixture at 650 degrees C.,Fabrication and Testing of Copper/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating at Intermediate Temperature,10.1002/ente.201800248
2,7523,The electrolyte densification at 900 degrees C was promoted by compressive strains induced by larger anodic thickness.,Fabrication and Testing of Copper/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating at Intermediate Temperature,10.1002/ente.201800248
3,7523,The reduction behaviour of CuO/GDC anodic powders was preliminarily evaluated.,Fabrication and Testing of Copper/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating at Intermediate Temperature,10.1002/ente.201800248
4,7523,The electrochemical measurements showed an increasing power density with the anode thickness (from approximate to 500 mu m to approximate to 1.4 mm) reaching a maximum value of 227 mW cm(-2) at 650 degrees C in pure H-2.,Fabrication and Testing of Copper/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating at Intermediate Temperature,10.1002/ente.201800248
5,7523,"Power density of 29 mW cm(-2) was measured in wet CH4/CO2 biogas mixture at 650 degrees C. Catalytic activity measurements towards methane dry reforming showed limited conversion at all investigated temperatures, this suggesting that the actual anodic reaction is the methane combustion.",Fabrication and Testing of Copper/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating at Intermediate Temperature,10.1002/ente.201800248
6,7523,"Scanning electron microscope observations and energy dispersive X-ray analyses of the cell tested in CH4/CO2 mixture did not show any carbon deposit, thus pointing out that the Cu/GDC cermet can be considered a stable and reliable anodic substrate for IT-SOFC fed by CH4/CO2 mixture.",Fabrication and Testing of Copper/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating at Intermediate Temperature,10.1002/ente.201800248
