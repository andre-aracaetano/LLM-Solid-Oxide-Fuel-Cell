4,5530,This novel infiltration process is designed based on the principle of a reversible sol-gel transition where the gelated precursor dendrites are uniformly deposited onto the electrode via controlled nanoscale electro-spraying process then resolubilized and infiltrated into the porous electrode structure through subsequent humidity control.,Vapor-Mediated Infiltration of Nanocatalysts for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Electrosprayed Dendrites,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c02872
5,5530,"Our infiltration technique reduces the cathodic polarization resistance by 18% compared to conventional processes, thereby achieving an enhanced peak power density of 0.976 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C. These results, which provide various degrees of freedom for forming nanocatalysts, exhibit an advancement in LT-SOFC technology.",Vapor-Mediated Infiltration of Nanocatalysts for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Electrosprayed Dendrites,10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c02872
