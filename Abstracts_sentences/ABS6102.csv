1,6102,"The decomposition of La2NiO4+delta (LNO) was studied in presence of a second phase, Sm0.2Ce0.8O2 (-) (delta) (SDC), for volume fractions of LNO below 55 vol%, after sintering at 1300 degrees C for 5 h. The details of the decomposition reaction were studied using a combination of experimental methods including X-ray diffractometry, dilatometry analysis and scanning electron microscopy imaging.",Decomposition of La2NiO4 in Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-La2NiO4 composites for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.11.030
