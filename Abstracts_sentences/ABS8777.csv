1,8777,"In this work, maximum power density as the function of electrolyte thickness of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (GDC10) electrolyte was calculated by integrating partial conductivities of charge carriers under various DC bias conditions at a fixed oxygen chemical potential gradient at both sides of the electrolyte.",Spatial distribution of oxygen chemical potential under potential gradients and performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.07.003
2,8777,Partial conductivities as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure (P-O2) were calculated using Hebb-Wagner polarization method and spatial distribution of P-O2 across the electrolyte was calculated based on Choudhury and Patterson's model [1] by considering reversible electrode conditions.,Spatial distribution of oxygen chemical potential under potential gradients and performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.07.003

5,8777,"The theoretical maximum power density increased from 1.26 W.cm(-2) at 500 degrees C to 7.39 W.cm(-2) at 700 degrees C. Similarly, at 500 degrees C, power density increased two fold on reducing electrolyte thickness from 20 mu m to 10 mu m.",Spatial distribution of oxygen chemical potential under potential gradients and performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.07.003
