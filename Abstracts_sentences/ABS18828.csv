1,18828,A solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) is an electrochemical technology used for hydrogen production via a steam electrolysis reaction.,Flowsheet-based model and exergy analysis of solid oxide electrolysis cells for clean hydrogen production,10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.127
2,18828,"Because the existing SOEC models are complicated, the aim of this study is to develop a user-friendly SOEC model in a flowsheet simulator (Aspen Plus).",Flowsheet-based model and exergy analysis of solid oxide electrolysis cells for clean hydrogen production,10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.127
3,18828,"The developed model is used to perform a parametric analysis to investigate the effects of key process parameters, i.e., operating temperature, current density, steam concentration, sweep gas type and number of cells, on the SOEC performance.",Flowsheet-based model and exergy analysis of solid oxide electrolysis cells for clean hydrogen production,10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.127
4,18828,"The simulation results show that the voltage and the overall overpotential decrease as the cell temperature increases, whereas the opposite trends are observed when the current density increases.",Flowsheet-based model and exergy analysis of solid oxide electrolysis cells for clean hydrogen production,10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.127
5,18828,"From the energy and exergy analyses, the total energy demand slightly increases with cell temperature, whereas the electrical energy demand decreases.",Flowsheet-based model and exergy analysis of solid oxide electrolysis cells for clean hydrogen production,10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.127
6,18828,"Based on an operating temperature of 1273 K when the SOEC uses oxygen as the sweep gas, the highest energy and exergetic efficiencies of 78.45% and 92.20% are achieved at a current density of 2500 A m(-2) and at a steam concentration of 90% in a 500-cell stack.",Flowsheet-based model and exergy analysis of solid oxide electrolysis cells for clean hydrogen production,10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.127
