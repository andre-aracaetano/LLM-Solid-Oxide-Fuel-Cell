3,5818,"Using Fe2O3 and Bi2O3 as healing additives, metallurgical healing of unbound interfaces was achieved by impregnating the additives into the gap interfaces, followed by liquid -phase sintering at 1200 and 1050 degrees C. After healing, the YSZ coating exhibited a dense bulk -like microstructure with a significant reduction in the gas leakage rate by two orders of magnitude, and the oxygen ion conductivity of the coating was significantly increased.",Plasma-sprayed bulk-like yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings for solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes based on liquid-phase sintering-induced interfacial healing,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2024.04.063
4,5818,"The YSZ coating healed with the Fe2O3 additive showed an oxygen ionic conductivity nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the as -sprayed coating, reaching more than 80% of the value of the hightemperature -sintered YSZ bulk.",Plasma-sprayed bulk-like yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings for solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes based on liquid-phase sintering-induced interfacial healing,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2024.04.063
