1,6106,"Here, we report the Sr0.5Bi0.4Ca0.1FeO3-delta (SBCF) and Sr0.5Bi0.5FeO3-delta (SBF) oxides, which are regarded as the oxygen electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Advanced electrochemical activity and CO2 tolerance of iron-based cathode electrocatalyst for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123267
2,6106,"The Ca2+ cations that doped into SBF substitutes the Bi3+ site, which can increase the oxygen vacancy concentration, promote the oxygen transport kinetics, enhance the electrical conductivity, and improve the electrochemical activity.",Advanced electrochemical activity and CO2 tolerance of iron-based cathode electrocatalyst for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123267
3,6106,"Impedance result shows that SBCF possesses a lower polarization resistance of 0.13 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Additionally, SBCF performs well in single cells, achieving a peak power density of 0.83 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C and a superior durability for similar to 100 h. When SBCF electrode is exposed to a CO2-containing atmosphere, no carbonate species are formed on SBCF cathode, indicating that SBCF has a good CO2 tolerance.",Advanced electrochemical activity and CO2 tolerance of iron-based cathode electrocatalyst for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123267
4,6106,The high activity and good chemical stability make SBCF a potential electrode for SOFCs.,Advanced electrochemical activity and CO2 tolerance of iron-based cathode electrocatalyst for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123267
