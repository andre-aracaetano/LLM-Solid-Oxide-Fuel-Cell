1,8098,"To increase corrosion resistance of gadolinium-doped cerium oxide (GDC) electrolytes for direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells with liquid Sb anodes, GDC-based electrolytes with Fe2O3 addition of 1 (GDCF-1), 2 (GDCF-2) and 3 (GDCF-3) mol.% have been prepared and evaluated chemically and electrochemically in contact with liquid Sb and Sb2O3 at 750 degrees C for 100 h. The results show that Fe2O3 addition significantly increases the resistance of the electrolytes to the chemical corrosion by liquid Sb, and GDCF-2 demonstrates the highest resistance with a corrosion affected thickness of about 60 mu m, which is smaller than 1/8 of that of GDC.",Enhanced resistance of gadolinium-doped cerium oxide to liquid antimony and antimony oxide corrosions by addition of iron oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227970

4,8098,"The performance promotion is resulted from the reduction of GDCF-2 thickness caused by liquid Sb/Sb2O3 corrosion, but the total thickness reduction is about 200 mu m, which is only 2/5 of that of GDC.",Enhanced resistance of gadolinium-doped cerium oxide to liquid antimony and antimony oxide corrosions by addition of iron oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227970
