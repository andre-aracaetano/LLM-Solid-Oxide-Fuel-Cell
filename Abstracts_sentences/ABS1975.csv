3,1975,"However, results from such experiments are of high importance for the evaluation of tar thresholds and operating conditions ensuring a stable operation of fuel cells.","Real coupling of solid oxide fuel cells with a biomass steam gasifier: Operating boundaries considering performance, tar and carbon deposition analyses",10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123310
4,1975,"For the first time, it was possible to demonstrate for dozens of hours the operation of solid oxide fuel cells with real product gas from steam gasification with a steam-to-carbon ratio of 2 and a typical tar content for fluidized bed gasification.","Real coupling of solid oxide fuel cells with a biomass steam gasifier: Operating boundaries considering performance, tar and carbon deposition analyses",10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123310
5,1975,"Four coupling experiments with industrial-relevant cell designs were conducted, demonstrating a stable operation for 30 h without structural degradation of the anodes for cells with nickel/ceria- and nickel/zirconiabased anodes at 800 degrees C and 850 degrees C, if heavy tars were partially removed (2.8-3.7 g.Nm(-3) gravimetric tars).","Real coupling of solid oxide fuel cells with a biomass steam gasifier: Operating boundaries considering performance, tar and carbon deposition analyses",10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123310
6,1975,"Raw gas operation (4.6-4.8 g.Nm(-3) gravimetric tars) led to metal dusting effects on nickel contact meshes and nickel/zirconia-based anodes, whereas nickel/ceria-based anodes were less affected.","Real coupling of solid oxide fuel cells with a biomass steam gasifier: Operating boundaries considering performance, tar and carbon deposition analyses",10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123310
7,1975,"Carbon deposited on the alumina support in all experiments whereby a change from pyrolytic to graphitic structure could be observed when increasing the temperature from 800 degrees C to 850 degrees C, thus significantly reducing the risk for blockages in the flow channels.","Real coupling of solid oxide fuel cells with a biomass steam gasifier: Operating boundaries considering performance, tar and carbon deposition analyses",10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123310
8,1975,"Moreover, high tar and benzene conversion rates were observed.","Real coupling of solid oxide fuel cells with a biomass steam gasifier: Operating boundaries considering performance, tar and carbon deposition analyses",10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123310
9,1975,"Concluding, operating temperatures of 850 degrees C and the removal only of heavy tars can enable stable long-term operation with a tar-laden steam gasifier product gas, even without increasing the steam-to-carbon ratio to values exceeding two.","Real coupling of solid oxide fuel cells with a biomass steam gasifier: Operating boundaries considering performance, tar and carbon deposition analyses",10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123310
