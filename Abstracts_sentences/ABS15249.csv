1,15249,Anaerobic digestion (AD) and sewage sludge digestion (SD) plants generate significant quantities of ammoniacal nitrogen in their digestate liquor.,"Ammonia and Biogas from Anaerobic and Sewage Digestion for Novel Heat, Power and Transport Applications-A Techno-Economic and GHG Emissions Study for the United Kingdom",10.3390/en15062174
2,15249,This article assesses the economic viability and CO2 abatement opportunity from the utilisation of this ammonia under three scenarios and proposes their potential for uptake in the United Kingdom.,"Ammonia and Biogas from Anaerobic and Sewage Digestion for Novel Heat, Power and Transport Applications-A Techno-Economic and GHG Emissions Study for the United Kingdom",10.3390/en15062174
3,15249,"Each state-of-the-art process route recovers ammonia and uses it alongside AD-produced biomethane for three different end goals: (1) the production of H-2 as a bus transport fuel, (2) production of H-2 for injection to the gas grid and (3) generation of heat and power via solid oxide fuel cell technology.","Ammonia and Biogas from Anaerobic and Sewage Digestion for Novel Heat, Power and Transport Applications-A Techno-Economic and GHG Emissions Study for the United Kingdom",10.3390/en15062174
4,15249,"A rigorous assessment of UK anaerobic and sewage digestion facilities revealed the production of H-2 as a bus fleet transport fuel scenario as the most attractive option, with 19 SD and 42 AD existing plants of suitable scale for process implementation.","Ammonia and Biogas from Anaerobic and Sewage Digestion for Novel Heat, Power and Transport Applications-A Techno-Economic and GHG Emissions Study for the United Kingdom",10.3390/en15062174
5,15249,"This is compared to 3 SD/1 AD and 13 SD/23 AD existing plants applicable with the aim of grid injection and SOFC processing, respectively.","Ammonia and Biogas from Anaerobic and Sewage Digestion for Novel Heat, Power and Transport Applications-A Techno-Economic and GHG Emissions Study for the United Kingdom",10.3390/en15062174
6,15249,"GHG emission analysis found that new plants using the NWaste2H2 technology could enable GHG reductions of up to 4.3 and 3.6 kg CO(2)e for each kg bio-CH4 supplied as feedstock for UK SD and AD plants, respectively.","Ammonia and Biogas from Anaerobic and Sewage Digestion for Novel Heat, Power and Transport Applications-A Techno-Economic and GHG Emissions Study for the United Kingdom",10.3390/en15062174
