4,12648,Symmetric SOFCs incorporating either LSFNi or CLSFNi electrodes give excellent peak power densities of similar to 900 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C in wet H-2/air (3% H2O).,Ce-doped La0.7Sr0.3Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ as symmetrical electrodes for high performance direct hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c7ta03001k
5,12648,"In wet CH4/air (3% H2O), the CLSFNi electrode greatly outperforms the LSFNi electrode (522 mW cm(-2) vs. 221 mW cm(-2)) due to the enhanced methane reforming activity imparted by the cerium doping.",Ce-doped La0.7Sr0.3Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ as symmetrical electrodes for high performance direct hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c7ta03001k
6,12648,"The performance and stability of the CLSFNi symmetric cell under direct CH4 operation are among the best reported to date in the literature, indicating that CLSFNi is a promising electrode material for symmetrical SOFCs.",Ce-doped La0.7Sr0.3Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ as symmetrical electrodes for high performance direct hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c7ta03001k
