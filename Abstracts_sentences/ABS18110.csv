1,18110,LaGaO3 and LaGaO3 doped with various amounts of Sr and Mg were prepared using the solid-state reaction method.,Raman studies of LaGaO3 and doped LaGaO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00350-6
2,18110,"Room temperature Raman spectra of the compounds exhibited a striking decrease in the number of bands on doping either B site only, or both A and B sites of the Perovskite structure, as compared with undoped LaGaO3.",Raman studies of LaGaO3 and doped LaGaO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00350-6
3,18110,This phenomenon indicates that the doping enhanced the symmetry of the crystal structure.,Raman studies of LaGaO3 and doped LaGaO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00350-6
4,18110,"In addition, the spectra of all doped compounds showed new Raman bands at around 700 cm(-1), probably due to local symmetry decrease, caused by the oxygen vacancy induced by doping.",Raman studies of LaGaO3 and doped LaGaO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00350-6
5,18110,"Raman spectra at elevated temperatures revealed that some LaGaO3 doped at both A and B sites became almost cubic structure at 1000 degrees C. Electrical conductivity was also measured, which is considered to be related to the long- and short-range symmetry changes observed with Raman spectra.",Raman studies of LaGaO3 and doped LaGaO3,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00350-6
