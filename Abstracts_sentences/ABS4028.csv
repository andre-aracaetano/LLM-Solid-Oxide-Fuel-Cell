1,4028,The La0.7Sr0.3CrO3 (LSC) powders were prepared using liquid-solid reaction method.,Ferritic Stainless Steels Coated a Dense La0.7Sr0.3CrO3 Layer as Interconnects for SOFCs,10.14233/ajchem.2013.OH57
2,4028,The LSC ceramic layer was coated by plasma spraying on ferritic stainless steels to form a dense LSC film to resist high temperature oxidation corrosion.,Ferritic Stainless Steels Coated a Dense La0.7Sr0.3CrO3 Layer as Interconnects for SOFCs,10.14233/ajchem.2013.OH57
3,4028,The results show the crystal phase of the coated layer is perovskite structure and the LSC coated layer is dense and the mass loss of the interconnects is 0.3 mg/cm(2) after heating at 850 degrees C for 60 h.,Ferritic Stainless Steels Coated a Dense La0.7Sr0.3CrO3 Layer as Interconnects for SOFCs,10.14233/ajchem.2013.OH57
