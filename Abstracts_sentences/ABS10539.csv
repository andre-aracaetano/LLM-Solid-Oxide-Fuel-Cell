1,10539,"Ni-YSZ cermet is commonly used as the anode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) because it has excellent electrochemical performance, not only in hydrogen fuel, but also in a clean blended synthetic coal syngas mixture (30% H(2), 26% H(2)O, 23% CO, and 21% CO(2)).",The effect of phosphine in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.044
2,10539,"However, trace impurities, such as phosphine (PH(3)), in coal-derived syngas can cause degradation in cell performance [J.P. Trembly, R.S. Gemmen, D.J. Bayless, J. Power Sources 163 (2007) 986-996].",The effect of phosphine in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.044
3,10539,A commercial solid oxide fuel cell was exposed to a syngas with 10 ppm PH(3) under a constant current load at 800 degrees C and its performance was evaluated periodically using electrochemical methods.,The effect of phosphine in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.044
4,10539,The central part of the anode was exposed directly to the syngas without an intervening current collector.,The effect of phosphine in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.044
5,10539,"Post-mortem analyses of the SOFC anode were performed using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).",The effect of phosphine in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.044
6,10539,The results show that the impurity PH3 caused a significant loss of the Ni-YSZ anode electrochemical performance and an irreversible Ni-YSZ structural modification.,The effect of phosphine in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.044
