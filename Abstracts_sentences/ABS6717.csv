1,6717,"The study examines a novel system that combined a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) for cooling, heating and power production (trigeneration) through exergy analysis.","Exergy analysis of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell and organic Rankine cycle for cooling, heating and power production",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.075
2,6717,"The system consists of an SOFC, an ORC, a heat exchanger and a single-effect absorption chiller.","Exergy analysis of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell and organic Rankine cycle for cooling, heating and power production",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.075
3,6717,The system is modeled to produce a net electricity of around 500 kW. The study reveals that there is 3-25% gain on exergy efficiency when trigeneration is used compared with the power cycle only.,"Exergy analysis of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell and organic Rankine cycle for cooling, heating and power production",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.075
4,6717,"Also, the study shows that as the current density of the SOFC increases, the exergy efficiencies of power cycle, cooling cogeneration, heating cogeneration and trigeneration decreases.","Exergy analysis of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell and organic Rankine cycle for cooling, heating and power production",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.075
5,6717,"In addition, it was shown that the effect of changing the turbine inlet pressure and ORC pump inlet temperature are insignificant on the exergy efficiencies of the power cycle, cooling cogeneration, heating cogeneration and trigeneration.","Exergy analysis of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell and organic Rankine cycle for cooling, heating and power production",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.075
6,6717,"Also, the study reveals that the significant sources of exergy destruction are the ORC evaporator, air heat exchanger at the SOFC inlet and heating process heat exchanger.","Exergy analysis of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell and organic Rankine cycle for cooling, heating and power production",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.075
