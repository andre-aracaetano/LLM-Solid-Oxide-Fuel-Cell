1,14770,"A supported lanthanum gallate (LSGM) electrolyte thin-film solid oxide fuel cell with Ni-YSZ cermet anode and strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM)-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) composite cathode was, for the first time, fabricated and tested.",Fabrication and testing of a doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte thin-film solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1496485
2,14770,"The cell was prepared by an unconventional approach, in which an LSGM thin film (about 15 mum thick) was first deposited on a porous substrate such as a porous YSZ disk by a wet process and sintered at a high temperature (above 1400degrees C).",Fabrication and testing of a doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte thin-film solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1496485
3,14770,NiO was then incorporated into the porous substrate by a carefully controlled impregnation process and fired at a much lower temperature.,Fabrication and testing of a doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte thin-film solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1496485
4,14770,"In this way, the severe reaction between LSGM and NiO at a high temperature, which is required for the full densification of LSGM film, can be avoided.",Fabrication and testing of a doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte thin-film solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1496485
5,14770,A strontium-doped LaMnO3 (LSM)-YSZ composite cathode was screen printed on the surface of the LSGM film and then fired at 1250degrees C.,Fabrication and testing of a doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte thin-film solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1496485
6,14770,The electrolyte resistances of the SOFC single cells fabricated by this approach are much lower compared to those of thick LSGM film supported cells.,Fabrication and testing of a doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte thin-film solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1496485
7,14770,A maximum output power density of over 0.85 W/cm(2) at 800degreesC with H-2 as fuel and air as oxidant for a fabricated cell was achieved.,Fabrication and testing of a doped lanthanum gallate electrolyte thin-film solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1496485
