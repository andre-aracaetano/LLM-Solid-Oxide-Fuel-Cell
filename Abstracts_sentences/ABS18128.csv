1,18128,Chrome poisoning effects of various Cr-containing metal sources on the electrochemical performance of the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF6428) cathode have been investigated.,Effects of chrome contamination on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode used in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2181435
2,18128,"It was found that chromia-forming metals caused significant fade in power density due to the chrome poisoning, while alumina-forming alloys exhibited no influence on the cell degradation.",Effects of chrome contamination on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode used in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2181435
3,18128,This degradation caused by the chrome poisoning was accelerated at higher operating temperatures.,Effects of chrome contamination on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode used in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2181435
4,18128,"Microstructural analysis conducted on the cells tested with chromia formers exhibited the formation of a strontium chromate phase in the entire cathode, leading to the homogeneous distribution of Cr in the cathode.",Effects of chrome contamination on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode used in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2181435
5,18128,"Although the Mn-containing chromia former such as Crofer22 formed a continuous layer of the Cr-Mn oxide scale on the mesh surface, it was not effective enough to prevent Cr poisoning of the cathode.",Effects of chrome contamination on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode used in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2181435
6,18128,"In contrast, alumina formers such as Haynes214 and Kanthal formed a continuous layer of the alumina scale, resulting in no Cr contamination in the LSCF6428 cathode.",Effects of chrome contamination on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode used in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2181435
