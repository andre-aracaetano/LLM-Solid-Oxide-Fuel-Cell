1,11399,"Possible interactions between La(0.9)Sr(0.1)Ga(0.8)Mg(0.2)O(2.85) and Gd(2)O(3)-doped CeO(2) (solid electrolyte and anode binding materials, respectively, for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)) at 1300 degrees C were studied with diffusion couples and fired powder mixtures.",Interactions between lanthanum gallate based solid electrolyte and ceria,10.1016/S0025-5408(99)00220-2
2,11399,The SrLaGa(3)O(7) compound was detected and its formation was attributed to the diffusion of La(2)O(3) from La(0.9)Sr(0.1)Ga(0.8)Mg(0.2)O(2.85) into Ce(1-x)La(x)O(2-x/2) solid solution.,Interactions between lanthanum gallate based solid electrolyte and ceria,10.1016/S0025-5408(99)00220-2
3,11399,"As the resistivity of SrLaGa(3)O(7) is rather high, around 1 M.ohm at 800 degrees C, its presence in the solid electrolyte/anode interface could significantly increase the internal resistivity of an SOFC.",Interactions between lanthanum gallate based solid electrolyte and ceria,10.1016/S0025-5408(99)00220-2
