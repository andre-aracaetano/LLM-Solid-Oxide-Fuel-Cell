1,11773,Liquid-phase infiltration of nickel (Ni) nanoparticles in Ni/yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells can improve anode performance provided that the infiltrated nanoparticles on YSZ connect to form conducting pathways and the Ni nanoparticles do not coarsen significantly.,Co-infiltration of Nickel and Mixed Conducting Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ and La0.6Sr0.3Ni0.15Cr0.85O3-δ Phases in Ni-YSZ Anodes for Improved Stability and Performance,10.1007/s11837-019-03723-1

3,11773,"Two mixed conducting oxides have been studied: Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (GDC), a predominantly ionic conductor, and La0.6Sr0.3Ni0.15Cr0.85O3-delta (LSNC), a predominantly electronic conductor.",Co-infiltration of Nickel and Mixed Conducting Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ and La0.6Sr0.3Ni0.15Cr0.85O3-δ Phases in Ni-YSZ Anodes for Improved Stability and Performance,10.1007/s11837-019-03723-1
4,11773,Experimental results show that both oxides improve the nickel nanoparticle stability and charge transfer kinetics.,Co-infiltration of Nickel and Mixed Conducting Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ and La0.6Sr0.3Ni0.15Cr0.85O3-δ Phases in Ni-YSZ Anodes for Improved Stability and Performance,10.1007/s11837-019-03723-1
5,11773,"However, the electrochemical performance of the Ni-GDC-infiltrated electrode is much better than that of the Ni-LSNC-infiltrated electrode.",Co-infiltration of Nickel and Mixed Conducting Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ and La0.6Sr0.3Ni0.15Cr0.85O3-δ Phases in Ni-YSZ Anodes for Improved Stability and Performance,10.1007/s11837-019-03723-1
6,11773,"This is attributed to the citrate-nitrate combustion reaction required to form LSNC, which fills the pores of the anode and inhibits gas diffusion, reducing the performance of the Ni-LSNC-infiltrated electrode.",Co-infiltration of Nickel and Mixed Conducting Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ and La0.6Sr0.3Ni0.15Cr0.85O3-δ Phases in Ni-YSZ Anodes for Improved Stability and Performance,10.1007/s11837-019-03723-1
