1,13499,Here we demonstrated a simple low-cost approach to dramatically increase the power density of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using an improved anode functional layer (AFL) structure.,Bimodally integrated anode functional layer for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm34465c
2,13499,"By infiltrating a very small amount (similar to 2 wt%) of Ni and Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95(GDC) precursor solution into a submicron-sized, colloidally deposited AFL, a high power density cost-effective bimodally integrated AFL (BI-AFL) was produced.",Bimodally integrated anode functional layer for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm34465c
3,13499,Microstructural analysis of this BI-AFL revealed that the superimposed ultra-fine features surrounding a submicron Ni-GDC particulate structure remained even after high temperature sintering.,Bimodally integrated anode functional layer for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm34465c
4,13499,"Applying this BI-AFL on an anode-supported SOFC yielded a maximum power density (MPD) of similar to 1.2 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, a similar to 3x increase compared to SOFC without an AFL.",Bimodally integrated anode functional layer for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm34465c
5,13499,Electrochemical impedance results showed a striking decrease in both ohmic and non-ohmic electrode area specific resistances (ASR) compared to SOFCs with either no AFL or a conventional AFL.,Bimodally integrated anode functional layer for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm34465c
6,13499,The effect of the BI-AFL structure on improving SOFC performance was even greater at lower temperature.,Bimodally integrated anode functional layer for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm34465c
7,13499,These results indicate that a network structure with bimodal particle size distribution in the AFL dramatically increased triple phase boundary (TPB) length and enhanced the interfacial contact between anode and electrolyte.,Bimodally integrated anode functional layer for lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm34465c
