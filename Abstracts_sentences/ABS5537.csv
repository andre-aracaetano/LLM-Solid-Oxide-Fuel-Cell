1,5537,The layered perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta (PBSC) was investigated as a cathode material for a solid oxide fuel cell using an oxide proton conductor based on BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY).,Layered peroyskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ as high performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells using oxide proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.088
2,5537,"The sintering conditions for the PBSC-BZCY composite cathode were optimized, resulting in the lowest area-specific resistance and apparent activation energy obtained with the cathode sintered at 1200 degrees C for 2h.",Layered peroyskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ as high performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells using oxide proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.088
3,5537,"The maximum power densities of the PBSC-BZCY/BZCY/NiO-BZCY cell were 0.179, 0.274, 0.395, and 0.522 W cm(-2) at 550, 600, 650, and 700 degrees C. respectively with a 15 mu m thick electrolyte.",Layered peroyskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ as high performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells using oxide proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.088
4,5537,A relatively low cell interfacial polarization resistance of 0.132 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C indicated that the PBSC-BZCY could be a good cathode candidate for intermediate temperature SOFCs with BZCY electrolyte.,Layered peroyskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ as high performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells using oxide proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.088
