3,19468,"Textured and non-textured Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta/Al2O3 (SDC/AO) solid electrolyte multilayers were prepared, and the dependence of conductivity on layer number was studied.",Contrary interfacial effects for textured and non-textured multilayer solid oxide electrolytes,10.1039/c6ra03139k
4,19468,"We found that non-textured and textured multilayers show a positive and a negative interfacial conduction contribution to the total ionic conductivity, respectively.",Contrary interfacial effects for textured and non-textured multilayer solid oxide electrolytes,10.1039/c6ra03139k
5,19468,The decrease of conductivity with the increase of layer number for textured SDC/AO was attributed to that the multilayered structure introduces random grain orientations to the interfacial region which results in more pronounced grain boundary blocking effects.,Contrary interfacial effects for textured and non-textured multilayer solid oxide electrolytes,10.1039/c6ra03139k
6,19468,"In contrast, non-textured SDC/AO show rich structural defects in the interfacial regions which facilitate the oxygen ionic transport and lead to a higher ionic conductivity.",Contrary interfacial effects for textured and non-textured multilayer solid oxide electrolytes,10.1039/c6ra03139k
