1,17799,The microstructural effects of the reduction step in the reactive consolidation of slurry processed Mn1.5Co1.5O4 coated Crofer 22 APU were studied using cross-sectional scanning and transmission electron microscopies.,Microstructural effects of the reduction step in reactive consolidation of manganese cobaltite coatings on Crofer 22 APU,10.1179/0960340914Z.00000000090
2,17799,Alloy samples were coated with a Mn1.5Co1.5O4 slurry and then reduced in moist H-2 based forming gas at 850 degrees C for 4 h. The reduced coating contained particles of MnO with the NaCl structure and Co with the face centred cubic (FCC) structure.,Microstructural effects of the reduction step in reactive consolidation of manganese cobaltite coatings on Crofer 22 APU,10.1179/0960340914Z.00000000090
3,17799,The interface exhibited a thin dense chromia layer with a thicker porous MnCr2O4 overlayer with needle-like protrusions into the reduced coating.,Microstructural effects of the reduction step in reactive consolidation of manganese cobaltite coatings on Crofer 22 APU,10.1179/0960340914Z.00000000090
4,17799,Evidence for inter-reactions during the concurrent coating reduction and substrate oxidation include Co rich metallic inclusions in the spinel layer and an enrichment of the spinel in Mn with distance from the chromia layer.,Microstructural effects of the reduction step in reactive consolidation of manganese cobaltite coatings on Crofer 22 APU,10.1179/0960340914Z.00000000090
5,17799,The consequences of these observations for the complex microstructural variation during subsequent reoxidation and long term thermal exposure are discussed.,Microstructural effects of the reduction step in reactive consolidation of manganese cobaltite coatings on Crofer 22 APU,10.1179/0960340914Z.00000000090
