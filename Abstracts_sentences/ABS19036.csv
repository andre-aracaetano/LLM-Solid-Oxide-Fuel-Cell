2,19036,YBSCCO and SDC oxides are synthesized by the sol-gel method.,Enhanced electrochemical performance of the YBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.4Cu0.6O5+δ cathode material by Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 incorporation for solid oxide fuel cells application,10.1007/s10971-020-05409-6
3,19036,The XRD result reveals that no obvious chemical reaction occurs after sintering the mixture of the YBSCCO and SDC at 850 degrees C for 20 h. The thermal expansion behavior shows that the YBSCCO-xSDC composite cathode has the suitable TEC values (13.3-11.2 x 10(-6) K-1) for the common electrolyte.,Enhanced electrochemical performance of the YBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.4Cu0.6O5+δ cathode material by Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 incorporation for solid oxide fuel cells application,10.1007/s10971-020-05409-6
