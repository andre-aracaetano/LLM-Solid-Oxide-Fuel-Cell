1,17814,The steam-methane reforming reaction on a Ni-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) cermet was experimentally investigated under atmospheric pressure and in the temperature range from 650 to 750 degrees C. We examined the effects of the partial pressures of methane and steam in the supply gas on the reaction rate.,Formulation of steam-methane reforming rate in Ni-YSZ porous anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s00231-018-2299-1
2,17814,The experiments were conducted with a low Ni contained Ni-YSZ cermet sheet of thickness 0.1 mm.,Formulation of steam-methane reforming rate in Ni-YSZ porous anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s00231-018-2299-1
3,17814,Its porous microstructure and accompanied parameters were quantified using the FIB-SEM (focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy) technique.,Formulation of steam-methane reforming rate in Ni-YSZ porous anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s00231-018-2299-1
4,17814,A power-law-type rate equation incorporating the reaction-rate-limiting conditions was obtained on the basis of the unit surface area of the Ni-pore contact surface in the cermet.,Formulation of steam-methane reforming rate in Ni-YSZ porous anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s00231-018-2299-1
5,17814,The kinetics indicated a strong positive dependence on the methane partial pressure and a negative dependence on the steam partial pressure.,Formulation of steam-methane reforming rate in Ni-YSZ porous anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s00231-018-2299-1
6,17814,The obtained rate equation successfully reproduced the experimental results for Ni-YSZ samples having different microstructures in the case of low methane consumption.,Formulation of steam-methane reforming rate in Ni-YSZ porous anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s00231-018-2299-1
7,17814,The equation also reproduced the limiting-reaction behaviours at different temperatures.,Formulation of steam-methane reforming rate in Ni-YSZ porous anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s00231-018-2299-1
