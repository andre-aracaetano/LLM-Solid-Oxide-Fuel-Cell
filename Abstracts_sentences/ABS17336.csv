1,17336,Germanate apatites with composition La10-xGe5.5Al0.5O26.75-3x/2 have been evaluated for the first time as possible electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Lanthanum Germanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte for SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000024
2,17336,"Different electrode materials have been considered in this study, i.e. manganite, ferrite, nickelates and cobaltite as cathode materials; and NiO-CGO composite and chromium-manganite as anodes.",Lanthanum Germanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte for SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000024
3,17336,The chemical compatibility and electrochemical performance of these electrodes with La9.8Ge5.5Al0.5O26.45 have been studied by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and impedance spectroscopy.,Lanthanum Germanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte for SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000024
4,17336,"The XRPD analysis did not reveal appreciable bulk reactivity with the formation of reaction products between the germanate electrolyte and these electrodes up to 1,200 degrees C. However, a significant cation interdiffusion was observed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which leads to a significant decrease of the performance of these electrodes.",Lanthanum Germanate-Based Apatites as Electrolyte for SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201000024
