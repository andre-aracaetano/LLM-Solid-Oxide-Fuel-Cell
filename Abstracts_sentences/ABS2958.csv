1,2958,The dependence of the residual stress in cylindrical solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) on the structures and the process temperatures was estimated using the analytical modeling of an axisymmetric structure.,Residual stress analysis of cylindrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.105.1057
2,2958,From the results of the analysis the following points were discovered.,Residual stress analysis of cylindrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.105.1057
3,2958,"In the case of a 4-layered structure, which is supported by a porous insulation tube of calcia-stabilized zirconia (CSZ), the circumferential and axial stresses induced in the electrodes are so high that they can break the structure under the assumed realistic conditions.",Residual stress analysis of cylindrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.105.1057
4,2958,A method for reducing these stresses is discussed.,Residual stress analysis of cylindrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.105.1057
5,2958,"On the other hand, in the case of a 3-layered structure which is supported by an inner electrode tube, tensile stresses in the electrodes can be reduced to several MPa if the total thickness of two electrodes is more than 60 times the thickness of the electrolyte.",Residual stress analysis of cylindrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.105.1057
6,2958,New material for the substrate tube is proposed on the basis of the obtained results.,Residual stress analysis of cylindrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.105.1057
