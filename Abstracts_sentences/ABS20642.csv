2,20642,The YSZ film greatly enlarged the number of electrochemical reaction sites (ERSs) by increasing the TPB.,Performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 cathode modified by sol-gel coating technique,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01037-0
3,20642,"The composite cathode was formed on thin YSZ electrolyte (about 30 mum thickness) supported on an anode and then I-V characterization and ac impedance analyses were performed at temperatures between 700 and 800 degreesC. As a result of the impedance analysis on the cell at 800 degreesC, with humidified hydrogen as the fuel and air as the oxidant, the element R-2 around the frequency of 1000 Hz is identified as the anode polarization, R-2 around the frequency of 100 Hz is identified as the cathode polarization and R-3 below the frequency of 10 Hz is the resistance of gas phase diffusion through the anode.",Performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 cathode modified by sol-gel coating technique,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01037-0
4,20642,"The maximum power densities of the cell modified by the SDC sol-gel coating were about 0.53 W/cm(2) at 750 degreesC and about 0.19 W/cm(2) at 650 degreesC. The result implied that deposition of SDC in the pore surface of the cathode increased the area of the TPB, resulting in a decrease of cathode polarization and improved cell performance.",Performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 cathode modified by sol-gel coating technique,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)01037-0
