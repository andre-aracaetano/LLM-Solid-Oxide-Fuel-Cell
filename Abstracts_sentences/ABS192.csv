2,192,"Since a fuel cell is the main power generating source in hybrid systems, in this investigation, complete electrochemical and thermal calculations in the fuel cell are carried out in order to obtain more accurate results.",Electrochemical and Exergetic Modeling of a Combined Heat and Power System Using Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Mini Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.4025053
3,192,"An examination of the hybrid system performance indicates that increasing of the working pressure and rate of air flow into the system, cause the cell temperature to reduce, the efficiency and the power generated by the system to diminish, and the entropy generation rate and exergy destruction rate to increase.",Electrochemical and Exergetic Modeling of a Combined Heat and Power System Using Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Mini Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.4025053
4,192,"On the other hand, increasing the flow rate of the incoming fuel, the rise in cell temperature causes the efficiency, generated power, and exergy destruction rate of the system to increase.",Electrochemical and Exergetic Modeling of a Combined Heat and Power System Using Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Mini Gas Turbine,10.1115/1.4025053
