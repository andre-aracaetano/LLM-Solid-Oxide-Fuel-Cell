1,2130,The present paper provides a thermodynamic foundation and interpretation of the concept of exergetic efficiency.,Exergetic efficiency as a basis for durability analysis and prognosis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.06.066
2,2130,"The interpretation focuses on solid oxide fuel cell behavior, specifically the impedance of SOFCs as an indicator of exergetic efficiency.",Exergetic efficiency as a basis for durability analysis and prognosis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.06.066
3,2130,"Subsequently, that concept is extended to the consideration of changes in response during long-term operation, resulting in a discussion of the possible use of exergetic efficiency with the interpretation in terms of impedance as a method of prognosis of expected performance based on observed impedance changes.",Exergetic efficiency as a basis for durability analysis and prognosis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.06.066
