1,1093,Composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells composed of metallic silver dispersed in ceramic (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-sigma) matrix were prepared on the surface of solid electrolyte by two-step procedure.,COMPOSITE Ag-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-σ CATHODE FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.2478/amm-2013-0170
2,1093,First the matrix of controlled porosity was created by sintering mixture of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-sigma powder with the organic polymer beads then the matrix was saturated with AgNO3 solution and sintered again.,COMPOSITE Ag-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-σ CATHODE FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.2478/amm-2013-0170
3,1093,Such obtained cathodes showed higher electrical conductivity and lower charge transfer resistance in oxygen reduction reaction in comparison to pure ceramic cathodes.,COMPOSITE Ag-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-σ CATHODE FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.2478/amm-2013-0170
