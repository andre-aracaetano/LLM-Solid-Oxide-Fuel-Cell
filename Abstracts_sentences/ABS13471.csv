1,13471,Rare earth silicate apatites are one-dimensional channel structures that show potential as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) due to their high ionic conductivity at intermediate temperatures (500-700 degrees C).,Interstitial Oxide Ion Distribution and Transport Mechanism in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/jacs.5b13409
2,13471,"This advantageous property can be attributed to the presence of both interstitial oxygen and cation vacancies, that create diffusion paths which computational studies suggest are less tortuous and have lower activation energies for migration than in stoichiometric compounds.",Interstitial Oxide Ion Distribution and Transport Mechanism in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/jacs.5b13409
3,13471,"In this work, neutron diffraction of Nd(28+x)/3AlxSi6-xO26 (0 <= x <= 1.5) single crystals identified the locations of oxygen interstitials, and allowed the deduction of a dual-path conduction mechanism that is a natural extension of the single-path sinusoidal channel trajectory arrived at through computation.",Interstitial Oxide Ion Distribution and Transport Mechanism in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/jacs.5b13409
4,13471,"This discovery provides the most thorough understanding of the O2- transport mechanism along the channels to date, clarifies the mode of interchannel motion, and presents a complete picture of O2- percolation through apatite.",Interstitial Oxide Ion Distribution and Transport Mechanism in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/jacs.5b13409
5,13471,Previously reported crystallographic and conductivity measurements are re-examined in the light of these new findings.,Interstitial Oxide Ion Distribution and Transport Mechanism in Aluminum-Doped Neodymium Silicate Apatite Electrolytes,10.1021/jacs.5b13409
