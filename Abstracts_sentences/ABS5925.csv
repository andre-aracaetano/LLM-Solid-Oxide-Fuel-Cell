1,5925,Assembly of a planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) or solid electrolyzer (SOE) stack involves the lamination of cells and interconnect plates under an applied load.,Numerical Study of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Contacting Mechanics,10.1002/fuce.201700128
2,5925,In most designs a pattern of ribs on the interconnector makes contact with a porous ceramic current collector layer on the air side.,Numerical Study of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Contacting Mechanics,10.1002/fuce.201700128
3,5925,These localized contacts are regions of increased stress on the cells and can cause damage if the stresses become too large.,Numerical Study of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Contacting Mechanics,10.1002/fuce.201700128
4,5925,In this paper the mechanical response of an anode-supported cell to localized loads from interconnector ribs is simulated.,Numerical Study of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Contacting Mechanics,10.1002/fuce.201700128
5,5925,"The simulations show that the critical stress for initiating and propagating a crack in the electrolyte (approximate to 300MPa for a 10m thick electrolyte) is reached when the interconnector displacement reaches 20m (after touching the cathode) with reduced support, or 30m when in an oxidized state.",Numerical Study of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Contacting Mechanics,10.1002/fuce.201700128
6,5925,The difference is due to the lower stiffness of the reduced support.,Numerical Study of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Contacting Mechanics,10.1002/fuce.201700128
7,5925,The residual compressive stress in the electrolyte layer has a major protective effect for the electrolyte.,Numerical Study of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Contacting Mechanics,10.1002/fuce.201700128
8,5925,"It is concluded that fracture is very unlikely for a geometrically perfect contact, but if the contact is non-uniform due to manufacturing variability in the contact plate or cell, local displacements >approximate to 20m can be dangerous.",Numerical Study of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Contacting Mechanics,10.1002/fuce.201700128
9,5925,The simulations are used in an example of contacting geometry optimization.,Numerical Study of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Contacting Mechanics,10.1002/fuce.201700128
