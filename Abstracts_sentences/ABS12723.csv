1,12723,A novel method that embeds Pt voltage probes into the triple-phase boundary (TPB) is developed.,"In-Situ Investigation of Quantitative Contributions of the Anode, Cathode, and Electrolyte to the Cell Performance in Anode-Supported Planar SOFCs",10.1002/aenm.201400120
2,12723,"Moreover, the quantitative contributions of the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte to cell performance are investigated in situ for anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","In-Situ Investigation of Quantitative Contributions of the Anode, Cathode, and Electrolyte to the Cell Performance in Anode-Supported Planar SOFCs",10.1002/aenm.201400120
3,12723,"The voltage and maximum output power density (MOPD) measured by the probes, which are placed on both sides of the electrolyte, account for 97.3% and 94.4%, respectively, of those of the cell during the instantaneous current-voltage testing.","In-Situ Investigation of Quantitative Contributions of the Anode, Cathode, and Electrolyte to the Cell Performance in Anode-Supported Planar SOFCs",10.1002/aenm.201400120
4,12723,"When the stack is discharged at 0.32 A cm(-2) for 200 h, the voltage drops of the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte account for 76.9%, 15.4%, and 7.7%, respectively, of the total voltage drop of the unit cell.","In-Situ Investigation of Quantitative Contributions of the Anode, Cathode, and Electrolyte to the Cell Performance in Anode-Supported Planar SOFCs",10.1002/aenm.201400120
5,12723,The ohmic resistance of the unit cell primarily depends on the resistance that results from the TPB.,"In-Situ Investigation of Quantitative Contributions of the Anode, Cathode, and Electrolyte to the Cell Performance in Anode-Supported Planar SOFCs",10.1002/aenm.201400120
6,12723,The variation in cell resistance is mainly attributed to the increase in anode polarization resistance caused by Ni particle agglomeration.,"In-Situ Investigation of Quantitative Contributions of the Anode, Cathode, and Electrolyte to the Cell Performance in Anode-Supported Planar SOFCs",10.1002/aenm.201400120
7,12723,"However, cell voltage is more sensitive to the TPB ohmic resistance, which may be the primary factor for SOFC degradation.","In-Situ Investigation of Quantitative Contributions of the Anode, Cathode, and Electrolyte to the Cell Performance in Anode-Supported Planar SOFCs",10.1002/aenm.201400120
