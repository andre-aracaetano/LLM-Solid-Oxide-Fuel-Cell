3,13867,"Results show that, the dry-pressed LNF-2 and the high-temperature sintering-pre-treated LNF-3 possess smaller area specific resistances of 0.074 and 0.076 Omega center dot cm(2), respectively, more stable particle sizes with shorter conditioning state and faster transfer into steady state after applying 1 A/cm(2) current load at 750 degrees C. Specifically, the single cell with LNF-2 shows improved peak power density of 0.94 W/cm(2) compared to 0.66 W/cm(2) of LNF without treatment at 750 degrees C. However, it exhibits significant performance degradation during thermal cycling, decreasing by 20%.",LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 Cathode Contact Material: Electrical Conducting Property Manipulation and Its Effect on SOFC Electrochemical Performance,10.15541/jim20230353
