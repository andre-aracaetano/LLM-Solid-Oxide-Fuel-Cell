1,14802,"Two Fe-22 wt% Cr ferritic stainless steels containing varying concentrations of La (0.14 or 0.52 wt%), Cu (0.17 or 1.74 wt%) and B (48 or 109 ppm) are investigated with respect to oxidation behavior and high temperature area specific resistance (ASR) of the surface oxide scales.","Oxidation behavior and area specific resistance of La, Cu and B alloyed Fe-22Cr ferritic steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.077
2,14802,"To determine the oxidation resistance of developed steels, continuous isothermal oxidation is carried out at 800 degrees C in air, for 2000 h, and their thermally grown oxide scale is characterized using dynamic SIMS, SEM/EDX, XRD and GI-XRD techniques.","Oxidation behavior and area specific resistance of La, Cu and B alloyed Fe-22Cr ferritic steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.077
3,14802,"To assess their electrical performance, the ASR measurement by four-point probe method is conducted at 800 degrees C in air, for 400 h. In higher La content steel, the La-oxides at the scale/alloy interface promotes the oxygen transport which resulted in sub-surface oxidation of Mn, Cr, Ti and Al.","Oxidation behavior and area specific resistance of La, Cu and B alloyed Fe-22Cr ferritic steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.077
4,14802,"Moreover, the inward growth of oxides contributes to increase of Fe-Cr alloy protrusions within the scale, which reduced the ASR.","Oxidation behavior and area specific resistance of La, Cu and B alloyed Fe-22Cr ferritic steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.077
5,14802,"In contrast, sub-surface oxidation is reduced in high Cu-alloyed steel by segregated Cu at the scale/alloy interface.","Oxidation behavior and area specific resistance of La, Cu and B alloyed Fe-22Cr ferritic steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.077
6,14802,"Thus, addition of Cu is effective to oxidation resistance and also to better electrical performance.","Oxidation behavior and area specific resistance of La, Cu and B alloyed Fe-22Cr ferritic steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.077
7,14802,"However, no obvious impact of B on the scale sequence and/or ASR is observed.","Oxidation behavior and area specific resistance of La, Cu and B alloyed Fe-22Cr ferritic steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.077
