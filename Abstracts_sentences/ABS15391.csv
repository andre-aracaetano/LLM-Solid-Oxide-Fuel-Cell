1,15391,"In this paper, explain a new relationships between Bi3+ content, the phase crystal, microstructure and conductivity for Sm and Bi co-doped Ce0.8-x Sm0.2Bi (x) O1.9-1/2x (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) electrolytes prepared by co-precipitation method.","Structure, morphology and electrical conductivity of Sm and Bi co-doped CeO2 electrolytes synthesized by co-precipitation method",10.1007/s10854-018-9525-y
2,15391,The XRD patterns showed that this compounds exhibit a fluorite-type cubic structure after the samples calcined at 700 A degrees C for 4 h and the cell volumes of increased when the Bi content increased.,"Structure, morphology and electrical conductivity of Sm and Bi co-doped CeO2 electrolytes synthesized by co-precipitation method",10.1007/s10854-018-9525-y
3,15391,"In addition, for the samples sintered at 1400 A degrees C for 4 h, the Bi doping improves the relative density, the grain size and the average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC).","Structure, morphology and electrical conductivity of Sm and Bi co-doped CeO2 electrolytes synthesized by co-precipitation method",10.1007/s10854-018-9525-y
4,15391,"More in details, the relative density and TEC increase with the Bi content.","Structure, morphology and electrical conductivity of Sm and Bi co-doped CeO2 electrolytes synthesized by co-precipitation method",10.1007/s10854-018-9525-y
5,15391,"Form the AC impedance spectroscopy measurements, the conductivity of the sintered samples is found to improve with the increasing of Bi content (for x <= 0.15), which is ascribed to the increasing of the number of oxygen ion vacancies and the increase in the unit cell volume.","Structure, morphology and electrical conductivity of Sm and Bi co-doped CeO2 electrolytes synthesized by co-precipitation method",10.1007/s10854-018-9525-y
6,15391,"However, the conductivity decreases when the Bi content is further increased (0.15 < x <= 0.2), which is ascribed the reduction of the number of free oxygen vacancies.","Structure, morphology and electrical conductivity of Sm and Bi co-doped CeO2 electrolytes synthesized by co-precipitation method",10.1007/s10854-018-9525-y
7,15391,The highest conductivity at 800 A degrees C is 5.6 x 10(-2),"Structure, morphology and electrical conductivity of Sm and Bi co-doped CeO2 electrolytes synthesized by co-precipitation method",10.1007/s10854-018-9525-y
8,15391,"S/cm and the activation energy is 0.83 eV for Ce0.65Sm0.2Bi0.15O1.825, indicating that this would be a promising electrolyte for the intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cell applications.","Structure, morphology and electrical conductivity of Sm and Bi co-doped CeO2 electrolytes synthesized by co-precipitation method",10.1007/s10854-018-9525-y
