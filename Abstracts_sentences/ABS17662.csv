1,17662,Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has been used to prepare two types of superionic ceramic thin films: (i) NASICON (Na superionic conductor) for a Na ion selective membrane and (ii) the mixed electronic and oxygen conductors La(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3+/-delta) (LSM) for the cathode in solid oxide fuel cells.,Pulsed laser deposition of superionic ceramic thin films: deposition and applications in electrochemistry,10.1016/S0169-4332(97)00674-0
2,17662,NASICON thin films have good ionic conductivity with resistivities between 3 x 10(3) and 5 x 10(4) Omega cm at room temperature and they have low surface particle densities depending upon the deposition conditions.,Pulsed laser deposition of superionic ceramic thin films: deposition and applications in electrochemistry,10.1016/S0169-4332(97)00674-0
