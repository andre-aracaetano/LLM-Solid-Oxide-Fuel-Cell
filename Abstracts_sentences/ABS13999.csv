6,13999,The impedance analysis demonstrated that the co-sintered temperatures have effects on not only the polarization resistance R-P of a single cell but also its overall ohmic resistance R-S. The results indicate that the tape casting and single-step co-sintering methods are both time saving and feasible for the development of anode-supported SOFCs.,Fabrication and characterization of Ni-SSZ/SSZ/LSM-SSZ anode-supported SOFCs by tape casting and single-step co-sintering techniques,10.1007/s11581-015-1626-5
