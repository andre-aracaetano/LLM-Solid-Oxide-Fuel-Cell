1,6904,"Surface Sr segregation and phase separation are the key reasons behind the chemical instability of Sr-containing perovskite oxide surfaces and the corresponding performance degradation of solid oxide fuel cell O-2-electrodes, but to date, practical solutions to prevent this phenomenon are limited.",Isovalent doping: a new strategy to suppress surface Sr segregation of the perovskite O2-electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta02870c
2,6904,"Here, we investigate how isovalent doping (in this case, Zr substitution of Ti) changes the surface morphology, chemical composition, and thus the O(2)activation kinetics under actual operating conditions.",Isovalent doping: a new strategy to suppress surface Sr segregation of the perovskite O2-electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta02870c
3,6904,"Thin films of SrTi(0.5)Fe(0.5)O(3-delta)as a representative model perovskite O-2-electrode, with Zr doping, are fabricatedviapulsed laser deposition and their surface oxygen exchange rates are then characterizedviaelectrical conductivity relaxation assessments.",Isovalent doping: a new strategy to suppress surface Sr segregation of the perovskite O2-electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta02870c
4,6904,"Zr dopants strengthen the Sr-O bonds in the oxide lattice, inhibiting the formation of surface SrO(x)clusters and significantly reducing the deterioration of the oxygen exchange rates compared to the results from undoped film at 650 degrees C for 30 h. These observations suggest a new strategy for ensuring the surface stability of Sr-containing perovskite oxides for fuel cell O-2-electrodes.",Isovalent doping: a new strategy to suppress surface Sr segregation of the perovskite O2-electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d0ta02870c
