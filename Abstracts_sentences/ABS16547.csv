1,16547,"A mixed conducting oxide with a nominal composition Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3- (STFRu) is studied, in comparison with SrTi0.3Fe0.7O3- (STF) oxide, as an anode for solid oxide fuel cells.",The enhanced electrochemical response of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3-δ anodes due to exsolved Ru-Fe nanoparticles,10.1039/c7ta10762e
2,16547,"Exposing STFRu to reducing fuel conditions at 800 degrees C for 4 h results in the exsolution of essentially all of the Ru and a small fraction of the Fe from the oxide, and the formation of Ru1-xFex nanoparticles on the oxide surfaces.",The enhanced electrochemical response of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3-δ anodes due to exsolved Ru-Fe nanoparticles,10.1039/c7ta10762e
3,16547,"Most of the nanoparticles have the hexagonal structure expected for Ru-rich alloys, and thermogravimetric analysis suggests the composition x approximate to 0.2.",The enhanced electrochemical response of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3-δ anodes due to exsolved Ru-Fe nanoparticles,10.1039/c7ta10762e

5,16547,"Comparison of cells with STFRu and STF anodes shows that the presence of Ru induces a reduced polarization resistance and increases the maximum power density under most cell operating conditions, particularly at lower temperatures and hydrogen partial pressures.",The enhanced electrochemical response of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3-δ anodes due to exsolved Ru-Fe nanoparticles,10.1039/c7ta10762e
6,16547,"For example, at 700 degrees C and 30% H-2 fuel, the maximum power density is 0.1 W cm(-2) for STF compared to 0.3 W cm(-2) for STFRu.",The enhanced electrochemical response of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3-δ anodes due to exsolved Ru-Fe nanoparticles,10.1039/c7ta10762e
7,16547,"There is also a significant change in the shape of the current-voltage curves and the p(H2)-dependence of the anode polarization resistances R-P,R-A (p(H2))(-m), from m approximate to 0.5-1.0 for STF to m approximate to 0.11-0.29 for STFRu; these suggest that Ru1-xFex nanoparticles improve anode performance by promoting hydrogen adsorption.",The enhanced electrochemical response of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7Ru0.07)O3-δ anodes due to exsolved Ru-Fe nanoparticles,10.1039/c7ta10762e
