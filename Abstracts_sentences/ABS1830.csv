1,1830,"The cathodic polarization of strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite, La1-xSrxFeO3-alpha, was studied in the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell using proton-conducting SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-alpha as an electrolyte.",Cathodic polarization of strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.008
2,1830,"The overpotential of La0.7Sr0.3FeO3-alpha cathode was smaller than those of other perovskite-type oxides such as La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-alpha and La0.7Sr0.3CoO3-alpha, and platinum at 773-973 K. The best cathodic performance was obtained for La0.7Sr0.3FeO3-alpha heat-treated at 1173 K.",Cathodic polarization of strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.008
3,1830,The cathode resistance of La0.7Sr0.3FeO3-alpha was independent of pO(2) while that of sputtered platinum was proportional to pO(2)(-1/4).,Cathodic polarization of strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.008
