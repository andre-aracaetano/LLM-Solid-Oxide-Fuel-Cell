1,2878,A novel nano-network of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) is successfully fabricated as the cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operated at 500-600 degrees C.,Novel nano-network cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.07.022
2,2878,"The cathode is composed of SSC nanowires formed from nanobeads of less than 50nm thus exhibiting high surface area and porosity, forming straight path for oxygen ion and electron transportation, resulting in high three-phase boundaries, and consequently showing remarkably high electrode performance.",Novel nano-network cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.07.022
3,2878,An anode-supported cell with the nano-network cathode demonstrates a peak power density of 0.44 W cm(-2) at 500 degrees C and displays exceptional performance with cell operating time.,Novel nano-network cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.07.022
4,2878,The result suggests a new direction to significantly improve the SOFC performance.,Novel nano-network cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.07.022
