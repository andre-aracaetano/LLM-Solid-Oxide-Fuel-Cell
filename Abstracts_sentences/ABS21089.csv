5,21089,"However, the lattice parameters of the C-type Y2O3 were significantly lower than expected due to misfit high compression stress.","Lattice variation of cubic Y2O3 in three dimensions: Temperature, pressure and crystal size",10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161199
6,21089,"High-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) was used in order to investigate in situ crystal structure and microstructure variations of Y2O3 imbedded in MgO as formed at high temperatures free of misfit strain, comparing with in situ study of pure Y2O3 formation at the same temperature range.","Lattice variation of cubic Y2O3 in three dimensions: Temperature, pressure and crystal size",10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161199
7,21089,It was found that nanocrystalline C-type Y2O3 was formed at a temperature range of 873-1163 K. Lattice parameters and crystal size were evaluated by using Rietveld refinement and high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM).,"Lattice variation of cubic Y2O3 in three dimensions: Temperature, pressure and crystal size",10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161199
8,21089,The relative lattice parameter changes as a function of crystal size were obtained by analyzing the in situ HT-XRD data from 873 to 1573 K. Those results along with those obtained at room temperature showed a non-monotonic trend: lattice contraction versus decreasing crystal size at the range of 60-45 nm crystal size and lattice expansion versus decreasing crystal size for smaller crystals (approximately 0.11%).,"Lattice variation of cubic Y2O3 in three dimensions: Temperature, pressure and crystal size",10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161199
9,21089,The non-monotonic lattice variation was modeled by assuming two effects acting simultaneously as a function of crystal size: lattice contraction due to hydrostatic pressure caused by the surface tension and Madelung model predicting lattice expansion due to weakening of bonding force in small ionic crystals.,"Lattice variation of cubic Y2O3 in three dimensions: Temperature, pressure and crystal size",10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161199
10,21089,The calculated theoretical lattice parameters values which were obtained by using this model were compared to the experimental results yielding a better understanding of the lattice variations in nano-Y2O3.,"Lattice variation of cubic Y2O3 in three dimensions: Temperature, pressure and crystal size",10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161199
