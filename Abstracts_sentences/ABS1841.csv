3,1841,"Here we reported that an oxide hybrid, featuring a nanoporous Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) catalyst coating bonded onto the internal surface of a high-porosity La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) backbone, exhibited superior catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions and thereby yielded low interfacial resistances in air, e. g., 0.021 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C and 0.043 Omega cm(2) at 6006=degrees C. We further demonstrated that such a micro-nano porous hybrid, adopted as the cathode in a thin LSGM electrolyte fuel cell, produced impressive power densities of 2.02 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C and 1.46 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C when operated on humidified hydrogen fuel and air oxidant.",A micro-nano porous oxide hybrid for efficient oxygen reduction in reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1038/srep00462
