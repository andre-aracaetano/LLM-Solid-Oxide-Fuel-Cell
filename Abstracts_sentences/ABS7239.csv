1,7239,This paper is focused on the performance of the 1 MW plant designed and developed by Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited.,Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
2,7239,"The system consists of a two stage turbogenerator coupled with pressure vessels containing the fuel cell stack, internal reformer, cathode ejector, anode ejector, and off-gas burner.",Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
3,7239,"While the overall scheme is relatively simple, due to the limited number of components, the interaction between the components is complex and the system behavior is determined by many parameters.",Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
4,7239,"In particular, two important subsystems such as the cathode and the anode recycle loops must be carefully analyzed also considering their interaction with and influence on the turbogenerator performance.",Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
5,7239,"The system performance model represents the whole, and each physical component is modeled in detail as a subsystem.",Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
6,7239,The component models have been validated or are under verification.,Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
7,7239,The model provides all the operating parameters in each characteristic point of the plant and a complete distribution of thermodynamics and chemical parameters inside the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack and reformer.,Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
8,7239,"In order to characterize the system behavior, its operating envelope has been calculated taking into account the effect of ambient temperature and pressure, as described in the paper.",Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
9,7239,"Given the complexity of the system, various constraints have to be considered in order to obtain a safe operating condition not only for the system as a whole but also for each of its parts.",Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
10,7239,"In particular each point calculated has to comply with several constraints such as stack temperature distribution, maximum and minimum temperatures, and high and low pressure spool maximum rotational speeds.",Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
11,7239,The model developed and the results presented in the paper provide important information for the definition of an appropriate control strategy and a first step in the development of a robust and optimized control system.,Modeling and Performance Analysis of the Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited: 1 MW Plant,10.1115/1.4000600
