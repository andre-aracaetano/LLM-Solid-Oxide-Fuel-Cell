1,5201,This study investigates Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC)-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) composite cathodes with a gradual change in composition from electrolyte to the cathode in an attempt to discover a potential approach applicable to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Electrochemical characterization of gradient Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathodes on Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.09.041
2,5201,The gradual change in composition from electrolyte to cathode shows the decline in charge transfer resistance (R-2) and gas phase diffusion resistance (R-3).,Electrochemical characterization of gradient Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathodes on Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.09.041
3,5201,"Because the value of R-3 is always larger than R-2 and R-3 significantly dominates the total cathode polarization resistance (R-P) at temperatures within the range of 750-850 degrees C, i.e., in this temperature range, the rate-determining step is dominated by the diffusion or dissociative adsorption of oxygen.",Electrochemical characterization of gradient Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathodes on Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.09.041
4,5201,"The functionally gradient cathode with a graded interface between cathode and electrolyte reveals both a higher exchange current density (i(0)) and a lower activation energy for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which suggests that the ORR kinetics can be improved by using the configuration of a functionally gradient cathode.",Electrochemical characterization of gradient Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathodes on Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.09.041
