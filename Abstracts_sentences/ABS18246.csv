1,18246,Lanthanum manganite substituted with strontium is a strong candidate for use as a mixed conductor at the cathode site in solid-oxide fuel-cell systems.,A co-precipitation procedure for the synthesis of LSM material,
2,18246,In the present work a co-precipitation method for the preparation of LSM is described and some material properties are reported.,A co-precipitation procedure for the synthesis of LSM material,
3,18246,"Since the co-precipitation involved calcination at 1000 degrees C and subsequent sintering, the crystalline phase development and the material homogeneity were followed by X-ray powder diffraction.",A co-precipitation procedure for the synthesis of LSM material,
4,18246,It was found that no secondary crystalline phases were present in the system when the samples were thermally treated up to 1200 degrees C.,A co-precipitation procedure for the synthesis of LSM material,
5,18246,The sintering behaviour of the calcined powders and their density evolution are also reported.,A co-precipitation procedure for the synthesis of LSM material,
6,18246,Relatively dense bodies were prepared after thermal treatment at 1200 degrees C for 2 hours.,A co-precipitation procedure for the synthesis of LSM material,
7,18246,The electrical characteristics of the material were determined from screen-printed LSM sintered layers.,A co-precipitation procedure for the synthesis of LSM material,
8,18246,The electrical conductivity of the screen-printed layers increased with the sintering temperature due to an additional densification effect.,A co-precipitation procedure for the synthesis of LSM material,
