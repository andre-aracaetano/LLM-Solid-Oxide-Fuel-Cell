1,10222,"This study focuses on mechanisms and symptoms of several simulated failure modes, which may have significant influences on the long-term durability and operational stability of intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), including fuel/oxidation starvation by breakdown of fuel/air supply components and wet and dry cycling atmospheres.",Degradation analysis of anode-supported intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells under various failure modes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.077
2,10222,Anode-supported IT-SOFCs consisting of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF)-Nd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (NDC) composite cathode with an NDC electrolyte on a Ni-NDC anode substrate are fabricated via dry-pressings followed by the co-firing method.,Degradation analysis of anode-supported intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells under various failure modes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.077
3,10222,Comprehensive and systematic research based on the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) of anode-supported IT-SOFCs is conducted using various electrochemical and physiochemical analysis techniques to extend our understanding of the major mechanisms of performance deterioration under SOFC operating conditions.,Degradation analysis of anode-supported intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells under various failure modes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.077
4,10222,The fuel-starvation condition in the fuel-pump failure mode causes irreversible mechanical degradation of the electrolyte and cathode interface by the dimensional expansion of the anode support due to the oxidation of Ni metal to NiO.,Degradation analysis of anode-supported intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells under various failure modes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.077
5,10222,"In contrast, the BSCF cathode shows poor stability under wet and dry cycling modes of cathode air due to the strong electroactivity of SrO with H2O. On the other hand, the air-depletion phenomena under air-pump failure mode results in the recovery of cell performance during the long-term operation without the visible microstructural transformation through the reduction of anode overvoltage.",Degradation analysis of anode-supported intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells under various failure modes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.077
