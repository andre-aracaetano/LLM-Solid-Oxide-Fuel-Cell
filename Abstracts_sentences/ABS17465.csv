1,17465,The crystallographic properties of the Ce1-x(Nd0.63Dy0.37)(x)O2-x/2 system (0 <= x <= 0.6) were studied by means of synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and compared to the ones of Sm-doped ceria.,"Effect of the (Nd,Dy)-Double Doping on the Structural Properties of Ceria",10.3390/inorganics7080094
2,17465,The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of substituting Sm3+ by a mixture of a smaller and a larger ion that ensures a more pronounced Ce4+/dopant size mismatch while having the same average ionic size as Sm3+.,"Effect of the (Nd,Dy)-Double Doping on the Structural Properties of Ceria",10.3390/inorganics7080094
3,17465,"Two main findings came to light: (a) the compositional region of the CeO2-based solid solution widens up to x ranging between 0.4 and 0.5, and (b) the cell parameter is larger than the one of Sm-doped ceria at each composition.","Effect of the (Nd,Dy)-Double Doping on the Structural Properties of Ceria",10.3390/inorganics7080094
4,17465,Both effects are expected to play a significant role on the ionic conductivity of the material.,"Effect of the (Nd,Dy)-Double Doping on the Structural Properties of Ceria",10.3390/inorganics7080094
5,17465,The results are discussed in terms of disorder and cation-vacancy association.,"Effect of the (Nd,Dy)-Double Doping on the Structural Properties of Ceria",10.3390/inorganics7080094
