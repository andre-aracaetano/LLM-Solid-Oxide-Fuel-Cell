1,11760,"In this work, a 3D multi-physics coupled model was developed to analyze the temperature and thermal stress distribution in a planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack, and then the effects of different flow channels (co-flow, counter-flow and cross-flow) and electrolyte thickness were investigated.",Numerical Analysis of Thermal Stress for a Stack of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en15010343
2,11760,The simulation results indicate that the generated power is higher while the thermal stress is lower in the co-flow mode than those in the cross-flow mode.,Numerical Analysis of Thermal Stress for a Stack of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en15010343
3,11760,"In the cross-flow mode, a gas inlet and outlet arrangement is proposed to increase current density by about 10%.",Numerical Analysis of Thermal Stress for a Stack of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en15010343
4,11760,"The generated power of the stack increases with a thin electrolyte layer, but the temperature and its gradient of the stack also increase with increase of heat generation.",Numerical Analysis of Thermal Stress for a Stack of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en15010343
5,11760,The thermal stress for two typical sealing materials is also studied.,Numerical Analysis of Thermal Stress for a Stack of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en15010343
6,11760,The predicted results can be used for design and optimization of the stack structure to achieve lower stress and longer life.,Numerical Analysis of Thermal Stress for a Stack of Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en15010343
