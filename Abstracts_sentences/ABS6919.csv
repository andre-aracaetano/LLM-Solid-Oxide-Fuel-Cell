5,6919,"Comprehensive conclusions are clearly achieved with the simulation results: (a) the positive effect of increasing electrolyte thickness on suppressing current leakage becomes pronounced in the situation of high electron-hole conductivities and poor electrode performances; (b) as the electron-hole conductivity is increased, the Faraday efficiency, energy efficiency, and power density decline monotonously and linearly, and the decline rate grows with the thinning the electrolyte layer; (c) boosting the electrode performance can mitigate the voltage and current loss caused by current leakage.",Multifactor theoretical analysis of current leakage in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230038
