1,2778,In the present research spray pyrolysis technique is employed to synthesize 10%Gd-doped ceria (GDC) thin films on ceramic substrates with an intention to use the film/substrate structure in solid oxide fuel cells GDC films deposited on GDC substrate showed enhanced crystallite formation In case of NiO-GDC composite substrate the thickness of film was higher (similar to 13 mu m) as compared to the film thickness on GDC substrate (similar to 2 mu m),Synthesis and characterization of electrolyte-grade 10%Gd-doped ceria thin film/ceramic substrate structures for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2010.08.110
2,2778,"The relative density of the films deposited on both the substrates was of the order of 95% The Impedance measurements revealed that ionic conductivity of GDC/NiO-GDC structure was of the order of 0 10 S/cm at 500 C, which is a desirable property for its prospective application (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved",Synthesis and characterization of electrolyte-grade 10%Gd-doped ceria thin film/ceramic substrate structures for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.tsf.2010.08.110
