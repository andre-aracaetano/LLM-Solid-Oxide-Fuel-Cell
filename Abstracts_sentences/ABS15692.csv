1,15692,CO dissociation on clean and hydrogen covered Nickel/Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia (Ni/YSZ) with interface oxygen vacancy is studied using the first-principles method based on density functional theory.,Understanding on the carbon deposition on the Nickel/Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia anode caused by the CO containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.074
2,15692,It is found that the CO can be trapped at the interface 0 vacancy and the trapped CO can dissociate to C and 0 with a much lower dissociation barrier as compared with that on the pure Ni (111) surface (1.74 vs 2.89 eV).,Understanding on the carbon deposition on the Nickel/Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia anode caused by the CO containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.074
3,15692,"When H atom precovers the Ni part, the H associated CO dissociation path (H + CO -> CHO, CHO -> CH + O) is preferred, while when H atom precovers at the YSZ part, the direct CO dissociation (CO -> C + O) is preferred.",Understanding on the carbon deposition on the Nickel/Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia anode caused by the CO containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.074
4,15692,"Overall, either the H at the Ni part or the YSZ part, the CO dissociations are both accelerated (0.90, 1.41 vs 1.74 eV).",Understanding on the carbon deposition on the Nickel/Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia anode caused by the CO containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.074
5,15692,"Therefore, we propose that the carbon deposition may form easily at the interface oxygen vacancy of triple phase boundary (TPB) and the precovered H atom can accelerate the CO dissociation, which offers new understanding on the carbon deposition of the Ni/YSZ anode of solid oxide fuel cell with the pure CO or CO and H-2 mixture as the fuel.",Understanding on the carbon deposition on the Nickel/Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia anode caused by the CO containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.074
