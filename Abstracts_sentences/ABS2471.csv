1,2471,A functionally graded Bi1.6.Er0.4O3(ESB)/Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92(YSZ) bilayer electrolyte is successfully developed via a cost-effective screen printing process using nanoscale ESB powders on the tape-cast NiO-YSZ anode support.,Functionally Graded Bismuth Oxide/Zirconia Bilayer Electrolytes for High-Performance Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFCs),10.1021/acsami.6b16660
2,2471,"Because of the highly enhanced oxygen incorporation process at the cathode/electrolyte interface, a novel bilayer solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) yields extremely high power density of similar to 2.1 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, which is a 2.4 times increase compared to that of the YSZ single electrolyte SOFC.",Functionally Graded Bismuth Oxide/Zirconia Bilayer Electrolytes for High-Performance Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFCs),10.1021/acsami.6b16660
