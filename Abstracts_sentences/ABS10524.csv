3,10524,"Iris found that nanoscale SDC powders can be obtained at 1000 degrees C. Cells constructed with an SDC electrolyte, a NiO + SDC composite anode, and an SSC-SDC/SSC hi-layer cathode are fabricated and tested at temperatures from 400 to 650 degrees C. SEM micrographs show that the SDC electrolyte layer adheres well to the porous anode and the cathode.",Fabrication and characterization of a Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 electrolyte film by the spin-coating method for a low-temperature anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.024
