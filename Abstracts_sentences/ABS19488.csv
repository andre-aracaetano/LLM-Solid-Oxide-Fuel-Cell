4,19488,"Results show that under the operating conditions investigated the accuracy of the reduced model is not significantly compromised by the two simplifications in prediction of the outlet gas flow rates and molar fractions, the outlet temperatures, and the cell voltage, while its computational time is significantly decreased by them.",A reduced 1D dynamic model of a planar direct internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell for system research,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.073
