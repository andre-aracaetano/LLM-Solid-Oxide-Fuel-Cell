1,3543,"The effect of lanthanide promoters on a Ni-Al2O3 catalyst for methane partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO2 reforming at 600-850 degrees C is systematically investigated.",A new Gd-promoted nickel catalyst for methane conversion to syngas and as an anode functional layer in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.072
2,3543,"The promoters include La2O3, CeO2, Pr2O3, Sm2O3 and Gd2O3.",A new Gd-promoted nickel catalyst for methane conversion to syngas and as an anode functional layer in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.072
3,3543,GdNi-Al2O3 shows comparable catalytic activity to LaNi-Al2O3 and PrNi-Al2O3 but higher activity than CeNi-Al2O3 and SmNi-Al2O3 for all three reactions.,A new Gd-promoted nickel catalyst for methane conversion to syngas and as an anode functional layer in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.072
4,3543,The O-2-TPO results show that GdNi-Al2O3 possesses the best coke resistance among those tested.,A new Gd-promoted nickel catalyst for methane conversion to syngas and as an anode functional layer in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.072
5,3543,It also displays good stability at 850 degrees C for 300 h. Raman spectroscopy indicates that the addition of lanthanide promoters can reduce the degree of graphitization of the carbon deposited on Ni-Al2O3.,A new Gd-promoted nickel catalyst for methane conversion to syngas and as an anode functional layer in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.072
6,3543,The GdNi-Al2O3 is further applied as an anode functional layer in solid-oxide fuel cells operating on methane.,A new Gd-promoted nickel catalyst for methane conversion to syngas and as an anode functional layer in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.072
7,3543,"The cell yields peak power densities of 1068, 996 and 986 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, respectively, for operating on methane-O-2, methane-H2O and methane-CO2 gas mixtures, which is comparable to operating on hydrogen fuel.",A new Gd-promoted nickel catalyst for methane conversion to syngas and as an anode functional layer in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.072
8,3543,GdNi-Al2O3 is promising as a highly coking-resistant catalyst layer for solid-oxide fuel cells.,A new Gd-promoted nickel catalyst for methane conversion to syngas and as an anode functional layer in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.072
