1,20496,"In this work, pre-synthesized fluorophlogopite mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) crystalline powder was added into potassium-magnesium boro-alumino-silicate (K2O-MgO-B2O3-Al2O3-SiO2) glass powder to synthesize glass-ceramic composite (GCC) sealant for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application.",Mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) based glass-ceramic composite sealant with thermal stability for SOFC application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.252
2,20496,"The basic purpose was to report the influence of KMg3AlSi3O10F2 on microstructure, thermal expansion and volume shrinkage behavior of GCCs in terms of their SOFC sealing ability.",Mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) based glass-ceramic composite sealant with thermal stability for SOFC application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.252
3,20496,The predominant crystalline phase was also identified as fluorophlogopite mica (KMg3AlSi3-O10F2) by X-ray diffraction in the GCCs heat-treated at 900 degrees C (for 2 h) followed by 800 degrees C (for 10 h).,Mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) based glass-ceramic composite sealant with thermal stability for SOFC application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.252
4,20496,"Higher thermal expansion (10.65-10.81 x 10(-6)/K at 50-800 degrees C) compatible with SOFC components (metallic electrode/interconnect, ceramic electrolyte) was realized for 5-10 wt % mica containing GCC.",Mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) based glass-ceramic composite sealant with thermal stability for SOFC application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.252
5,20496,"However, it was found decreased linearly with adding further KMg3AlSi3O10F2 content (20-40 wt%) in the composites.",Mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) based glass-ceramic composite sealant with thermal stability for SOFC application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.252
6,20496,GCC with 5 wt % of mica was stable under thermal cycling testing and no significant degradation was observed in thermal expansion till 10 cycles.,Mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) based glass-ceramic composite sealant with thermal stability for SOFC application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.252
7,20496,Field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed the spherical shaped nanocrystallites morphology of those GCCs and that was ascribed for their compact bonding with SOFC components.,Mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) based glass-ceramic composite sealant with thermal stability for SOFC application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.252
8,20496,Heating stage microscopy (HSM) ensured the lower softening temperature (752 +/- 7 degrees C) for 5 wt % mica containing GCC which furthermore showed 11-13% volume shrinkage (to ensure the self-healing) in SOFC operating temperature.,Mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) based glass-ceramic composite sealant with thermal stability for SOFC application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.252
9,20496,"In a summary, the above factors confirmed the suitability of 5 wt % mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) containing K2O-MgO-B2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 system (GCC) for SOFC sealant application.",Mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2) based glass-ceramic composite sealant with thermal stability for SOFC application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.252
