1,16119,In this paper we report the successful incorporation of germanium into Sr1-yCayFeO3-delta perovskite materials for potential applications as electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells.,Synthesis and characterization of novel Ge doped Sr1-yCayFeO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.02.014
2,16119,It was observed that Ge doping leads to a change from a tetragonal cell (with partial ordering of oxygen vacancies) to a cubic one (with the oxygen vacancies disordered).,Synthesis and characterization of novel Ge doped Sr1-yCayFeO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.02.014
3,16119,"Annealing experiments in 5%H2195%N-2 (up to 800 degrees C) also showed the stabilization of the cubic form in reducing conditions for the 15 mol% Ge-doped SrFeO3-delta sample, in contrast to the undoped systems which showed a transition to an oxygen vacancy ordered brownmillerite-type phase.",Synthesis and characterization of novel Ge doped Sr1-yCayFeO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.02.014
4,16119,"In order to examine the potential of these systems as SOFC cathodes, composite electrodes comprising 50% Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 and 50% Sr1-yCay(Fe/Ge)O3-delta on dense Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 pellets were examined in air.",Synthesis and characterization of novel Ge doped Sr1-yCayFeO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.02.014
5,16119,"The results showed an improvement in the area specific resistances (ASR) values for the Ge-doped samples with respect to the undoped ones, with the best performance for the Ge doped SrFeO3-delta system (0.24 and 0.060 Omega cm(2) at 700 and 800 degrees C, respectively, for SrFe0.85Ge0.15O3-delta).",Synthesis and characterization of novel Ge doped Sr1-yCayFeO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.02.014
6,16119,"Thus, the results show that germanium can be incorporated into Sr1-yCayFeO3-delta- based materials leading to materials with potential for use as cathode materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).",Synthesis and characterization of novel Ge doped Sr1-yCayFeO3-δ SOFC cathode materials,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.02.014
