1,2481,Highly efficient combined cycles with solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) need an integrated heat exchanger in the stack to reach efficiencies of about 80%.,Design and operation of interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02353-1
2,2481,The stack costs must be lower than 1000 DM/kW. A newly developed welded metallic (Haynes HA 230) interconnector with a free stretching planar SOFC and an integrated heat exchanger was tested in thermal cycling operation.,Design and operation of interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02353-1
3,2481,The design allowed a cycling of the SOFC without mechanical damage of the electrolyte in several tests.,Design and operation of interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02353-1
4,2481,"However, more tests and a further design optimization will be necessary.",Design and operation of interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02353-1
5,2481,These results could indicate that commercial high-temperature alloys can be used as interconnector material in order to fullfil the cost requirements.,Design and operation of interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02353-1
