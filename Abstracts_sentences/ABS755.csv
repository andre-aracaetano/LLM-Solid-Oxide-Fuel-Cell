1,755,A cobalt-free perovskite-type cathode material La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Cr0.1O3-alpha (LSFC10) was prepared by a citric acid-nitrate process and investigated as a potential cathode material for proton-conducting intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,A cobalt-free perovskite-type La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Cr0.1O3-α cathode for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.09.107
2,755,"The maximum conductivity of LSFC10 reached 138 S cm(-1) under oxygen at 550 degrees C. A Ni-BZCY composite anode-supported proton-conducting BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-alpha (BZCY) electrolyte membrane was successfully fabricated by a simple, cost-effective spin coating process.",A cobalt-free perovskite-type La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Cr0.1O3-α cathode for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.09.107
3,755,"The peak power densities of the H-2/O-2 fuel cell using BZCY electrolyte membrane, Ni-BZCY composite anode and LSFC10 cathode reached 412 mW cm(-2), and the interfacial polarization resistance for the fuel cell was as low as 0.19 Omega cm(2) under open circuit conditions, at 700 degrees",A cobalt-free perovskite-type La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Cr0.1O3-α cathode for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.09.107
