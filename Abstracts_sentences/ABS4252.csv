1,4252,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes on porous Ni-YSZ anodes were successfully operated with humidified methane and natural gas.,Operation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells on methane and natural gas,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00769-5
2,4252,"For both fuels, single-cell tests were carried out with low fuel utilizations in order to approximate the conditions expected near the fuel inlet in a direct methane SOFC stack.",Operation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells on methane and natural gas,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00769-5
3,4252,"Open circuit voltages (OCV) increased from approximate to 1.1 to 1.17 V, and power densities increased from approximate to 0.1 to 1.0 W/cm(2), as the operating temperature was increased from 600 to 800 degreesC. Comparisons of open circuit voltages with Nernst potentials suggested partial oxidation of solid C as the main anode reaction.",Operation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells on methane and natural gas,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00769-5
4,4252,"SOFCs were operated in methane for >90 h at 700 degreesC and 0.6 V, yielding a stable power density of approximate to 0.35 W/cm(2).",Operation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells on methane and natural gas,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00769-5
5,4252,"Very little carbon was detected on the anodes, suggesting that carbon deposition was limited during cell operation.",Operation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells on methane and natural gas,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00769-5
