2,472,The conductivity stability of composite electrolyte with co-doped ceria and binary carbonate was measured by AC impedance spectroscopy.,Durability study of an intermediate temperature fuel cell based on an oxide-carbonate composite electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.04.026
3,472,"At 550 degrees C, the conductivity dropped from 0.26 to 0.21 S cm(-1) in air during the measured 135 h. At a constant current density of 1 A cm(-2), the cell performance keeps decreasing at 550 degrees C, with a maximum power density change from 520 to 300 mW cm(-2).",Durability study of an intermediate temperature fuel cell based on an oxide-carbonate composite electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.04.026
