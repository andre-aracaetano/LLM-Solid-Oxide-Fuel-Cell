2,8965,"Ni-Fe supports were obtained through tape casting, high temperature sintering and pre-reducing in 97% H-2/N-2(9/91)-3% H2O at 750 and 1000 degrees C, respectively.",Oxidation behavior of a Ni-Fe support in SOFC anode atmosphere,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.04.326
3,8965,Then the Ni-Fe supports were exposed in simulated anode atmospheres of H-2/N-2 (9/91)-3% H2O and 75% H-2/N-2(9/ 91)-25% H2O for periods of up to 1000 hat 750 degrees C.,Oxidation behavior of a Ni-Fe support in SOFC anode atmosphere,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.04.326

5,8965,"The Ni-Fe supports exposed to H-2/N-2-3% H2O showed negligible oxidation, while those exposed to H-2/N-2-25% H2O showed a 4-6% mass increase, due to the fact that a Fe-rich oxide scale was found on the surface of the Ni-Fe alloy particles.",Oxidation behavior of a Ni-Fe support in SOFC anode atmosphere,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.04.326
6,8965,Room-temperature conductivity measurements showed that the supports annealed in the two atmospheres maintained sufficiently high conductivity.,Oxidation behavior of a Ni-Fe support in SOFC anode atmosphere,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.04.326
