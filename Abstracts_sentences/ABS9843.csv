1,9843,Solid oxide fuel cell-micro-gas turbine (SOFC-MGT) hybrid power plants integrate a solid oxide fuel cell and a micro-gas turbine and can achieve efficiencies of over 60% even for small power outputs (200-500 kW).,Externally reformed solid oxide fuel cell-micro-gas turbine (SOFC-MGT) hybrid systems fueled by methanol and di-methyl-ether (DME),10.1016/j.energy.2008.09.013
2,9843,"The SOFC-MGT systems currently developed are fueled with natural gas, which is reformed inside the same stack, but the use of alternative fuels can be an interesting option.",Externally reformed solid oxide fuel cell-micro-gas turbine (SOFC-MGT) hybrid systems fueled by methanol and di-methyl-ether (DME),10.1016/j.energy.2008.09.013
3,9843,"in particular, as the reforming temperature of methanol and di-methyl-ether (DME) (200-350 degrees C) is significantly lower than that of natural gas (700-900 degrees C), the reformer can be sited outside the stack.",Externally reformed solid oxide fuel cell-micro-gas turbine (SOFC-MGT) hybrid systems fueled by methanol and di-methyl-ether (DME),10.1016/j.energy.2008.09.013
4,9843,External reforming in SOFC-MGT plants fueled by methanol and DME enhances efficiency due to improved exhaust heat recovery and higher voltage produced by the greater hydrogen partial pressure at the anode inlet.,Externally reformed solid oxide fuel cell-micro-gas turbine (SOFC-MGT) hybrid systems fueled by methanol and di-methyl-ether (DME),10.1016/j.energy.2008.09.013
5,9843,The study carried out in this paper shows that the main operating parameters of the fuel reforming section (temperature and steam-to-carbon ratio (SCR)) must be carefully chosen to optimise the hybrid plant performance.,Externally reformed solid oxide fuel cell-micro-gas turbine (SOFC-MGT) hybrid systems fueled by methanol and di-methyl-ether (DME),10.1016/j.energy.2008.09.013
6,9843,"For the stoichiometric SCR values, the optimum reforming temperature for the methanol fueled hybrid plant is approximately 240 degrees C, giving efficiencies of about 67-68% with a SOFC temperature of 900 degrees C (the efficiency is about 72-73% at 1000 degrees C).",Externally reformed solid oxide fuel cell-micro-gas turbine (SOFC-MGT) hybrid systems fueled by methanol and di-methyl-ether (DME),10.1016/j.energy.2008.09.013
7,9843,"Similarly, for DME the optimum reforming temperature is approximately 280 degrees C with efficiencies of 65% at 900 degrees C (69% at 1000 degrees C).",Externally reformed solid oxide fuel cell-micro-gas turbine (SOFC-MGT) hybrid systems fueled by methanol and di-methyl-ether (DME),10.1016/j.energy.2008.09.013

9,9843,"As too small SCRs can lead to carbon formation, practical SCR values are around one for methanol and 1.5-2 for DME.",Externally reformed solid oxide fuel cell-micro-gas turbine (SOFC-MGT) hybrid systems fueled by methanol and di-methyl-ether (DME),10.1016/j.energy.2008.09.013
