6,1337,"A reference SOFC cell of the planar cell type, based on the current fuel cell programme of the Research Centre Julich, has been compared with a conventional technology in the form of a 10 MW gas turbine.",Environmental analysis of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02368-3
7,1337,"The latter has been chosen as the competitive conventional technology, because the power output is similar to the expected SOFC power output and the use of the same fuel, natural gas, facilitates the comparison.",Environmental analysis of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02368-3
