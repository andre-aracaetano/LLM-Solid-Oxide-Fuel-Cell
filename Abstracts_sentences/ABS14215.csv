4,14215,The activation energy for crystallization varied with glass particle size and decreased from 570 +/- 25 to 457 +/- 30 kJ/mol as the average particle size decreased from 425-500 to similar to 10 pm.,Isothermal Crystallization of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Sealing Glass by Differential Thermal Analysis,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02661.x
5,14215,"The activation energy for crystallization, E, increased from 520 +/- 20 to similar to 600 +/- 20 kJ/mol when glass particles (45-53 mu m) were mechanically mixed with 10 vol% of micrometer-sized Ni or YSZ powders.",Isothermal Crystallization of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Sealing Glass by Differential Thermal Analysis,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02661.x
