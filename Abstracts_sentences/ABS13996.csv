2,13996,"Here, machine learning (ML) models are developed to predict perovskite catalytic properties critical for SOFC/SOEC applications, including oxygen surface exchange, oxygen diffusivity, and area specific resistance (ASR).",Machine Learning Design of Perovskite Catalytic Properties,10.1002/aenm.202303684
3,13996,"The models are based on trivial-to-calculate elemental features and are more accurate and dramatically faster than the best models based on ab initio-derived features, potentially eliminating the need for ab initio calculations in descriptor-based screening.",Machine Learning Design of Perovskite Catalytic Properties,10.1002/aenm.202303684
4,13996,"The model of ASR enables temperature-dependent predictions, has well calibrated uncertainty estimates and online accessibility.",Machine Learning Design of Perovskite Catalytic Properties,10.1002/aenm.202303684
5,13996,"Use of temporal cross-validation reveals the model to be effective at discovering new promising materials prior to their initial discovery, demonstrating the model can make meaningful predictions.",Machine Learning Design of Perovskite Catalytic Properties,10.1002/aenm.202303684
