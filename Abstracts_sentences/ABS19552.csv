1,19552,Dense films of CeO2 were deposited on dense Y2O3-doped CeO2 substrates by electrochemical vapor deposition (EVD) using CeCl3 as the source of cerium over a range of temperatures between 1050 and 1200-degrees-C. A substrate of a variable thickness was used to determine rate constants for the substrate and the film.,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE OF THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF CEO2,10.1149/1.2056200
2,19552,The kinetics of film deposition were analyzed by considering transport processes through both the substrate and the film.,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE OF THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF CEO2,10.1149/1.2056200
3,19552,An analysis which takes into account spatially dependent transport processes is presented.,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE OF THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF CEO2,10.1149/1.2056200
4,19552,The analysis reduces to the equivalent circuit approach provided transport properties are uniform in each region.,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE OF THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF CEO2,10.1149/1.2056200
5,19552,Numerical calculations of the kinetics of film growth were conducted using conductivities that are dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen.,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE OF THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF CEO2,10.1149/1.2056200
6,19552,A simple analysis based on the assumption of constant conductivities in a given region is satisfactory.,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE OF THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF CEO2,10.1149/1.2056200
7,19552,The implication is that an average of transport properties is reflected in the measured rate constants.,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE OF THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF CEO2,10.1149/1.2056200
