5,9572,"It is found that current density of conventional SOFC is likely to be limited by thermal constraints, while that of water-cooled SOFC is much more robust against them, enabling the water-cooled SOFC to operate at much higher power densities.",Power maximization and load range extension of solid oxide fuel cell operation by water cooling,10.1016/j.energy.2023.127512
6,9572,"The maximum power of conventional SOFC can be enhanced by tuning air flow rate or inlet temperature, but those generally have trade-offs such as a higher parasitic loss.",Power maximization and load range extension of solid oxide fuel cell operation by water cooling,10.1016/j.energy.2023.127512
7,9572,"For the thermal constraints and operating conditions used in this study, the thermal limiting power density of water-cooled SOFC operating at 1023 K can be even higher than that of the conventional SOFC operating at 1123 K. Two methods to suppress overcooling in water-cooled SOFC operations at part-load are also proposed and evaluated.",Power maximization and load range extension of solid oxide fuel cell operation by water cooling,10.1016/j.energy.2023.127512
