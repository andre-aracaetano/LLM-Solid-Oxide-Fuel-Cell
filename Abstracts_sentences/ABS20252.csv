4,20252,"Under air, a transition to high temperature rhombohedral structure (S.G.: R-3c) occurs at around 600 degrees C, while its oxygen vacancy amount increases from delta approximate to 0.05 at room temperature up to 0.10 at high temperature.",Characterization of PrNiO3-δ as oxygen electrode for SOFCs,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2018.04.016
5,20252,"Thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) measurements coupled with X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations show that above 1000 degrees C, in air, PrNiO3-delta starts to decompose into Pr2NiO4+delta and NiO through an intermediate transformation into Pr 4 Ni3O10+delta.",Characterization of PrNiO3-δ as oxygen electrode for SOFCs,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2018.04.016
