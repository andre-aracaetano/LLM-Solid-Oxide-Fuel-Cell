1,3847,The fabrication of a cathode layer of solid oxide fuel cells by the dispenser printing was investigated and found to be useful in the creation of a thicker ceramic layer using viscous ceramic slurries.,Application of dispenser printing for the preparation of a SOFC cathode with controlled microstructure,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.07.009
2,3847,The cathode layer prepared from a mixture of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) slurry clearly shows an inhomogeneous microstructure which leads to poor cell performance.,Application of dispenser printing for the preparation of a SOFC cathode with controlled microstructure,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.07.009
3,3847,"In order to solve this problem, the size of the LSCF particles was controlled through a milling process.",Application of dispenser printing for the preparation of a SOFC cathode with controlled microstructure,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.07.009
4,3847,"Better cell performance was observed for the cells with controlled microstructure by adjusting the pore former content, the LSCF/GDC ratio, in addition to the particle size control.",Application of dispenser printing for the preparation of a SOFC cathode with controlled microstructure,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.07.009
