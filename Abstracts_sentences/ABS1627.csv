1,1627,"Highly active NI-cermet anodes for thin La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Sr0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells are fabricated by impregnating aqueous nickel nitrate solutions into porous LSGM backbones, followed by calcinations at 700 degrees C. High Ni loadings, e.g., V-Ni =",Impregnated nickel anodes for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells based on thin electrolytes of doped LaGaO3,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.019

4,1627,"7.9% anodes in humidified hydrogen, ranging from 0.008 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C to 0.011 Omega cm(2) at 550 degrees C. Thin LSGM electrolyte fuel cells, impregnated with Ni anodes and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SSC - SDC) cathodes, exhibit superior power densities at reduced temperatures, e.g., 1.60 and 1.05 W cm(-2) at 650 and 550 degrees C, respectively.",Impregnated nickel anodes for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells based on thin electrolytes of doped LaGaO3,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.019
