5,13426,The electrical conductivities of YSZ with different grain sizes were measured via the four-probe DC technique and grain conductivities and grain boundary conductivities of YSZ were investigated by impedance spectroscopy.,"Fabrication, microstructure and properties of a YSZ electrolyte for SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.054
6,13426,"YSZ electrolytes with a grain size of 0.1-0.4 mu m had the highest electrical conductivity in the range of 500-1000 degrees C, especially at medium and low temperatures 550-800 degrees C. As the YSZ grain size becomes small, the thickness of the intergranular region decreased greatly.","Fabrication, microstructure and properties of a YSZ electrolyte for SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.054
7,13426,"The YSZ electrolytes with sub-micrometer grain sizes, high ion conductivity and low sintering temperatures are important to the electrode- supported SOFC, on which the dense YSZ electrolyte films are optimized at 10 mu m.
