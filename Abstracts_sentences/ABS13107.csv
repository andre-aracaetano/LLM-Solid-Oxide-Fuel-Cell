1,13107,Bulk Ba(x)Sr(1-x)CoyFe(1-y)O(3-delta) compositions (BSCF) were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method.,Electrical conductivity and defect chemistry of BaxSr1-xCoyFe1-yO3-δ perovskites,10.1007/s10008-010-1208-4
2,13107,The electrical conductivity of ceramic bars was measured using a dc four-probe method as a function of temperature in air up to 970 A degrees C. All compositions showed thermally activated p-type semi-conductivity up to similar to 450 A degrees C and then a transition to metal-like conductivity.,Electrical conductivity and defect chemistry of BaxSr1-xCoyFe1-yO3-δ perovskites,10.1007/s10008-010-1208-4
