2,17168,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the microstructure of the anode cross section.,Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
3,17168,X-ray diffraction was used to measure the residual stress in the electrolyte.,Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
4,17168,The re-oxidation of the anode by ionic current was conducted at 800 degrees C by applying the current to a cell by supplying air for the cathode and pure N(2) for the anode.,Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
5,17168,"From the cross-sectional SEM images of the anodes, it was confirmed that the morphology of Ni particles in a particular area of the anode-an active area for electrochemical reactions-was modified to a sponge-like structure.",Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
6,17168,It was reported that the spongy microstructure was generated when Ni was re-oxidized by 02 in air.,Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
7,17168,"On the other hand, the morphology change in the Ni particles outside of the active area was not observed.",Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
8,17168,This suggests that this change in the microstructure resulting from re-oxidation was caused not by 02 in air but by the oxide ion current.,Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
9,17168,"The larger degree of morphology change in the Ni particles was observed in close proximity of the electrolyte, which also suggests that the re-oxidation was caused by the ionic current.",Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
10,17168,These results indicate that the effect of the anode structure on the electrolyte re-oxidized by ionic current was successfully investigated without the influence of the gas phase.,Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
11,17168,"Then, the influence of anode expansion caused by the re-oxidation on the electrolyte is studied by measuring the residual stress in the electrolyte.",Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
12,17168,A large compressive stress in the electrolyte was observed as that before the re-oxidation.,Study on electrochemical re-oxidation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells using oxide ion current,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.018
