1,15018,A new zero CO2 emission solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) hybrid power system integrated with the oxygen ion transport membrane using CO2 as sweep gas is proposed in this paper.,Study on a zero CO2 emission SOFC hybrid power system integrated with OTM using CO2 as sweep gas,10.1002/er.3042
2,15018,The pure oxygen is picked up from the cathode outlet gas by the oxygen ion transport membrane with CO2 as sweep gas; the oxy-fuel combustion mode in the afterburner of SOFC is employed.,Study on a zero CO2 emission SOFC hybrid power system integrated with OTM using CO2 as sweep gas,10.1002/er.3042
3,15018,"Because the combustion product gas only consists of CO2 and steam, CO2 is easily captured with lower energy consumption by the condensation of steam.",Study on a zero CO2 emission SOFC hybrid power system integrated with OTM using CO2 as sweep gas,10.1002/er.3042
4,15018,"With the aspen plus soft, this paper builds the simulation model of the overall SOFC hybrids system with CO2 capture.",Study on a zero CO2 emission SOFC hybrid power system integrated with OTM using CO2 as sweep gas,10.1002/er.3042
5,15018,"The exergy loss distributions of the overall system are analyzed, and the effects of the key operation parameters on the overall system performance are also investigated.",Study on a zero CO2 emission SOFC hybrid power system integrated with OTM using CO2 as sweep gas,10.1002/er.3042
6,15018,The research results show that the new system still has a high efficiency after CO2 recovery.,Study on a zero CO2 emission SOFC hybrid power system integrated with OTM using CO2 as sweep gas,10.1002/er.3042
