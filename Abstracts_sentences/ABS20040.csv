5,20040,"The CET and the conventional Carbon Tax (CT, based on energy policy considerations and imposed on the mass of emitted CO2) are applied to different conventional energy systems (a gas turbine simple cycle; a regenerative cogeneration gas turbine; a three pressure levels combined cycle) in order to determine their impact on the design of the plants.",Carbon exergy tax (CET):: its impact on conventional energy system design and its contribution to advanced systems utilisation,10.1016/S0360-5442(02)00179-2

7,20040,"The results are presented using useful representations: the cost of electricity vs. efficiency, the cost of electricity vs. specific work, and the cost of electricity vs. plant design parameters (e.g., pressure ratio).",Carbon exergy tax (CET):: its impact on conventional energy system design and its contribution to advanced systems utilisation,10.1016/S0360-5442(02)00179-2
