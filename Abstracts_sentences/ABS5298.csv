1,5298,"In proton conducting solid oxide fuel cell (H-SOFC), the primary reaction occurs at the three-phase reaction boundary where protons, electrons and oxygen ions meet.",Enhancement of electrochemical performance for proton conductive solid oxide fuel cell by 30%GDC-LSCF cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.052
2,5298,"In the present study, an oxygen ion conductor, Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta(GDC), added La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) as a cathode for anode-supported H-SOFC with BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) as the electrolyte.",Enhancement of electrochemical performance for proton conductive solid oxide fuel cell by 30%GDC-LSCF cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.052
3,5298,"The addition of GDC could increase the oxygen vacancy concentration and three-phase reaction interface, which improved the adsorption and dissociation rate of oxygen, but led to the decrease of conductivity and the decrease of charge transfer rate.",Enhancement of electrochemical performance for proton conductive solid oxide fuel cell by 30%GDC-LSCF cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.052
4,5298,"The single-cell with LSCF30GDC cathode presented outstanding performance, and the maximum power density (MPD) was 56% higher than that of LSCF at 650 degrees C, while the performance of the cell with 50%GDC only increased by 10%, indicating that 30% GDC was the most suitable doping amount.",Enhancement of electrochemical performance for proton conductive solid oxide fuel cell by 30%GDC-LSCF cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.052
5,5298,The superb performance and stability imply that the LSCFGDC composite material is a promising substitute cathode for H-SOFCs at low temperatures.,Enhancement of electrochemical performance for proton conductive solid oxide fuel cell by 30%GDC-LSCF cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.03.052
