3,13440,"High surface area Ce-ZrO2 can reform DME with steam efficiently at 900 degrees C, producing high contents of H-2, CO, and CH4 without the presence of CH3OH in the product gas.",Catalytic steam reforming of dimethyl ether (DME) over high surface area Ce-ZrO2 at SOFC temperature:: The possible use of DME in indirect internal reforming operation (IIR-SOFC),10.1016/j.apcata.2006.12.018
4,13440,The combination use of Ce-ZrO2 (as a pre-reforming catalyst) and Ni/Al2O3 in the single unit was proven to significantly improve the reforming performance.,Catalytic steam reforming of dimethyl ether (DME) over high surface area Ce-ZrO2 at SOFC temperature:: The possible use of DME in indirect internal reforming operation (IIR-SOFC),10.1016/j.apcata.2006.12.018
5,13440,"According to this combination, the role of Ce-ZrO2 is to first decompose CH3OH and some CH4 generated from the homogeneous decomposition of DME, while the role of Ni/Al2O3 is to reform CH4 left from the pre-reforming section and to maximize the yield of H-2 production.",Catalytic steam reforming of dimethyl ether (DME) over high surface area Ce-ZrO2 at SOFC temperature:: The possible use of DME in indirect internal reforming operation (IIR-SOFC),10.1016/j.apcata.2006.12.018
6,13440,"As another approach, IIR-SOFC model was studied using an annular ceramic reactor, in which DME initially reacted with steam on CeZrO2 + Ni/Al2O3 at the inner side of the reactor and then Ni/YSZ at the outer side.",Catalytic steam reforming of dimethyl ether (DME) over high surface area Ce-ZrO2 at SOFC temperature:: The possible use of DME in indirect internal reforming operation (IIR-SOFC),10.1016/j.apcata.2006.12.018
7,13440,"The stability and the yield of hydrogen production over this configuration were considerably higher than those of systems packed with single Ce-ZrO2, single Ni/Al2O3, and without the filling of catalyst.",Catalytic steam reforming of dimethyl ether (DME) over high surface area Ce-ZrO2 at SOFC temperature:: The possible use of DME in indirect internal reforming operation (IIR-SOFC),10.1016/j.apcata.2006.12.018
