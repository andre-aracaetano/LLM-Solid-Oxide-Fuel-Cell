6,13589,"The performance improvement can be attributed to the discrete distribution of ribs, the reduction of rib size, and the spatial layout arrangement of discrete ribs, which may shorten gas diffusion path, current collection path, or both.",New interconnector designs for electrical performance enhancement of solid oxide fuel cells: A 3D modelling study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231373
7,13589,It is also found that the performance degradation caused by IC oxidation is highly related to the contact area between IC and electrode.,New interconnector designs for electrical performance enhancement of solid oxide fuel cells: A 3D modelling study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231373
8,13589,"In addition, the increased parasitic power loss induced by the newly designed IC is less than 0.1% of the increased electric power, so it can be neglected.",New interconnector designs for electrical performance enhancement of solid oxide fuel cells: A 3D modelling study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231373
