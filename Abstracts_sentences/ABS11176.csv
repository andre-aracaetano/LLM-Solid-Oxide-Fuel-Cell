5,11176,"Cerium substitution improves the conductivity in neutral atmosphere from 18.3 to 35.4?S?cm1 for x?=?0 and 0.375, respectively, at 1,173?K. In reducing conditions, the conductivity is not influenced by cerium substitution, and it is about 1?S?cm1 at 1,173?K. High temperature XRD shows that structure becomes cubic at 1,073?K in operating (reducing) conditions.",Effect of Ce-Doping on the Electrical and Electrocatalytical Behavior of La/Sr Chromo-Manganite Perovskite as New SOFC Anode,10.1002/fuce.201100070
