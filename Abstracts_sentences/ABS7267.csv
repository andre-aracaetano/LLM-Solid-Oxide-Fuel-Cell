1,7267,Ammonia-fueled operation of solid oxide fuel cells is a promising alternative to their hydrogen-fueled operation.,Numerical performance analysis of solid oxide fuel cell stacks with internal ammonia cracking,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.321
2,7267,"However, high ammonia decomposition rates at elevated operating temperatures of the solid oxide cells lead to a significant temperature drop at the stack inlet, causing increased thermal stresses.",Numerical performance analysis of solid oxide fuel cell stacks with internal ammonia cracking,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.321
3,7267,A multi-scale model is used in this study to investigate stack performance under direct feed and external pre-cracking of ammonia.,Numerical performance analysis of solid oxide fuel cell stacks with internal ammonia cracking,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.321
4,7267,"Additionally, the effects of co-and counter-flow configurations, gas inflow temperatures, current density, and air flow rate on the stack performance under direct ammonia feed are examined.",Numerical performance analysis of solid oxide fuel cell stacks with internal ammonia cracking,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.321
5,7267,"The simulation results show that for gas inlet temperatures above 750 degrees C, the power densities with direct feed and external cracking of ammonia differ by less than 5%.",Numerical performance analysis of solid oxide fuel cell stacks with internal ammonia cracking,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.321
6,7267,"Moreover, it is indicated that the thermal stresses are lowest for the co-flow case, which decrease with decreasing gas inlet temperature and current density and with increasing air flow.",Numerical performance analysis of solid oxide fuel cell stacks with internal ammonia cracking,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.321
7,7267,"Finally, this study shows that under practically applicable operating conditions, the risk of mechanical failure of the cells under direct ammonia feed operation is small.",Numerical performance analysis of solid oxide fuel cell stacks with internal ammonia cracking,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.05.321
