1,4448,A strategy of tailoring the ceramic cathode composite is presented to improve the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) prepared by a one-step co-firing process.,Tailoring cathode composite boosts the performance of proton-conducting SOFCs fabricated by a one-step co-firing method,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.02.022
2,4448,"Comparing to the conventional way of using BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-delta (BCZY) in the composite cathode for BCZY-electrolyte based cells, the replacement of BCZY by BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BZY) mitigates the reaction between the two ceramic phases in the composite cathode during the co-firing process and also keeps the cathode with sufficient porosity for ample gas diffusion which could assist in adequate cathode reactions.",Tailoring cathode composite boosts the performance of proton-conducting SOFCs fabricated by a one-step co-firing method,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.02.022
3,4448,"As a result, the BCZY-electrolyte based cell with Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC)-BZY composite cathode shows a power output of 300 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, which is the largest ever reported for proton-conducting SOFCs prepared by a one-step co-firing process.",Tailoring cathode composite boosts the performance of proton-conducting SOFCs fabricated by a one-step co-firing method,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.02.022
