2,5347,"In this work, A(2)CrMoO(6-delta) (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) double perovskite materials are synthesized and evaluated as potential SOFC anode materials to assess their electrocatalytic activity and sulfur tolerance.","Molybdenum-based double perovskites A2CrMoO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) as anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.102
3,5347,All samples exhibit well-matched thermal expansion coefficient and satisfactory chemical compatibility with La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte over the measured temperature range.,"Molybdenum-based double perovskites A2CrMoO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) as anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.102
4,5347,"Among the compositions investigated, the B-site partially disordered Sr2CrMoO6-delta (SCM) double perovskite exhibits superior electrical conductivity, cycle stability, and polarization resistance on LSGM electrolyte because of its high-symmetry structure and appropriate oxygen-vacancy concentration.","Molybdenum-based double perovskites A2CrMoO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) as anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.102
5,5347,The relatively stable single-cell performance in 100 ppm H2S/H-2 demonstrates that the behavior of SCM anode is more stable than that of nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia.,"Molybdenum-based double perovskites A2CrMoO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) as anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.102
