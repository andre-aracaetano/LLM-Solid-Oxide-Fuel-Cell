5,20881,"Substitution by manganese gradually increases the extent of oxygen content variation on thermal/redox cycling, chemical contribution to thermal expansion and dimensional changes on reduction.","Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductivity, Redox Behavior and Thermochemical Expansion of Mn-Substituted 5YSZ as an Interlayer Material for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells",10.3390/ma14030641
6,20881,"It also deteriorates oxygen-ionic conductivity and improves p-type electronic conductivity under oxidizing conditions, leading to a gradual transformation from predominantly ionic to prevailing electronic transport with increasing x. Mn2+/3+-> Mn2+ transformation under reducing atmospheres is accompanied by the suppression of electronic transport and an increase in ionic conductivity.","Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductivity, Redox Behavior and Thermochemical Expansion of Mn-Substituted 5YSZ as an Interlayer Material for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells",10.3390/ma14030641
