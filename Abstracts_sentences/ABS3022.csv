2,3022,"For the sake of simplicity in developing the model, hydrogen-air mixture (80% hydrogen, 20% air by volume, which is considered as safe) has been chosen instead of hydrocarbon-air mixtures (which require complex modeling strategy such as reforming via partial oxidation and modeling of two active fuels, i.e., hydrogen and carbon monoxide).",Modeling of Co-planar Type Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003636
3,3022,"The model is based on considering yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as an electrolyte supported material, nickel yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) as anode, and lanthanum strontium manganite as a cathode material.",Modeling of Co-planar Type Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003636
4,3022,"The effect of varying distance between anode and cathode, flow rate, temperature, porosity, and electrolyte thickness has been investigated in terms of electrochemical performance.",Modeling of Co-planar Type Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003636
5,3022,It has been found that the flow rate and distance between the electrodes' pair are the most sensitive parameters in such type of fuel cells.,Modeling of Co-planar Type Single-Chamber Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003636
