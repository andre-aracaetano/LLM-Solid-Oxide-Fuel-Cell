1,19294,Two Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs) with different oxygen electrodes have been tested in galvanostatic tests carried out at -1.5 Acm(-2) and 800 degrees C converting 60% of a 50:50% mixture of H2O and CO2 (co-electrolysis).,Influence of the oxygen electrode and inter-diffusion barrier on the degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.063
2,19294,One of the cells had an LSM:YSZ oxygen electrode.,Influence of the oxygen electrode and inter-diffusion barrier on the degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.063
3,19294,The other had an CGO inter-diffusion barrier sandwiched between the YSZ electrolyte and an LSCF:CGO oxygen electrode.,Influence of the oxygen electrode and inter-diffusion barrier on the degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.063
4,19294,Impedance Spectroscopy was used during the tests to diagnose the change in electrochemical response of the different components of the SOECs.,Influence of the oxygen electrode and inter-diffusion barrier on the degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.063
5,19294,The results showed a significantly lower degradation rate for the cell with an LSCF:CGO oxygen electrode.,Influence of the oxygen electrode and inter-diffusion barrier on the degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.063
6,19294,This was attributed to three different effects: (1) The LSCF electrode was found to be more stable than its LSM:YSZ based counterpart.,Influence of the oxygen electrode and inter-diffusion barrier on the degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.063
7,19294,(2) The crack propagation in the YSZ electrolyte was less severe in the cell with an LSCF electrode.,Influence of the oxygen electrode and inter-diffusion barrier on the degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.063
8,19294,(3) The Ni:YSZ degradation was less severe in the cell with an LSCF electrode.,Influence of the oxygen electrode and inter-diffusion barrier on the degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.063
9,19294,We hypothesize further that (2) is an effect of the CGO inter-diffusion layer and that (3) is an indirect effect of (2).,Influence of the oxygen electrode and inter-diffusion barrier on the degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.063
