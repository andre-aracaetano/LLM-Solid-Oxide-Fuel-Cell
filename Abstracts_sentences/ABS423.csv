1,423,Coplanar single-chamber micro solid oxide fuel cells (SC-mu SOFCs) with curvilinear microelectrode configurations of arbitrarily complex two-dimensional geometry were fabricated by a direct-write microfabrication technique using conventional fuel cell materials.,Fabrication and testing of coplanar single-chamber micro solid oxide fuel cells with geometrically complex electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.013
2,423,"The electrochemical performance of two SC-mu SOFCs with different electrode shapes, but comparable electrode and inter-electrode dimensions, was characterized in a methane-air mixture at 700 degrees C. Both cells exhibited stable open circuit voltage and peak power density of 0.9 V and 2.3 mW cm(-2), respectively, indicating that electrode shape did not have a significant influence on the performance of these fuel cells.",Fabrication and testing of coplanar single-chamber micro solid oxide fuel cells with geometrically complex electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.013
