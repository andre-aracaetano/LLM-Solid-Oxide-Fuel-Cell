1,264,This paper provides two types of control relevant models of planer solid oxide fuel cell system with different details.,Control relevant modeling of planer solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.080
2,264,"Dynamic models of system components which include heat exchanger, reformer and after-burner are also provided along with the necessary formulation of a fuel cell connected in parallel with a capacitor.",Control relevant modeling of planer solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.080
3,264,Steady-state and dynamic simulations of fuel cell system for both types of models are performed.,Control relevant modeling of planer solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.080
4,264,The results indicate that both models are comparable in predicting stack voltage at lower current load.,Control relevant modeling of planer solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.080
5,264,"But, the discrepancy in the stack voltage, power and temperature of different components become more prominent at higher current load.",Control relevant modeling of planer solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.080
