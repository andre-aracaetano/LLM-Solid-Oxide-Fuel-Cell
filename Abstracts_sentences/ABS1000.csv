1,1000,Ammonia is recognized as a useful fuel for high-temperature solid oxide fuel cell with advantages over hydrogen.,A pressurized ammonia-fueled anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell: Power performance and electrochemical impedance measurements,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.006
2,1000,"The challenge of ammonia solid oxide fuel cell is its performance durability especially at elevated operating pressure, which motivates this work to measure power and impedance of a pressurized anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (530-mu m-Ni-YSZ/3-mu m-YSZ/15-mu m-LSC-GDC) using ammonia as a fuel at both 1 atm and 3 atm, each pressure with three operating temperatures (750, 800, 850 degrees C).",A pressurized ammonia-fueled anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell: Power performance and electrochemical impedance measurements,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.006
3,1000,"Results show that both pressurization and increasing temperature enhance the ammonia-fueled cell power densities which are closely matching with that of hydrogen, indicating an almost 100% ammonia conversion to hydrogen and nitrogen at T >= 750 degrees C. From Bode and Nyquist plots, we find that the polarization impedance is primarily contributed by the gas diffusion impedance with summit frequencies around 5-24 Hz and secondarily due to the gas conversion with summit frequencies around 0.03-0.07 Hz.",A pressurized ammonia-fueled anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell: Power performance and electrochemical impedance measurements,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.006
4,1000,"When pressure increases, the gas diffusion impedance decreases noticeably, while the gas conversion impedance increases slightly.",A pressurized ammonia-fueled anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell: Power performance and electrochemical impedance measurements,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.006
5,1000,"Moreover, a stability test shows little degradation even at 3 atm, suggesting that pressurized ammonia solid oxide fuel cell is feasible for future development of the hybrid power system integrating with micro gas turbines.",A pressurized ammonia-fueled anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell: Power performance and electrochemical impedance measurements,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.006
