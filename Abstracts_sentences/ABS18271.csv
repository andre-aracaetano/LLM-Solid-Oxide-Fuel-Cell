1,18271,The influence of a reducing atmosphere on transport properties of undoped and doped oxyborate Ba3Ti3O6(BO3)(2) has been studied using various experimental methods and first-principles calculations.,Ionic to Electronic Transport in Ba3Ti3O6(BO3)2 under Reducing Atmosphere,10.1021/acsaem.7b00124
2,18271,"We find that the electrical transport mechanism in the material changes from being ionic under oxidizing and soft reducing conditions to mainly electronic under extreme reducing conditions; consequently, the total conductivity is increased by about 200 times.",Ionic to Electronic Transport in Ba3Ti3O6(BO3)2 under Reducing Atmosphere,10.1021/acsaem.7b00124
3,18271,"The change is caused by the emergence of electron polarons, associated with the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, as the predominant highly mobile current-carrying defects.",Ionic to Electronic Transport in Ba3Ti3O6(BO3)2 under Reducing Atmosphere,10.1021/acsaem.7b00124
4,18271,"Hybrid-density-functional electronic structure and defect calculations provide a novel theoretical framework for understanding the observed transport properties, including the ionic to electronic transition and the effects of doping.",Ionic to Electronic Transport in Ba3Ti3O6(BO3)2 under Reducing Atmosphere,10.1021/acsaem.7b00124
5,18271,"We also find that Ba3Ti3O6(BO3)(2) is stable in the extreme reducing atmosphere, and the Ti4+/Ti3+ reduction and re-oxidation reactions are reversible.",Ionic to Electronic Transport in Ba3Ti3O6(BO3)2 under Reducing Atmosphere,10.1021/acsaem.7b00124
6,18271,This mixed ionic-electronic conductor can thus have applications in solid-oxide fuel-cell anodes or anode composites.,Ionic to Electronic Transport in Ba3Ti3O6(BO3)2 under Reducing Atmosphere,10.1021/acsaem.7b00124
