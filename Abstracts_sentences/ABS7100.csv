1,7100,"To promote catalytic activity toward oxygen-reduction reaction in the intermediate temperature solid-oxide fuel cells, we prepared a dual-phase composite cathode material 75 mol%La0.5Sr0.5CoO(3-delta)-LaSrCoO4 +/- delta with a fibrous structure via one-pot electrospinning of a polymer containing solution.",Composite fibers of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-LaSrCoO4 ± δ with high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.086
2,7100,We then investigated the microstructure and electrochemical performance of this fibrous composite.,Composite fibers of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-LaSrCoO4 ± δ with high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.086
3,7100,The results confirm that the fibrous composite is composed of intimately mixed nano-crystalline grains and that the compositional phases are compatible with each other.,Composite fibers of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-LaSrCoO4 ± δ with high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.086
4,7100,"Compared with the corresponding single-phase fibers, the nano-crystalline size of the composite is more stable, and the fine nano-crystalline grains are more resistant to growth and coarsening, indicating the mutual dispersion and suppression between the constituent phases.",Composite fibers of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-LaSrCoO4 ± δ with high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.086
5,7100,"Furthermore, compared with the corresponding single-phase fibers, the electrochemical performance of this fibrous composite cathode is more favorable.",Composite fibers of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-LaSrCoO4 ± δ with high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.086
6,7100,"At 800 degrees C, its area specific resistance (ASR) is as low as 0.03 Omega( )cm(2), and maximum output power density is as high as 960 mW cm(-2), which is achieved from an electrolyte-supported single cell that was developed using this cathode.",Composite fibers of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-LaSrCoO4 ± δ with high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.086
7,7100,"After aging this cathode for a long time, ASR is less worsened and the output power density decreases only slightly, indicating that the prolonged electrochemical performance in the running cells is more stable.",Composite fibers of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-LaSrCoO4 ± δ with high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.086
