2,14133,"This paper evaluated the microstructural characteristics and properties including porosity, pore size distribution, sintering shrinkage, mechanical strength, and electrical conductivity of the SOFC anode using carbon microspheres (CMSs) as the pore-former in the fabrication of Ni/YSZ ceramic anode.",Characteristics of Ni/YSZ ceramic anode prepared using carbon microspheres as a pore former,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.108
3,14133,"CMSs with different average particle sizes (CMS1: 11.54 mu m, CMS2: 4.39 mu m, and CMS3: 0.27 mu m) were synthesized, and then incorporated into NiO/YSZ at various volumetric blend ratios ranging from 4.4 to 44.6 vol.%.",Characteristics of Ni/YSZ ceramic anode prepared using carbon microspheres as a pore former,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.108
4,14133,"SOFC anode cermets with a desirable range of porosity (30-40%), shrinkage (15.9-17.3%), flexural strength (75.4-157.8 N), and electrical conductivity (253.5-510.7 S/cm) were obtained using approximately 4-10 vol% of CMS1, 4-20 vol.% of CMS2, and 10-34 vol.% of CMS3.",Characteristics of Ni/YSZ ceramic anode prepared using carbon microspheres as a pore former,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.108
