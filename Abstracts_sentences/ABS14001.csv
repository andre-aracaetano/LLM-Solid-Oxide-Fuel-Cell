1,14001,The aim of this work was to fabricate a dense and thin film of gadolinium doped ceria (CGO) adherent on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) using electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC) applications.,Elaboration of thin and dense CGO films adherent to YSZ by electrostatic spray deposition for IT-SOFC applications,10.1039/c0nj00570c
2,14001,"In order to optimize the film microstructure and thickness, several ESD parameters were studied such as the total salt concentration of the solution (0.05, 0.01 and 0.005 mol L(-1)), the substrate temperature (range from 275 to 350 degrees C), the solvent composition (using different butyl-carbitol : ethanol ratios), nozzle-to-substrate distance (35 and 45 mm), the solution flow rate (0.50, 0.67 and 1 mL h(-1)) and the deposition time (from 15 to 60 min).",Elaboration of thin and dense CGO films adherent to YSZ by electrostatic spray deposition for IT-SOFC applications,10.1039/c0nj00570c
