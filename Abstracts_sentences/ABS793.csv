1,793,"Microstructural changes in solid oxide fuel cell anodes after long-term operation have been characterized by sequential sectioning with a focused ion beam, followed by scanning electron microscopy imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction.",Long-term microstructural changes in solid oxide fuel cell anodes: 3D reconstruction,10.1111/jace.14659
2,793,The anodes were porous composites of Ni and Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ).,Long-term microstructural changes in solid oxide fuel cell anodes: 3D reconstruction,10.1111/jace.14659
3,793,"The cells were operated at 800 degrees C for 2, 4, and 8 kh, and at 925 degrees C for 2 and 4 kh.",Long-term microstructural changes in solid oxide fuel cell anodes: 3D reconstruction,10.1111/jace.14659
4,793,"For each specimen, the volume fraction, surface area, particle diameter, and tortuosity have been calculated for each phase (Ni, YSZ, and pores).",Long-term microstructural changes in solid oxide fuel cell anodes: 3D reconstruction,10.1111/jace.14659
5,793,The dependence of these microstructural parameters on the volume of sample analyzed was monitored; sufficiently large volumes were analyzed so as to eliminate any effect of sample volume.,Long-term microstructural changes in solid oxide fuel cell anodes: 3D reconstruction,10.1111/jace.14659
