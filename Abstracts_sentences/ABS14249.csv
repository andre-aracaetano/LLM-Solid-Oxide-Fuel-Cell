1,14249,A degraded sample of the solid oxide fuel cell cathode material La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) is investigated by analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).,Post-test analysis of silicon poisoning and phase decomposition in the SOFC cathode material La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ by transmission electron microscopy,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.08.013
2,14249,In the present study TEM is applied in order to analyse the relevant surface-near regions of an LSCF sample which was pre-treated for 1000 h in a dry O-2-Ar atmosphere and an additional 1000 h in a humidified atmosphere in the vicinity of a silicon source.,Post-test analysis of silicon poisoning and phase decomposition in the SOFC cathode material La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ by transmission electron microscopy,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.08.013
