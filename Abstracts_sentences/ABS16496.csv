2,16496,"From Arrhenius plots, apparent activation energies, E(a), and apparent pre-exponential factors, A, were calculated for the oxygen-reduction and oxygen-evolution reactions at La0.84Sr0.16MnO3 cathodes.",THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL REACTIONS ON HIGH-TEMPERATURE FUEL-CELL ELECTRODES,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01817-2
3,16496,"At low overpotentials (\eta\less-than-or-equal-to 0.2 V), both apparent activation energies and apparent pre-exponential factors are much higher in the temperature range T = 800-1000-degrees-C (E(a) almost-equal-to 160-210 kJ/mol, log A almost-equal-to 6-9) compared with those in the range T= 500-800-degrees-C (E(a) almost-equal-to 80-110 kJ/mol, log A = 2-4).",THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL REACTIONS ON HIGH-TEMPERATURE FUEL-CELL ELECTRODES,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01817-2
4,16496,"For oxygen reduction, reaction orders of z(e) = 1 at p(O2) > 0.2 bar and z(e) = 0.5 at p(O2) < 0.2 bar were obtained.",THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL REACTIONS ON HIGH-TEMPERATURE FUEL-CELL ELECTRODES,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01817-2
5,16496,These values may be related to either oxygen adsorbed as molecules or atoms as the reacting species.,THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL REACTIONS ON HIGH-TEMPERATURE FUEL-CELL ELECTRODES,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01817-2
6,16496,"From impedance spectroscopy, it follows that the rate of the oxygen-exchange reaction is determined not only by charge transfer, but also by another process, possibly the adsorption or surface diffusion of intermediates.",THE KINETICS OF ELECTROCHEMICAL REACTIONS ON HIGH-TEMPERATURE FUEL-CELL ELECTRODES,10.1016/0378-7753(93)01817-2
