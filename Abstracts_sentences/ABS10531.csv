1,10531,"In this paper, we reported our effort on improving electrochemical performance of (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.995)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) by infiltration of La2NiO4+delta (LNO).",High performance La2NiO4+δ-infiltrated (La0.6Sr0.4)0.995Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.132
2,10531,"It is found that a porous LCSF backbone coated with LNO nanoparticles is an attractive way to acquire a noticeable decrease in the polarization resistance and activation energy of LSCF cathode, thereby showing high surface activity and enhanced oxygen transport capability.",High performance La2NiO4+δ-infiltrated (La0.6Sr0.4)0.995Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.132
3,10531,The key contributions of the LNO nanoparticles also lead to a 67% increase in peak power density and operation stability at a constant current density of 250 mA cm(-2) with a low degradation rate of 0.39% for about 500 h at 750 degrees C.,High performance La2NiO4+δ-infiltrated (La0.6Sr0.4)0.995Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.132
4,10531,"Although extended durability of LNO-infiltrated LSCF might be concerned, based on coarsening of the LNO nanopartides, a greatly increased power density and voltage output after a cell operation of 500 h engenders substantial confidence in the beneficial effect of LNO-infiltrated LSCF materials on cell properties.",High performance La2NiO4+δ-infiltrated (La0.6Sr0.4)0.995Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.132
5,10531,"The enhancement of ORR kinetics could be ascribed to the increase of active surface area and active reaction regions from the heterostructured LSCF/LNO interface architecture, and/or favorable cation diffusion from LSCF to LNO.",High performance La2NiO4+δ-infiltrated (La0.6Sr0.4)0.995Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.132
