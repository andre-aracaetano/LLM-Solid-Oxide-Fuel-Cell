1,7050,An electrolyte supported single chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) module consisting of two cells has been proposed.,Single chamber electrolyte supported SOFC module,10.1149/1.1799952
2,7050,"The module consists of one Sm-doped CeO2 (SDC) electrolyte substrate (0.5 mm thick with the size of 5 x 10 mm), two Ni-SDC anodes on one side, and two SDC-(La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O-3 cathodes on the other side.",Single chamber electrolyte supported SOFC module,10.1149/1.1799952
3,7050,Two modules with different electrode areas were prepared and tested using an air-propane mixture.,Single chamber electrolyte supported SOFC module,10.1149/1.1799952
4,7050,The electrode area had a strong influence on the performance of the module.,Single chamber electrolyte supported SOFC module,10.1149/1.1799952
5,7050,It was shown that the two-cell module generated 1.5 V open-circuit voltage and about 17 mW maximum power at 550 degrees C. (C) 2004,Single chamber electrolyte supported SOFC module,10.1149/1.1799952
