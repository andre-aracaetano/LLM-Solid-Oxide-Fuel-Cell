3,15093,"Even though the electrical conductivity of the anode decreased with increasing ceria content in the anode catalyst in association with decreasing nickel content, the ohmic loss was kept low until the ceria content was <= 30 mol% because the semiconducting ceria compensated for the decreased current path owing to the decreasing nickel content, The lowest activation loss was observed when the ceria content in the nickel anode catalyst was 30 mol% and the maximum activation loss was obtained for ceria content of 2 mol%.",The effect of ceria content in nickel-ceria composite anode catalysts on the discharge performance for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.031
