1,19033,Double perovskites which exhibit 1:2 B-site ordering are under focus because of their interesting structure property relationships and high chemical versatility.,"Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Electrical Properties of (Sr0.5Ca0.5)(Ca0.5Sb0.5)O3-δ Double Perovskites",10.1021/cm1029276
2,19033,"Perovskites with a big cation, such as Sr2+ or Ca2+, occupying the octahedral B site are very scarce because the calculated Goldschmidt tolerance factor becomes quite small as these types of cations usually occupy the A-site.","Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Electrical Properties of (Sr0.5Ca0.5)(Ca0.5Sb0.5)O3-δ Double Perovskites",10.1021/cm1029276
3,19033,This work describes the synthesis and structural and microstructural characterization of a new calcium and strontium antimoniate which shows face-centered cubic symmetry and a rock-salt ordered distribution of Sbs+ and Sr2+.,"Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Electrical Properties of (Sr0.5Ca0.5)(Ca0.5Sb0.5)O3-δ Double Perovskites",10.1021/cm1029276
4,19033,The ordered-cation distribution occurs due to the differences in both the ionic sizes and the bonding character of the two B-site cations.,"Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Electrical Properties of (Sr0.5Ca0.5)(Ca0.5Sb0.5)O3-δ Double Perovskites",10.1021/cm1029276
5,19033,"As a consequence of the cation stoichiometry of the title phase and assuming a pentavalent state for Sb, a large concentration of oxygen vacancies are created (y similar to 0.25).","Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Electrical Properties of (Sr0.5Ca0.5)(Ca0.5Sb0.5)O3-δ Double Perovskites",10.1021/cm1029276
6,19033,Diffraction studies reveal that these vacancies tend to arrange in a short-ordered way and are related to oxygen ionic conductivity (10(-3) S/cm at 700 degrees C) which makes these materials potential candidates to be used as electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,"Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Electrical Properties of (Sr0.5Ca0.5)(Ca0.5Sb0.5)O3-δ Double Perovskites",10.1021/cm1029276
