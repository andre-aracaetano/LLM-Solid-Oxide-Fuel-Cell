4,19579,The DTA study demonstrated that the crystallization exotherm of fluorphlogopite mica appeared in the temperature window of 886-903 degrees C.,"Crystallization, microstructure and mechanical behavior of titanium doped barium fluormica glass-ceramics",10.1111/ijac.13165
5,19579,"In this investigation, four glass samples were prepared using 2 (MA1), 4 (MA2), 6 (MA3), and 8 (MA4) wt% of TiO2.","Crystallization, microstructure and mechanical behavior of titanium doped barium fluormica glass-ceramics",10.1111/ijac.13165
6,19579,Glass transition (T-g) and peak crystallization (T-p) temperatures escalated with an increase in the TiO2 content from 2 (MA1) to 4 wt% (MA2).,"Crystallization, microstructure and mechanical behavior of titanium doped barium fluormica glass-ceramics",10.1111/ijac.13165
7,19579,"However, beyond this value, T-g and T-p decreased with a surge in TiO2 content from 6 (MA3) to 8 wt% (MA4).","Crystallization, microstructure and mechanical behavior of titanium doped barium fluormica glass-ceramics",10.1111/ijac.13165
