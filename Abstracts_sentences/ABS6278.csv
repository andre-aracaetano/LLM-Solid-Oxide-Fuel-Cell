1,6278,Factors of cathode current-collecting layer (CCCL) affecting cell performance are studied by investigation of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks with various (La0.75Sr0.25)(0.95)MnO3-delta (LSM) as CCCL in-suit.,Factors of cathode current-collecting layer affecting cell performance inside solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.08.116
2,6278,A larger real contact area between cathode and interconnect appears when the LSM is coated on cathode side as CCCL through characterization of a 2-cell stack.,Factors of cathode current-collecting layer affecting cell performance inside solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.08.116
3,6278,The result reveals that the real contact area depends on the surface roughness match (SRM) between CCCL and its neighboring components (active cathode and interconnect).,Factors of cathode current-collecting layer affecting cell performance inside solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.08.116
