1,769,A comparative study is carried out on the effect of cosintering temperature of anode-electrolyte bilayer on the fabrication and cell performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells from commercially available tape casting materials.,Effect of cosintering of anode-electrolyte bilayer on the fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-008-0537-z
2,769,It was found that the sintering conditions have profound effects on the anode characteristic and cell performance.,Effect of cosintering of anode-electrolyte bilayer on the fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-008-0537-z
3,769,"For low cosintering temperature as low as 1,250 degrees C, the electrolyte is unable to sinter fully and forms a porous structure which leads to a reduced open-circuit potential and poor cell performance especially under low current output.",Effect of cosintering of anode-electrolyte bilayer on the fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-008-0537-z
4,769,"For further increasing cosintering temperature to 1,350 degrees C, the cell performance was lower under low current operation.",Effect of cosintering of anode-electrolyte bilayer on the fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-008-0537-z
5,769,"However, the cell performance turns out to be better than that of high-temperature cosintering under high current output.",Effect of cosintering of anode-electrolyte bilayer on the fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-008-0537-z
6,769,"Although at temperature as high as 1,500 degrees C the cell performs better than that of low temperature cosintering, the trend turn out to be reverse for high current operating due to less anode surface area resulting from overagglomeration of anode layer.",Effect of cosintering of anode-electrolyte bilayer on the fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-008-0537-z
7,769,"An optimal cosintering temperature of 1,350-1,450 degrees C is recommended for commercially available anode-electrolyte bilayer of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells.",Effect of cosintering of anode-electrolyte bilayer on the fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-008-0537-z
