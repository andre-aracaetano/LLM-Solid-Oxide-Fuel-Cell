1,9452,Lowering the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has extensively stimulated the development of new oxide ion conductors.,Borates as a new direction in the design of oxide ion conductors,10.1007/s40843-022-2044-3
2,9452,"Here, inspired by the structural commonalities of oxide ion conductors, the inability to accommodate oxygen vacancies in the rigid, isolated, 3-fold tetrahedral rings of SrSi/GeO3-based materials, and the considerable flexibility of BOn polyhedra in terms of coordination number, rotation, deformation, and linkage, we report the first borate-base family of oxide ion conductors, (Gd/Y)(1-x)ZnxBO3-0.5x, through combined computational prediction and experimental verification.",Borates as a new direction in the design of oxide ion conductors,10.1007/s40843-022-2044-3
3,9452,"The oxygen vacancies in (Gd/Y)BO3 can be accommodated by forming B3O8 units in isolated, 3-fold, tetrahedral rings of B3O9 and transported through a cooperative mechanism of oxygen exchange between the B3O9 and B3O8 units, which is assisted by the intermediate opening and extending of these units.",Borates as a new direction in the design of oxide ion conductors,10.1007/s40843-022-2044-3
