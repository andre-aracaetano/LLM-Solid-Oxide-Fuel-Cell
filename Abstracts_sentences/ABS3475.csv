7,3475,Anode gas diffusion through the porous substrate appears at similar to 0.5 Hz and dominates the overall diffusion impedance.,Gas Transport Impedance in Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/1.3519492
8,3475,"Cathode gas diffusion through the porous current collecting layer appears at similar to 3 Hz, which significantly contributes to the overall gas diffusion impedance under low cathode oxygen partial pressures.",Gas Transport Impedance in Segmented-in-Series Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/1.3519492
