1,9156,Degradation of cathode in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) remains a major concern for the long-term performance stability and operational reliability.,Development and Validation of Chromium Getters for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Systems,10.3791/59623
2,9156,The presence of gas phase chromium species in air has demonstrated significant cathode performance degradation during long-term exposure due to unwanted compound formation at the cathode and electrolyte interface which retards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).,Development and Validation of Chromium Getters for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Systems,10.3791/59623
3,9156,We have demonstrated a novel method to mitigate the cathode degradation using chromium getters which capture the gas phase chromium species before it is ingested in the cathode chamber.,Development and Validation of Chromium Getters for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Systems,10.3791/59623
4,9156,"Low-cost getter materials, synthesized from alkaline earth and transition metal oxides, are coated on the cordierite honeycomb substrate for application in the SOFC power systems.",Development and Validation of Chromium Getters for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Systems,10.3791/59623
5,9156,As-fabricated getters have been screened by chromium transpiration tests for 500 h in humidified air atmosphere in presence of chromium vapor.,Development and Validation of Chromium Getters for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Systems,10.3791/59623
6,9156,Selected getters have been further validated utilizing electrochemical tests.,Development and Validation of Chromium Getters for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Systems,10.3791/59623
7,9156,"Typically, electrochemical performance of SOFCs (lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) parallel to yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) parallel to Pt) was measured at 850 degrees C in the presence and absence of Cr getter.",Development and Validation of Chromium Getters for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Systems,10.3791/59623
8,9156,"For the 100 h cell tests containing getters, stable electrochemical performance was maintained, whereas the cell performance in the absence of Cr getters rapidly decreased in 10 h. Analyses of Nyquist plots indicated significant increase in the polarization resistance within the first 10 h of the cell operation.",Development and Validation of Chromium Getters for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Systems,10.3791/59623
9,9156,Characterization results from posttest SOFCs and getters have demonstrated the high efficiency of chromium capture for the mitigation of cell degradation.,Development and Validation of Chromium Getters for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Systems,10.3791/59623
