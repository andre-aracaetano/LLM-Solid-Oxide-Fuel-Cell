1,6288,"Bi1.4Er0.6O3-(La0.74Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-delta (ESB-LBSM) composite cathodes were fabricated by impregnating the ionic conducting ESB matrix with the LBSM electronic conducting materials The ion-impregnated ESB-LBSM cathodes were beneficial for the O-2 reduction reactions, and the performance of these cathodes was investigated at temperatures below 700 degrees C by AC impedance spectroscopy and the results indicated that the ion-impregnated ESB-LBSM system had an excellent performance.",Bi1.4Er0.6O3-(La0.74Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-δ Cathodes Fabricated By Ion-impregnating Method For IT-SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200900068
2,6288,"At 700 degrees C, the lowest cathode polarisation resistance (R-p) was only 0.07 Omega cm(2) for the ion-impregnated ESB-LBSM system For the performance testing of single cells, the maximum power density was 1.0 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C for a cell with the ESB-LBSM cathode",Bi1.4Er0.6O3-(La0.74Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-δ Cathodes Fabricated By Ion-impregnating Method For IT-SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200900068
3,6288,"The results demonstrated that the unique combination of the ESB ionic conducting matrix with electronic conducting LBSM materials was a valid method to improve the cathode performance, and the ion-impregnated ESB-LBSM was a promising composite cathode material for the intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",Bi1.4Er0.6O3-(La0.74Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-δ Cathodes Fabricated By Ion-impregnating Method For IT-SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200900068
