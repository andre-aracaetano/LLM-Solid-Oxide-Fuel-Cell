3,12753,"However, previous studies have confirmed that metal Co surfaces only have weak adsorption activity for H2O, which is evidently unfavorable for steam reforming.",Cooperative activation effect on H2O adsorption in MnO-Co catalyzed steam methane reforming,10.1016/j.physleta.2019.01.038
4,12753,"In this work we used first-principles simulations to study the activity of MnO-Co catalysts for the adsorption of H2O. Compared with the Co (111) surface and pristine Co clusters, the MnO-Co catalytic layer has a stronger adsorption capability for H2O because of the introduction of the MnO substrate, which is crucial for improving the steam reforming reaction and inhibiting carbon disposition in SOFCs.",Cooperative activation effect on H2O adsorption in MnO-Co catalyzed steam methane reforming,10.1016/j.physleta.2019.01.038
