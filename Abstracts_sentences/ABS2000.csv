1,2000,Lowering the operating temperature is a universal R&D challenge for the development of low-temperature (<600 degrees C) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that meet the demands of commercialization.,Advanced Fuel Cell Based on New Nanocrystalline Structure Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 Electrolyte,10.1021/acsami.8b20454
2,2000,"Regarding the traditional electrolyte materials of SOFCs, bulk diffusion is the main ionic conduction mechanism, which is primarily affected by the bulk density and operating temperatures.",Advanced Fuel Cell Based on New Nanocrystalline Structure Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 Electrolyte,10.1021/acsami.8b20454
3,2000,"In this study, we report a new mechanism for the Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (GDC) electrolyte based on a nanocrystalline structure with surface or grain boundary conduction, exhibiting an extremely high ionic conductivity of 0.37 S.cm(-1) at 550 degrees C.",Advanced Fuel Cell Based on New Nanocrystalline Structure Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 Electrolyte,10.1021/acsami.8b20454
4,2000,"The fuel cell with the nanocrystalline structure GDC electrolyte (0.5 mm in thickness) can deliver a remarkable peak power density of 591.8 mW.cm(-2) at 550 degrees C, which is approximately 3.5 times higher than that for the cell with the GDC electrolyte densified at 1550 degrees C. An amorphous layer enriched by oxygen vacancies was found at the surface of the nano-GDC particles in the fuel cell test atmosphere, which was attributed to the ion conduction channel of the grain boundary diffusion.",Advanced Fuel Cell Based on New Nanocrystalline Structure Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 Electrolyte,10.1021/acsami.8b20454
5,2000,The ionic conduction at the interfaces between the particles was discovered to be the dominant conduction mechanism of the nanocrystalline structure GDC electrolyte.,Advanced Fuel Cell Based on New Nanocrystalline Structure Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 Electrolyte,10.1021/acsami.8b20454
6,2000,"Oxygen ions and protons were determined to be the charge carriers in this interfacial conduction phenomenon, and the conduction of oxygen ions was dominant.",Advanced Fuel Cell Based on New Nanocrystalline Structure Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 Electrolyte,10.1021/acsami.8b20454
