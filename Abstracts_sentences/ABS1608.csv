2,1608,"However, understanding the complexity of fuel cell stacks and systems supplied by ammonia remains challenging.",Parametric study of a high-performance ammonia-fed SOFC standalone system,10.1007/s12206-022-0550-7
3,1608,"Therefore, it is proposed to investigate the standalone SOFC system to clearly elucidate the behavior of the stack and realize facile implementation.",Parametric study of a high-performance ammonia-fed SOFC standalone system,10.1007/s12206-022-0550-7
4,1608,"In this study, the stack was modeled and validated using experimental data to confirm its output characteristics.",Parametric study of a high-performance ammonia-fed SOFC standalone system,10.1007/s12206-022-0550-7
5,1608,"The system efficiency was then calculated under various operating conditions, such as current density, fuel utilization, and stack in/out temperature.",Parametric study of a high-performance ammonia-fed SOFC standalone system,10.1007/s12206-022-0550-7
6,1608,The results show that the system efficiency is approximately 54 % and is highly dependent on fuel utilization and current density but not on temperature differences.,Parametric study of a high-performance ammonia-fed SOFC standalone system,10.1007/s12206-022-0550-7
7,1608,"However, the system can only operate at a temperature difference of 65 degrees C or higher owing to the effectiveness of the heat exchanger on the fuel side.",Parametric study of a high-performance ammonia-fed SOFC standalone system,10.1007/s12206-022-0550-7
