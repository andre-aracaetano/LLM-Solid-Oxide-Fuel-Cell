1,9666,This paper examines the feasibility of using electrophoretic deposition for producing thin films of cathode materials based on lanthanum nickel oxides (with the lanthanum nickelate La2NiO4 + delta (LNO) as the predominant phase).,"Preparation of thin bilayer coatings based on lanthanum, nickel, and cerium mixed oxides by electrophoretic deposition",10.1134/S0020168517090102
2,9666,"We have determined the particle size and zeta potential of nonaqueous suspensions of LNO micro-and nanopowders prepared by solid-state reactions, pyrolysis of liquid precursors, and laser evaporation of a target.","Preparation of thin bilayer coatings based on lanthanum, nickel, and cerium mixed oxides by electrophoretic deposition",10.1134/S0020168517090102
3,9666,"Using ultrasonic processing, we have obtained stable LNO nanopowder suspensions in acetylacetone and an isopropanol + acetylacetone mixture, which have zeta potentials of +25 and + 38 mV, respectively.","Preparation of thin bilayer coatings based on lanthanum, nickel, and cerium mixed oxides by electrophoretic deposition",10.1134/S0020168517090102
4,9666,"Electrophoretic deposition on a dense model cathode has produced thin bilayer coatings from electrode and electrolyte materials (LNO and Ce-0.8(Sm0.75Sr0.2Ba0.05)(0.2)O2-delta), which are of interest for solid oxide fuel cell technology.","Preparation of thin bilayer coatings based on lanthanum, nickel, and cerium mixed oxides by electrophoretic deposition",10.1134/S0020168517090102
