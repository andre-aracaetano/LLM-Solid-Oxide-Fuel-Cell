1,20900,"An assessment is undertaken for the formation of anorthite crystalline phase in a melilite-based glass composition (CMAS: 38.7CaO-9.7MgO-12.9Al(2)O(3)-38.7SiO(2) mol %), used as a sealing material in solid oxide fuel cells, in view of the detrimental effect of anorthite on the sealing properties.",Understanding the Formation of CaAl2Si2O8 in Melilite-Based Glass-Ceramics: Combined Diffraction and Spectroscopic Studies,10.1021/acsomega.7b00598
2,20900,"Several advanced characterization techniques are employed to assess the material after prolonged heat treatment, including neutron powder diffraction (ND), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Si-29 and Al-27 magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR), and in situ Raman spectroscopy.",Understanding the Formation of CaAl2Si2O8 in Melilite-Based Glass-Ceramics: Combined Diffraction and Spectroscopic Studies,10.1021/acsomega.7b00598
3,20900,"ND, Si-29 MAS-NMR, and Al-27 MAS-NMR results revealed that both Si and Al adopt tetrahedral coordination and participate in the formation of the network structure.",Understanding the Formation of CaAl2Si2O8 in Melilite-Based Glass-Ceramics: Combined Diffraction and Spectroscopic Studies,10.1021/acsomega.7b00598
4,20900,"In situ XRD measurements for the CMAS glass demonstrate the thermal stability of the glass structure up to 850 degrees C. Further heat treatment up to 900 degrees C initiates the precipitation of melilite, a solid solution of akermanite/gehlenite crystalline phase.",Understanding the Formation of CaAl2Si2O8 in Melilite-Based Glass-Ceramics: Combined Diffraction and Spectroscopic Studies,10.1021/acsomega.7b00598
