2,16570,"It is found that when going from air to the reductive atmosphere (8% Ar/H-2), the conductivity of both samples at 1173 K increases from 4.6 to 25 S/cm for LCF6 and from 0.5 to 10 S/cm for LCF5.","New Electrode Materials for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Perovskites (La,Ca)(Fe,Co,Mg,Mo)O3-δ",10.1134/S1023193520020111
3,16570,"For LCF5, the conductivity is shown to be virtually independent of the oxygen partial pressure throughout the studied intervals of temperature and partial pressure, whereas for LCF6 two regions are observed.","New Electrode Materials for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Perovskites (La,Ca)(Fe,Co,Mg,Mo)O3-δ",10.1134/S1023193520020111

5,16570,"The method of impedance spectroscopy is used for studying the electrochemical behavior in air of the porous electrode based on (La,Ca)(Fe,Mg,Mo)O3 - delta deposited on the solid electrolyte of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC).","New Electrode Materials for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Perovskites (La,Ca)(Fe,Co,Mg,Mo)O3-δ",10.1134/S1023193520020111
6,16570,"The polarization resistance of the electrode/electrolyte interface (R-eta) is found to be 2.7 and 3.6 ohm cm(2) for electrodes of LCF5 and LCF6, respectively, at 1173 K.","New Electrode Materials for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Perovskites (La,Ca)(Fe,Co,Mg,Mo)O3-δ",10.1134/S1023193520020111
7,16570,The partial substitution of Co for Fe allows the R-eta value of La0.3Ca0.7Fe0.45Co0.05Mg0.25Mo0.25O3 - delta and La0.3Ca0.7Fe0.55Co0.05Mg0.175Mo0.225O3 - delta to be decreased to similar to 1.2 ohm cm(2).,"New Electrode Materials for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Perovskites (La,Ca)(Fe,Co,Mg,Mo)O3-δ",10.1134/S1023193520020111
