1,16139,We report the fabrication and evaluation of a ceramic-anode supported button cell LSCM-SDC/SDC/PBSC (thickness 400 mu m/ 20 mu m/20 mu m).,A Ceramic-Anode Supported Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/2.019206esl
2,16139,"The anode/electrolyte assembly LSCM-SDC/SDC was co-fired at low temperature of 1250 degrees C, where a slight amount of CuO was mixed with LSCM.",A Ceramic-Anode Supported Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/2.019206esl
3,16139,The CuO (20.3 wt%) were impregnated into the porous substrate to enhance current collecting effect.,A Ceramic-Anode Supported Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/2.019206esl
4,16139,"The cell exhibited power density of 596 mWcm(-2) and 381 mWcm(-2) at 700 degrees C with wet hydrogen and methane as the fuel respectively, where the silver paste was used as current collectors, the highest performance up to date for the cells with metal oxide anodes at this temperature.",A Ceramic-Anode Supported Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/2.019206esl
