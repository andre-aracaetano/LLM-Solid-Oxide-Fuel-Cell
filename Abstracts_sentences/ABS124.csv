1,124,In this paper solid oxide fuel cells operating with dry synthetic biogas have been examined.,Investigation of catalytic layers on anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating with synthetic biogas,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.10.023
2,124,"In order to increase their stability the layers of CuO-CeO2, Cu1.3Mn1.7O4 and Y0.08Sr0.92Ti0.8Fe0.2O3-delta have been deposited on the Ni-YSZ anode site.",Investigation of catalytic layers on anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating with synthetic biogas,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.10.023
3,124,These layers should catalyze the internal biogas reforming and prevent the carbon deposition on the anode site.,Investigation of catalytic layers on anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating with synthetic biogas,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.10.023
4,124,"It has been found that CuO-CeO2 and Cu1.3Mn1.7O4 catalysts led to an increase of the stability (at least 7 days) of the fabricated fuel cells powered by biogas, whereas the unmodified fuel cell, as well as the fuel cell with Y0.08Sr0.92Ti0.8Fe0.2O3-delta catalyst degraded gradually with time.",Investigation of catalytic layers on anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating with synthetic biogas,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.10.023
5,124,A significant amount of carbon nanofibers has been formed on the catalyst surface after fuel cell test.,Investigation of catalytic layers on anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating with synthetic biogas,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.10.023
6,124,"However, they have not formed in the anode area.",Investigation of catalytic layers on anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating with synthetic biogas,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.10.023
7,124,"The use of CuO-CeO2 and Cu1.3Mn1.7O4 catalysts prevented the carbon deposition on the anode site, and thus the fuel cell degradation was slower when operating with biogas fuel.",Investigation of catalytic layers on anode for solid oxide fuel cells operating with synthetic biogas,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.10.023
