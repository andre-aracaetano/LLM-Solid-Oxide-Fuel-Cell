5,3175,All systems in this study assume a Conoco Philips gasifier and cold-gas clean up conditions for the coal gasification system (Cases 3 and 4 in the NETL IGCC report).,Comparison of Preanode and Postanode Carbon Dioxide Separation for IGFC Systems,10.1115/1.4000140
6,3175,"Four system arrangements, cases, are examined.",Comparison of Preanode and Postanode Carbon Dioxide Separation for IGFC Systems,10.1115/1.4000140
7,3175,Cases 1 and 2 remove the CO(2) after the SOFC anode.,Comparison of Preanode and Postanode Carbon Dioxide Separation for IGFC Systems,10.1115/1.4000140
8,3175,"Case 3 assumes steam addition, a water-gas-shift (WGS) catalyst, and a Selexol process to remove the CO(2) in the gas cleanup section, sending a hydrogen-rich gas to the fuel cell anode.",Comparison of Preanode and Postanode Carbon Dioxide Separation for IGFC Systems,10.1115/1.4000140
9,3175,"Case 4 assumes Selexol in the cold-gas cleanup section as in Case 3; however, there is no steam addition, and the WGS takes places in the SOFC and after the anode.",Comparison of Preanode and Postanode Carbon Dioxide Separation for IGFC Systems,10.1115/1.4000140

11,3175,"The hydrogen-rich case (Case 3) has better net electric efficiency compared with typical postanode CO(2) capture cases (Cases 1 and 2), with a simpler arrangement but at a lower SOFC power density, or a lower efficiency at the same power density.",Comparison of Preanode and Postanode Carbon Dioxide Separation for IGFC Systems,10.1115/1.4000140
12,3175,Case 4 gives an efficiency similar to Case 3 but also at a lower SOFC power density.,Comparison of Preanode and Postanode Carbon Dioxide Separation for IGFC Systems,10.1115/1.4000140
