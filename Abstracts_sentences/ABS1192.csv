2,1192,"Considering the operating and design parameters of yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte supported SOFC stack, the variations of overpotentials, the rational overpotentials and the exergetic efficiencies are investigated for comparison purposes.",A parametric study on exergetic performance of a YSZ electrolyte supported SOFC stack,10.1504/IJEX.2017.087653
3,1192,"Consequently, considering the selected operating conditions and design parameters, it is suggested that the YSZ electrolyte supported SOFC stack having higher exergetic efficiency than 30% is used.",A parametric study on exergetic performance of a YSZ electrolyte supported SOFC stack,10.1504/IJEX.2017.087653
4,1192,"Moreover, in order to operate such a fuel cell in an exergetically more efficient manner, the minimum YSZ electrolyte thickness needs to be thicker than 150 mu m. Otherwise, some durability and manufacture problems may occur.",A parametric study on exergetic performance of a YSZ electrolyte supported SOFC stack,10.1504/IJEX.2017.087653
5,1192,"However, a decrease of operating temperatures from 1273 K to 1073 K and an increase of YSZ electrolyte thickness from 150 mu m to 500 mu m will result in a reduced exergetic efficiency.",A parametric study on exergetic performance of a YSZ electrolyte supported SOFC stack,10.1504/IJEX.2017.087653
