1,8655,A Ni0.95La0.05O-SDC composite was tested as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode fueled with methane at temperatures between 500 and 600 degrees C (i.e. for low temperature SOFC).,Lanthanum promoted NiO-SDC anode for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells fueled with methane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.081
2,8655,It was found that NiO and La2O3 formed a solid solution and small amounts of La2NiO4 were also observed after sintering at 1340 degrees C. After subsequent reduction.,Lanthanum promoted NiO-SDC anode for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells fueled with methane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.081
3,8655,NiO was reduced to Ni while La2O3 remained as oxide phase.,Lanthanum promoted NiO-SDC anode for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells fueled with methane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.081
4,8655,"The La modified NiO-SDC anode showed higher OCV, over 30% improved maximum power density and better stability in humidified methane fuel as compared with the NiO-SDC anode.",Lanthanum promoted NiO-SDC anode for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells fueled with methane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.081
5,8655,"Meanwhile, the Ni0.95La0.05O-SDC anode cell displayed lower polarization resistance (e.g. at 600 degrees C, 0.12 Omega cm(-2) versus 0.34 Omega cm(-2) for NiO-SDC) implying higher surface reaction activity than the NiO-SDC anode cell.",Lanthanum promoted NiO-SDC anode for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells fueled with methane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.081
6,8655,At 600 degrees C. the Ni0.95La0.05O-SDC anode exhibited similar performance and activity in H-2 and CH4 fuels.,Lanthanum promoted NiO-SDC anode for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells fueled with methane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.081
7,8655,"The SEM results indicated that La effectively prevented NiO coarsening giving rise to a much finer structure with smaller particle size and more uniform distribution, which can contribute to the better performance with La.
