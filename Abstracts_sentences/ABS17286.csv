2,17286,"In this work, oxide catalysts containing Li(2)TiO(3), which can prevent carbon deposition, were developed, and the performance of catalyst-doped anode-supported SOFCs used with CH(4) fuel was evaluated.",Performance Improvement of Oxide Catalyst-Doped Anode-Supported SOFCs for Methane Fuel,10.1149/1.3302459
3,17286,The Li2TiO3 catalyst showed excellent resistance to carbon deposition on Li(2)TiO(3)-catalyst-doped Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anodes.,Performance Improvement of Oxide Catalyst-Doped Anode-Supported SOFCs for Methane Fuel,10.1149/1.3302459
4,17286,"The power density of the catalyst-doped Ni-YSZ anode-supported unit cells was higher than 0.4 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C, and in particular, their long-term stability improved considerably when used with CH4 fuel.",Performance Improvement of Oxide Catalyst-Doped Anode-Supported SOFCs for Methane Fuel,10.1149/1.3302459
