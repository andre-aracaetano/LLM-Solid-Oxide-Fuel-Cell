1,17459,"Anode-supported proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (PC-SOFCs) fabricated with two representative proton-conducting oxides, BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BCZYYb) and BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BZY), were compared to obtain the insight into the electrochemical performances when fueled with syngas at 700 degrees C and the correlation between the anode thickness (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mm) and operational stability.",Anodic Reaction in Syngas-Fueled Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1155/2023/9844833
2,17459,"We have demonstrated that, in stability tests, the BCZYYb cells exhibited significantly higher maximum power density (MPD) than the BZY cells when operating on H-2, 1.22 and 0.48 W/cm(2) for the BCZYYb and BZY cells, but the BCZYYb cells degraded more rapidly than the BZY cells when operating on syngas.",Anodic Reaction in Syngas-Fueled Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1155/2023/9844833
3,17459,"In addition, decreasing the anode thickness significantly enhanced the stability of BCZYYb cells operating on syngas, a reduction of 81, 76, and 71% in MPD for 1.6, 0.8, and 0.4 mm anode after 30 min.",Anodic Reaction in Syngas-Fueled Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1155/2023/9844833
4,17459,The electrochemical impedance spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns indicated that the rapid degradation of cerate-based cells with syngas could be mainly attributed to the considerable increase in polarization resistance due to the phase decomposition of the electrolyte powder in the anode.,Anodic Reaction in Syngas-Fueled Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1155/2023/9844833
5,17459,"Heterogeneous catalysis was performed to study the catalytic reaction of the H-2-CO mixture over anode powders prepared with the two proton-conducting oxides (Ni-BCZYYb and Ni-BZY) in a fixed bed reactor, and the CO conversion and selectivity to CO2 and CH4 were determined.",Anodic Reaction in Syngas-Fueled Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1155/2023/9844833
6,17459,"For all anode powders, continuous CO2 production was initially observed with CH4 formation, and no significant difference in catalytic activity trends was observed between both anode powders.",Anodic Reaction in Syngas-Fueled Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1155/2023/9844833
7,17459,"An increased residence time substantially decreased the normalized CO2 yield, which was associated with the potential secondary reaction of CO2 with H-2, CH4, or perovskite oxide.",Anodic Reaction in Syngas-Fueled Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1155/2023/9844833
8,17459,"Based on the results of heterogeneous catalysis with both anode powders, the observed cell degradation on both cells during operation with syngas may be primarily attributed to carbon coking due to CO disproportionation; however, more than 4 times rapid degradation of the cerate-based cell when operating with syngas was clearly demonstrated to be attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte powder in anode by the resulting CO2 from the catalytic reaction of the H-2-CO mixture.",Anodic Reaction in Syngas-Fueled Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1155/2023/9844833
