1,4472,The SrCo0.9Sb0.1O3-delta(SCS) composite oxide with cubic perovskite structure was synthesized by a modified Pechini method and examined as a novel cathode for intermediate-to-low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ILT-SOFCs).,SrCo0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cubic perovskite as a novel cathode for intermediate-to-low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.05.056
2,4472,"At 700 degrees C and under open-circuit condition, symmetrical SCS cathode on Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte showed low polarization resistances (R-p) of 0.09 Omega cm(2) in air.",SrCo0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cubic perovskite as a novel cathode for intermediate-to-low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.05.056
3,4472,A porous layer of SCS was deposited on an anode-supported fuel cell consisting of a similar to 30-mu m thick dense electrolyte of SDC prepared by a cost-effective dip coating process and a NiO-SDC cermet as an anode (Ni-SDC/SDC/SCS).,SrCo0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cubic perovskite as a novel cathode for intermediate-to-low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.05.056
