1,1946,"A novel direct lamination technique by tape casting thermoreversible gel-based slips is introduced for the production of solid oxide fuel cell anode support, anode, and electrolyte layers.","Direct lamination of solid oxide fuel cell anode support, anode, and electrolyte by sequential tape casting of thermoreversible gel slips",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.073
2,1946,Production of cells with controlled layer thicknesses of similar to 10-500 mu m and having well formed and relatively high toughness interfaces is demonstrated.,"Direct lamination of solid oxide fuel cell anode support, anode, and electrolyte by sequential tape casting of thermoreversible gel slips",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.073
3,1946,Cells with maximum current density of 1.76 A.cm(-2) and maximum power density 425 mW cm(-2) were achieved using 97% H-2/3% H2O fuel at 800 degrees C. Specific opportunities for further optimization of processing to improve electrochemical performance are highlighted.,"Direct lamination of solid oxide fuel cell anode support, anode, and electrolyte by sequential tape casting of thermoreversible gel slips",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.073
