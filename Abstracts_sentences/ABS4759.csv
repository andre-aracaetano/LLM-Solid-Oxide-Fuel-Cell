1,4759,A Ni-YSZ/YSZ/Ag-Pt cell was used to demonstrate the concept of high temperature lignite-assisted electrolysis in hybrid (combined solid oxide and molten carbonate) operation.,Demonstration of hydrogen production in a hybrid lignite-assisted solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.144
2,4759,"To assess the performance of the hybrid concept, the same cell was also used for lignite-assisted electrolysis in absence of an anodic carbonate load, as well as for fuel cell measurements using H-2 and lignite as fuels, the latter both with and free of molten carbonates.",Demonstration of hydrogen production in a hybrid lignite-assisted solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.144
3,4759,"In fuel cell operation, the hybrid direct lignite fuel cell obtained 45% higher maximum power density than the H-2 fed SOFC and 160% higher power density than the lignite fuel cell without carbonates.",Demonstration of hydrogen production in a hybrid lignite-assisted solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.144
4,4759,"For high temperature electrolysis, the hybrid concept of admixed lignite and carbonates at the anode led to a 350% higher current density (up to 508 mA.cm(-2), at 1.95 V), compared to the lignite-assisted operation in absence of carbonates (145 mA.cm(-2), at 1.95 V).",Demonstration of hydrogen production in a hybrid lignite-assisted solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.144
5,4759,"Thus, the anodic addition of carbonates within the same cell, increased H2 production 3.5 times.",Demonstration of hydrogen production in a hybrid lignite-assisted solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.144
6,4759,"This was accompanied by an equivalent increase of the anodic fuel consumption, and the cell's efficiency was essentially unaffected.",Demonstration of hydrogen production in a hybrid lignite-assisted solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.144
7,4759,"Nonetheless, significant anodic and cathodic resistances at low overpotentials restricted electrolysis performance and efficiency, in either the absence or the presence of carbonates.",Demonstration of hydrogen production in a hybrid lignite-assisted solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.144
8,4759,"These resistances, most likely due to both the cathodic steam activation and the anodic shuttle of the CO intermediate, were drastically alleviated at higher overpotentials.",Demonstration of hydrogen production in a hybrid lignite-assisted solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.144
9,4759,"The presence of carbonates caused an earlier and more rapid decrease of the anodic area specific resistance, to much lower values at high overpotentials, resulting in the considerably higher performance of the hybrid mode.",Demonstration of hydrogen production in a hybrid lignite-assisted solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.144
