1,2033,"X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the chemical compatibility of (La, Sr)CrO3, SrCrO4, CaCrO4 and Cr2O3 (materials associated with the interconnect of a solid oxide fuel cell) with gadolinia-doped cerium oxide electrolyte (CGO).",Chemical compatibility of chromium-based interconnect related materials with doped cerium oxide electrolyte,10.1016/S0955-2219(98)00279-9
2,2033,Powder mixtures and multilayer pellets of the interconnect related materials were annealed with CGO in air at temperatures ranging from 650 to 1600 degrees C for durations of up to 400 h.,Chemical compatibility of chromium-based interconnect related materials with doped cerium oxide electrolyte,10.1016/S0955-2219(98)00279-9
3,2033,"No reaction was observed between (LA,Sr) CrO3 and Ce0.8Gd0.2 O-1.9 after annealing at 1600 degrees C for 10 h. However, SrCrO4, CaCrO4 and Cr2O3 reacted with CGO, forming an unidentified phase.",Chemical compatibility of chromium-based interconnect related materials with doped cerium oxide electrolyte,10.1016/S0955-2219(98)00279-9
