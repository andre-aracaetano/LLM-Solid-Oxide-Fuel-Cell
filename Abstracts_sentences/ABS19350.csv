2,19350,"This cell is tested in both fuel cell (SOFC) and electrolysis (SOEC) mode and the reversible operation is proven, ASR values being slightly lower in electrolysis mode.",A new anode material for solid oxide electrolyser: The neodymium nickelate Nd2NiO4+δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.003
3,19350,"Performances in SOEC mode are compared with a commercial cell based on the same electrolyte and cathode, but with lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) as anode.",A new anode material for solid oxide electrolyser: The neodymium nickelate Nd2NiO4+δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.003
4,19350,"For a voltage of 1.3 V. current densities of 0.40, 0.64 and 0.87 A cm(-2) are measured at 750,800 and 850 degrees C, respectively; they are much higher than the ones measured in the same conditions for the LSM-containing cell, Indeed, for a voltage of 1.3 V, current densities are respectively 1.7, 3 and 4.2 times higher for the Nd2NiO4+delta cell than for the LSM one at 850, 800 and 750 degrees C, respectively.",A new anode material for solid oxide electrolyser: The neodymium nickelate Nd2NiO4+δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.003
5,19350,"Consequently, Nd2NiO4+delta can be considered as a good candidate for operating below 800 degrees C as oxygen electrode for high temperature steam electrolysis.",A new anode material for solid oxide electrolyser: The neodymium nickelate Nd2NiO4+δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.003
