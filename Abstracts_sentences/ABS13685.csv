1,13685,We successfully proposed a newly corrected density functional theory plus Hubbard U parameter (DFT+U) based on partial core correction on the orbitals within norm-conserving lanthanide atomic pseudopotentials.,Superiority of DFT plus U with non-linear core correction for open-shell binary rare-earth metal oxides: a case study of native point defects in cerium oxides,10.1080/14786435.2014.933908
2,13685,A related and comprehensive investigation of native point defects in cerium oxides has also been performed as an examine by practice.,Superiority of DFT plus U with non-linear core correction for open-shell binary rare-earth metal oxides: a case study of native point defects in cerium oxides,10.1080/14786435.2014.933908
