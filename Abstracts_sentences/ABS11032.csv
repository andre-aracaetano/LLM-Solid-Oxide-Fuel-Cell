1,11032,The degradation of the solid oxide fuel cell cathode material Nd(2)NiO(4+delta) with respect to the oxygen exchange kinetics in H(2)O- and CO(2)-containing atmospheres has been investigated at 700 degrees C.,Long-Term Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of Nd2NiO4+δ in H2O- and CO2-Containing Atmospheres,10.1149/1.3481420
2,11032,The material exhibits excellent stability in dry Ar + 1% O(2) atmosphere over 1000 h.,Long-Term Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of Nd2NiO4+δ in H2O- and CO2-Containing Atmospheres,10.1149/1.3481420
3,11032,"No appreciable degradation has been observed after exposure to a CO(2)-rich atmosphere, but a decrease in the chemical surface exchange coefficient of oxygen by 1 order of magnitude has been found after 1000 h under moist conditions (30% relative humidity).",Long-Term Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of Nd2NiO4+δ in H2O- and CO2-Containing Atmospheres,10.1149/1.3481420
4,11032,Post-test X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth analysis showed significant changes in the Nd:Ni cation ratio within the topmost 100 nm of the H(2)O-degraded sample.,Long-Term Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of Nd2NiO4+δ in H2O- and CO2-Containing Atmospheres,10.1149/1.3481420
5,11032,It is concluded that the degradation mechanism involves hydroxides as intermediate species even if the predominant species in the degraded surface is NdNiO(3).,Long-Term Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of Nd2NiO4+δ in H2O- and CO2-Containing Atmospheres,10.1149/1.3481420
