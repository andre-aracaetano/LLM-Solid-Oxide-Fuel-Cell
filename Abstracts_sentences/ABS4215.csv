1,4215,We report a novel Ni-Mo bimetallic alloy decorated with multi-microcrystals as an efficient anode catalyst for hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Facile Synthesis of Highly Active and Robust Ni-Mo Bimetallic Electrocatalyst for Hydrocarbon Oxidation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsenergylett.6b00109
2,4215,"We show that these Ni-Mo bimetallic alloys are highly active, thermally stable, and sulfur/coke tolerant electrocatalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation.",Facile Synthesis of Highly Active and Robust Ni-Mo Bimetallic Electrocatalyst for Hydrocarbon Oxidation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsenergylett.6b00109
3,4215,"When fueled with CH4-50 ppm of H2S, the SOFC shows a maximum power density of 0.594 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Most significantly, this bimetallic catalyst also offers sustained and steady power output in prolonged tests, suggesting that it is a promising anode catalyst with superior sulfur/coke tolerance and thermal stability.",Facile Synthesis of Highly Active and Robust Ni-Mo Bimetallic Electrocatalyst for Hydrocarbon Oxidation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsenergylett.6b00109
