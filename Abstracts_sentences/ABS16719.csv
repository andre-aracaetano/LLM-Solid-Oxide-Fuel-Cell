1,16719,"Using a model for the Ni/ceria anode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), we have performed a DFT + U study of H-2 and CH4 activation on the ceria surface and elucidated the mechanisms of charge transfer as a result of ceria reduction.",The Electronic Structure and Chemical Properties of a Ni/CeO2 Anode in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp105316p
2,16719,Bader's Atoms in Molecules (AIM) analysis scheme establishes that deposition of nickel on stoichiometric ceria to form the Ni/ceria anode results in the transfer of electron density from Ni to CeO2.,The Electronic Structure and Chemical Properties of a Ni/CeO2 Anode in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp105316p
3,16719,The subsequent removal of an oxygen atom from the ceria surface of the Ni/ceria anode in the process of fuel oxidation results in a minor transfer of electron density from ceria to Ni.,The Electronic Structure and Chemical Properties of a Ni/CeO2 Anode in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp105316p
4,16719,The modest amount of transferred electron charge following vacancy formation can be explained by the fact that the rather shallow vacancy-induced occupied band in ceria has a lower energy than the top of the Ni valence band.,The Electronic Structure and Chemical Properties of a Ni/CeO2 Anode in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp105316p
5,16719,"We also show that the removal of an oxygen atom not bonded to Ni is more favorable (by 28 kcal/mol) than extraction of an oxygen, originally bonded to both Ni and Ce at the Ni/CeO2 interface.",The Electronic Structure and Chemical Properties of a Ni/CeO2 Anode in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp105316p
6,16719,This finding would indicate that fuel oxidation should occur predominantly at the ceria surface of the cermet rather than at the Ni/CeO2 interface.,The Electronic Structure and Chemical Properties of a Ni/CeO2 Anode in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp105316p
7,16719,"Moreover, our study demonstrates that the energies of activation of the fuel molecules (H2 and CH4) on the ceria surface of the Ni/CeO2 cerrnet are close to the respective values in the case of fuel adsorption on a pure ceria surface.",The Electronic Structure and Chemical Properties of a Ni/CeO2 Anode in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp105316p
8,16719,"We also show that the reduction of a ceria film on top of the electrolyte (YSZ, yttria-stabilized zirconia), with subsequent migration of an oxygen from the YSZ bulk to ceria, results in accumulation of charge on Ni, accounting for generation of a current in a SOFC.",The Electronic Structure and Chemical Properties of a Ni/CeO2 Anode in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp105316p
