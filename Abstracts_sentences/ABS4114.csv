4,4114,The polarization experiments on the redox-cycled anode-supported tubular cell showed serious performance degradation as a result of the decreases of open-circuit potential and power density.,Redox-induced performance degradation of anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.038
5,4114,"The ac-impedance measurements combined with microstructural observations indicated that the performance degradation resulted mainly from (i) the degradation of anode support, (ii) microcracks across the whole cell, and (iii) interface delamination.",Redox-induced performance degradation of anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.038
