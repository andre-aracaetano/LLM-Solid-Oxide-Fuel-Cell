4,654,The synthesized CeO2 nanocubes were used as an electrolyte sandwiched between two layers of semiconducting Ni(0.8)Co(0.8)isAl(0.05)LiO(2-delta) to fabricate the fuel cell.,Electrical properties of nanocube CeO2 in advanced solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.05.120
5,654,"Such device has achieved an excellent maximum power density of 406 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C. These results demonstrate CeO2/CeO2-delta heterogeneous interfaces could provide a high ionic conductive path conductor for the electrolyte in SOFCs, which widen the selecting range of the electrolyte candidates for advanced SOFCs.",Electrical properties of nanocube CeO2 in advanced solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.05.120
