3,6755,"One cycle considered is a simple sCO(2) cycle with recuperation, while the other is the supercritical recompression CO2 (srCO(2)) cycle.",Thermoeconomic analysis of two solid oxide fuel cell based cogeneration plants integrated with simple or modified supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles: A comparative study,10.1016/j.energy.2022.125038
4,6755,"To provide a fair comparison between the performances of the SOFC-sCO(2) integrated plants, the flue gas is considered to exit at the same temperature in both cases, through a heating unit to generate hot air.",Thermoeconomic analysis of two solid oxide fuel cell based cogeneration plants integrated with simple or modified supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles: A comparative study,10.1016/j.energy.2022.125038
5,6755,"The findings indicate that designing an efficient SOFC-sCO(2) integrated plant for cogenerating electricity and a by-product, e.g., heat, is not solely a question of selecting the most efficient sCO(2) layout as the bottoming power cycle.",Thermoeconomic analysis of two solid oxide fuel cell based cogeneration plants integrated with simple or modified supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles: A comparative study,10.1016/j.energy.2022.125038
6,6755,"Rather, it is a tradeoff between the exergetic performance of the sCO(2) layout and its potential to absorb heat from upper SOFC system.",Thermoeconomic analysis of two solid oxide fuel cell based cogeneration plants integrated with simple or modified supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles: A comparative study,10.1016/j.energy.2022.125038
7,6755,"It is shown that, at the optimized condition, the capability of a simple sCO(2) cycle for recovering heat from the SOFC is 30.86% higher than a srCO2 layout.",Thermoeconomic analysis of two solid oxide fuel cell based cogeneration plants integrated with simple or modified supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles: A comparative study,10.1016/j.energy.2022.125038
8,6755,"However, the exergy efficiency of the SOFC-srCO(2) integrated cogeneration plant is 0.64% higher than that of the SOFC-sCO2, with a corresponding increase in the average unit cost of products of 3.06%.",Thermoeconomic analysis of two solid oxide fuel cell based cogeneration plants integrated with simple or modified supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles: A comparative study,10.1016/j.energy.2022.125038
