3,15717,"In the first case study presented here, a model is used to test the hypothesis that oxygen interactions with hydrogen on the catalyst particles of solid oxide fuel cell anodes can sometimes occur a finite distance away from the triple phase boundary (TPB), so that such reactions are not restricted to the TPB as normally assumed.",Modeling of environmentally significant interfaces: Two case studies,10.1016/j.elspec.2005.05.005
