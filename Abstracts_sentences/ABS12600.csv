1,12600,The influence of cathode composition on the open-circuit voltage (OCV) and the performance of a single chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) was investigated.,Role of composite cathodes in single chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1786071
2,12600,"Because the SC-SOFC is operated using a mixture of air and fuel, the OCV of the cell is determined by the difference of catalytic activity between the cathode and anode.",Role of composite cathodes in single chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1786071
3,12600,"Due to its catalytic activity with fuel, Ni-cermet has proven to be an excellent anode.",Role of composite cathodes in single chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1786071
4,12600,"Typical cathode materials such as perovskite oxides also have catalytic activity with fuel, which can influence the OCV.",Role of composite cathodes in single chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1786071
5,12600,"In this study, cells with composite cathode materials (a mixture of Sm-doped ceria (SDC) and (La, Sr)(Co, Fe)O-3 (LSCF)) and reference electrode (Ag) on SDC electrolyte were prepared and tested in a mixture of propane and air.",Role of composite cathodes in single chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1786071
6,12600,Several cathode compositions yielded a voltage as high as 0.1 V against the Ag reference electrode and the voltage decreased as the SDC content in the LSCF increased.,Role of composite cathodes in single chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1786071
7,12600,These cathodes were also tested in the SC-SOFC configuration with Ni-cermet anode on an SDC electrolyte (0.5 mm thick).,Role of composite cathodes in single chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1786071
8,12600,A cell using a cathode composition of 30 vol% SDC-LSCF showed the lowest overpotential among those tested.,Role of composite cathodes in single chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1786071
