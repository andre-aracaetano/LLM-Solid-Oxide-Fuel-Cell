1,12816,A new diffusion barrier layer (DBL) is proposed for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) supported on stainless steel where DBL prevents inter-diffusion of atoms between anode and stainless steel (STS) support during fabrication and operation of STS-supported SOFCs.,Y0.08Sr0.88TiO3-CeO2 composite as a diffusion barrier layer for stainless-steel supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.130
2,12816,"Half cells consisting of dense yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, porous Ni-YSZ anode layer, and ferritic STS support, with or without Y0.08Sr0.88TiO3-CeO2 (YST-CeO2) composite DBL, are prepared by tape casting and co-firing at 1250 and 1350 degrees C, respectively, in reducing (H-2) atmosphere.",Y0.08Sr0.88TiO3-CeO2 composite as a diffusion barrier layer for stainless-steel supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.130

4,12816,The cell with DBL and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode achieved a maximum power density of similar to 220 mW cm(-2) which is stable at 700 degrees C.,Y0.08Sr0.88TiO3-CeO2 composite as a diffusion barrier layer for stainless-steel supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.130
5,12816,"In order to further improve the power performance, Ni coarsening in anode during co-firing must be prevented or alternative anode which is resistive to coarsening is suggested.",Y0.08Sr0.88TiO3-CeO2 composite as a diffusion barrier layer for stainless-steel supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.130
