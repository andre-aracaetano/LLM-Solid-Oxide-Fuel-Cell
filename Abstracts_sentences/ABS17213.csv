1,17213,The thermal expansion of La0.4Y0.1Sr0.5MnO3 samples has been studied by dilatometry up to 1000-degrees-C in air leading to a coefficient value of 10.5x10(-6) K-1.,THERMAL-EXPANSION AND ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY OF YTTRIA-SUBSTITUTED LANTHANUM STRONTIUM MANGANITES,10.1016/0025-5408(93)90103-K
2,17213,"Conductivity measurements, carried out in the same temperature range show no noticeable influence of the oxygen partial pressure, but the substitution of La for Y in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 significantly modifies the electrical behaviour, which passes from a metallic to a semiconductive type.",THERMAL-EXPANSION AND ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY OF YTTRIA-SUBSTITUTED LANTHANUM STRONTIUM MANGANITES,10.1016/0025-5408(93)90103-K
3,17213,The thermal expansion coefficient of such La for Y substituted materials is much closer to that of yttria stabilized zirconia used as the solid electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells.,THERMAL-EXPANSION AND ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY OF YTTRIA-SUBSTITUTED LANTHANUM STRONTIUM MANGANITES,10.1016/0025-5408(93)90103-K
4,17213,"From this view point, this material offers an advantage over La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 cathode materials.",THERMAL-EXPANSION AND ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY OF YTTRIA-SUBSTITUTED LANTHANUM STRONTIUM MANGANITES,10.1016/0025-5408(93)90103-K
5,17213,"However, this subsititution results in a cost of electrical conductivity which decreases by a factor of 3 compared to that of La0.5Sr0.5MnO3.",THERMAL-EXPANSION AND ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY OF YTTRIA-SUBSTITUTED LANTHANUM STRONTIUM MANGANITES,10.1016/0025-5408(93)90103-K
