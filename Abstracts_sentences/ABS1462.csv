2,1462,"For the analysis, it is assumed that the fuel supply to the stacks is constant in all the analyzed conditions.",Thermoeconomic comparison of a molten carbonate fuel cell and a solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with a micro gas turbine as hybrid plants,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116533
3,1462,"The components of the system have been sized using the first law of thermodynamics to meet the thermal conditions required to maintain fuel cell stack operation, while an exergetic analysis has been implemented in order to assess the components in terms of irreversibilities.",Thermoeconomic comparison of a molten carbonate fuel cell and a solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with a micro gas turbine as hybrid plants,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116533
4,1462,"Furthermore, an economic analysis to estimate the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) has been carried out to indicate the most feasible option between the two analyzed systems.",Thermoeconomic comparison of a molten carbonate fuel cell and a solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with a micro gas turbine as hybrid plants,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116533
5,1462,The capacity of the fuel cell stacks is 500kWdc operating at 350 kPa and 600 degrees C/650 degrees C.,Thermoeconomic comparison of a molten carbonate fuel cell and a solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with a micro gas turbine as hybrid plants,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116533
6,1462,"The results indicate that MCFC stacks are more efficient than SOFC stacks, but are considerably more expensive.",Thermoeconomic comparison of a molten carbonate fuel cell and a solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with a micro gas turbine as hybrid plants,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116533
7,1462,"Nevertheless, the SOFC/MGT system has a global ef-ficiency higher than that of the MCFC/MGT; also its Total Capital Investment (TCI) is 2.5-3.5 times lower, thus making the SOFC/MGT coupling more attractive.",Thermoeconomic comparison of a molten carbonate fuel cell and a solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with a micro gas turbine as hybrid plants,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116533
8,1462,The only product considered coming out from the systems to determine the LCOE is electricity.,Thermoeconomic comparison of a molten carbonate fuel cell and a solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with a micro gas turbine as hybrid plants,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116533
9,1462,"The LCOE for the SOFC/MGT system is 0.339-0.402$/kWh and for the MCFC/MGT is 0.875-0.897$/kWh, which for both configurations is still higher than the current electricity prices.",Thermoeconomic comparison of a molten carbonate fuel cell and a solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with a micro gas turbine as hybrid plants,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116533
10,1462,"One aspect that increases the investment and consequently the LCOE is the high cost of the stacks and their replacements which is around 19 % and 10 % of the total Purchased Equipment Cost (PEC) for MCFC and SOFC stacks, respectively.",Thermoeconomic comparison of a molten carbonate fuel cell and a solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with a micro gas turbine as hybrid plants,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116533
