6,2865,"Based on comparison of the total axial stresses and the residual ones with the material strength it was noticed that the anode and electrolyte layers should not be critically deformed, but there is a risk of damage for cathode layers at chosen fuel cell configurations.",Modeling of thermal stresses in a microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.047
7,2865,"A high risk of damage was also noticed for the outer housing, near contact points with manifolds as well as at the air distributor due to large number of cutouts in the material.",Modeling of thermal stresses in a microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.047
