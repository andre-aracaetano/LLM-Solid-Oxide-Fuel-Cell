2,16646,An objective of the present effort is to develop computational tools to study the validity of such assumptions.,"Multidimensional flow, thermal, and chemical behavior in solid-oxide fuel cell button cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.097
3,16646,"A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed and applied to a particular SOFC button cell, characterizing the fluid flow, chemistry, and thermal transport.","Multidimensional flow, thermal, and chemical behavior in solid-oxide fuel cell button cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.097
4,16646,"Results show that when inlet flow rates are sufficiently high, button-cell data can be interpreted using the commonly used assumptions.","Multidimensional flow, thermal, and chemical behavior in solid-oxide fuel cell button cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.097
5,16646,"However, when flow rates are not Sufficient, the assumptions of uniform composition can be significantly violated.","Multidimensional flow, thermal, and chemical behavior in solid-oxide fuel cell button cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.097
