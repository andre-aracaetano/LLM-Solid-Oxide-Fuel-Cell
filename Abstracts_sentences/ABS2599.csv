2,2599,The main function of glass seal is to separate air and fuel at working temperature of fuel cell i.e. 800-1000 degrees C.,Chemical interaction study between lanthanum based different alkaline earth glass sealants with Crofer 22 APU for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.104
3,2599,"The glasses were prepared by substitution of alkaline earth glass modifiers in lanthanum based borosilicate glass composition SiO2-B2O3-AO-La2O3 (A = Mg, Ca).",Chemical interaction study between lanthanum based different alkaline earth glass sealants with Crofer 22 APU for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.104
4,2599,"Furthermore Crofer22APU/glass-ceramics were joined to make diffusion couples which were heat-treated at 850 C for different time durations of 5, 100 and 750 h. These diffusion couples were morphologically characterized after heat-treatment at 850 degrees C. XRD indicated surface crystallization of various crystalline phases formed in the glass/Crofer 22 APU diffusion couple.",Chemical interaction study between lanthanum based different alkaline earth glass sealants with Crofer 22 APU for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.104
