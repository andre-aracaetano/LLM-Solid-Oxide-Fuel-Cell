1,18811,"In most planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) stack designs, the interconnect, which is typically made from an oxidation resistant alloy, potentially including austenitic chromia-forming, ferritic chromia-forming, and alumina-forming alloys, has to be hermitically sealed to its adjacent components, usually by a sealing glass.",Chemical interactions of barium-calcium-aluminosilicate-based sealing glasses with oxidation resistant alloys,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00160-7
2,18811,"To maintain the structural stability and minimize the degradation of stack performance, the sealing glass must be chemically compatible with the alloy used for the interconnect.",Chemical interactions of barium-calcium-aluminosilicate-based sealing glasses with oxidation resistant alloys,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00160-7
