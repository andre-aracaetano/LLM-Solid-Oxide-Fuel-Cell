1,11725,The combined experimental approach for in-situ Raman spectroscopy of the inner anode I electrolyte interfaces in solid oxide fuel cells under current load was examined in a case study centered on the behavior of gadoliniadoped ceria (GDC) interlayers between cermet anodes and stabilized zirconia membrane.,In-situ Raman spectroscopy analysis of the interface between ceria-containing SOFC anode and stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.02.006
2,11725,"The Raman spectra of ceria at 850 degrees C were found sensitive enough with respect to the variations of anodic current and fuel gas mixture composition, which induce oxygen nonstoichiometry changes in GDC.",In-situ Raman spectroscopy analysis of the interface between ceria-containing SOFC anode and stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.02.006
3,11725,Linear dependence of the Raman peak area on the open-circuit voltage makes it possible to estimate local overpotentials at the GDC interlayer 'electrolyte interface under current load.,In-situ Raman spectroscopy analysis of the interface between ceria-containing SOFC anode and stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.02.006
4,11725,"The calculated local overpotentials exhibit a Tafel-like dependence on the current density, and are essentially independent on the hydrogen and water vapor partial pressures within the limits of experimental uncertainties.",In-situ Raman spectroscopy analysis of the interface between ceria-containing SOFC anode and stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.02.006
