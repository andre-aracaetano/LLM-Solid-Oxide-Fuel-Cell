6,19314,A variational principle-based sintering model capable of predicting microstructural evolution is presented.,Microstructure evolution in thin zirconia films: Experimental observation and modelling,10.1016/j.actamat.2010.12.056
7,19314,The modelling results agree with the experimental observations in that constrained sintering leads to an anisotropic microstructure which becomes more isotropic with densification.,Microstructure evolution in thin zirconia films: Experimental observation and modelling,10.1016/j.actamat.2010.12.056
8,19314,Decreasing grain boundary diffusion with respect to surface diffusion is predicted to produce a more isotropic pore geometry.,Microstructure evolution in thin zirconia films: Experimental observation and modelling,10.1016/j.actamat.2010.12.056
9,19314,The model also predicts that in constrained sintering there exists a critical pore size above which the pore grows instead of shrinks.,Microstructure evolution in thin zirconia films: Experimental observation and modelling,10.1016/j.actamat.2010.12.056
10,19314,It is critical to control defect size at an early stage of processing to be smaller than the critical pore size in order to obtain leak-free electrolyte films.,Microstructure evolution in thin zirconia films: Experimental observation and modelling,10.1016/j.actamat.2010.12.056
