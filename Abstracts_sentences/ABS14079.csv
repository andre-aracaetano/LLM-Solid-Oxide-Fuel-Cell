3,14079,"PrLaNiO4 powders were then synthesized using a solid state reaction method for the application of cathode materials in an intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC); these material properties were then examined by XRD, SEM, thermomechanical analysis, alternating current impedance spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis.",Preparation and performance of PrLaNiO4 and (La0.75Sr0.2Ba0.05)0.175Ce0.825O1.891 composite cathode material by solid state reaction for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.269
4,14079,"The crystallization of the as-prepared PrLaNiO4 was obtained after heat-treatment at 1200 degrees C for 6 h. Moreover, PrLaNiO4 cathode material demonstrated favorable chemical stability with the electrolyte of (La0.75Sr0.2Ba0.05)(0.175)Ce0.825O1.891 (LSBC) under 1200 degrees C for 6 h. The determined thermal expansion coefficient of PrLaNiO4 was 14.1 x 10(-6) K-1.",Preparation and performance of PrLaNiO4 and (La0.75Sr0.2Ba0.05)0.175Ce0.825O1.891 composite cathode material by solid state reaction for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.269
