1,16666,"The development of sealants for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is a significant challenge as they must meet very restrictive requirements; they must withstand the severe environment of the SOFC (i.e., be resistant to oxidative and reducing gas environments) and be thermo-chemically and thermo-mechanically compatible with the materials to which they are in contact with.",Performance of a glass-ceramic sealant in a SOFC short stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.025
2,16666,This work discusses the design and the operation of two SOFC short stacks (based on planar anode-supported cells) along with the performance of a glass ceramic sealantinside the stack.,Performance of a glass-ceramic sealant in a SOFC short stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.025
3,16666,"In particular, a joined Crofer22APU frame/glass-ceramic sealant/anode-supported-cell (ASC) was tested in two SOFC short stack configurations (referred to as m1stack and m2stack tests, respectively), in order to study the stability and the effectiveness of the glass-ceramic (boron and barium-free silica-based) sealant used in the experiment.",Performance of a glass-ceramic sealant in a SOFC short stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.025
4,16666,The difference between the two stacks was the presence of a Mn1.5Co1.5O4 protective coating on the Crofer22APU frame prevent Cr poisoning of the cathode used in the m2stack.,Performance of a glass-ceramic sealant in a SOFC short stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.025
5,16666,"A full cell open circuit voltage was achieved during the experiments, indicating therefore that the glass ceramic sealant employed provided effective gas separation.",Performance of a glass-ceramic sealant in a SOFC short stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.025
6,16666,The time-evolution of the cell voltage was investigated to evaluate eventual degradation caused by chromium poisoning at the cathode.,Performance of a glass-ceramic sealant in a SOFC short stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.025
7,16666,The m2stack was operated at similar to 0.3 A cm(-2) and an FU (Fuel Utilisation) of 25% and no voltage degradation was observed for the duration of the galvanostatic experiment (350 h).,Performance of a glass-ceramic sealant in a SOFC short stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.025
8,16666,"Microstructural post-mortem analysis after the experiments (m1stack and m2stack) in the short stack configuration highlighted the excellent compatibility of the glass-ceramic sealant with Crofer22APU and YSZ, respectively, as well as the effectiveness of Mn1.5Co1.5O4 coating on Crofer22APU to prevent Cr poisoning of the cathode.",Performance of a glass-ceramic sealant in a SOFC short stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.07.025
