1,17279,Magnesia-doped lanthanum chromite is a potential material for use in solid oxide fuel cells as an interconnector due to its resistance to oxidation and reduction.,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES OF MAGNESIA-DOPED LANTHANUM CHROMITE VERSUS TEMPERATURE,10.1111/j.1151-2916.1995.tb08902.x
2,17279,The strength and toughness of La(Cr0.9Mg0.1)O-3 were measured from 25 degrees to 1000 degrees C in the as-fired reduced state and after oxidation.,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES OF MAGNESIA-DOPED LANTHANUM CHROMITE VERSUS TEMPERATURE,10.1111/j.1151-2916.1995.tb08902.x
3,17279,The as-fired samples showed a peak in toughness of approximately 3.9 MPa .,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES OF MAGNESIA-DOPED LANTHANUM CHROMITE VERSUS TEMPERATURE,10.1111/j.1151-2916.1995.tb08902.x
