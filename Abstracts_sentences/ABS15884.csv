6,15884,"Among the relatively few in situ surface analysis methods, Raman spectroscopy can be performed even with high temperatures and harsh atmospheres, making it ideal for characterizing chemical processes relevant to SOFC anode performance and degradation(8-12).",Probing and Mapping Electrode Surfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3791/50161
7,15884,"It can also be used alongside electrochemical measurements, potentially allowing direct correlation of electrochemistry to surface chemistry in an operating cell.",Probing and Mapping Electrode Surfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3791/50161
8,15884,"Proper in situ Raman mapping measurements would be useful for pin-pointing important anode reaction mechanisms because of its sensitivity to the relevant species, including anode performance degradation through carbon deposition(8, 10, 13, 14) (coking) and sulfur poisoning(11, 15) and the manner in which surface modifications stave off this degradation(16).",Probing and Mapping Electrode Surfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3791/50161
9,15884,The current work demonstrates significant progress towards this capability.,Probing and Mapping Electrode Surfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3791/50161
