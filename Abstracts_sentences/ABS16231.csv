1,16231,The perovskite-type oxide La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 was studied as an ethanol oxidation catalyst-anode as a probable candidate for future application in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs).,Catalytic Behavior of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Perovskite-Type Oxide Thin Films Deposited on YSZ During the Reaction of Ethanol Oxidation,10.1007/BF02375794
2,16231,The investigation was carried out at atmospheric total pressure in a fully Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) continuous stirred tank reactor (C.S.T.R.) at a temperature range between 300-700 degrees C. Preliminary results show that La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 thin films deposited on the inner bottom of the one end closed YSZ tube present: a) mediocre ethanol oxidation catalytic activity at relatively low temperature values and b) thermal stability under the experimental conditions.,Catalytic Behavior of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Perovskite-Type Oxide Thin Films Deposited on YSZ During the Reaction of Ethanol Oxidation,10.1007/BF02375794
