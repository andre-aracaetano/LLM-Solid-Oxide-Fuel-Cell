2,5284,We investigate how in-plane biaxial stress modifies the electronic structure of La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 and La1/2Sr1/2MnO3 thin films prepared by pulsed laser deposition on three different substrates to vary the in-plane stress from tensile to compressive.,Stress relaxation of La1/2Sr1/2MnO3 and La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 at solid oxide fuel cell interfaces,10.1016/j.tsf.2007.04.049
