1,4973,"Sr1.5La0.5Mn1-xCoxO4 (SLMCOx) cathode materials for IT-SOFCs (intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells) were synthesized by EDTA-citric acid method and characterized by XRD, XPS and EIS, respectively.",Synthesis and High Temperature Electrochemical Properties of Co-doped Sr1.5La0.5MnO4,10.11862/CJIC.2016.207
2,4973,"The results show that SLMCOx has no reaction with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 at 1 200 degrees C for 12 h. Both the amount of Mn3+ and Co2+ in the oxide increase with the Co doping concentration; at the same time the content of lattice oxygen reduces, and the distortion ratio (c/a) of the lattice increases.",Synthesis and High Temperature Electrochemical Properties of Co-doped Sr1.5La0.5MnO4,10.11862/CJIC.2016.207
3,4973,The EIS results show that Co-doping dramatically reduces the polarization resistance (R-p) of SLMCOx cathode.,Synthesis and High Temperature Electrochemical Properties of Co-doped Sr1.5La0.5MnO4,10.11862/CJIC.2016.207
4,4973,"The Sr1.5La0.5Mn0.7Co0.3O4 has the lowest R-p of 0.62 Omega center dot cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air, which is clearly smaller than the R-p value of Sr1.5La0.5Mn0.7O4 that measured at 750 degrees C (1.5 Omega center dot cm(2)).",Synthesis and High Temperature Electrochemical Properties of Co-doped Sr1.5La0.5MnO4,10.11862/CJIC.2016.207
5,4973,Our results indicate that the Co doped Sr1.5La0.5Mn1-xCoxO4. is potential cathode material for IT-SOFC.,Synthesis and High Temperature Electrochemical Properties of Co-doped Sr1.5La0.5MnO4,10.11862/CJIC.2016.207
