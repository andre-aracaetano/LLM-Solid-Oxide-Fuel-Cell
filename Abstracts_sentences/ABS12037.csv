3,12037,The steel containing these alloying additions exhibited substantially higher creep resistance in the temperature range 700-800 degrees C than the high purity steel.,Effect of Laves phase strengthening on the mechanical properties of high Cr ferritic steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.msea.2011.03.112
4,12037,The Laves phase formation occurred trans- as well as intragranular whereby the extent and size of grain boundary precipitates increased with increasing exposure time.,Effect of Laves phase strengthening on the mechanical properties of high Cr ferritic steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.msea.2011.03.112
5,12037,Especially at 800 degrees C the precipitates inside the grains virtually completely vanished after longer exposure times and only intergranular precipitates remained.,Effect of Laves phase strengthening on the mechanical properties of high Cr ferritic steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.msea.2011.03.112
