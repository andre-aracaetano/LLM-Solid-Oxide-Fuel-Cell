1,3409,This study investigates the corrosion of AISI 441 in simulated anode conditions of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,High temperature oxidation of AISI 441 in simulated solid oxide fuel cell anode side conditions,10.1016/j.corsci.2022.110338
2,3409,"Several parameters such as temperature, humidity, surface condition, pre-oxidation temperature and environment, were investigated.",High temperature oxidation of AISI 441 in simulated solid oxide fuel cell anode side conditions,10.1016/j.corsci.2022.110338
3,3409,"Samples pre-oxidized at 800 degrees C were protective at 550-900 degrees C, while as-received samples showed protective behavior only at 900 degrees C. Additional exposures performed at 600 degrees C revealed the negative effect of increasing steam concentration, the beneficial effect of grinding, while pre-oxidation at 600 degrees C did not improve the protectiveness.",High temperature oxidation of AISI 441 in simulated solid oxide fuel cell anode side conditions,10.1016/j.corsci.2022.110338
4,3409,The role and the interplay of the aforementioned factors are discussed.,High temperature oxidation of AISI 441 in simulated solid oxide fuel cell anode side conditions,10.1016/j.corsci.2022.110338
