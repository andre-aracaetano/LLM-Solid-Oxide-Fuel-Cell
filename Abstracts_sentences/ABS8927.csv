2,8927,All components are produced using a low cost tape casting method and are fired as a single unit.,Thermal Cycling Evaluation of Rolled Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4004638
3,8927,The geometry is self-supporting which removes the need for thick cell components further reducing cell cost and offering increased volumetric power densities.,Thermal Cycling Evaluation of Rolled Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4004638
4,8927,Here we present the results from some early studies on the influence of fast thermal cycling on performance characteristics.,Thermal Cycling Evaluation of Rolled Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4004638
5,8927,Thermal cycles were carried out heating and cooling at 10 degrees C min-1 between 400 and 800 degrees C. Less than 1% performance drop was calculated for the single cell and 5% drop was observed on the fourth cycle for the five cell bundle.,Thermal Cycling Evaluation of Rolled Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4004638
