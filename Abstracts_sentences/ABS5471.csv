1,5471,"Barriers to technological advancement of metal-supported SOFCs include nickel coarsening in the anode, metallic interdiffusion between the anode and the metal substrate, as well as poor cathode adhesion.",Novel architectured metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with Mo-doped SrFeO3-δ electrocatalysts,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.157
2,5471,Here we report a robust and novel architectured metal-supported SOFC that consists of a thin dense yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte layer sandwiched between a porous 430L stainless steel substrate and a porous YSZ thin layer.,Novel architectured metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with Mo-doped SrFeO3-δ electrocatalysts,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.157
3,5471,The key feature is simultaneous use of impregnated nano-scale SrFe0.75Mo0.25O3-delta coatings on the internal surfaces of the porous 430L and YSZ backbones respectively as the anode and cathode catalyst.,Novel architectured metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with Mo-doped SrFeO3-δ electrocatalysts,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.157
4,5471,Such a fuel cell exhibits power densities of 0.74 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and 0.40 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C when operating on hydrogen fuels and air oxidants.,Novel architectured metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with Mo-doped SrFeO3-δ electrocatalysts,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.157
