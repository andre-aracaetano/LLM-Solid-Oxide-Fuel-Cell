2,16049,"The electrical conductivity, measured in the oxygen partial pressure range of 10(-20) to 0.5 atm at 940-1270 K, increases with manganese and strontium additions which lead, however, to higher reducibility.","Functional properties of SOFC anode materials based on LaCrO3, La(Ti,Mn)O3 and Sr(Nb,Mn)O3 perovskites: A comparative analysis",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.005
3,16049,"In addition to the thermodynamic stability limitations under the SOFC anodic conditions, the latter factor raises the importance of chemically induced expansion, as for Fe-substituted (La,Sr)CrO3 (- delta).","Functional properties of SOFC anode materials based on LaCrO3, La(Ti,Mn)O3 and Sr(Nb,Mn)O3 perovskites: A comparative analysis",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.005
4,16049,"The reduction of Ni-doped chromite results in the formation of nanosized metallic particles dispersed on the perovskite surface, and has no significant effect on the transport properties governed by the perovskite phase.","Functional properties of SOFC anode materials based on LaCrO3, La(Ti,Mn)O3 and Sr(Nb,Mn)O3 perovskites: A comparative analysis",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.005
