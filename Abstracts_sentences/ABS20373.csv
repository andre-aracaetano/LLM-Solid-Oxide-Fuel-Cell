2,20373,"A new aspect of vibrational analysis was introduced to explain trend of the slope of Arrhenius plots (migration movement barrier, MMB).","Transport, thermodynamic, and structural properties of rare earth zirconia-based electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulation",10.1002/er.3559
3,20373,Vibrational spectra of atomic trajectory of cations and anions were calculated by Fourier transform analysis.,"Transport, thermodynamic, and structural properties of rare earth zirconia-based electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulation",10.1002/er.3559
4,20373,The result demonstrates that electrolyte with smaller dopant suggests lower vibration in hopping plate cations (HPCs) and was verified by Zr4+ mean square displacement (MSD).,"Transport, thermodynamic, and structural properties of rare earth zirconia-based electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulation",10.1002/er.3559
5,20373,Result of MSD indicated that dopant which is heavier (atomic mass) than Zr implies higher movement (or vibration).,"Transport, thermodynamic, and structural properties of rare earth zirconia-based electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulation",10.1002/er.3559

8,20373,It was found that lower vibrating HPC electrolyte deduces lower activation energy.,"Transport, thermodynamic, and structural properties of rare earth zirconia-based electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulation",10.1002/er.3559
9,20373,First peak of O-O radial distribution function and 001 density distribution of oxygen ions claimed activation energy of oxygen hopping has direct correlation with oxygen scattering in the lattice structure.,"Transport, thermodynamic, and structural properties of rare earth zirconia-based electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulation",10.1002/er.3559
10,20373,Thermal expansion and heat capacity as well were studied as important factors in heating operation.,"Transport, thermodynamic, and structural properties of rare earth zirconia-based electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulation",10.1002/er.3559
11,20373,"Although, results did not show relation between dopant size and these two thermal factors, it was found a linear relation between van der Waals and kinetic energy, respectively.","Transport, thermodynamic, and structural properties of rare earth zirconia-based electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulation",10.1002/er.3559
