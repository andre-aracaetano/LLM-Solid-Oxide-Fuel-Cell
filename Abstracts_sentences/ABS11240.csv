1,11240,"The electromotive force (e.m.f) is calculated for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on doped ceria electrolytes using biomass-produced gases (BPG, 14.7% CO, 14.2% CO2, 15.3% H-2, 4.2% CH4, and 51% N-2) as fuels and air as oxidant.",Low-temperature SOFCs using biomass-produced gases as fuels,10.1007/s10800-004-2053-x
2,11240,It reveals that the BPG derived e.m.f. is very close to hydrogen when doped ceria is used as the electrolyte.,Low-temperature SOFCs using biomass-produced gases as fuels,10.1007/s10800-004-2053-x
3,11240,A 35-mum-thick samaria-doped ceria based single cell was tested between 450 and 650degreesC using BPG as fuel.,Low-temperature SOFCs using biomass-produced gases as fuels,10.1007/s10800-004-2053-x
4,11240,"Maximum power density of about 700 mW cm(-2) was achieved at 650degreesC. The open-circuit voltage at 450degreesC was 0.96 V, close to the calculated value.",Low-temperature SOFCs using biomass-produced gases as fuels,10.1007/s10800-004-2053-x
5,11240,"However, the cell power density using BPG as fuel was relatively lower than that using humidified hydrogen (3% H2O), and close to that using humidified methane (3% H2O).",Low-temperature SOFCs using biomass-produced gases as fuels,10.1007/s10800-004-2053-x
6,11240,Impedance measurements indicate that the relatively lower power output may be attributed to the high anode-electrolyte interfacial polarization resistance when BPG is used as fuel.,Low-temperature SOFCs using biomass-produced gases as fuels,10.1007/s10800-004-2053-x
