2,2408,"However, SOFCs give a challenging control problem due to their slow dynamics, complex non-linearity, and operating constraints.",Improved data driven model free adaptive constrained control for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1049/iet-cta.2015.0841
3,2408,"In this study, an improved model free adaptive constrained control scheme is proposed to solve the SOFC control problem with I/O measurement data.",Improved data driven model free adaptive constrained control for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1049/iet-cta.2015.0841
4,2408,"Since the control terms appear within the unknown non-linear dynamic, an improved compact form dynamic linearisation data driven modelling method is used to simplify the SOFC system.",Improved data driven model free adaptive constrained control for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1049/iet-cta.2015.0841
