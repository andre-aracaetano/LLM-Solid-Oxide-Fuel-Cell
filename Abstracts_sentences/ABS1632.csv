1,1632,A novel liquid-phase synthesis strategy is demonstrated for the preparation of the Nb-containing ceramic oxide SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3-delta (SCN).,Liquid-phase synthesis of SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3-δ cathode material for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.116
2,1632,"In comparison with the traditional solid-state reaction (SSR) method, the liquid-phase synthesis route offers a couple of advantages, including a lower phase formation temperature and a smaller particle size of the SCN materials that are beneficial for applications as proton-conducting fuel cell cathode.",Liquid-phase synthesis of SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3-δ cathode material for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.116
3,1632,"With BaCe0.4Zr0.4Y0.2O3-delta (BCZY442) as the electrolyte and the SCN synthesized in this work as the cathode, a proton conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) shows a peak power density of 348 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, significantly higher than that of a SOFC fabricated with SCN cathode prepared using the SSR method, which can only deliver 204 mW cm(-2) at the same temperature.",Liquid-phase synthesis of SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3-δ cathode material for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.116
4,1632,"Additionally, this new synthesis strategy allows impregnation of Sr2+, Co3+ and Nb5+ on the solid backbone in aqueous solution, further improving cell performance to reach a peak power density of 488 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C.",Liquid-phase synthesis of SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3-δ cathode material for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.12.116
