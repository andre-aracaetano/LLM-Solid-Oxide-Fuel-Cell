1,18608,"A-site deficiency was introduced intentionally into the mixed conducting perovskite ABO(3)-type oxide, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF=6/4/2/8), in order to create additional oxygen vacancies.",Introduction of A-site deficiency into La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ and its effect on structure and conductivity,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.11.021
2,18608,"With increasing Sr-deficiency, z in La0.6Sr0.4-zCo0.2Fe0.8O3-delta, its lattice parameters and oxygen content gradually increased and decreased, respectively, which strongly suggested that additional oxygen vacancies were created in the lattice.",Introduction of A-site deficiency into La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ and its effect on structure and conductivity,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.11.021
