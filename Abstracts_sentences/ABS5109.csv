1,5109,"In this work, nanopowders of perovskite cathode materials (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta, La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta, and La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta), for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), were successfully synthesized, using induction plasma techniques.","Synthesis and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MO3-δ (M= Mn, Fe, Or Co) cathode mate.rials by induction plasma technology",10.1361/105996306X92578
2,5109,"Their compositions, structures, morphology, particle size distributions, and BET specific surface areas were determined for comparison with their counterparts prepared by the Pechini method and by the glycine-nitrate combustion (GNC) technique.","Synthesis and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MO3-δ (M= Mn, Fe, Or Co) cathode mate.rials by induction plasma technology",10.1361/105996306X92578
3,5109,The particle sizes of the plasma-synthesized powders are mostly around 63 nm.,"Synthesis and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MO3-δ (M= Mn, Fe, Or Co) cathode mate.rials by induction plasma technology",10.1361/105996306X92578
4,5109,"These plasma-synthesized powders are generally globular, their BET specific surface areas being about 26 m(2)g(-1), approximately twice those of powders prepared by the GNC and Pechini methods.","Synthesis and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MO3-δ (M= Mn, Fe, Or Co) cathode mate.rials by induction plasma technology",10.1361/105996306X92578
