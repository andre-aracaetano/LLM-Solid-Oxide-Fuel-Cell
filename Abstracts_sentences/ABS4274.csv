5,4274,"Accordingly, it has been found that the performance of hydrogen-fueled oxide ion conducting electrolytes (SOFC-O) is lower than that of protonic conducting one (SOFC-H) at 800 degrees",Investigation of the effect of ion transition type on performance in solid oxide fuel cells fueled hydrogen and coal gas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.212
6,4274,"C. Furthermore, a numerical simulation has been conducted to investigate the result of temperature changes on SOFC performance at 400 degrees C, 600 degrees C, and 800 degrees C for proton-conducting SOFC and 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C for oxygen-conducting SOFC.",Investigation of the effect of ion transition type on performance in solid oxide fuel cells fueled hydrogen and coal gas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.212
7,4274,It has been demonstrated that SOFC-O shows a better performance at high temperatures compared with SOFC-H while SOFC-H can be an agreeable selection at medium temperatures.,Investigation of the effect of ion transition type on performance in solid oxide fuel cells fueled hydrogen and coal gas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.212
8,4274,"Therefore, this study reveals that the temperature augments the performance of both electrolytes, yet at higher working temperatures SOFC-H becomes more advantageous than SOFC-O to use hydrogen and coal gas as a primary fuel.",Investigation of the effect of ion transition type on performance in solid oxide fuel cells fueled hydrogen and coal gas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.212
