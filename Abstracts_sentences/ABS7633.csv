1,7633,A novel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is designed and investigated in this work.,A novel ceria-based solid oxide fuel cell free from internal short circuit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.065
2,7633,Barium-containing anode is employed for Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta(SDC)-based SOFC.,A novel ceria-based solid oxide fuel cell free from internal short circuit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.065
3,7633,SEM and EDX results show that barium diffuses from the anode to the electrolyte and a thin BaO-CeO2-Sm2O3 ternary composite interlayer is formed in situ at elevated temperatures.,A novel ceria-based solid oxide fuel cell free from internal short circuit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.065
4,7633,"The interlayer is electron-blocking, and eliminates the well-known internal short circuit in the SDC electrolyte membrane completely.",A novel ceria-based solid oxide fuel cell free from internal short circuit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.065
5,7633,"Consequently, the open circuit voltages (OCVs) of the cell are improved significantly and achieve as high as 1.04, 1.06, 1.07, and 1.08 Vat 700, 650, 600, and 550 degrees C, respectively, for the cell co-fired at 1350 degrees C. Notably, the new cell still outputs 221 mW cm(-2) at a voltage of 0.9 V at 600 degrees C, while the traditional ceria-based cell cannot output any performance at all at such a high voltage.",A novel ceria-based solid oxide fuel cell free from internal short circuit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.065
6,7633,The results demonstrate that this novel structured cell exhibits great potential working at low temperatures at high efficiency.,A novel ceria-based solid oxide fuel cell free from internal short circuit,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.065
