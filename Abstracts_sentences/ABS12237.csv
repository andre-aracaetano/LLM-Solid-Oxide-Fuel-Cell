1,12237,Recent changes in the cost and the availability of natural gas (NG) have sparked interest in applying fuel cell (FC) technologies to commercial shipping to take advantage of beneficial market factors.,"Viability of Natural Gas in Fuel Cell Traction for Heavy Freight Locomotion Economic, Efficiency, and Technology Factors",10.3141/2546-12
2,12237,"Historically, FC technology has been primarily developed for private automobiles and faces considerable economic and logistical barriers, including cost, range, durability, and refueling infrastructure.","Viability of Natural Gas in Fuel Cell Traction for Heavy Freight Locomotion Economic, Efficiency, and Technology Factors",10.3141/2546-12
3,12237,"Serendipitously, the rail industry has been investigating NG as a supplement to diesel fuel, which accounts for a large portion of its operating expenses.","Viability of Natural Gas in Fuel Cell Traction for Heavy Freight Locomotion Economic, Efficiency, and Technology Factors",10.3141/2546-12
4,12237,This study investigated the economic and technology factors that determined fuel efficiency and emissions advantages of FC technologies applied to NG locomotives.,"Viability of Natural Gas in Fuel Cell Traction for Heavy Freight Locomotion Economic, Efficiency, and Technology Factors",10.3141/2546-12
5,12237,"Results indicated that economic advantage would come either from the price of NG and diesel fuel diverging in the future or from the development of two key FC technologies, which would mitigate the disadvantages of FCs and make them economically superior to diesel fuel.","Viability of Natural Gas in Fuel Cell Traction for Heavy Freight Locomotion Economic, Efficiency, and Technology Factors",10.3141/2546-12
6,12237,These technologies are variable-output solid-oxide FCs and hot start-up optimization.,"Viability of Natural Gas in Fuel Cell Traction for Heavy Freight Locomotion Economic, Efficiency, and Technology Factors",10.3141/2546-12
7,12237,Two configurations are suggested: high-temperature responsive multistack and dual-temperature responsive multistack.,"Viability of Natural Gas in Fuel Cell Traction for Heavy Freight Locomotion Economic, Efficiency, and Technology Factors",10.3141/2546-12
8,12237,Both are discussed with proposed configurations and estimated benefits.,"Viability of Natural Gas in Fuel Cell Traction for Heavy Freight Locomotion Economic, Efficiency, and Technology Factors",10.3141/2546-12
9,12237,These recommendations are the opposite of those required for private automobiles.,"Viability of Natural Gas in Fuel Cell Traction for Heavy Freight Locomotion Economic, Efficiency, and Technology Factors",10.3141/2546-12
10,12237,Breakeven prices for liquefied NG are estimated for nine distinct drive train configurations.,"Viability of Natural Gas in Fuel Cell Traction for Heavy Freight Locomotion Economic, Efficiency, and Technology Factors",10.3141/2546-12
