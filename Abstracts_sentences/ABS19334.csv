1,19334,"In order to appraise microstructure-determined defect formation processes and minor intergranular states in the solid electrolyte materials sintered employing transition metal oxide additives, the transmission Mossbauer spectroscopy analysis of Zr0.85Y0.15O2 - delta, Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 - delta, and (La0.9Sr0.1)(0.98)Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 - delta ceramics containing 2 mol% Fe-57 isotope probe was combined with X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy studies.",Grain-boundary states in solid oxide electrolyte ceramics processed using iron oxide sintering aids: a Mossbauer spectroscopy study,10.1007/s10008-017-3622-3
2,19334,"The sintering aids tend to dissolve in yttria-stabilized zirconia and lanthanum gallate where Fe-rich domains, magnetically ordered at 4 K, co-exist with interfacial iron species remaining paramagnetic.",Grain-boundary states in solid oxide electrolyte ceramics processed using iron oxide sintering aids: a Mossbauer spectroscopy study,10.1007/s10008-017-3622-3
3,19334,"For the electrolyte ceramics processed at 1373 K, this dissolution is accompanied with an appearance of insulating phase impurities, such as monoclinic zirconia.",Grain-boundary states in solid oxide electrolyte ceramics processed using iron oxide sintering aids: a Mossbauer spectroscopy study,10.1007/s10008-017-3622-3
4,19334,"On the contrary, low iron solubility in gadolinia-doped ceria leads to the segregation of trace amounts of hematite and perovskite-type GdFeO3 phases, which enhance densification and affect p-type electronic transport.",Grain-boundary states in solid oxide electrolyte ceramics processed using iron oxide sintering aids: a Mossbauer spectroscopy study,10.1007/s10008-017-3622-3
5,19334,"The iron cations incorporated into the fluorite-type cubic zirconia and ceria lattices are predominantly trivalent, with reduced oxygen coordination relative to the host cations, while the Fe4+ states prevailing in the gallate ceramics sintered in air exhibit atypical disproportionation into Fe3+ and Fe5+ even at room temperature.",Grain-boundary states in solid oxide electrolyte ceramics processed using iron oxide sintering aids: a Mossbauer spectroscopy study,10.1007/s10008-017-3622-3
