8,16029,"The grain boundaries of phase-pure materials showed only a very small blocking effect, linked to the high-purity synthesis method employed, while at high %Sr, they became more blocking due to the presence of a SrCeO3 impurity.",Effects on Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of the Co-Doping with Strontium and Samarium of Ceria with Constant Oxygen Vacancy Concentration,10.3390/solids2040022
9,16029,"Grain capacitances were found to be 50-60 pF and grain boundary capacitances, 5-50 nF. The variation in the bulk capacitance with Sr content was small, and the variation in grain boundary capacitance could be explained by the variation in grain size.",Effects on Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of the Co-Doping with Strontium and Samarium of Ceria with Constant Oxygen Vacancy Concentration,10.3390/solids2040022
10,16029,Slight deviations at high %Sr were attributed to the SrCeO3 impurity.,Effects on Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of the Co-Doping with Strontium and Samarium of Ceria with Constant Oxygen Vacancy Concentration,10.3390/solids2040022
