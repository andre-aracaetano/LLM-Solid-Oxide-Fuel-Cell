5,10736,The results show that nitriding occurs in the first few centimeters of the fuel electrode for all investigated operating conditions considered in this study.,A numerical investigation of nitridation in solid oxide fuel cell stacks operated with ammonia,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.241
6,10736,"Moreover, it is indicated that higher gas inflow temperatures and counter-flow configuration reduce the nitriding in the fuel electrode.",A numerical investigation of nitridation in solid oxide fuel cell stacks operated with ammonia,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.241
7,10736,"Furthermore, the model illustrates the nitriding in the fuel active electrode for the gas inflow temperatures up to 700 degrees C. Finally, a significant reduction in nitriding in the fuel electrode is shown for a proposed nickel coating over the metallic inlet header due to a spreading of the ammonia decomposition.(c) 2023",A numerical investigation of nitridation in solid oxide fuel cell stacks operated with ammonia,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.241
