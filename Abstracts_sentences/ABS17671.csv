7,17671,"This thesis is generally supported by the results of analysis, which shows that in some cases optimal design generation capacity of the CHP system is reduced by more than half between analyses using 1-h precision and 5-min precision energy demand data.",Impacts of temporal precision in optimisation modelling of micro-combined heat and power,10.1016/j.energy.2004.11.012
8,17671,"When optimal dispatch of given generator and boiler capacities is considered, the quantities of energy delivered by the various components of the energy provision system (i.e. generation from CHP, heat from CHP, heat from an additional boiler, electricity from grid) varied by up to 40% between precisions analysed.",Impacts of temporal precision in optimisation modelling of micro-combined heat and power,10.1016/j.energy.2004.11.012
