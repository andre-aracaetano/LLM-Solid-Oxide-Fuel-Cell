1,17682,A compact SOFC power generation system was developed by integrating a 1 kW SOFC stack and balance-of-plant.,Development of 1 kW SOFC power package for dual-fuel operation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.056
2,17682,The system was designed for dual-fuel operation using both natural gas (NG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).,Development of 1 kW SOFC power package for dual-fuel operation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.056
3,17682,An adiabatic pre-reformer was employed in a fuel processing system to convert C2+ hydrocarbons in the fuel into CH4-rich gas which was further processed in a main reformer to produce H-2-rich gas for the SOFC stack.,Development of 1 kW SOFC power package for dual-fuel operation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.056
4,17682,"The SOFC system was operated for 350 h under thermally self-sustaining condition, and on-load fuel switching from NG to LPG was carried out during the operation.",Development of 1 kW SOFC power package for dual-fuel operation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.056
5,17682,The system performance was not significantly affected by NG/LPG composition ratios and the performance was stable during continuous operation in NG or LPG.,Development of 1 kW SOFC power package for dual-fuel operation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.056
