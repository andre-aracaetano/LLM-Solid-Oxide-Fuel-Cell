1,20798,New pyrochlore-like phases of composition R2MnTiO7 (R = Er and Y) have been synthesized by a soft-chemistry procedure involving citrates of the different metal ions followed by thermal treatments at moderate temperatures (850 degrees C for 12 h in air).,Synthesis and characterization of R2MnTiO7 (R = Y and Er) pyrochlores oxides,10.1016/j.materresbull.2013.05.003
2,20798,"A characterization by X-ray diffraction and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) has been carried out in order to determine the crystal structure features: these phyrochlores are cubic, space group Fd-3m, defining an intrinsically frustrated three-dimensional system.",Synthesis and characterization of R2MnTiO7 (R = Y and Er) pyrochlores oxides,10.1016/j.materresbull.2013.05.003
3,20798,The Rietveld-refinement from NPD data at room temperature evidences an antisite cation disorder (distribution of Mn between A and B positions) that is accompanied by an increment of the oxygen-vacancy concentration due to the reduction of Mn4+ at the B position to Mn2+ at the A position.,Synthesis and characterization of R2MnTiO7 (R = Y and Er) pyrochlores oxides,10.1016/j.materresbull.2013.05.003
4,20798,"Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was useful to evaluate the stability of these oxides in reducing conditions up to 500 degrees C. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate a ferromagnetic behavior, due to the random distribution of Mn4+ ions in the octahedral sublattice.",Synthesis and characterization of R2MnTiO7 (R = Y and Er) pyrochlores oxides,10.1016/j.materresbull.2013.05.003

6,20798,"Aiming to evaluate these materials as possible electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) we determined that the thermal expansion coefficients between 100 and 900 degrees C perfectly match with those of the usual electrolytes; however, these pyrochlore oxides display a semiconductor-like behavior with poor conductivity values, e.g. 6 x 10(-3) cm(-1) at 850 degrees C for Er, which would prevent its use as MIEC (mixed ionic-electronic conductors) oxides in SOFC devices (c) 2013",Synthesis and characterization of R2MnTiO7 (R = Y and Er) pyrochlores oxides,10.1016/j.materresbull.2013.05.003
