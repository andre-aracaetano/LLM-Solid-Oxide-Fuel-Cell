5,13496,Detailed analyses of the microstructure and elemental distributions unequivocally demonstrate the SrZrO3 formation along both the LSCF/10GDC and the 10GDC/8YSZ interfaces as the result of strontium and zirconium counter directional grain boundary diffusion through the 10GDC interlayer.,Sr and Zr diffusion in LSCF/10GDC/8YSZ triplets for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.046
6,13496,"Furthermore, micro-cracks in the 10GDC interlayer, formed during pre-annealing of the 10GDC/8YSZ layers, were also found to contribute to the SrZrO3 formation via surface diffusion.",Sr and Zr diffusion in LSCF/10GDC/8YSZ triplets for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.046
7,13496,"Thermodynamic considerations taking in account these microstructural features successfully explain, in terms of the chemical potential gradients developed across the 10GDC layer, why SrZrO3 is formed along both interfaces when grain boundary diffusion, or surface diffusion (along crack walls), become dominant compared to bulk diffusion through the 10GDC.",Sr and Zr diffusion in LSCF/10GDC/8YSZ triplets for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.046
