2,16955,"Chemically homogeneous, large area (25 cm(2)), and nanoporous LSC thin films were derived from metallorganic precursors (metallorganic deposition) and deposited on yttria-doped zirconia [(YSZ) design 1] and gadolinia-doped ceria [(GCO) design 2].",Nanoscaled (La0.5Sr0.5)CoO3-δ thin film cathodes for SOFC application at 500°C < T < 700°C,10.1149/1.2909552
3,16955,"The area-specific polarization resistance (ASR(pol)) of both designs was evaluated on symmetrical cells with special emphasis on constancy, depending on temperature (500-850 degrees C) and time by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",Nanoscaled (La0.5Sr0.5)CoO3-δ thin film cathodes for SOFC application at 500°C < T < 700°C,10.1149/1.2909552

6,16955,Nanoporous LSC thin-film cathodes from this study were compared to alternative design concepts for high-performance porous cathodes and with dense (La0.52Sr0.48)(Co0.18Fe0.82)O3-delta thin-film cathodes.,Nanoscaled (La0.5Sr0.5)CoO3-δ thin film cathodes for SOFC application at 500°C < T < 700°C,10.1149/1.2909552
7,16955,"Furthermore, the aim of our study was (i) to find a temperature regime with a perspective for chemical durability of an LSC/YSZ interface.",Nanoscaled (La0.5Sr0.5)CoO3-δ thin film cathodes for SOFC application at 500°C < T < 700°C,10.1149/1.2909552
8,16955,"We could prove that at a temperature of 500 degrees C and for 100 h, polarization resistance of the LSC/YSZ interface remains constant, and at unreported low values, which reopens LSC/YSZ for micro-SOFC application; (ii) to estimate the structural durability of nanoscaled and nanoporous LSC thin-film cathodes.",Nanoscaled (La0.5Sr0.5)CoO3-δ thin film cathodes for SOFC application at 500°C < T < 700°C,10.1149/1.2909552
