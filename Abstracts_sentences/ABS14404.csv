2,14404,"Different glycine to nitrate (g/n) molar ratios of 0.27, 0.54, and 1.1 were used to investigate its effect on the structural, morphological, and electrical properties of the heat-treated samples.",Morphology and Structure of Ni/Zr0.84Sc0.16O1.92 Electrode Material Synthesized via Glycine-Nitrate Combustion Method for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cell,10.3390/app9020264
3,14404,X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-sintered samples for all the g/n ratios were indexed to cubic phases of NiO and ScSZ.,Morphology and Structure of Ni/Zr0.84Sc0.16O1.92 Electrode Material Synthesized via Glycine-Nitrate Combustion Method for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cell,10.3390/app9020264
4,14404,"Upon reduction at 700 degrees C, NiO was fully reduced to Ni.",Morphology and Structure of Ni/Zr0.84Sc0.16O1.92 Electrode Material Synthesized via Glycine-Nitrate Combustion Method for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cell,10.3390/app9020264
5,14404,"In-situ XRD patterns showed that the composite Ni/Zr0.84Sc0.16O1.92 electrode material retains its cubic structure at intermediate temperatures from 500 degrees C to 800 degrees C. High magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that nanoparticles of Ni are also formed and situated at the surfaces of ScSZ grains, apart from agglomerated submicron particles of Ni. SEM and electron-dispersive spectroscopy mapping revealed interconnected grains of ScSZ oxide-ion conducting phase.",Morphology and Structure of Ni/Zr0.84Sc0.16O1.92 Electrode Material Synthesized via Glycine-Nitrate Combustion Method for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cell,10.3390/app9020264
