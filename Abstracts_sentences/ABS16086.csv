2,16086,"In this study, thermally and electrochemically induced electrode/electrolyte interfaces were investigated on pre-sintered and in situ assembled (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.90)MnO3 (LSM) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) electrodes on Y2O3-ZrO2 (YSZ) and Gd0.2Ce0.8O2 (GDC) electrolytes, using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).",Thermally and Electrochemically Induced Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An AFM and EIS Study,10.1149/2.0111510jes
3,16086,"The results indicate that thermally induced interface is characterized by convex contact rings with depth of 100-400 nm and diameter in agreement with the particle size of pre-sintered LSM and LSCF electrodes, while the electrochemically induced interfaces under cathodic polarization conditions on in situ assembled electrodes are characterized by particle-shaped contact marks or clusters (50-100 nm in diameter).",Thermally and Electrochemically Induced Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An AFM and EIS Study,10.1149/2.0111510jes
4,16086,The number and distribution of contact clusters depend on the cathodic current density as well as the electrode and electrolyte materials.,Thermally and Electrochemically Induced Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An AFM and EIS Study,10.1149/2.0111510jes
5,16086,The contact clusters on the in situ assembled LSCF/GDC interface are substantially smaller than that on the in situ assembled LSM/GDC interface likely due to the high mixed ionic and electronic conductivities of LSCF materials.,Thermally and Electrochemically Induced Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An AFM and EIS Study,10.1149/2.0111510jes
6,16086,The results show that the electrochemically induced interface is most likely resulting from the incorporation of oxygen species and cation interdiffusion under cathodic polarization conditions.,Thermally and Electrochemically Induced Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An AFM and EIS Study,10.1149/2.0111510jes
7,16086,"However, the electrocatalytic activity of electrochemically induced electrode/electrolyte interfaces is comparable to the thermally induced interfaces for the O-2 reduction reaction under SOFC operation conditions.",Thermally and Electrochemically Induced Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An AFM and EIS Study,10.1149/2.0111510jes
