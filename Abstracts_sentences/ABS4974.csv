1,4974,"As an ionic conductive functional layer of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFC), samarium-doped ceria (SDC)-LiNaSO4 nano-composites were synthesized by a sol-gel method and their properties were investigated.",Novel Nano-composites SDC-LiNaSO4 as Functional Layer for ITSOFC,10.1007/s40820-015-0038-4
2,4974,"It was found that the content of LiNaSO4 strongly affected the crystal phase, defect concentration, and conductivity of the composites.",Novel Nano-composites SDC-LiNaSO4 as Functional Layer for ITSOFC,10.1007/s40820-015-0038-4
3,4974,"When the content of LiNaSO4 was 20 wt%, the highest conductivity of the composite was found to be, respectively, 0.22, 0.26, and 0.35 S cm(-1) at temperatures of 550, 600, and 700 degrees C, which are much higher than those of SDC.",Novel Nano-composites SDC-LiNaSO4 as Functional Layer for ITSOFC,10.1007/s40820-015-0038-4
4,4974,"The peak power density of the single cell using this composite as an interlayer was improved to, respectively, 0.23, 0.39, and 0.88 W cm(-2) at 500, 600, and 700 degrees C comparing with that of the SDC-based cell.",Novel Nano-composites SDC-LiNaSO4 as Functional Layer for ITSOFC,10.1007/s40820-015-0038-4
5,4974,"Further, the SDC-LiNaSO4(20 wt%)-based cell also displayed better thermal stability according to the performance measurements at 560 degrees C for 50 h. These results reveal that SDC-LiNaSO4 composite may be a potential good candidate as interlayer for ITSOFC due to its high ionic conductivity and thermal stability.",Novel Nano-composites SDC-LiNaSO4 as Functional Layer for ITSOFC,10.1007/s40820-015-0038-4
