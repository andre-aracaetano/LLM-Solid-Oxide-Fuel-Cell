1,7032,"The influence of water vapor in air on power generation characteristic of solid oxide fuel cells was analyzed by measuring cell voltage at a constant current density, as a function of water vapor concentration at 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. Cell voltage change was negligible at 1000 degrees C, while considerable voltage drop was observed at 800 degrees C accelerated at high water vapor concentrations of 20 wt % and 40 wt %.",Degradation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes Accelerated at a High Water Vapor Concentration,10.1115/1.3117608
2,7032,"It is considered that La2O3 formed on the (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 surface, which is assumed to be the reason for a large voltage drop.",Degradation of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes Accelerated at a High Water Vapor Concentration,10.1115/1.3117608
