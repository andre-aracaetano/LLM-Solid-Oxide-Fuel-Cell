1,1379,"The deactivation upon oxidative treatments of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes based on La0.7Sr0.3VO3.85 with a Pd/ceria catalyst is examined using electrodes formed by infiltration of La0.7Sr0.3VO3.85, Pd, and ceria into porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).",The stability of lanthanum strontium vanadate for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.084
2,1379,"Based on XRD results, performance measurements of cells made with varying La:Sr:V ratios, and Pd dispersion measurements using CO adsorption, we conclude that La0.7Sr0.3VO3.85 is kinetically unstable upon reduction-oxidation treatments at 973 K, forming molten, strontium-vanadate phases that partially cover the catalytic component.",The stability of lanthanum strontium vanadate for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.08.084
