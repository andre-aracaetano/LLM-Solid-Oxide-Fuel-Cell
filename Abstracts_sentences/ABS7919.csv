2,7919,The total electrical conductivity of the ceramics with cubic fluorite structure in air mainly depends on the Ti content and decreases at 900 degrees C by about one order of magnitude from y = 0 to y = 0.15.,Mixed conducting oxides YxZr1-x-yTiyO2-x/2 (YZT) and corresponding Ni/YZT cermets as anode materials in an SOFC,10.1007/s10853-007-2099-3
3,7919,Comparing the conductivity of contributions at 900 degrees C in Ar/4% H-2 the highest contributions of electronic conductivity were obtained for y = 0.15.,Mixed conducting oxides YxZr1-x-yTiyO2-x/2 (YZT) and corresponding Ni/YZT cermets as anode materials in an SOFC,10.1007/s10853-007-2099-3
4,7919,"For the Ni/YZT cermets, the enhanced adherence at the metal/ceramic interface, compared to Ni/8YSZ (8 mol% yttria stabilised zirconia), results in a better long-term stability in terms of electrical conductivity and microstructure after 1,000 h of annealing at 1,000 degrees C in reducing atmosphere.",Mixed conducting oxides YxZr1-x-yTiyO2-x/2 (YZT) and corresponding Ni/YZT cermets as anode materials in an SOFC,10.1007/s10853-007-2099-3
5,7919,"The electrochemical performance, tested in fuel cells with Ni/8YSZ, Ni/Y0.20Zr0.75Ti0.05O1.9 and Ni/Y0.20Zr0.70Ti0.10O1.9 anodes, decreased for Ni/Y0.20Zr0.70Ti0.10O1.9 under steam reforming conditions, most likely due to the reduced ionic conductivity of this specific YZT ceramic.",Mixed conducting oxides YxZr1-x-yTiyO2-x/2 (YZT) and corresponding Ni/YZT cermets as anode materials in an SOFC,10.1007/s10853-007-2099-3
