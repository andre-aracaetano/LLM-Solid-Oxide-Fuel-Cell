1,17585,The present study investigates the mass loading effect of an infiltrated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) nanoparticles (NPs) catalyst on the area-specific polarization resistance (R-p) of a screen-printed porous LSCF cathode for solid oxide fuel cells.,Communication-Improving Intermediate-Temperature Performance of a Screen-Printed LSCF Cathode with Infiltrated LSCF Nanoparticles,10.1149/2.0541607jes
2,17585,The results show that R-p of the LSCF-NPs decorated LSCF cathode can be substantially reduced by as much as 89.3% after a single-step impregnation of 1.5 M nitrate solution containing La:Sr:Co:Fe = 0.6:0.4:0.2:0.8 with a mass loading of 3 wt%.,Communication-Improving Intermediate-Temperature Performance of a Screen-Printed LSCF Cathode with Infiltrated LSCF Nanoparticles,10.1149/2.0541607jes
