1,5609,"This work aims to analyse the techno-economic performance of an integrated system for a residential CHP (Combined Heat and Power) application, based on the integration of a Fuel Cell (FC) micro cogeneration device coupled with an Heat Pump (HP).",Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
2,5609,"The main components of the system are: the Fuel Cell unit, the Heat Pump and the thermal storage required to cover the thermal peaks, mainly due to the domestic hot water demand.",Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
3,5609,The analysis will be focused on the most diffused FC technologies for residential applications: a low temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) and a high temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC).,Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
4,5609,"FC-based cogeneration systems usually produce an electric power surplus respect to the thermal production, because of their high electrical efficiency.",Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
5,5609,"Currently, however, the households heating load exceeds significantly the electricity requirements, thus making difficult the sizing of a FC system for a single family house without including large electrical and thermal storages or high grid/boiler integration.",Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
6,5609,The combination of a Fuel Cell and an Heat Pump has been found to be an optimal solution to manage this problematic while achieving a reduction in the primary energy consumption and avoiding energy overproduction.,Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
7,5609,In the proposed scenario the heat is exploited by feeding both the domestic hot water and a low temperature radiant floor heating system operating between 35 degrees C and 45 degrees C. An energy and economic analysis has been performed to understand and to evaluate the plant feasibility.,Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
8,5609,"Results have pointed out that the best economic choice, with the current energy tariff scenario, is related to a small size FC-based CHP system able to produce enough electrical power to feed the HP plus a low electrical consumption (<1 kW electrical size), which corresponds to the base electrical household consumption (the electrical power which is near-always requested by the house).",Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
9,5609,"The electrical load is in fact deeply changing during the day (with one-minute variable peaks) and with a higher electrical production from the FC, most of the electrical power would be sold to the grid without no energy advantages.",Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
10,5609,The best PEMFC configuration was able to reach a total efficiency of 75%: if compared to the case with separated energy generation (electricity from the grid and heat from a boiler) the saving is estimated in three years of payback for the current scenario (2015).,Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
11,5609,"With the SOFC system, thanks to its higher total efficiency equal to 81%, the primary energy consumption was reduced (-30% respect to PEMFC) with a consequent reduction in the operating costs.",Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
12,5609,"However, from an economic point of view, the payback still results extended because of its not competitive investment cost.",Modeling and techno-economic analysis of the integration of a FC-based micro-CHP system for residential application with a heat pump,10.1016/j.energy.2016.11.082
