1,14606,"La1-xSrxCr1-xMxO3-delta (M=Cr, Fe, V) system has been studied as anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ+Cu composite anode running on H2 and CH4 fuels,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.04.046
2,14606,"The perovskite La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) is stable in both H-2 and CH4 atmospheres at temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. However, in the reducing atmospheres of H-2 and CH4, its electronic conductivity is greatly reduced from its value in air.",La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ+Cu composite anode running on H2 and CH4 fuels,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.04.046
3,14606,We have characterized LSCM as the anode of a SOFC having 250 mu m-thick La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 (LSGM) as the electrolyte and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (SCF) as the cathode.,La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ+Cu composite anode running on H2 and CH4 fuels,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.04.046
4,14606,"We report a comparison of the overpotentials at the following anodes: (1) La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 (LDC) +NiO composite in H-2, (2) porous LSCM in H-2 and CH4, (3) porous LSCM impregnated with CuO in H-2 and CH4 and (4) porous LSCM impregnated with CuO and sputtered with Pt in H-2 and CH4.",La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ+Cu composite anode running on H2 and CH4 fuels,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.04.046
5,14606,"An LSCM+CuO+Pt anode gave a maximum power output at 850 degrees C of 850 mW/cm(2) and 520 mW/cm(2), respectively, with H-2 and CH4 as fuel whereas anode (1) gave 1.4 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C in H-2.",La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ+Cu composite anode running on H2 and CH4 fuels,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.04.046
6,14606,"There was no noticeable coke formation in CH4 with anodes (2), (3) and (4), which demonstrates that the perovskite oxide is a plausible option for the anode of a SOFC operating with hydrocarbon fuels.",La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ+Cu composite anode running on H2 and CH4 fuels,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.04.046
7,14606,We also report the moisture effect in the H-2 and CH4 fuel-oxidation process.,La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ+Cu composite anode running on H2 and CH4 fuels,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.04.046
