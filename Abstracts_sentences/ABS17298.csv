1,17298,"The effect of annealing on the electrical conductivity of the Y2O3-ZrO2 system (8.0-10.0 mol% Y2O3) was investigated by the direct current four-probe technique at several temperatures for 1000 h. The difference of the crystal structure before and after annealing was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).",Effect of annealing on the electrical conductivity of theY2O3-ZrO2 system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.084
2,17298,The decrease of the conductivity for the specimens with composition of 8.0-9.0 mol% Y2O3 was caused by the formation of a fine tetragonal phase.,Effect of annealing on the electrical conductivity of theY2O3-ZrO2 system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.084
3,17298,"On the other hand, the sample of 9.5 mol% Y2O3 after annealing for 1000 h supported a single phase with cubic structure.",Effect of annealing on the electrical conductivity of theY2O3-ZrO2 system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.084
4,17298,"Therefore, the optimum composition as electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell in the Y2O3-ZrO2 system was considered to be 9.5 mol% Y2O3 from the viewpoint of long-term stability with the relatively high conductivity.",Effect of annealing on the electrical conductivity of theY2O3-ZrO2 system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.084
