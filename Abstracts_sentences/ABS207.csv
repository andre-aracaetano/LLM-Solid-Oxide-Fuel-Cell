1,207,Anode aluminum oxide-supported thin-film fuel cells having a sub-500-nm-thick bilayered electrolyte comprising a gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) layer and an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer were fabricated and electrochemically characterized in order to investigate the effect of the YSZ protective layer.,Fabrication of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with a nanothin protective layer by atomic layer deposition,10.1186/1556-276X-8-48
2,207,The highly dense and thin YSZ layer acted as a blockage against electron and oxygen permeation between the anode and GDC electrolyte.,Fabrication of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with a nanothin protective layer by atomic layer deposition,10.1186/1556-276X-8-48
3,207,"Dense GDC and YSZ thin films were fabricated using radio frequency sputtering and atomic layer deposition techniques, respectively.",Fabrication of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with a nanothin protective layer by atomic layer deposition,10.1186/1556-276X-8-48
4,207,The resulting bilayered thin-film fuel cell generated a significantly higher open circuit voltage of approximately 1.07 V compared with a thin-film fuel cell with a single-layered GDC electrolyte (approximately 0.3 V).,Fabrication of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with a nanothin protective layer by atomic layer deposition,10.1186/1556-276X-8-48
