2,17622,NiO-CGO and SDC-SSC are described as possible new materials and their synthesis and the cell fabrication are discussed.,Synthesis of mesoporous nanocomposites for their application in solid oxide electrolysers cells: microstructural and electrochemical characterization,10.1039/c5fd00035a
3,17622,"The obtained materials are microstructurally characterised by SEM, TEM and XRD, where the mesoporous structures are observed and analysed.",Synthesis of mesoporous nanocomposites for their application in solid oxide electrolysers cells: microstructural and electrochemical characterization,10.1039/c5fd00035a
4,17622,"The obtained samples are electrochemically analysed by I-V polarisation curves and EIS analysis, showing a maximum current density of 330 mA cm(-2) at 1.7 V. A degradation of the cell performance is evidenced after a potentiostatic test at 1.4 V after more than 40 hours.",Synthesis of mesoporous nanocomposites for their application in solid oxide electrolysers cells: microstructural and electrochemical characterization,10.1039/c5fd00035a
