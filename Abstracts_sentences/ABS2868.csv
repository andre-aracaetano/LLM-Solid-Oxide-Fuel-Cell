2,2868,One interesting phenomenon is that the SIMs can successfully avoid the underlying short-circuiting issue and power losses while bringing significantly enhanced power output.,Experimental and physical approaches on a novel semiconducting-ionic membrane fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.204
3,2868,It is crucial to understand the physics in such devices as they show distinct electrochemical processes with conventional fuel cells.,Experimental and physical approaches on a novel semiconducting-ionic membrane fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.204
4,2868,"We first presented experimental studies of a SIM fuel cell based on a composite of semiconductor LiCo0.8Fe0.2O2 (LCF) and ionic conductor Sm-doped CeO2 (SDC), which achieved a remarkable power density of 1150 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C along with a high open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.04 V. Then, for the first time we used a physical model via combining a semiconductor-ionic contact junction with a rectifying layer which blocks the electron leakage to describe such unique SIM device and excellent performance.",Experimental and physical approaches on a novel semiconducting-ionic membrane fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.204
