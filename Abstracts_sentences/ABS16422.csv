2,16422,"Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) analysis of the SrGdNixMn1-xO4 +/-delta (x = 0.2, 0.S, and 0.8) materials revealed that significant exsolution of Ni nanoparticles occurred in SrGdNi0.2Mn0.8O4 +/-delta (SGNM28) in H-2 at over 650 degrees C. Consistently, the SGNM28 on the LSGM electrolyte showed low electrode polarization resistance (1.79 Omega cm(2)) in H-2 at 800 degrees C. Moreover, after 10 redox cycles at 750 degrees C, the electrode area specific resistance of the SGNM28 anode in H-2 increased only 0.027 Omega.cm(2) per cycle (1.78% degradation rate), indicating excellent redox stability in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres.",A Highly Active and Redox-Stable SrGdNi0.2Mn0.8O4±δ Anode with in Situ Exsolution of Nanocatalysts,10.1021/acscatal.8b03669
3,16422,"An LSGM-electrolyte-supported SOFC employing an SGNM28-Gd-doped ceria anode yielded a maximum power density of 1.26 W cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, which is the best performance among the SOFCs with Ruddlesden-Popper-based ceramic anodes to date.",A Highly Active and Redox-Stable SrGdNi0.2Mn0.8O4±δ Anode with in Situ Exsolution of Nanocatalysts,10.1021/acscatal.8b03669
