1,12603,"Composite materials frequently allow the drawbacks of single components to be overcome thanks to a synergistic combination of material-and structure-specific features, leading to enhanced and also new properties.",Application of La-Doped SrTiO3 in Advanced Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/cryst8030134
2,12603,"This is the case of a metallic-ceramic composite, a nickel-chromium-aluminum (NiCrAl) foam impregnated with La-doped Strontium Titanate (LST).",Application of La-Doped SrTiO3 in Advanced Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/cryst8030134
3,12603,"This particular cermet has very interesting properties that can be used in different fields of application, namely: mechanical robustness provided by the metal foam; and chemical stability in harsh conditions of temperature and atmosphere by promotion of a thin protective layer of alumina (Al2O3); high electronic conductivity given by a percolating ceramic conducting phase, i.e., La-doped Strontium Titanate.",Application of La-Doped SrTiO3 in Advanced Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/cryst8030134
4,12603,"In this paper, its application as a current collector in a metal-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) was studied.",Application of La-Doped SrTiO3 in Advanced Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/cryst8030134
5,12603,"Firstly, the electronic properties of different compositions, stoichiometric and under stoichiometric, of LST were analyzed to choose the best one in terms of conductivity and phase purity.",Application of La-Doped SrTiO3 in Advanced Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/cryst8030134
6,12603,"Then, LST chemical stability was studied in the presence of Al2O3 at different temperatures, gas compositions and aging times.",Application of La-Doped SrTiO3 in Advanced Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/cryst8030134
7,12603,"Finally, stability and conductivity of LST-impregnated NiCrAl foam composite materials were measured, and LST was found to be fully compatible with the NiCrAl foam, as no reactions were detected in oxidizing and reducing atmosphere after up to 300 h operation at 750 degrees C and 900 degrees C between the Al2O3 la yer and LST.",Application of La-Doped SrTiO3 in Advanced Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/cryst8030134
8,12603,"Results showed that the composite is suitable as a current collector in innovative designs of metal-supported SOFC, like the Evolve cell, in which the metallic part is supposed not only to provide the structural stability to the cell, but also to play the role of current collector due to the impregnation of ceramic material.",Application of La-Doped SrTiO3 in Advanced Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/cryst8030134
