2,16893,"After annealing in air at 500 degrees C for up to 200 h, each material underwent a conductivity-lowering structural transformation, thus making them unsuitable for use as solid electrolytes in solid-oxide fuel cells.",Structure-property relationships in fluorite-type Bi2O3-Yb2O3-PbO solid-electrolyte materials,10.1017/S0885715614001079
3,16893,"For example, (BiO1.5)(0.80)(YbO1.5)(0.17)(PbO)(0.03) underwent a fluorite- to Bi17Yb7O36-type orthorhombic transformation, indicative of long-range cation ordering, and (BiO1.5)(0.80)(YbO1.5)(0.11)(PbO)(0.09) underwent a fluorite- to beta-Bi2O3-type tetragonal transformation, indicative of long-range < 001 > oxide-ion vacancy ordering.",Structure-property relationships in fluorite-type Bi2O3-Yb2O3-PbO solid-electrolyte materials,10.1017/S0885715614001079
