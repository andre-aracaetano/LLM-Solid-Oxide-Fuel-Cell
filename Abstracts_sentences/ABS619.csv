2,619,Numerous attempts have been made to identify compatible materials.,Performance of a single layer fuel cell based on a mixed proton-electron conducting composite,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.04.007
3,619,"Here, these challenges are circumvented by the introduction of a working single layer fuel cell, fabricated from a composite of proton conducting BaCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-delta and a mixture of semiconducting oxides - Li2O, NiO, and ZnO. Structural and electrical properties of the composite, related to its fuel cell performance are investigated.",Performance of a single layer fuel cell based on a mixed proton-electron conducting composite,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.04.007
4,619,The single layer fuel cell shows a maximum OCV of 0.83 V and a peak power density of 3.86 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C. Activation and mass transport losses are identified as the major limiting factor for efficiency and power output.,Performance of a single layer fuel cell based on a mixed proton-electron conducting composite,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.04.007
