1,11916,"In order to develop a new anodic material for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operated under methane, we studied lanthanum chromites doped with strontium and ruthenium.","Surface properties and physicochemical characterizations of a new type of anode material, La1-xSrxCr1-yRuyO3-δ, for a solid oxide fuel cell under methane at intermediate temperature",10.1006/jcat.2002.3588
2,11916,Ruthenium is an excellent catalyst for methane steam reforming but its use is limited by its cost and evaporation as RuO(x) at high temperature.,"Surface properties and physicochemical characterizations of a new type of anode material, La1-xSrxCr1-yRuyO3-δ, for a solid oxide fuel cell under methane at intermediate temperature",10.1006/jcat.2002.3588
3,11916,"To stabilize the ruthenium, we inserted it into the perovskite to form La(1-x)Sr(x)Cr(1-y)Ru(y)O(3).","Surface properties and physicochemical characterizations of a new type of anode material, La1-xSrxCr1-yRuyO3-δ, for a solid oxide fuel cell under methane at intermediate temperature",10.1006/jcat.2002.3588
4,11916,"XRD, SEM, TPR, and EDX analyses revealed the stability of ruthenium in the perovskite, in the tetravalent state.","Surface properties and physicochemical characterizations of a new type of anode material, La1-xSrxCr1-yRuyO3-δ, for a solid oxide fuel cell under methane at intermediate temperature",10.1006/jcat.2002.3588
5,11916,The composition was homogeneous in the entire volume of the electrode.,"Surface properties and physicochemical characterizations of a new type of anode material, La1-xSrxCr1-yRuyO3-δ, for a solid oxide fuel cell under methane at intermediate temperature",10.1006/jcat.2002.3588
6,11916,"Nevertheless, XPS analyses indicated a strontium segregation for a thickness lower than 5 nm.","Surface properties and physicochemical characterizations of a new type of anode material, La1-xSrxCr1-yRuyO3-δ, for a solid oxide fuel cell under methane at intermediate temperature",10.1006/jcat.2002.3588
7,11916,The EDX analyses also showed a strontium concentration gradient near the subsurface.,"Surface properties and physicochemical characterizations of a new type of anode material, La1-xSrxCr1-yRuyO3-δ, for a solid oxide fuel cell under methane at intermediate temperature",10.1006/jcat.2002.3588
8,11916,The main result was that no loss of ruthenium was detected even after treatments under air at 1100degreesC. The strontium doping allows the stabilization of the ruthenium in the perovskite in the tetravalent state.,"Surface properties and physicochemical characterizations of a new type of anode material, La1-xSrxCr1-yRuyO3-δ, for a solid oxide fuel cell under methane at intermediate temperature",10.1006/jcat.2002.3588
