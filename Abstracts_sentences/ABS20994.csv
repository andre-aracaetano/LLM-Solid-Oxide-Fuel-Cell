5,20994,"The results indicate that by increasing the solar receiver outlet temperature from 800 K to 1300 K, the solar share increases from 22.1% to 42.38% and the overall fuel consumption of the plant reduces from 7 kg/s to 2.7 kg/s.",Performance evaluation of a solarized gas turbine system integrated to a high temperature electrolyzer for hydrogen production,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.018
6,20994,"Furthermore, flameless mode is achievable in the boiler while the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) is maintained at the temperatures higher than 1314 K. Using constant amounts of the SGT electrical power, the HTE voltage decreases by enhancing the HTE steam temperature which result in the augmentation of the overall hydrogen production.",Performance evaluation of a solarized gas turbine system integrated to a high temperature electrolyzer for hydrogen production,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.018
7,20994,"To increase the HTE steam temperature from 950 K to 1350 K, the rate of fuel consumption in the flameless boiler increases from 0.1 m/s to 0.8 m/s; however, since the HTE hydrogen production increases from 4.24 mol/s to 16 mol/s it can be interpreted that the higher steam temperatures would be affordable.",Performance evaluation of a solarized gas turbine system integrated to a high temperature electrolyzer for hydrogen production,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.018
