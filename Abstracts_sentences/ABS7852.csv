1,7852,Chemical to electrical energy conversion using a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) becomes more practical as the operating temperature is lowered to 600 degrees C and below.,High-performance SrNb0.1Co0.9-xFexO3-δ perovskite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03208j
2,7852,"Given the thermally activated nature of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode side, development of cathode catalysts with very low polarisation resistance is essential.",High-performance SrNb0.1Co0.9-xFexO3-δ perovskite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03208j
3,7852,"Here, we showed that partial substitution of Co within SrNb0.1Co0.9O3-delta by Fe (up to 0.5) triggers the formation of oxygen non-stoichiometry while preserving the primitive cubic lattice, thus substantially enhancing the ORR performance below 600 degrees C (relative to the parent compound).",High-performance SrNb0.1Co0.9-xFexO3-δ perovskite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03208j
4,7852,Close correlation between the oxygen non-stoichiometry and ORR activity trends was found to some extent.,High-performance SrNb0.1Co0.9-xFexO3-δ perovskite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03208j
5,7852,"SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3-delta (SNCF0.2) cathode exhibits a very low area specific resistance value of 0.052 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C which translates to superior fuel cell performance, e. g. peak power density of 1587 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C. Moreover, the synergistic relationship between ORR activity, thermal expansion coefficient and enhanced CO2 resistance attests to the significance of the SNCF cathode.",High-performance SrNb0.1Co0.9-xFexO3-δ perovskite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03208j
6,7852,The last attribute is envisioned as a dominant factor for applications using alternative fuels (e. g. CO which normally contains CO2) and in a portable single-chamber SOFC.,High-performance SrNb0.1Co0.9-xFexO3-δ perovskite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03208j
