1,5626,"A traditional composite cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs) is typically obtained by mixing cathode materials and proton conducting electrolyte of BaCe0.7Y0.2Zr0.1O3-delta (BZCY), providing chemical and thermal compatibility with the electrolyte.",A Novel Self-Assembled Cobalt-Free Perovskite Composite Cathode with Triple-Conduction for Intermediate Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.202209695
2,5626,"Here, a series of triple-conducing and cobalt-free iron-based perovskites as cathodes for H-SOFCs is reported.",A Novel Self-Assembled Cobalt-Free Perovskite Composite Cathode with Triple-Conduction for Intermediate Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.202209695
3,5626,"Specifically, BaCexFe1-xO3-delta (x = 0.36, 0.43, and 0.50) shows various contents of two single phase perovskites with an in situ heterojunction structure as well as triple conductivity by tailoring the Ce/Fe ratios.",A Novel Self-Assembled Cobalt-Free Perovskite Composite Cathode with Triple-Conduction for Intermediate Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.202209695
4,5626,"The cell performance with the optimized BaCe0.36Fe0.64O3-delta (BCF36) cathode composition reaches 1056 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C. Moreover, a record cell performance of 1525 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C is obtained by modifying the BCF36 cathode microstructure through a spraying method, demonstrating high promise with Co-free cathodes for H-SOFCs.",A Novel Self-Assembled Cobalt-Free Perovskite Composite Cathode with Triple-Conduction for Intermediate Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.202209695
