3,6531,"Herein, to further improve the performance of the heterostructure electrolyte, an A-site-deficiency strategy is used to solely modify BCFZY for regulating the ionic conduction and catalytic activity of the heterostructure.",Enhancing the Performance of the p-n Heterostructure Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells via A-Site-Deficiency Engineering,10.1021/acsami.3c10501
4,6531,"Two new electrolytes, B(0.9)CFZY-ZnO and B(0.8)CFZY-ZnO, were developed and systematically studied.",Enhancing the Performance of the p-n Heterostructure Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells via A-Site-Deficiency Engineering,10.1021/acsami.3c10501
5,6531,The results show that the two samples gain improved ionic conductivity and auxiliary catalytic activity after A-site deficiency as a result of the increment of the surface and interface oxygen vacancies.,Enhancing the Performance of the p-n Heterostructure Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells via A-Site-Deficiency Engineering,10.1021/acsami.3c10501
6,6531,"The single cells with B(0.9)CFZY-ZnO and B(0.8)CFZY-ZnO exhibit enhanced peak power outputs at 450-550 degrees C compared to the cell based on B(1.0)CFZY-ZnO (typically, 745 and 795 vs 542 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C).",Enhancing the Performance of the p-n Heterostructure Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells via A-Site-Deficiency Engineering,10.1021/acsami.3c10501
7,6531,"Particular attention is paid to the impact of A-site deficiency on the interface energy band alignment between B(x)CFZY and ZnO, which suggests that the p-n heterojunction effect of B(x)CFZY-ZnO for charge carrier regulation can be tuned by A-site deficiency to enable high proton transport while avoiding fuel cell current leakage.",Enhancing the Performance of the p-n Heterostructure Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells via A-Site-Deficiency Engineering,10.1021/acsami.3c10501
8,6531,This study thus confirms the feasibility of A-site-deficiency engineering to optimize the performance of the heterostructure electrolyte for developing LT-SOFCs.,Enhancing the Performance of the p-n Heterostructure Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells via A-Site-Deficiency Engineering,10.1021/acsami.3c10501
