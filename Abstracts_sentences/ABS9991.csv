1,9991,"Lattice expansion behaviour, oxygen nonstoichiometry, mean iron oxidation state, electrical conductivity and interfacial polarization resistance of Bi1-xSrxFeO3-delta were reported as a function of Sr-doping content for x = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8.",Evaluation and optimization of Bi1-xSrxFeO3-δ perovskites as cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.109
2,9991,"Among the series, Bi1-xSrxFeO3-delta(BSE5) demonstrates the optimum performance in terms of the lowest interfacial polarization resistance and the largest oxygen nonstoichiometry.",Evaluation and optimization of Bi1-xSrxFeO3-δ perovskites as cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.109
3,9991,"It is demonstrated that the best microstructure and the lowest interfacial resistance can be obtained by firing BSF5 onto dense Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte at 1000 degrees C. BSF5 exhibits good chemical compatibility with SDC; however, firing temperature above 1000 degrees C results in the formation of bismuth-deficient perovskite with inferior activity for oxygen reduction reaction.",Evaluation and optimization of Bi1-xSrxFeO3-δ perovskites as cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.109
4,9991,We also show that single-phase BSF5 cathode provides better electrode performance than its composite with SDC.,Evaluation and optimization of Bi1-xSrxFeO3-δ perovskites as cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.109
5,9991,This is due to the increased charge-transfer resistance upon adding SDC which have negligible electronic conductivity.,Evaluation and optimization of Bi1-xSrxFeO3-δ perovskites as cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.109
