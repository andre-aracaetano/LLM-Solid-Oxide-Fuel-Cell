3,17819,A solid solution La3-xSrxTaO7-x/2 was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy; it extends for a substitution ratio up to x = 0.15.,La3TaO7 derivatives with Weberite structure type: Possible electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells and high temperature electrolysers,10.1016/j.crci.2010.07.009
4,17819,"Whereas La3TaO7 is a poor oxide ion conductor (sigma(700 degrees C) = 2 x 10(-5)S.cm(-1)), at 700 degrees C, its ionic conductivity is increased by more than one order of magnitude when 3.3% molar strontium is introduced in the structure (sigma(700 degrees C) = 2 x 10(-4)S.cm(-1)).",La3TaO7 derivatives with Weberite structure type: Possible electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells and high temperature electrolysers,10.1016/j.crci.2010.07.009
