4,17351,"The impedance spectrum results of symmetrical cells indicate that the 42.2 wt% LSN-infiltrated BCZYYC2 electrode exhibits the lowest polarization resistance of 0.039 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Moreover, a hydrogen electrode-supported single cell with the 42.2 wt% LSN-infiltrated BCZYYC2 electrode shows a high maximum power density of 1.22 W cm(-2) and an electrolysis current density (at 1.3 V) of -3.02 A cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, respectively.",Tailoring a micro-nanostructured electrolyte-oxygen electrode interface for proton-conducting reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227498
