2,8916,"In this paper, the advanced solid oxide fuel cell gas turbine hybrid power generation system based on aviation kerosene is studied.",Study on the performance comparison of three configurations of aviation fuel cell gas turbine hybrid power generation system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230007
3,8916,"And the performance of three configurations of hybrid system without/with SOFC exhaust recirculation are compared and evaluated, which are a basic hybrid system without exhaust recirculation (BHS), an anode exhaust recirculation hybrid system (ARHS), and an anode and cathode exhaust recirculation hybrid system (ACRHS).",Study on the performance comparison of three configurations of aviation fuel cell gas turbine hybrid power generation system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230007
4,8916,"The results show that the power generation efficiency of the BHS is 59.3%, while the two hybrid systems with exhaust recirculation increase to around 70%: the efficiency of ARHS is 70.9%, and ACRHS is 69.7%.",Study on the performance comparison of three configurations of aviation fuel cell gas turbine hybrid power generation system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230007
5,8916,But the ACRHS shows greater potential in increasing the SOFC cathode inlet temperature.,Study on the performance comparison of three configurations of aviation fuel cell gas turbine hybrid power generation system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230007
6,8916,And the specific work of the hybrid system with exhaust recirculation can reach more than 760 kW (kg air)-1.,Study on the performance comparison of three configurations of aviation fuel cell gas turbine hybrid power generation system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230007
7,8916,"In addition, the parameters such as pressure ratio, temperature ratio and fuel utilization have important influence on the performance.",Study on the performance comparison of three configurations of aviation fuel cell gas turbine hybrid power generation system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230007
8,8916,"Due to the advantages of high power generation efficiency and specific work, hybrid system is a competitive power generation system in aviation field.",Study on the performance comparison of three configurations of aviation fuel cell gas turbine hybrid power generation system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230007
