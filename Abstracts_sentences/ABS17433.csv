1,17433,The effect of water vapour in the fuel on planar solid oxide fuel cells (p-SOFCs) with new compositions for La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 (LSFC) and Pr0.58Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta (PSFC) cathodes has been investigated.,DEPENDENCE OF WATER CONTENT IN FUEL ON SOFC PERFORMANCE,
2,17433,The aim was to study the SOFC electrochemical behaviour as a function of 3 to 30 mol.% water content in H-2 fuel.,DEPENDENCE OF WATER CONTENT IN FUEL ON SOFC PERFORMANCE,
3,17433,For this purpose a new single SOFC diagnostic system has been set up.,DEPENDENCE OF WATER CONTENT IN FUEL ON SOFC PERFORMANCE,
4,17433,The installation includes a special heating supplying system with a preliminary water preheating process in parallel with a precise fuel mass flow unit and temperature control.,DEPENDENCE OF WATER CONTENT IN FUEL ON SOFC PERFORMANCE,
5,17433,The experiments are carried out under isothermal conditions at a temperature of 800 degrees C.,DEPENDENCE OF WATER CONTENT IN FUEL ON SOFC PERFORMANCE,
6,17433,An attempt to check the fuel humidity level versus power density and an adequate interpretation of the SOFC performance at the testing conditions is presented.,DEPENDENCE OF WATER CONTENT IN FUEL ON SOFC PERFORMANCE,
