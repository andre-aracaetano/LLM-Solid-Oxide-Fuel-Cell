1,4787,"This study investigates the electrochemical properties of (Sm0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8M0.2)O3-delta (M=Cu, Mn) cathodes and evaluates them for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Electrochemical Properties of Composite (Sm0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8M0.2)O3-δ (M=Cu, Mn) Cathodes for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/2.027208jes
2,4787,"According to the relationship between interfacial polarization resistance at high frequency (R-2) and oxygen partial pressure (Po-2) at different temperatures, it indicates that oxygen reduction reactions are almost entirely dominated by the electron-transfer process for (Sm0.5Sr0.5)CoO3-delta-based cathodes with increasing the temperature.","Electrochemical Properties of Composite (Sm0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8M0.2)O3-δ (M=Cu, Mn) Cathodes for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/2.027208jes
3,4787,The result of the interfacial polarization resistance at high frequency (R-3) as a function of oxygen partial pressure revealed that oxygen reduction reactions are nearly dominated by oxygen adsorption/desorption processes for (Sm0.5Sr0.5)CoO3-delta-based cathodes with increasing the temperature.,"Electrochemical Properties of Composite (Sm0.5Sr0.5)(Co0.8M0.2)O3-δ (M=Cu, Mn) Cathodes for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/2.027208jes
