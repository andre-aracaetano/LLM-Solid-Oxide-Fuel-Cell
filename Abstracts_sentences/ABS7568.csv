1,7568,"In this paper, La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Ba0.1Bi0.9O1.5-delta (LSM-BSB) composite cathode was prepared and characterized for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Sintering behavioral and electrochemical performances of LSM-BSB composite cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1007/s10832-011-9630-2
2,7568,"XRD results show that no reaction occurred between LSM and BSB at 900A degrees C. SEM results show that the LSM-BSB composite cathode formed good contact with YSZ electrolyte after sintered at 900A degrees C for 2 h, which significantly reduced the sintering temperature of cathode.",Sintering behavioral and electrochemical performances of LSM-BSB composite cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1007/s10832-011-9630-2
3,7568,"Compared with the LSM-YSZ electrode sintered at 1200A degrees C for 2 h, LSM-BSB electrode exhibits better electrochemical performance.",Sintering behavioral and electrochemical performances of LSM-BSB composite cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1007/s10832-011-9630-2
4,7568,"At 800A degrees C, the area specific resistance (ASR) of the LSM-BSB30 electrode is about 0.168 Omega cm(2), which is nearly 1.5 times lower than that of LSM-YSZ composite cathode.",Sintering behavioral and electrochemical performances of LSM-BSB composite cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1007/s10832-011-9630-2
