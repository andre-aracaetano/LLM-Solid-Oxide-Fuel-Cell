1,19624,A microsteam turbine with a tip diameter of 15 mm was designed and experimentally characterized.,Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a 34 Watt Radial-Inflow Steam Turbine With Partial Admission,10.1115/1.4049483
2,19624,"At the nominal mass flow rate and total-to-total pressure ratio of 2.3 kg h(-1) and 2, respectively, the turbine yields a power of 34 W and a total-to-static isentropic efficiency of 37%.",Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a 34 Watt Radial-Inflow Steam Turbine With Partial Admission,10.1115/1.4049483
3,19624,"The steam turbine is conceived as a radial-inflow, low-reaction (15%), and partial admission (21%) machine.",Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a 34 Watt Radial-Inflow Steam Turbine With Partial Admission,10.1115/1.4049483
4,19624,"Since the steam is limited in the system (solid oxide fuel cell), a low-reaction and high-power-density design is preferred.",Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a 34 Watt Radial-Inflow Steam Turbine With Partial Admission,10.1115/1.4049483
5,19624,"The partial-admission design allows for reduced losses: The turbine rotor and stator blades are prismatic, have a radial chord length of 1 mm and a height of 0.59 mm.",Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a 34 Watt Radial-Inflow Steam Turbine With Partial Admission,10.1115/1.4049483
6,19624,"Since the relative rotor blade tip clearance (0.24) is high, the blade tip leakage losses are significant.",Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a 34 Watt Radial-Inflow Steam Turbine With Partial Admission,10.1115/1.4049483
7,19624,"Considering a fixed steam supply, this design allows to increase the blade height, and thus reducing the losses.",Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a 34 Watt Radial-Inflow Steam Turbine With Partial Admission,10.1115/1.4049483

9,19624,The rotor is supported on dynamic steam-lubricated bearings; the nominal rotational speed is 175 krpm.,Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a 34 Watt Radial-Inflow Steam Turbine With Partial Admission,10.1115/1.4049483
10,19624,A numerical simulation of the steam turbine is in good agreement with the experimental results.,Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a 34 Watt Radial-Inflow Steam Turbine With Partial Admission,10.1115/1.4049483
11,19624,"Furthermore, a novel test rig setup, featuring extremely thin thermocouples (phi 0.15 mm) is investigated for an operation with ambient and hot air at 220 degrees C. Conventional zero- and one-dimensional predesign models correlate well with the experimental results, despite the small size of the turbine blades.",Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of a 34 Watt Radial-Inflow Steam Turbine With Partial Admission,10.1115/1.4049483
