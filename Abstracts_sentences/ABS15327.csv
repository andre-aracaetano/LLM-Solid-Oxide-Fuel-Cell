3,15327,Ni/TZ3Y cermet anodes were prepared by screen printing and the electrode performance was characterised by galvanostatic current interruption and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques.,Fabrication and performance of Ni/3 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00729-3
4,15327,"The results showed that the electrochemical activity of Ni/TZ3Y cermet anodes for hydrogen oxidation is strongly dependent on the selection of fabrication parameters, and the effect of these processing parameters on the electrode microstructure is closely interlinked.",Fabrication and performance of Ni/3 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00729-3
5,15327,"The most critical parameters appear to be the particle size and particle size distribution of NiO and TZ3Y powders, which can be controlled by screening various commercial powders and by optimising the heat treatment conditions of these powders.",Fabrication and performance of Ni/3 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00729-3
