3,14208,"Subsequently, the as-prepared whole cell was annealed in the humidified 5% H-2-95% N-2 at 700 degrees C for 1 hour to get the metal oxide support reduced.",Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ Cathode,10.1149/2.0811602jes
4,14208,"Results show that after being annealed in the reducing atmosphere at 700 degrees C for 1 hour, the oxide support was mostly reduced into metal, while the LSCFN cathode maintained its perovskite structure with slightly oxygen loss which was proved redox reversible in air at the typical cell test temperature of 700 degrees C. Fully reduced Ni-Fe metal support could be obtained during the cell test condition with humidified H-2 sweeping at the anode side.",Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ Cathode,10.1149/2.0811602jes
5,14208,"Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results show that the polarization resistance of LSCFN symmetrical cell in air decreased after one redox cycle between the humidified 5% H2-95% N2 and air, suggesting the performance optimization of LSCFN cathode after the possible rearrangement of mixed-valence Fe3+/Fe4+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox couples and distribution of oxygen vacancies.",Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ Cathode,10.1149/2.0811602jes
