1,9086,The effect of anode off-gas recycling (AOGR) on the characteristic performance of a natural gas reformer equipped with a precious metal catalyst is investigated experimentally.,Effect of Anode off-gas Recycling on Reforming of Natural Gas for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1002/fuce.201200047
2,9086,The reformer is operated both with synthetic AOGR gas and in steam reforming (SR) conditions.,Effect of Anode off-gas Recycling on Reforming of Natural Gas for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1002/fuce.201200047
3,9086,"The characteristic performance in SR and AOGR mode are compared with equilibrium, and it is found that equilibrium is more readily achieved in AOGR mode.",Effect of Anode off-gas Recycling on Reforming of Natural Gas for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1002/fuce.201200047
4,9086,"The reformer is used for extended periods of time (1001,000?h) in conditions where carbon formation is thermodynamically possible to measure any changes in characteristic performance.",Effect of Anode off-gas Recycling on Reforming of Natural Gas for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1002/fuce.201200047
5,9086,No significant change in the performance is observed due to carbon formation or catalyst deactivation.,Effect of Anode off-gas Recycling on Reforming of Natural Gas for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1002/fuce.201200047
6,9086,The reformer could be successfully implemented in a 10?kW SOFC system with an anode off-gas recycling loop.,Effect of Anode off-gas Recycling on Reforming of Natural Gas for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1002/fuce.201200047
