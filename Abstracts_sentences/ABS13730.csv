3,13730,"The results of this screen, which are supported by a comprehensive set of density functional theory calculations, indicate that known materials with the CrVO4 structure type have an average migration energy for proton diffusion of less than 0.2 eV, with several known materials having calculated migration energies below 0.1 eV.",Materials with the CrVO4 structure type as candidate superprotonic conductors,10.1039/c9ra06291b
4,13730,"These results indicate that materials with the CrVO4 structure type, which to our knowledge have not been previously explored as candidate proton conductors, may exhibit very high proton conductivity that surpasses that of leading proton-conducting oxides.",Materials with the CrVO4 structure type as candidate superprotonic conductors,10.1039/c9ra06291b
