2,669,It was applied as an anode catalytic material for biogas reforming in solid oxide fuel cells.,The influence of synthesis method on the microstructure and catalytic performance of Y0.07Sr0.93Ti0.8Fe0.2O3-8 in synthetic biogas operated solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.materresbull.2017.12.002
3,669,"Clear differences in the microstructure of fabricated catalytic layers were found, mainly with respect to a grain size and distribution of grains.",The influence of synthesis method on the microstructure and catalytic performance of Y0.07Sr0.93Ti0.8Fe0.2O3-8 in synthetic biogas operated solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.materresbull.2017.12.002
4,669,This led to some differences in biogas diffusion through the layer as well as in an amount of active sites for a biogas reforming.,The influence of synthesis method on the microstructure and catalytic performance of Y0.07Sr0.93Ti0.8Fe0.2O3-8 in synthetic biogas operated solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.materresbull.2017.12.002
5,669,Also different chemical stability of each compound was observed in the fuel cell operating conditions.,The influence of synthesis method on the microstructure and catalytic performance of Y0.07Sr0.93Ti0.8Fe0.2O3-8 in synthetic biogas operated solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.materresbull.2017.12.002
6,669,The best long-term stability in biogas was found for a fuel cell with the YSTF_Pechini catalytic layer (sintered in air at 1100 degrees C for 2 h) and the lowest one for a fuel cell with the YSTF_MPP layer.,The influence of synthesis method on the microstructure and catalytic performance of Y0.07Sr0.93Ti0.8Fe0.2O3-8 in synthetic biogas operated solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.materresbull.2017.12.002
