1,14411,An anode backbone using 40 wt% (ZrO2)0.89(Sc2O3)(0.1)(CeO2)(0.01) (SSZ)-Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 (SLT) cermet was prepared for SSZ electrolyte -supported SOFC single cells.,Highly redox-resistant solid oxide fuel cell anode materials based on La-doped SrTiO3 by catalyst impregnation strategy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.111
2,14411,"15 mgcm(-2) CeasGd(0.1)O(2) (GDC) was impregnated to totally cover the SSZ-SLT anode backbone surface acting as a catalyst, and the cell voltage achieved 0.865 V at 200 mAcm(-2) using (La0.75Sr0.25)(0.98)MnO3 (LSM)-SSZ cathode in 3%-humidified hydrogen fuel at 800 degrees C. Cell performance was substantially improved from 0.865 V to >0.97 V when 0.03 mgcm(-2)",Highly redox-resistant solid oxide fuel cell anode materials based on La-doped SrTiO3 by catalyst impregnation strategy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.111

4,14411,50 redox cycles were performed to investigate redox stability of this high performance anode.,Highly redox-resistant solid oxide fuel cell anode materials based on La-doped SrTiO3 by catalyst impregnation strategy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.111
5,14411,"It was found that even after the 50 redox cycle long-term degradation test, cell voltage at 200 mAcm(-2) was retained around 0.94 V, higher than the cell performance using the conventional Ni-SSZ cermet anode.",Highly redox-resistant solid oxide fuel cell anode materials based on La-doped SrTiO3 by catalyst impregnation strategy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.111
6,14411,"The catalytically-active reaction sites at ceria-Pd or ceria-Ni may account for the excellent performance, and the extremely low metal catalyst concentration prevent serious metal aggregation in achieving excellent redox stability.",Highly redox-resistant solid oxide fuel cell anode materials based on La-doped SrTiO3 by catalyst impregnation strategy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.111
