1,16368,"The presence of both chromium and sulfur (Cr/S) contaminants on the microstructure and electrocatalytic activity properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is studied, using Confocal laser Raman spectroscopy, XRD, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) methods.",Co-Deposition and Poisoning of Chromium and Sulfur Contaminants on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0231506jes
2,16368,LSCF dense bar samples were heat treated in the presence of Cr2O3 and 20 ppm SO2 and in the temperature range of 600-900 degrees C.,Co-Deposition and Poisoning of Chromium and Sulfur Contaminants on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0231506jes
3,16368,"The deposition and reaction products between LSCF and Cr/S depend on the temperature: SrCrO4 only forms on LSCF samples at 900 degrees C and 800 degrees C, while formation of SrSO4 phase occurs at all temperatures studied.",Co-Deposition and Poisoning of Chromium and Sulfur Contaminants on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0231506jes
4,16368,"The results indicate that sulfur shows a higher activity with LSCF, as compared to gaseous Cr species.",Co-Deposition and Poisoning of Chromium and Sulfur Contaminants on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0231506jes
5,16368,"Segregated SrO is more likely to react with gaseous Cr species at higher temperatures, however, reaction with SO2 is more pronounced at lower temperatures, forming SrSO4.",Co-Deposition and Poisoning of Chromium and Sulfur Contaminants on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0231506jes
6,16368,ECR results indicate that co-deposition of Cr and sulfur significantly deteriorates the surface exchange and diffusion processes for the O-2 reduction reaction on LSCF electrodes.,Co-Deposition and Poisoning of Chromium and Sulfur Contaminants on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0231506jes
