2,14281,"In this study, well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles are prepared by one-cycle infiltration method using H2PtCl6 aqueous solution in SFM-SDC scaffold, to form high electrocatalytic activity Pt-SFM-SDC electrode for fuel cell, steam electrolysis and CH4-assisted steam electrolysis processes.",Optimization of Pt infiltrated Sr2Fe2-xMoxO6-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cell and CH4-assisted electrolysis process,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.11.247
3,14281,"Systematic studies in concentration variation of H2PtCl6 solution demonstrate that the discharge current of the 3.14 cm(2) cell infiltrated by 0.040 M solution is significantly increased from 0.4 to 1.32 A (>3 times) at 0.5 V at 800 degrees C while the electrolysis current is effectively enhanced from 0.8 to 3.28 A (>4 times) at 1.5 V. Moreover, cells with Pt-SFM-SDC electrode applied in CH4-assisted electrolysis process realized a remarkable reduction of power consumption.",Optimization of Pt infiltrated Sr2Fe2-xMoxO6-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cell and CH4-assisted electrolysis process,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.11.247
