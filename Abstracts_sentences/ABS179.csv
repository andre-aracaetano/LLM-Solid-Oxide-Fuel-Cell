1,179,Since the successful demonstration of alkaline fuel cell technology by Bacon in the 1950s fuel cells in one guise or another - have held forth the promise of mass market commercialisation.,Material issues for fuel cell applications,10.3184/096034007X267349
2,179,To date this promise has yet to materialise despite the fact that many products are currently undergoing field evaluation and testing.,Material issues for fuel cell applications,10.3184/096034007X267349
3,179,The primary barrier that fuel cell technology must overcome relates to cost but at its heart this is a materials issue.,Material issues for fuel cell applications,10.3184/096034007X267349
4,179,"The problems relate to electrolyte and catalyst performance and cost, chemical stability of the cell interconnect and the long-term reliability of fuel and oxidant seals.",Material issues for fuel cell applications,10.3184/096034007X267349
5,179,"In this paper, the detailed issues facing the different types of fuel cells will be summarised and an in-depth case study on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) will be presented.",Material issues for fuel cell applications,10.3184/096034007X267349
