3,2550,"In this study, the interaction of the proton conduction, the electron conduction, and the electrochemical hydrogen conversion in such composite electrode materials was examined.",Parasitic Currents Caused by Different Ionic and Electronic Conductivities in Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acsami.5b02182
4,2550,"Exposed to a hydrogen atmosphere, these composites displayed up to 10-fold smaller resistivities for the proton conduction than that of Nafion membranes.",Parasitic Currents Caused by Different Ionic and Electronic Conductivities in Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acsami.5b02182
5,2550,"This effect was ascribed to the simultaneously occurring electrochemical hydrogen oxidation and evolution inside the composite samples, which are driven by different proton and electron resistivities.",Parasitic Currents Caused by Different Ionic and Electronic Conductivities in Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acsami.5b02182
6,2550,"The parasitic electrochemical currents resulting were postulated to occur in the anode of fuel cells with polymer, solid oxide, or liquid alkaline electrolytes, when the ohmic drop of the ion conduction in the anode is higher with the anodic kinetic overvoltage (as illustrated in the graphical abstract).",Parasitic Currents Caused by Different Ionic and Electronic Conductivities in Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acsami.5b02182
7,2550,"In this case, the parasitic electrochemical currents increase the anodic kinetic overpotential and the ohmic drop in the anode.",Parasitic Currents Caused by Different Ionic and Electronic Conductivities in Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acsami.5b02182
8,2550,Thinner fuel cell anodes with smaller ohmic drops for the ion conduction may reduce the parasitic electrochemical currents.,Parasitic Currents Caused by Different Ionic and Electronic Conductivities in Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1021/acsami.5b02182
