1,3414,"Three methods of lowering the activation energy of the oxygen reduction reaction at solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes are reported: (i) addition of highly dispersed noble metals (less than or equal to 0.1 mg/cm(2)) at the La0.84Sr0.16MnO3 cathode/yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte interface; (ii) partial substitution of manganese by cobalt in La0.79Sr0.16MnO3 cathodes, and (iii) combination of (i) and (ii).",Catalysis of the electrochemical processes on solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02358-0
2,3414,"In the presence of palladium, the apparent activation energy, E(2), of the oxygen reduction reaction is decreased from 2.2 eV (La0.84Sr0.16MnO3 without catalyst) to 1.4 eV. A similar effect is observed, when manganese is substituted by 20 mol% Co (La0.79Sr0.16Mn0.80Co0.20O3), where E(a) approximate to 0.9 eV is obtained.",Catalysis of the electrochemical processes on solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02358-0
