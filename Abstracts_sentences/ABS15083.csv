1,15083,"A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) unit is constructed with Ni-YSZ as the anode, YSZ as the electrolyte, and La(0.6)Sr(0.4)CoO(3)-Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.95) as the cathode.",Electrochemical Enhancement of Nitric Oxide Removal from Simulated Lean-Burn Engine Exhaust via Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/es1034393
2,15083,"The SOFC operation is performed at 600 degrees C with a cathode gas simulating the lean-burn engine exhaust and at various fixed voltage, at open-circuit voltage, and with an inert gas flowing over the anode side, respectively.",Electrochemical Enhancement of Nitric Oxide Removal from Simulated Lean-Burn Engine Exhaust via Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/es1034393
3,15083,Electrochemical enhancement of NO decomposition occurs when an operating voltage is generated; higher O(2) concentration leads to higher enhancement.,Electrochemical Enhancement of Nitric Oxide Removal from Simulated Lean-Burn Engine Exhaust via Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/es1034393
4,15083,Smaller NO concentration results in larger NO conversion.,Electrochemical Enhancement of Nitric Oxide Removal from Simulated Lean-Burn Engine Exhaust via Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/es1034393
5,15083,Higher operating voltage and higher O(2) concentration can lead to both higher NO conversion and lower fuel consumption.,Electrochemical Enhancement of Nitric Oxide Removal from Simulated Lean-Burn Engine Exhaust via Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/es1034393
6,15083,The molar rate of the consumption of the anode fuel can be very much smaller than that of NO to N(2) conversion.,Electrochemical Enhancement of Nitric Oxide Removal from Simulated Lean-Burn Engine Exhaust via Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/es1034393
7,15083,This makes the anode fuel consumed in the SOFC-DeNO(x) process to be much less than the equivalent amount of ammonia consumed in the urea-based selective catalytic reduction process.,Electrochemical Enhancement of Nitric Oxide Removal from Simulated Lean-Burn Engine Exhaust via Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/es1034393
8,15083,"Additionally, the NO conversion increases with the addition of propylene and SO(2) into the cathode gas.",Electrochemical Enhancement of Nitric Oxide Removal from Simulated Lean-Burn Engine Exhaust via Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/es1034393
9,15083,These are beneficial for the application of the SOFC-DeNO(x) technology on treating diesel and other lean-burn engine exhausts.,Electrochemical Enhancement of Nitric Oxide Removal from Simulated Lean-Burn Engine Exhaust via Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/es1034393
