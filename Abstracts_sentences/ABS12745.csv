3,12745,The effect on electrochemical performance with methane fuel was then investigated at 850 degrees C after which temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was employed to measure carbon deposition.,Characterisation of electrical performance of anode supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with methane fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.019
4,12745,Results showed that carbon deposition was minimized after certain reduction conditions.,Characterisation of electrical performance of anode supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with methane fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.019
5,12745,The conclusion was that 30 min reduction at 650 degrees C with 10 ml min(-1) methane reduction flow rate led to the highest current output over 1.2 A cm(-2) at 0.5 V when the cell operated at 850 degrees C between 10 ml min(-1) and 12.5 ml min(-1) methane running flow rate.,Characterisation of electrical performance of anode supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with methane fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.019
6,12745,"From these results, it is evident that solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) performance can be substantially improved by optimising preparation, reduction and operating conditions without the need for hydrogen.",Characterisation of electrical performance of anode supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with methane fuel,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.019
