3,13101,"A thermodynamic approach and the density functional theory plus U method are combined to obtain energies relevant for SOFC conditions (T approximate to 800 degrees C, PO2 approximate to 0.2 atm).","Ab initio energetics of LaBO3(001) (B=Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.224101
4,13101,The impact of varying U-eff (U-eff=U-J) on energy and electronic structure is explored in detail and it is shown that optimal U-eff values yield significantly better agreement with experimental energies than U-eff=0 (which corresponds to the standard generalized gradient approximation).,"Ab initio energetics of LaBO3(001) (B=Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.224101
5,13101,LaBO3 oxygen vacancy formation energies are predicted to be in the order Fe>Mn>Co>Ni (where the largest implies most difficult to form a vacancy).,"Ab initio energetics of LaBO3(001) (B=Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.224101
6,13101,It is shown that (001) BO2 terminated surfaces have 1-2 eV lower vacancy formation energies and therefore far higher vacancy concentrations than the bulk.,"Ab initio energetics of LaBO3(001) (B=Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.224101
7,13101,"The stable surface species at low temperature are predicted to be the superoxide O-2(-) for B=Mn, Fe, Co and a peroxide O-2(2-) with a surface oxygen for B=Ni.","Ab initio energetics of LaBO3(001) (B=Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.224101
8,13101,Entropy effects are predicted to stabilize the monomer oxygen surface state for all B cations at higher temperatures.,"Ab initio energetics of LaBO3(001) (B=Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.224101
9,13101,Overall oxygen coverage of the (001) BO2 surface is predicted to be quite low at SOFC operating conditions.,"Ab initio energetics of LaBO3(001) (B=Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.224101
10,13101,These results will aid in understanding the oxygen reduction reaction on perovskite SOFC cathodes.,"Ab initio energetics of LaBO3(001) (B=Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.224101
