1,546,"A facile strategy was proposed to synthesize Nb-containing BaCeO3-based material, which is a potential electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), via a wet chemical route while the conventional synthesis of Nb-containing oxides relied on the solid state reaction method due to the unavailability of suitable Nb-precursors such as Nb-nitrates resulting in a less desirable fuel cell performance when used as an electrolyte.",A strategy of tailoring stable electrolyte material for high performance proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.elecom.2016.08.019
