1,15336,Etectro-catalytic activity of Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ anodes towards oxidation of H-2 and n-C4H10 fuels and carbon depositions are investigated using different Cu-Co loadings.,Study of Carbon Deposition Behavior on Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ Anodes for Direct Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300287
2,15336,Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ anode based SOFCs with YSZ as electrolyte and LSM/YSZ as cathode were prepared by tape casting and wet impregnation methods and performance was analyzed using I-V characteristics and impedance spectroscopy.,Study of Carbon Deposition Behavior on Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ Anodes for Direct Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300287
3,15336,"The Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ anodes with Cu-Co loading of 10, 15, and 25 wt.% produced power density of 60, 197, and 400 mW cm(-2) in H-2 and 190, 225, and 275 mW cm(-2) in n-C4H10 at 800 degrees C.",Study of Carbon Deposition Behavior on Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ Anodes for Direct Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300287
4,15336,The power density is increased with the increase in Cu-Co loading in Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ anodes.,Study of Carbon Deposition Behavior on Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ Anodes for Direct Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300287
5,15336,"The electrochemical impedance spectra shows less ohmic and polarization resistance for 25 wt.% Cu-Co loading in comparison to 10 and 15 wt.% Cu-Co. Scanning electron microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, shows that the carbon fibers formed hollow in nature with 70 nm size, whereas, thermal gravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction points out that they are amorphous in nature.",Study of Carbon Deposition Behavior on Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ Anodes for Direct Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300287
6,15336,The performance degradation of Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ anodes in n-C4H10 in 16 h is attributed to increasing amount of carbon deposition with which is contrary to our earlier observation in Cu-Fe/CeO2-YSZ anode.,Study of Carbon Deposition Behavior on Cu-Co/CeO2-YSZ Anodes for Direct Butane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201300287
