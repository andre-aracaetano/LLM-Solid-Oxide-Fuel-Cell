1,18806,"The oxygen nonstoichiometry of mixed conducting perovskite-structured BaxSr1-xTi1-yFeyO3-y/2+delta (BSTF) (x = 0, 0.1, 0.5 and y = 0.05, 0.35) was measured by means of thermogravimetry as a function of oxygen partial pressure, pO(2), in a temperature range typical for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode applications.",Oxygen Nonstoichiometry and Defect Chemistry of Perovskite-Structured BaxSr1-xTi1-yFeyO3-y/2+δ Solid Solutions,10.1021/cm400546z
2,18806,"With increasing Ba content, the nonstoichiometry curve was shifted to higher pO(2), indicating enhanced reducibility.",Oxygen Nonstoichiometry and Defect Chemistry of Perovskite-Structured BaxSr1-xTi1-yFeyO3-y/2+δ Solid Solutions,10.1021/cm400546z
3,18806,"Based on a defect chemical analysis of thermogravimetry derived nonstoichiometry data, the substitution of Ba for Sr on the A-site of STF was found to result in a decrease in both the reduction enthalpy and band gap energy, consistent with expectations that substitution of Sr by the larger Ba leads to a reduction in bond strength.",Oxygen Nonstoichiometry and Defect Chemistry of Perovskite-Structured BaxSr1-xTi1-yFeyO3-y/2+δ Solid Solutions,10.1021/cm400546z
4,18806,A consequent increase in minority electron density and oxygen vacancy concentration are expected to result in enhancements in oxygen surface exchange kinetics and diffusivity and thereby cathode performance.,Oxygen Nonstoichiometry and Defect Chemistry of Perovskite-Structured BaxSr1-xTi1-yFeyO3-y/2+δ Solid Solutions,10.1021/cm400546z
5,18806,"The nonstoichiometry data obtained in this study also brought to light a previous underestimation of the minority electron density, by approximately a factor of 10(3), a key parameter believed to impact cathodic performance.",Oxygen Nonstoichiometry and Defect Chemistry of Perovskite-Structured BaxSr1-xTi1-yFeyO3-y/2+δ Solid Solutions,10.1021/cm400546z
