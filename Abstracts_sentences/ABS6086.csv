4,6086,The most promising results were achieved within the system BaO-SrO-B(2)O(3)-Al(2)O(3)-Ta(2)O(5)-SiO(2).,Development of an improved devitrifiable fuel cell sealing glass I.: Bulk properties,10.1149/1.2728291
5,6086,"Additions of SrO and BaO maximize the thermal expansion of the bulk glass, achieving a coefficient of thermal expansion ranging from 10.8 to 13.9 ppm/K (200-500 degrees C).",Development of an improved devitrifiable fuel cell sealing glass I.: Bulk properties,10.1149/1.2728291
6,6086,Devitrification of the glasses yielded similar thermal expansion coefficients ranging from 10.7 to 14.4 ppm/K. The addition of Al(2)O(3) and Ta(2)O(5) allows a critical sealing viscosity to be achieved at 900 degrees C in a glass with just 6 mol % of B(2)O(3).,Development of an improved devitrifiable fuel cell sealing glass I.: Bulk properties,10.1149/1.2728291
