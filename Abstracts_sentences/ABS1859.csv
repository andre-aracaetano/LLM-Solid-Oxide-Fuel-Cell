1,1859,"This paper reports the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, NiYSZ anode and (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3 (LSM) cathode or RuO2-YSZ cathode using air oxidant or a CO2 oxidant and a H-2 fuel with 3% H2O at 600-800 degrees C.",Solid oxide fuel cell using a H2 fuel/CO2 oxidant gas system,10.2109/jcersj2.18073
2,1859,The power density was higher for air oxidant than for a CO2 oxidant.,Solid oxide fuel cell using a H2 fuel/CO2 oxidant gas system,10.2109/jcersj2.18073
3,1859,The measured power density was associated with the reduction of CO2 gas to solid carbon for the RuO2-YSZ cathode.,Solid oxide fuel cell using a H2 fuel/CO2 oxidant gas system,10.2109/jcersj2.18073
4,1859,"In the cell with the LSM cathode, a CO2 oxidant was reduced to the mixed state of CO molecules and solid carbon.",Solid oxide fuel cell using a H2 fuel/CO2 oxidant gas system,10.2109/jcersj2.18073
5,1859,The reactivity of O-2 or CO2 molecules in their mixed oxidant gas system for the YSZ cell with the LSM cathode changed drastically at 50-70 vol% CO2 in the O-2-N-2-CO2 gas system.,Solid oxide fuel cell using a H2 fuel/CO2 oxidant gas system,10.2109/jcersj2.18073
6,1859,It is possible to produce an electric power and to reduce CO2 gas into solid carbon at the same time during the operation of a solid oxide fuel cells using a CO2 oxidant.,Solid oxide fuel cell using a H2 fuel/CO2 oxidant gas system,10.2109/jcersj2.18073
