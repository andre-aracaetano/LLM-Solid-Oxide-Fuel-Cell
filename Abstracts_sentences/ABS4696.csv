2,4696,"BaCO3 nanoparticles are formed from thermal decomposition of barium acetate, Ba(Ac)(2) infiltrated to porous cathode skeleton and shows good chemical compatibility with cathode materials.",Barium carbonate nanoparticle as high temperature oxygen reduction catalyst for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.elecom.2014.12.017
3,4696,"BaCO3 nanoparticles can greatly reduce the area specific resistance (ASR) of typical SOFC cathode materials, including La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta (LSF), La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM).",Barium carbonate nanoparticle as high temperature oxygen reduction catalyst for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.elecom.2014.12.017
4,4696,"For example at 700 degrees C, ASR for LSF on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte decreases from 2.95 Omega cm(2) to 0.77 Omega cm(2) when 12.9 wt.% BaCO3 nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of the porous LSF electrode.",Barium carbonate nanoparticle as high temperature oxygen reduction catalyst for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.elecom.2014.12.017
5,4696,Impedance spectra analysis shows that the decrease in ASR mainly comes from the reduction of the low frequency resistance.,Barium carbonate nanoparticle as high temperature oxygen reduction catalyst for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.elecom.2014.12.017
