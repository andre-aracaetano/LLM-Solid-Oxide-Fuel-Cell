1,1805,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are now being seriously considered for alternate energy source because of the environmental hazards associated with the use of fossil fuels and their limited availability, As a part of the development of these fuel cells, we have synthesized a series of CuO-ZrO2 samples with varying concentration of CuO.",Synthesis and characterization of copper-stabilized zirconia as an anode material for SOFC,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00371-5
2,1805,"In this paper, we present the study of copper-stabilized zirconia as an anode material in SOFC, The role of copper oxide in stabilizing zirconia and the possible reasons for the increase in catalytic activity of the relevant composition have been discussed using the experimental data.",Synthesis and characterization of copper-stabilized zirconia as an anode material for SOFC,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00371-5
