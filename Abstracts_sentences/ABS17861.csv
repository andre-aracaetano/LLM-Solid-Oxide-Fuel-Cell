5,17861,"Thermochemical calculation and FESEM-EDX analysis also indicated that the poisoning by Cl-2 caused the fon-nation of nickel nano-particles on zirconia grains via NiCl2 (g), while the poisoning by siloxane formed segregated silica (SiO2) in porous cermet anodes.",Poisoning of SOFC anodes by various fuel impurities,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.062
