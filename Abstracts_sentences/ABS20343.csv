1,20343,"In this paper, La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-delta (LSTF0.7) composite with CeO2 is successfully prepared by infiltration method as a thin porous electrode and examined in detail as a fuel electrode for efficient reversible solid oxide cells (RSOCs) at different ratios of CO/CO2 at the temperatures of 700850 degrees C. XRD analysis indicates that the cubic perovskite LSTF0.7 is stable in CO or CO2 at high temperature and compatible with CeO2 and scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) electrolyte.",Oxide composite of La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ and CeO2 as an active fuel electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.016
