1,18322,Reversible symmetrical solid oxide cells (RS-SOCs) have attracted much attention due to their high energy conversion efficiency and fabrication simplicity.,High-Performance Sr0.95Fe0.8Mo0.1Ni0.1O3-δ Electrode for Reversible Symmetrical Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/catal13071043
2,18322,"In this study, 10% Fe was substituted with Ni in the B-site of Sr0.9Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-& delta; to enhance the electrochemical performance of H2O electrolysis.",High-Performance Sr0.95Fe0.8Mo0.1Ni0.1O3-δ Electrode for Reversible Symmetrical Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/catal13071043
3,18322,"The characterization results and theoretical calculations indicated that Ni doping decreased the adsorption and reaction energy barrier of intermediates of H2O electrolysis on the Sr0.95Fe0.8Mo0.1Ni0.1O3-& delta;'s (111) surface, which promoted the kinetics of the electrode reaction, thus fabricating electrochemical activity and resulting in higher reaction dynamics.",High-Performance Sr0.95Fe0.8Mo0.1Ni0.1O3-δ Electrode for Reversible Symmetrical Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/catal13071043
4,18322,"Consequently, a high power density of 1.145 W cm(-2) at 850 & DEG;C on a symmetrical cell was achieved in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode, and a current density of 3.995 A cm(-2) was obtained at 850 & DEG;C and 1.6 V in the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) mode, indicating the Sr0.9Fe0.8Mo0.1Ni0.1O3-& delta; oxide to be a promising SOFC electrode for power production and SOEC electrode for H-2 production.",High-Performance Sr0.95Fe0.8Mo0.1Ni0.1O3-δ Electrode for Reversible Symmetrical Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/catal13071043
