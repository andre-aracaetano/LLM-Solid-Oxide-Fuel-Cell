3,10200,"The nonstoichiometry of CeO2-x solid solutions with 20 mol% SmO1.5, 20 mol% GdO1.5 and 10 mol% CaO were investigated by isothermal coulometric titration in a zirconia cell in the temperature range from 700 to 900 degrees C and in the oxygen partial pressure range from 10(-12) to 10(-25) atm.",Nonstoichiometry and defect chemistry of ceria solid solutions,
4,10200,"The results of the 3 different compositions at 900 degrees C are comparable to those for pure ceria, At lower temperatures, purl ceria is more stable against reduction than ceria solid solutions, The dependence of nonstoichiometry on oxygen partial pressure suggests a defect model with oxygen vacancies and their associates with reduced cerium cations and dopant cations, Low oxygen nonstoichiometries of x = 0.005 to 0.008 can be expected for ceria solid solutions at 700 degrees under SOFC operating conditions.",Nonstoichiometry and defect chemistry of ceria solid solutions,
