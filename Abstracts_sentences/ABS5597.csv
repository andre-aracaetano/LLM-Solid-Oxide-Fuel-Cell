1,5597,A composite electrode composed of Pr4Ni3O10 +/-delta-Ce(0.75)Gd(0.1)Pr(0.1)5O(2-delta) (50 wt.%-50 wt.%) was thoroughly investigated in terms of the electrochemical performance as a function of microstructure.,High performance composite Pr4Ni3O10±δ-Ce0.75Gd0.1Pr0.15O2-δ solid oxide cell air electrode,10.1088/2515-7655/aceeb5
2,5597,"The electrochemical performance was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the microstructures, characterized by focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy and 3D reconstructions, were modified by changing the particle size of Pr4Ni3O10 +/-delta and the electrode thickness.",High performance composite Pr4Ni3O10±δ-Ce0.75Gd0.1Pr0.15O2-δ solid oxide cell air electrode,10.1088/2515-7655/aceeb5
