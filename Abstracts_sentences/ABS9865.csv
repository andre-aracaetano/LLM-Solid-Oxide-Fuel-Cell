1,9865,Solid-oxide fuel cells produce electric current from energy released by a spontaneous electrochemical reaction.,Theory-based design of sintered granular composites triples three-phase boundary in fuel cells,10.1103/PhysRevE.96.052903
2,9865,"The efficiency of these devices depends crucially on the microstructure of their electrodes and in particular on the three-phase boundary (TPB) length, along which the energy-producing reaction occurs.",Theory-based design of sintered granular composites triples three-phase boundary in fuel cells,10.1103/PhysRevE.96.052903
3,9865,"We present a systematic maximization of the TPB length as a function of four readily controllable microstructural parameters, for any given mean hydraulic radius, which is a conventional measure of the permeability to gas flow.",Theory-based design of sintered granular composites triples three-phase boundary in fuel cells,10.1103/PhysRevE.96.052903
4,9865,We identify the maximizing parameters and show that the TPB length can be increased by a factor of over 300% compared to current common practices.,Theory-based design of sintered granular composites triples three-phase boundary in fuel cells,10.1103/PhysRevE.96.052903
5,9865,We support this result by calculating the TPB of several numerically simulated structures.,Theory-based design of sintered granular composites triples three-phase boundary in fuel cells,10.1103/PhysRevE.96.052903
6,9865,We also compare four models for a single intergranular contact in the sintered electrode and show that the model commonly used in the literature is oversimplified and unphysical.,Theory-based design of sintered granular composites triples three-phase boundary in fuel cells,10.1103/PhysRevE.96.052903
7,9865,We then propose two alternatives.,Theory-based design of sintered granular composites triples three-phase boundary in fuel cells,10.1103/PhysRevE.96.052903
