3,5739,This work presents short-term degradation and regeneration analyses of industrial-relevant cell designs with different anode structure and sulfur tolerance fueled with synthetic product gas from wood steam gasification containing 1 to 10 ppm(v) of H2S at 750 degrees C and 800 degrees C. Full performance regeneration of both cell types was achieved in all operating points.,Analysis of H2S-related short-term degradation and regeneration of anode- and electrolyte supported solid oxide fuel cells fueled with biomass steam gasifier product gas,10.1016/j.energy.2020.119556
4,5739,The high H2O content and avoided fuel depletion may have contributed to a lower performance degradation and better regeneration of the cells.,Analysis of H2S-related short-term degradation and regeneration of anode- and electrolyte supported solid oxide fuel cells fueled with biomass steam gasifier product gas,10.1016/j.energy.2020.119556
