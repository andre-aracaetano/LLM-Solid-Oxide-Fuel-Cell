1,12563,Ferritic stainless steels at high temperature and long operating time of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) face with some problems such as overgrowth and spoliation of the surface oxide and cathode poisoning due to chromium evaporation.,Applying the protective CuMn2O4 spinel coating on AISI-430 ferritic stainless steel used as solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2017.11.036
2,12563,"In the present work in order to improve the above-mentioned problems, the protective/conductive CuMn2O4 spinel coating was created on the AISI-430 ferritic stainless steel by means of pulse electrodeposition and subsequent heat treatment.",Applying the protective CuMn2O4 spinel coating on AISI-430 ferritic stainless steel used as solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2017.11.036
3,12563,"Therefore, at first, the copper was applied to the substrate from a sulfate bath with an average current density of 48 mA/cm(2) and a deposition time of 4 min.",Applying the protective CuMn2O4 spinel coating on AISI-430 ferritic stainless steel used as solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2017.11.036
4,12563,"Subsequently, manganese was electrodeposited on the copper layer from a sulfate bath with an average current density of 125 mA/cm(2) and a deposition time of 8 min.",Applying the protective CuMn2O4 spinel coating on AISI-430 ferritic stainless steel used as solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2017.11.036
5,12563,"The frequency and duty cycle in the pulse electrodeposition of Cu and Mn Were considered100 Hz and 80%, respectively.",Applying the protective CuMn2O4 spinel coating on AISI-430 ferritic stainless steel used as solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2017.11.036
6,12563,"Then, to convert the metallic layers to spinel and also to evaluate its prevention of outward diffusion of Cr, oxidation was carried out at 750 degrees C in the air for 24 h and 100 h. Microstructural evaluation of samples cross-section by scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with EDS indicated that the cuMn(2)O(4) spinel layer acted as a barrier to outward diffusion of Cr effectively and the amount of Cr in the coating surface was zero.",Applying the protective CuMn2O4 spinel coating on AISI-430 ferritic stainless steel used as solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2017.11.036

8,12563,"By investigation of samples oxidation in the air for 0.5, 10 and 120 min at 750 degrees C, the results indicated that Mn was rapidly oxidized to MnO and Mn3O4, at the outset of the oxidation of the Cu Mn metallic coating.",Applying the protective CuMn2O4 spinel coating on AISI-430 ferritic stainless steel used as solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2017.11.036
9,12563,"Gradually, the MnO and Mn3O4 disappeared and Mn2O3 was formed and the copper was oxidized to CuO.",Applying the protective CuMn2O4 spinel coating on AISI-430 ferritic stainless steel used as solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2017.11.036
