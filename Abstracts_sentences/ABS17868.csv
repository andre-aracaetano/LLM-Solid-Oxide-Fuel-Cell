1,17868,"In this research, tubes consisting of a co-extruded dense YSZ electrolyte (similar to 10 mu m) and porous NiO-YSZ anode (similar to 200 mu m) were modified with different cathodes and anode infiltration to investigate the effects on both power and thermal cycling tolerance.",Performance of microtubular SOFCs with infiltrated electrodes under thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.10.098
2,17868,"Type of cathode (produced by infiltration of LSM into a porous YSZ matrix or by hand-painting of an LSM YSZ ink), the type of pore former used in the cathode (graphite or poly (methyl methacrylate), PMMA) and the infiltration of the anode (no infiltration, or with infiltration steps using a co-precipitated SDC (Samaria doped ceria) mixture, or Ni-SDC mixture) were investigated as variables.",Performance of microtubular SOFCs with infiltrated electrodes under thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.10.098
3,17868,"The overall aim of this work is to produce cells that are more tolerant to thermal cycling, without sacrificing power density.",Performance of microtubular SOFCs with infiltrated electrodes under thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.10.098
4,17868,"Testing at 750 degrees C with 20 mL/min of dry hydrogen shows that anode infiltration has a particularly advantageous effect on performance, raising the peak power and reducing the degradation in peak power seen after aggressive cycling (100 degrees C/min heating and cooling rates).",Performance of microtubular SOFCs with infiltrated electrodes under thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.10.098
5,17868,Cell power can be improved by LSM infiltration into a porous YSZ layer when the thickness of the YSZ layer is optimised and there is sufficient LSM.,Performance of microtubular SOFCs with infiltrated electrodes under thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.10.098
6,17868,Infiltrated cells with cathode thicknesses of 20-40 mu m functioned better than those 10-15 mu m thick despite having a similar LSM/YSZ weight ratio.,Performance of microtubular SOFCs with infiltrated electrodes under thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.10.098
7,17868,"This may be due to the additional reaction zone available as a result of the higher LSM mass, suggesting that the reaction zone extends beyond 15 mu m from the electrolyte.",Performance of microtubular SOFCs with infiltrated electrodes under thermal cycling,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.10.098
