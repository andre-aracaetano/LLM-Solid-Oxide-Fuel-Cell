1,13359,"The Ruddlesden-Popper phases, Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=1, 2, and 3), were synthesized by a solid-state reaction for use as cathodes in an intermediate-temperature (500 degrees-700 degrees C) solid oxide fuel cell.","Electrode Properties of the Ruddlesden-Popper Series, Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=1, 2, and 3), as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03743.x
2,13359,The samples crystallized into an orthorhombic layered perovskite structure.,"Electrode Properties of the Ruddlesden-Popper Series, Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=1, 2, and 3), as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03743.x
3,13359,The overall electrical conductivity increased with the increase of n in the intermediate temperature range.,"Electrode Properties of the Ruddlesden-Popper Series, Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=1, 2, and 3), as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03743.x
4,13359,"Single test-cells, which consisted of samarium-oxide-doped ceria (SDC; Sm0.2Ce0.8Ox) as an electrolyte, Ni-SDC cermet (Ni-SDC) as an anode, and Lan+1NinO3n+1 as a cathode, were fabricated for measurements of cell performance at 500 degrees-700 degrees C. Current interruption measurements revealed that both the ohmic and overpotential losses at 700 degrees C decreased with the increase of n. La4Ni3O10 was found to exhibit the best cathode characteristics in the Lan+1NinO3n+1 series.","Electrode Properties of the Ruddlesden-Popper Series, Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=1, 2, and 3), as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03743.x
5,13359,"Maximum test-cell power densities with La4Ni3O10 (n=3) were 10.2, 36.5, and 88.2 mW/cm2 at 500 degrees, 600 degrees, and 700 degrees C, respectively.","Electrode Properties of the Ruddlesden-Popper Series, Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n=1, 2, and 3), as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03743.x
