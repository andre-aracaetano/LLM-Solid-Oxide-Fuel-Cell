1,19529,"The effect of electrochemical oxygen pumping on the emission of oxygen negative ions, O-, from the surface of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was studied with a quadrupole mass spectrometer capable of detecting negative ions.",Effect of electrochemical polarization on the emission of O- ions from the surface of YSZ,10.1149/1.1611495
2,19529,It was found that O- ions are emitted into a vacuum from the YSZ surface with a porous platinum electrode.,Effect of electrochemical polarization on the emission of O- ions from the surface of YSZ,10.1149/1.1611495
3,19529,"With a potentiostat, the voltage between an air electrode and the platinum electrode on the emission surface was varied during the emission of O- ions at 925degreesC: deviation from the rest potential ranged from -750 to +150 mV. Negative ion mass analysis demonstrated that electrochemical polarization affected the emission rate of O- ions.",Effect of electrochemical polarization on the emission of O- ions from the surface of YSZ,10.1149/1.1611495
4,19529,The effect of electrochemical polarization increased with the magnitude of the polarization.,Effect of electrochemical polarization on the emission of O- ions from the surface of YSZ,10.1149/1.1611495
5,19529,"The emission of O- ions was enhanced with cathodic polarization, whereas it was reduced with anodic polarization.",Effect of electrochemical polarization on the emission of O- ions from the surface of YSZ,10.1149/1.1611495
6,19529,"Although oxygen pumping by anodic polarization enhanced the mass flow of oxygen from air into the vacuum chamber, it did not enhance the emission of O- ions.",Effect of electrochemical polarization on the emission of O- ions from the surface of YSZ,10.1149/1.1611495
7,19529,The variation in the emission rate of O- ions is due to the variation in the work function of the emission surface by electrochemical polarization.,Effect of electrochemical polarization on the emission of O- ions from the surface of YSZ,10.1149/1.1611495
