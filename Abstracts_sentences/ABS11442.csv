2,11442,"Including the chemical reaction kinetics of NH3 catalytic thermal decomposition, the present model can be used to predict the performance of the NH3 fed SOFC-H at an intermediate temperature (i.e. 773 K).",An improved electrochemical model for the NH3 fed proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.07.023
3,11442,Comparison between the simulation results using the present model and experimental data from literature validates the accuracy of this model.,An improved electrochemical model for the NH3 fed proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.07.023
4,11442,"Parametrical analyses reveal that at a high operating temperature (i.e. 1073 K), the NH3 fuel is completely decomposed to H-2 and N-2 within a very thin layer (30 mu m) near the anode surface of an SOFC-H. It is also found that operating the NH3 fed SOFC-H at an intermediate temperature of 773 K is feasible due to sufficiently high rate of NH3 decomposition.",An improved electrochemical model for the NH3 fed proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.07.023
5,11442,"However, further decreasing the temperature to 673 K is not recommended as less than 10% NH3 fuel can be decomposed to H-2 and N-2 in the SOFC-H. The effects of current density and electrode microstructure on the performance of the NH3 fed SOFC-H are also studied.",An improved electrochemical model for the NH3 fed proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.07.023
6,11442,It is found that increasing electrode porosity and pore size is beneficial to increase the partial pressure of H-2 at the anode-electrolyte interface.,An improved electrochemical model for the NH3 fed proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.07.023
