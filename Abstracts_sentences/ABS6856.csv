2,6856,"Here, the performances of NCAL cathode were investigated for low-temperature SOFCs (LT-SOFCs) on Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) electrolyte.",Partially reduced Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-δ for low-temperature SOFC cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.150
3,6856,"After on-line reduction of NCAL for 30 min, the partially reduced NCAL, i.e., NCAL(r), was employed as the new cathode and its performances were also investigated.",Partially reduced Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-δ for low-temperature SOFC cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.150
4,6856,"The area specific resistances of NCAL and NCAL(r) cathodes on SDC electrolyte are 7.076 and 1.214 Omega cm(2) at 550 degrees C, respectively.",Partially reduced Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-δ for low-temperature SOFC cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.150
5,6856,"Moreover, NCAL(r) exhibits the activation energy of 0.46 eV for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is much lower than that of NCAL (0.88 eV).",Partially reduced Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-δ for low-temperature SOFC cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.150
6,6856,"The fuel cell consisted of NCAL electrodes and SDC electrolyte shows an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.95 V and power output of 436 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C. After cathode on-line optimization, the cell's OCV and power output are significantly increased to 1.01 V and 648 mW cm(-2), which mainly attributed to the accelerated ORR and decreased electrode polarization resistance.",Partially reduced Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-δ for low-temperature SOFC cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.150
