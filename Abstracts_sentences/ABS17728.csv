1,17728,"Apatite-type oxides of general formula La9.33+x(SiO4)(6)O-2 + (3x/2) have been attracting considerable interest recently because of their observed high oxide-ion conductivity and potential use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), oxygen sensors, and ceramic membranes.",Local defect structures and ion transport mechanisms in the oxygen-excess apatite La9.67(SiO4)6O2.5,10.1021/cm801101j
2,17728,"In this paper, computer modeling techniques are used to investigate, at the atomic level, the energetics of defect formation, oxide-ion migration, and cation migration in the oxygen-excess apatite silicate, La-9.67(SiO4)(6)O-2.5.",Local defect structures and ion transport mechanisms in the oxygen-excess apatite La9.67(SiO4)6O2.5,10.1021/cm801101j
3,17728,Recent research has suggested that oxide-ion conduction in these apatite systems proceeds by an interstitial mechanism.,Local defect structures and ion transport mechanisms in the oxygen-excess apatite La9.67(SiO4)6O2.5,10.1021/cm801101j
4,17728,"Our results support this view and have revealed how the flexibility of the SiO4 substructure plays a crucial role in facilitating oxide-ion migration: the presence of interstitial oxide ions creates pseudo-SiO5 units, which can effectively pass along the c direction by oxygen transfer.",Local defect structures and ion transport mechanisms in the oxygen-excess apatite La9.67(SiO4)6O2.5,10.1021/cm801101j
5,17728,"La vacancy migration is also examined and, as expected, found to have a high energy barrier.",Local defect structures and ion transport mechanisms in the oxygen-excess apatite La9.67(SiO4)6O2.5,10.1021/cm801101j
