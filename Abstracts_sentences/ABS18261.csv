1,18261,Hydrogen production by electrolysis of seawater using a reversible solid oxide cell (rSOC) can potentially realize offshore wind power energy storage.,Reversible cycling performance of a flat-tube solid oxide cell for seawater electrolysis,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115543
2,18261,"In this work, a flat-tube solid oxide cell was used to simulate the peak shaving and valley filling aspects usually encountered with wind power, and the reversible cycle of charge and discharge of seawater electrolysis was studied.",Reversible cycling performance of a flat-tube solid oxide cell for seawater electrolysis,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115543
3,18261,"The results show that the reversible cell runs successfully for more than 1000 h with 31 cycles under the charging voltage of less than 1.22 V and the discharge voltage of higher than 0.71 V. During the reversible operation, the charging degradation rate was 0.73 mV/h and the discharge degradation rate was 0.82 mV/h.",Reversible cycling performance of a flat-tube solid oxide cell for seawater electrolysis,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115543
4,18261,The overall calculated efficiency during one reversible cycle was up to 104.9%.,Reversible cycling performance of a flat-tube solid oxide cell for seawater electrolysis,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115543
5,18261,"Under reversible cycle, the performance degradation of the cell is similar to that under constant current electrolysis, and is mainly due to the coarsening and loss of fuel electrode nickel and the partial cracking of electrolyte/air electrode interface.",Reversible cycling performance of a flat-tube solid oxide cell for seawater electrolysis,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115543
