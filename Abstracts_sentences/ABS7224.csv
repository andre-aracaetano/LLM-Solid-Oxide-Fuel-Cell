2,7224,"In this paper, a CeO2-doped (Co,Mn)(3)O-4 coating was synthesized on a Crofer 22 APU alloy substrate via electrolytic codeposition of a composite layer consisting of a Co matrix and embedded Mn3O4/CeO2 particles, followed by thermal conversion of the deposited layer in air at elevated temperatures.","CeO2-doped (Co,Mn)3O4 coatings for protecting solid oxide fuel cell interconnect alloys",10.1016/j.tsf.2015.07.085
3,7224,"After oxidation at 800 degrees C in air for 250 h, no Cr penetration was detected in both the CeO2-doped and CeO2-free spinel coatings.","CeO2-doped (Co,Mn)3O4 coatings for protecting solid oxide fuel cell interconnect alloys",10.1016/j.tsf.2015.07.085
4,7224,"However, CeO2 doping significantly reduced the Cr2O3 scale growth at the coating/substrate interface.","CeO2-doped (Co,Mn)3O4 coatings for protecting solid oxide fuel cell interconnect alloys",10.1016/j.tsf.2015.07.085
5,7224,"An area specific resistance of 8 m Omega.cm(2) at 800 degrees C was achieved for the CeO2-doped coating sample, which was much lower than that of the CeO2-free coating sample (13 m Omega.cm(2)) or the bare substrate (24 m Omega.cm(2)) at the same temperature.","CeO2-doped (Co,Mn)3O4 coatings for protecting solid oxide fuel cell interconnect alloys",10.1016/j.tsf.2015.07.085
