1,5335,Mixed ionic-electronic conductors in the family of LaxSr1-xCoyFe1-yO3-delta have been widely studied as cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,LSM-infiltrated LSCF cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S2095-4956(13)60072-8
2,5335,"However, the long-term stability was a concern.",LSM-infiltrated LSCF cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S2095-4956(13)60072-8
3,5335,Here we report our findings on the effect of a thin film coating of La0.85Sr0.15MnO3-delta (LSM) on the performance of a porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode.,LSM-infiltrated LSCF cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S2095-4956(13)60072-8
4,5335,"When the thicknesses of the LSM coatings are appropriate, an LSM-coated LSCF electrode showed better stability and lower polarization (or higher activity) than the blank LSCF cathode without LSM infiltration.",LSM-infiltrated LSCF cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S2095-4956(13)60072-8
5,5335,"An anode-supported cell with an LSM-infiltrated LSCF cathode demonstrated at 825 degrees C a peak power density of similar to 1.07 W/cm(2), about 24% higher than that of the same cell without LSM infiltration (similar to 0.86 W/cm(2)).",LSM-infiltrated LSCF cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S2095-4956(13)60072-8
6,5335,"Further, the LSM coating enhanced the stability of the electrode; there was little degradation in performance for the cell with an LSM-infiltrated LSCF cathode during 100 h operation.",LSM-infiltrated LSCF cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S2095-4956(13)60072-8
