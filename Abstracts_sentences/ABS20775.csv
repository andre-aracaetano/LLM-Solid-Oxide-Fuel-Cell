1,20775,"SrFeO(2.5) and SrCoO(2.5) are able to intercalate oxygen in a reversible topotactic redox reaction already at room temperature to form the cubic perovskites Sr(Fe,Co)O(3), while CaFeO(2.5) can only be oxidized under extreme conditions.",Lattice Dynamics To Trigger Low Temperature Oxygen Mobility in Solid Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ja806144a
2,20775,"To explain this significant difference in low temperature oxygen mobility, we investigated the homologous SrFeO(2.5) and CaFeO(2.5) by temperature dependent oxygen isotope exchange as well as by inelastic neutron scattering (INS) studies, combined with ab initio (DFT) molecular dynamical calculations.",Lattice Dynamics To Trigger Low Temperature Oxygen Mobility in Solid Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ja806144a
3,20775,From (18)O/(16)O isotope exchange experiments we proved free oxygen mobility to be realized in SrFeO(x) already below 600 K.,Lattice Dynamics To Trigger Low Temperature Oxygen Mobility in Solid Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ja806144a
4,20775,"We have also evidence that low temperature oxygen mobility relies on the existence of specific, low energy lattice modes, which trigger and amplify oxygen mobility in solids.",Lattice Dynamics To Trigger Low Temperature Oxygen Mobility in Solid Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ja806144a
5,20775,"We interpret the INS data together with the DFT-based molecular dynamical simulation results on SrFeO(2.5) and CaFeO(2.5) in terms of an enhanced, phonon-assisted, low temperature oxygen diffusion for SrFeO(3-x) as a result of the strongly reduced Fe-O-Fe bond strength of the apical oxygen atoms in the FeO(6) octahedra along the stacking axis.",Lattice Dynamics To Trigger Low Temperature Oxygen Mobility in Solid Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ja806144a
6,20775,This dynamically triggered phenomenon leads to an easy migration of the oxide ions into the open vacancy channels and vice versa.,Lattice Dynamics To Trigger Low Temperature Oxygen Mobility in Solid Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ja806144a
7,20775,"The decisive impact of lattice dynamics, giving rise to structural instabilities in oxygen deficient perovskites, especially with brown millerite-type structure, is demonstrated, opening new concepts for the design and tailoring of low temperature oxygen ion conductors.",Lattice Dynamics To Trigger Low Temperature Oxygen Mobility in Solid Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ja806144a
