1,14602,Bulk proton mobility and catalytic activity to surface oxygen reduction are the two factors for determining the effectiveness of cathode materials for protonic-solid oxide fuel cells (p-SOFCs).,First-principles study of O2 reduction on BaZr1-xCoxO3 cathodes in protonic-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta01652a
2,14602,"In this work, a mixed protonic/electronic conductor (MPEC) of BaZr0 75Co0.25O3(BZCO) was selected as a potential cathode for p-SOFCs, and its bulk proton transporting and oxygen reduction behaviours at the microscopic level were investigated using the first-principles approach.",First-principles study of O2 reduction on BaZr1-xCoxO3 cathodes in protonic-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta01652a
3,14602,"Two plausible proton migration pathways in BZCO were examined, and the highest proton migration barrier was calculated to be 0.63 eV, which agrees remarkably well with the experimental findings.",First-principles study of O2 reduction on BaZr1-xCoxO3 cathodes in protonic-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta01652a
4,14602,"Compared with the weak adsorption of oxygen on BaZrO3(100) surface, the BZCO(100) surface provides a relatively large adsorption energy of -0.64 eV, indicating that Co doping enhances the oxygen adsorption on the surface.",First-principles study of O2 reduction on BaZr1-xCoxO3 cathodes in protonic-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta01652a
5,14602,"Furthermore, an oxygen reduction reaction over the MPEC cathode surface was explored using a hydrogenated BZCO(100) surface model, where four protons are located to react with one O-2 molecule to generate two water molecules.",First-principles study of O2 reduction on BaZr1-xCoxO3 cathodes in protonic-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta01652a
6,14602,"For the formation and desorption of the first water molecule on the BZCO surface, four possible reaction pathways have been mapped.",First-principles study of O2 reduction on BaZr1-xCoxO3 cathodes in protonic-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta01652a
7,14602,The potential energy profiles indicate that the reaction with two protons simultaneously migrating to the adsorbed oxygen molecule to break the O-O bond (path-4) is the most feasible process for the formation of the first water molecule.,First-principles study of O2 reduction on BaZr1-xCoxO3 cathodes in protonic-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta01652a
8,14602,Our study presents an atomistic level understanding of oxygen reduction and proton migration over or inside the MPEC cathode for the first time.,First-principles study of O2 reduction on BaZr1-xCoxO3 cathodes in protonic-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta01652a
