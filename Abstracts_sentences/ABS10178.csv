1,10178,In situ thermal expansion and in situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) are used to investigate the dynamic process of the interaction between Ni and methane at high temperature.,New insights into carbon deposition mechanism of nickel/yttrium-stabilized zirconia cermet from methane by in situ investigation,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113910
2,10178,"Thermal expansion results show that it takes 68 min for the Ni and yttrium-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet at 650 degrees C to collapse, while it takes only 14 min at 800 degrees C when exposed to methane.",New insights into carbon deposition mechanism of nickel/yttrium-stabilized zirconia cermet from methane by in situ investigation,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113910

4,10178,"The results of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy show a large number of carbon fibers on Ni particles in methane at 650 degrees C, whereas a considerable amount of encapsulating carbon and few carbon fibers are noted at 800 degrees C. On the basis of the experimental results, the deactivation mechanisms of Ni-YSZ cermet in methane at 650 degrees C and 800 degrees C are elucidated, respectively.",New insights into carbon deposition mechanism of nickel/yttrium-stabilized zirconia cermet from methane by in situ investigation,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113910
