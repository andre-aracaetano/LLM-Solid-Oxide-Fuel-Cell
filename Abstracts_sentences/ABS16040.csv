1,16040,"Oxide catalysts with alkaline earth metal dopants, such as Sr2+ and Ba2+, are widely applied as cathode materials in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).","CO2-tolerant (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)4O7 cathodes with low thermal expansion for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta01338e
2,16040,"However, one of the irreversible performance degradation mechanisms is the formation of BaCO3 and SrCO3 on the cathode surface when CO2 in air reacts with the cathode.","CO2-tolerant (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)4O7 cathodes with low thermal expansion for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta01338e
3,16040,"This study presents a series of CO2-tolerant swedenborgite oxides (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)(4)O7+ with high catalytic activity and relatively low thermal expansion coefficients (TECs, 9.2-10.2 x 10(-6) K-1).","CO2-tolerant (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)4O7 cathodes with low thermal expansion for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta01338e
4,16040,The doping effect of Tb and Ga on the phase stability in air and CO2-containing air is comprehensively investigated.,"CO2-tolerant (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)4O7 cathodes with low thermal expansion for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta01338e
5,16040,"Unlike the >500% increase in area-specific resistance (ASR) of Co-containing perovskite oxides exposed to 5% CO2 in air in the literature, the ASRs of (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)(4)O7+-Gd-doped ceria (GDC) composite cathodes only increase by approximate to 120% at 600 degrees C.","CO2-tolerant (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)4O7 cathodes with low thermal expansion for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta01338e
6,16040,"In addition, the ASRs recover to their initial values after switching the gas back to pure air within 1 h, indicating good CO2 tolerance and recovery capability.","CO2-tolerant (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)4O7 cathodes with low thermal expansion for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta01338e
7,16040,"The low number of oxygen vacancies in (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)(4)O7+ might explain the high CO2 tolerance compared to Co-containing perovskite materials.","CO2-tolerant (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)4O7 cathodes with low thermal expansion for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta01338e
8,16040,"Furthermore, a high electrochemical performance of 1.17 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C is demonstrated with an anode-supported single cell and Y0.5Tb0.5BaCo3.2Ga0.8O7+-GDC composite cathode.","CO2-tolerant (Y,Tb)Ba(Co,Ga)4O7 cathodes with low thermal expansion for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta01338e
