1,7775,This work deals with the design and off-design performance evaluation of an anodic recirculation system based on ejector technology for solid oxide fuel cell hybrid applications.,Ejector performance influence on a solid oxide fuel cell anodic recirculation system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.034
2,7775,"The analysis presented here has been divided into three parts: (i) ejector design taking into account all the thermodynamic, fluid dynamic and chemical constraints, such as steam to carbon ratio (two ejector geometries have been considered: constant area mixing section, constant pressure mixing section); (ii) stand-alone ejector design and off-design performance analysis; (iii) influence on the whole hybrid system-SOFC, reformer, anode recirculation-design and off-design performance of the ejector primary flow conditions (hybrid system part-load conditions).",Ejector performance influence on a solid oxide fuel cell anodic recirculation system,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.034
