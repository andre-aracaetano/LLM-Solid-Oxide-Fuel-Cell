1,3850,"NiFe alloy (NFA) nanoparticles decorated Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) type layered perovskite structure Pr0.8Sr1.2(NiFe)O4-delta (RP-PSNF) have been fabricated by in-situ reduction of cubic perovskite Pr0.32Sr0.48Ni0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (P-PSNF) in H-2 at 800 degrees C. When used as the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode material, the RP-PSNF-NFA based ceramic anode demonstrates a comparable catalytic activity to Ni-based anode.",In-situ exsolved NiFe alloy nanoparticles on Pr0.8Sr1.2(NiFe)O4-δ for direct hydrocarbon fuel solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.250
2,3850,"The SOFC single cell with RP-PSNF-NFA-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (GDC) anode exhibits a maximum power density of 983 and 770 mW cm(-2) in humidified H-2 and C3H8 at 800 degrees C, respectively.",In-situ exsolved NiFe alloy nanoparticles on Pr0.8Sr1.2(NiFe)O4-δ for direct hydrocarbon fuel solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.250
3,3850,"More importantly, the single cell shows a high durability at the current density of 250 mA cm(-2) in humidified C3H8 at 800 degrees C, demonstrating an excellent coking resistance.",In-situ exsolved NiFe alloy nanoparticles on Pr0.8Sr1.2(NiFe)O4-δ for direct hydrocarbon fuel solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.250
