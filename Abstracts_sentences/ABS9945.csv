6,9945,"The simultaneous segregation of Fe and Ni from La0.3Sr0.55Ti0.95-xNi0.05FexO3 +/- (x 0.05) was investigated by temperature programmed reduction, X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy and catalytic tests after multiple redox cycles.",Segregation of Nickel/Iron Bimetallic Particles from Lanthanum Doped Strontium Titanates to Improve Sulfur Stability of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.3390/catal9040332
7,9945,"It is shown that catalytic properties of the active phase were affected likely by the segregation of Ni/Fe alloy particles and that the reversible segregation of Ni persisted, while it was limited in the case of Fe under the same conditions.",Segregation of Nickel/Iron Bimetallic Particles from Lanthanum Doped Strontium Titanates to Improve Sulfur Stability of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.3390/catal9040332
