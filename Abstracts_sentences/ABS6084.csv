3,6084,"More interestingly though the ZnO SrTiO3 is a semiconducting system, it could be used as an electrolyte in the low temperature solid oxide fuel cell without electronic conducting short circuiting problem.",The synthesis of ZnO/SrTiO3 composite for high-efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen and electricity conversion,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.206
4,6084,"This device displayed an open circuit voltage of 1.14 V and reached the maximum power density of 564 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C. These results are attributed to the enhanced separation of the charge-hole pairs by the heterogeneous structure of ZnO SrTiO3 nano composites, which possess obvious both heterogeneously ionic and semiconduction.",The synthesis of ZnO/SrTiO3 composite for high-efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen and electricity conversion,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.206
