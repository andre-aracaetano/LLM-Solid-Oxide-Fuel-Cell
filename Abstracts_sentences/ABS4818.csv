1,4818,"Planar single solid oxide fuel cells with a 50 x 50 x 0.2 mm electrolyte were investigated in order to identify constituents which contributed voltage loss during discharge, a study of 250 cells showed that voltage loss during discharge could be attributed chiefly to IR resistance which consists of material resistance of the cell, contact resistance and unknown resistance, Under a discharge condition of 80% fuel utilization and current density of 0.31 A/cm(2), it was estimated that activation polarization accounted for approximately 21% of voltage loss, diffusion polarization accounted for approximately 7%, and that IR resistance accounted for approximately 72% of the loss.",Polarization analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.624
2,4818,"Additional studies showed that a cell used with hydrogen fuel has an electrical efficiency of 45%, when the power density is 0.18 W/cm(2) and a cell used with methane fuel has a 50% efficiency at 0.16 W/cm(2).",Polarization analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.624
3,4818,"Thus, it was concluded that cell performance could be improved with the reduction of IR resistance.",Polarization analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.624
