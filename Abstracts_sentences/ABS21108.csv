2,21108,"In the process, Al2O3 from the base glass was gradually substituted by K2Cr2O7, which considerably tuned the crystallization characteristics, microstructure, thermal, and mechanical properties.",Cr+6 Controlled Nucleation in SiO2-MgO-Al2O3-K2O-B2O3-F Glass Sealant (SOFC),10.3389/fmats.2020.00057
3,21108,The distinctive feature of this study is the induction of nucleation and crystallization in glass matrix on addition of Cr6+ content performing only annealing heat-treatment (600 degrees C).,Cr+6 Controlled Nucleation in SiO2-MgO-Al2O3-K2O-B2O3-F Glass Sealant (SOFC),10.3389/fmats.2020.00057
4,21108,"The melt-quenched SiO2-MgO-Al2O3-B2O3-K2O-F glass with zero Cr6+ content is found amorphous, which in presence of Cr6+ content became crystalline with MgCr2O4, K3CrF6, MgF2, and mullite (3Al(2)O(3).2SiO(2)) phases.",Cr+6 Controlled Nucleation in SiO2-MgO-Al2O3-K2O-B2O3-F Glass Sealant (SOFC),10.3389/fmats.2020.00057
5,21108,"Glassy features in DSC and dilatometric thermal properties (T-g, T-d, thermal expansion) were attained in glass without Cr- content, but glass-ceramic-like features obtained for Cr- containing glasses.",Cr+6 Controlled Nucleation in SiO2-MgO-Al2O3-K2O-B2O3-F Glass Sealant (SOFC),10.3389/fmats.2020.00057
6,21108,"Large thermal expansion (>11 x 10(-6)/K) was achieved for such glasses, and that is compatible with the CTE of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) components (electrode, interconnect, etc.) at the operating temperature (700-900 degrees C).",Cr+6 Controlled Nucleation in SiO2-MgO-Al2O3-K2O-B2O3-F Glass Sealant (SOFC),10.3389/fmats.2020.00057
7,21108,FESEM study revealed the development of 200-500 nm sized crystallites in 2 mol% K2Cr2O7-containing glass microstructure and that became more compact sorted with 10-50 mu m sized crystals in higher Cr-doped glasses.,Cr+6 Controlled Nucleation in SiO2-MgO-Al2O3-K2O-B2O3-F Glass Sealant (SOFC),10.3389/fmats.2020.00057
8,21108,"Higher crystallinity was thus ascertained for higher Cr-containing glasses, which influenced the corresponding density and mechanical properties.",Cr+6 Controlled Nucleation in SiO2-MgO-Al2O3-K2O-B2O3-F Glass Sealant (SOFC),10.3389/fmats.2020.00057
9,21108,"From nano-indentation measurements, the hardness and Young's modulus were estimated to be 0.6 (+/- 0.5) and 25 (+/- 10) GPa, respectively, for base glass and in the range of 3.3 to 8.4 and 58 to 94 GPa, respectively, for Cr-containing glass-ceramics.",Cr+6 Controlled Nucleation in SiO2-MgO-Al2O3-K2O-B2O3-F Glass Sealant (SOFC),10.3389/fmats.2020.00057
