2,21026,"In this study, nickel and titanium doubly doped lanthanum strontium chromites are developed and the effects of nickel and titanium co-doping of the chromite perovskite La0.85Sr0.15Cr1-2yNiyTiyO3-delta (0.05 <= y <= 0.3) on the electrical conductivity, chemical stability, microstructure, density, thermal expansion and electrochemical performance are measured.",Nickel and titanium doubly doped lanthanum strontium chromite for high temperature electrochemical devices,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.11.111
3,21026,Density and the electrical conductivity increases with nickel concentration whereas Sr-segregation on the surface of La0.85Sr0.15Cr1-2yNiyTiyO3-delta has been observed for y >= 0.2 and is associated with reduction in the electrical conductivity.,Nickel and titanium doubly doped lanthanum strontium chromite for high temperature electrochemical devices,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.11.111
4,21026,"For y = 0.1, La0.85Sr0.15Cr1-2yNiyTiyO3-delta shows the highest electrical conductivity in air and reducing atmosphere (PO2 similar to 10(-24) atm).",Nickel and titanium doubly doped lanthanum strontium chromite for high temperature electrochemical devices,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.11.111
5,21026,The conductivity of La0.85Sr0.15Cr1-2yNiyTiyO3-delta (y = 0.1) in reducing atmosphere (3.58 S cm(-1) at 950 degrees C) also remains higher than the most widely investigated compositions such as (La0.75Sr0.25)(0.95)Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (2.81 S Cm-1) and (La0.75Sr0.25)(0.95)Cr0.7Fe0.3O3-delta (1.41 S cm(-1)).,Nickel and titanium doubly doped lanthanum strontium chromite for high temperature electrochemical devices,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.11.111
6,21026,"Smaller deviation in the oxygen stoichiometry is similarly observed for La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.8Ni0.1Ti0.1O3-delta (delta = 0.011) when compared to La0.75Sr0.25CrO3-delta (delta = 0.091), La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (delta = 0.175) and La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (delta = 0.148) at 1000 degrees C and similar to 10(-24) atm.",Nickel and titanium doubly doped lanthanum strontium chromite for high temperature electrochemical devices,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.11.111
7,21026,Highest electrochemical performance and structural interfacial stability is obtained for new composition La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.8Ni0.1Ti0.1O3-delta (LSCNT0.1) when mixed with 8YSZ in both oxidizing and reducing atmosphere.,Nickel and titanium doubly doped lanthanum strontium chromite for high temperature electrochemical devices,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.11.111
