1,12203,We have investigated the property of a Fe-Cr-Al-type stainless steel as a porous alloy substrate for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) especially on the cathode side.,Decrease in electrical resistance of surface oxide of iron-chromium-aluminium alloy by La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 coating and heat treatment for the application of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.096
2,12203,We found that the microstructure and electrical resistance of the surface oxide layer of the alloy changes depending on the heat-treatment conditions.,Decrease in electrical resistance of surface oxide of iron-chromium-aluminium alloy by La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 coating and heat treatment for the application of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.096
3,12203,A relatively low electrical resistance was obtained when the porous alloy substrate was coated with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) and heat treated at 700-800 degrees C in air.,Decrease in electrical resistance of surface oxide of iron-chromium-aluminium alloy by La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 coating and heat treatment for the application of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.096
4,12203,The morphology of the surface oxide layer observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy was a columnar structure of gamma-Al2O3 polycrystal and Sr3Al2O6 growing outward in the same direction.,Decrease in electrical resistance of surface oxide of iron-chromium-aluminium alloy by La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 coating and heat treatment for the application of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.096
