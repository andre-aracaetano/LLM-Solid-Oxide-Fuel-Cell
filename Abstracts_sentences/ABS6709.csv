1,6709,"In this work, Cu-CeO2 co-impregnated 8 mol.% Y2O3-ZrO2 (YSZ) has been synthesized and characterized as an integrated catalyst layer for methanol-fueled Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Direct power generation from methanol by solid oxide fuel cells with a Cu-ceria based catalyst layer,10.10161/j.renene.2022.05.089
2,6709,"With the addition of the integrated catalyst layer, single cell fueled by methanol demonstrates 55.2% reduction of polarization resistance (from 0.67 to 0.30 Omega.cm(2)) and 42.32% incensement of peak power density (from 501 to 713 mW.cm(-2)) at 800 degrees C. Moreover, under constant current output mode, the cell with an integrated catalyst layer exhibits good stability for more than 45 h. The enhanced electrochemical performance proves that the integrated catalyst layer is helpful to catalytic the methanol fuel for Ni-YSZ anode-supported SOFCs.",Direct power generation from methanol by solid oxide fuel cells with a Cu-ceria based catalyst layer,10.10161/j.renene.2022.05.089
