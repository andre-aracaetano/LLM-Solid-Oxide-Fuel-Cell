3,18702,"Herein, an electrochemically engineered direct conversion process of ethane to produce hydrogen and ethylene using a planar protonic ceramic membrane reactor with a bifunctional three-dimensional catalytic electrode is reported, with a single-pass ethane conversion of 40% and ethylene yield of 26.7% at 550 degrees C. Compared with the industrial ethane steam cracking, this method saves process energy input by 45.1% and improves process energy efficiency by 50.6%, based on comprehensive process simulation using Aspen Plus software.","Electrochemically Engineered, Highly Energy-Efficient Conversion of Ethane to Ethylene and Hydrogen below 550 째C in a Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cell",10.1021/acscatal.1c03351
