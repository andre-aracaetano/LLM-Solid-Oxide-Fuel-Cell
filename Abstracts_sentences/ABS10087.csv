1,10087,"A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack requires metallic interconnects to electrically connect unit cells, while preventing fuel from mixing with oxidant During SOFC operations, chromia scales continue to grow on the interconnect surfaces, resulting m a considerable increase of interfacial resistance, and at the same time, gaseous Cr species released from the chromia scales degrades the cathode performance To address these problems, in this study, protective Mn2CuO4 coatings are fabricated on metallic interconnects (Crofer 22 APU) via a plasma spray (PS) process.",Protective coating based on manganese-copper oxide for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects: Plasma spray coating and performance evaluation,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.220
