1,5667,"This work deals with the design, the characterization, and testing of a novel glass-ceramic to be used as sealant for planar solid oxide fuel cells and its compatibility with Mn1.5Co1.5O4-coated Crofer22APU.",Novel Glass-Ceramic Composition as Sealant for SOFCs,10.1111/jace.13219
2,5667,"Thermal, sintering, and crystallization behavior and thermo mechanical properties of the sealant are reviewed and discussed, indicating therefore that these compositions can be deposited at 850 degrees C and provide an excellent compatibility with both the Mn1.5Co1.5O4-coated Crofer22APU and the anode-supported electrolyte.",Novel Glass-Ceramic Composition as Sealant for SOFCs,10.1111/jace.13219
3,5667,"In particular, Mn1.5Co1.5O4-coated Crofer22APU/sealant/anode-supported-electrolyte joined samples have been submitted to thermal tests (in air atmosphere) from RT to 800 degrees C (SOFC operating temperature) up to 500h.",Novel Glass-Ceramic Composition as Sealant for SOFCs,10.1111/jace.13219
4,5667,"No interactions, cracks formation, or failure were observed at the Mn1.5Co1.5O4-coated Crofer22APU/sealant interface and between the glass-ceramic and the anode-supported-electrolyte after 500h of thermal tests in air atmosphere.",Novel Glass-Ceramic Composition as Sealant for SOFCs,10.1111/jace.13219
