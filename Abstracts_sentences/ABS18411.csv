1,18411,"In this study, a (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 protective layer was prepared on the C276, Crofer22 APU, SUS304, and SUS430 alloys by the atmospheric plasma spraying technique (APS).",Plasma-Sprayed LSM Protective Coating on Metallic Interconnect of SOFC,10.3390/coatings7120226
2,18411,The oxidation behavior and electrical property of these metal alloys have been investigated isothermally at 800 degrees C in air for up to 300 h. Results showed that the ferritic steels transform into MnCr2O4 spinels and a Cr2O3 layer during isothermal oxidation.,Plasma-Sprayed LSM Protective Coating on Metallic Interconnect of SOFC,10.3390/coatings7120226
3,18411,"The C276 alloy formed NiCr2O4 and FeCr2O4 layers; these are protective and act as an effective barrier against chromium migration into the outer oxide layer, and the alloy demonstrated good oxidation resistance and a reasonable match to the coefficient of thermal expansion of the substrate and a low-oxide scale area-specific resistance.",Plasma-Sprayed LSM Protective Coating on Metallic Interconnect of SOFC,10.3390/coatings7120226
4,18411,"The ASR effects on the formation of oxide scale have been investigated, and the ASR of coated samples was below 0.024 W x cm(2).",Plasma-Sprayed LSM Protective Coating on Metallic Interconnect of SOFC,10.3390/coatings7120226
5,18411,It has good electrical conductivity for SOFC in long-term use.,Plasma-Sprayed LSM Protective Coating on Metallic Interconnect of SOFC,10.3390/coatings7120226
