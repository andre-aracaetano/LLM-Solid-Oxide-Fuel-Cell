2,38,The selection of the reforming process depends on the fuel and the type of the fuel cell.,Fuel processors for fuel cell APU applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.026
3,38,"For vehicle power trains, liquid hydrocarbons like gasoline, kerosene, and diesel are utilized and, therefore, they will also be the fuel for the respective APU systems.",Fuel processors for fuel cell APU applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.026
4,38,"The fuel cells commonly envisioned for mobile APU applications are molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC), solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC).",Fuel processors for fuel cell APU applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.026
5,38,"Since high-temperature fuel cells, e.g. MCFCs or SOFCs, can be supplied with a feed gas that contains carbon monoxide (CO) their fuel processor does not require reactors for CO reduction and removal.",Fuel processors for fuel cell APU applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.026
6,38,"For PEMFCs on the other hand, CO concentrations in the feed gas must not exceed 50 ppm, better 20 ppm, which requires additional reactors downstream of the reforming reactor.",Fuel processors for fuel cell APU applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.026
