4,16349,"S cm(-1) was measured in air at 800 degrees C for CMCuO, which is nearly 10 times higher than that reported for CMO.","Mo,Cu-doped CeO2 as Anode Material of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) using Syngas as Fuel",10.33961/jecst.2020.01571
5,16349,"This increase was associated with the inclusion of copper into the crystal lattice of ceria and the presence of Cu and Cu2O as secondary phases in the CMCuO structure, which also could explain the increase in the charge transfer activities of the CMCuO based anode for the hydrogen and carbon monoxide electro-oxidation processes compared to the CMO based anode.","Mo,Cu-doped CeO2 as Anode Material of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) using Syngas as Fuel",10.33961/jecst.2020.01571
