1,18480,"Conductive La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) layers with a thickness of similar to 10 mu m were deposited on ferritic stainless steel (SS) by the aerosol deposition method, for use as an oxidation resistance-coating layer in the metallic interconnector of a solid oxide fuel cell.",Oxidation resistance coating of LSM and LSCF on SOFC metallic interconnects by the aerosol deposition process,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01641.x
2,18480,"The coated layers were fairly dense without pores or cracks, and maintained good adhesion even after oxidation at 800 degrees C for 100 h. The surface of the bare SS after annealing at 800 degrees C for 100 h was covered with Cr2O3 and Fe3O4 oxide scales, and the electrical conductivity was sharply decreased.",Oxidation resistance coating of LSM and LSCF on SOFC metallic interconnects by the aerosol deposition process,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01641.x
3,18480,"However, the LSM- and LSCF-coated SSs showed a surface microstructure with almost no oxidation and maintained good electrical conductivity after annealing at 800 degrees C for 100 h. The area-specific resistance (ASR) of LSM- and LSCF-coated alloys after 100 h of oxidation at 800 degrees C was 20.6 and 11.7 m Omega.cm(2), respectively.",Oxidation resistance coating of LSM and LSCF on SOFC metallic interconnects by the aerosol deposition process,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01641.x
