1,12056,Isothermal grain growth experiments have been conducted for undoped as well as cobalt oxide doped CeO2 and Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (CGO20).,Grain growth of micron-sized grains in undoped and cobalt oxide doped ceria solid solutions,10.2109/jcersj.114.963
2,12056,"Due to the solute drag effect of the dissolved gadolinium ions, the grain boundary mobility of CGO20 was significantly lower than that one of CeO2.",Grain growth of micron-sized grains in undoped and cobalt oxide doped ceria solid solutions,10.2109/jcersj.114.963
3,12056,The addition of cobalt oxide increases the grain boundary mobility of CGO20.,Grain growth of micron-sized grains in undoped and cobalt oxide doped ceria solid solutions,10.2109/jcersj.114.963
4,12056,This increase is assigned to the formation of a characteristic cobalt oxide rich grain boundary film.,Grain growth of micron-sized grains in undoped and cobalt oxide doped ceria solid solutions,10.2109/jcersj.114.963
5,12056,"In undoped and cobalt oxide doped CGO20, a transition from regular grain growth at high temperature in micron-sized grains to self-limited grain growth at low temperature in nanometer-sized grains occurs.",Grain growth of micron-sized grains in undoped and cobalt oxide doped ceria solid solutions,10.2109/jcersj.114.963
6,12056,"As a consequence, highly stable microstructures result at lower temperatures.",Grain growth of micron-sized grains in undoped and cobalt oxide doped ceria solid solutions,10.2109/jcersj.114.963
7,12056,It is suggested that strain in amorphous grain boundary films becomes important for the self limited grain growth for very small grains at low temperatures.,Grain growth of micron-sized grains in undoped and cobalt oxide doped ceria solid solutions,10.2109/jcersj.114.963
