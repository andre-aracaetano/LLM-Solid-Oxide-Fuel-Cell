1,17207,Anode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were manufactured by a novel method using aqueous electrophoretic deposition (EPD).,Anode-supported micro-tubular SOFCs made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.057
2,17207,"The process of these micro-tubular SOFCs included consecutive aqueous EPDs of porous anode layer (NiO-YSZ), dense electrolyte layer (yttria-stabilized zirconia, YSZ) and porous cathode layer (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, LSM) onto a thin wire electrode (e.g., a Cu wire), followed by stripping, drying, and a single co-sintering.",Anode-supported micro-tubular SOFCs made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.057
3,17207,"The microstructure of the micro-tubular SOFC, including the thickness and porosity of each layer, was controlled by the processing parameters such as solid loading, current density, deposition time, and sintering temperature.",Anode-supported micro-tubular SOFCs made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.057
4,17207,The electrochemical performance of such a micro-tubular SOFC was demonstrated by the V-I-P (voltage current power) measurement.,Anode-supported micro-tubular SOFCs made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.057
