1,1765,"YSZ based anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were prepared, and two cells with different electrolyte thicknesses were connected in series for the simulation of a cell-imbalanced fuel cell stack.",Improving the Stability of Series-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Modifying the Electrolyte Composition,10.33961/jecst.2020.01396
2,1765,Pure YSZ cells in a series connection exhibited a rapid degradation when a thick electrolyte cell was operated under a negative voltage.,Improving the Stability of Series-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Modifying the Electrolyte Composition,10.33961/jecst.2020.01396
3,1765,"On the other hand, ceria added-YSZ cells in a series connection were stable under similar operating conditions, and the power density and impedance were about the same as those before tests.",Improving the Stability of Series-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Modifying the Electrolyte Composition,10.33961/jecst.2020.01396
4,1765,The improved stability was due to the reduction of internal partial pressure in the electrolyte by locally increasing the electronic conduction.,Improving the Stability of Series-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Modifying the Electrolyte Composition,10.33961/jecst.2020.01396
5,1765,"Thus, we propose a new protection method, i.e., the local addition of ceria in the YSZ electrolyte, to extend the lifetime of a cell-imbalanced SOFC stack.",Improving the Stability of Series-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Modifying the Electrolyte Composition,10.33961/jecst.2020.01396
