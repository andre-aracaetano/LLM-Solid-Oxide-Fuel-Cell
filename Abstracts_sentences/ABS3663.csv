1,3663,"La-0.5(Ba0.75Ca0.25)(0.5)Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, a simple perovskite cathode material with high electrical conductivity (940 S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C) and impressive surface catalytic activity, was prepared and used in proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells.",High-performance La0.5(Ba0.75Ca0.25)0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.01.014
2,3663,"As its thermal expansion coefficient is higher than that of the electrolyte material BaZr0.1Ce 0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta, they were combined and used as a composite cathode.",High-performance La0.5(Ba0.75Ca0.25)0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.01.014
3,3663,"The crystal structure, chemical compatibility, electrical conductivity, cell performance, and the oxygen reduction reaction of the cathode material were explored, and we found that the single fuel cell developed with the composite cathode achieved excellent electrochemical performance, with both a low polarization resistance and high peak power density (0.044 Omega cm(2) and 1102 mW cm(-2 )at 750 degrees C, respectively).",High-performance La0.5(Ba0.75Ca0.25)0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.01.014
