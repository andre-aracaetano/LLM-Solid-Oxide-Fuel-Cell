4,19987,The results show that the conductivity of SFN in H-2/H2O (80 vol% H2O) atmosphere (2.215 S cm(-1) at 850 degrees C) is much higher than that in air (0.049 S cm(-1) at 850 degrees C).,Sr2FeNbO6 Applied in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell as the Hydrogen Electrode: Kinetic Studies by Comparison with Ni-YSZ,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.11.078
5,19987,"The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement results indicate that, compared with Ni-YSZ, SFN-YSZ is more suitable for high temperature steam electrolysis as the hydrogen electrode.",Sr2FeNbO6 Applied in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell as the Hydrogen Electrode: Kinetic Studies by Comparison with Ni-YSZ,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.11.078
6,19987,"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis suggests that the surface of SFN can also be one of the electrode reaction places besides the triple phase boundary (TPB), which greatly accelerates the reaction process, lowers the energy barrier of the charge transfer process and results in a better performance of SFN-YSZ than Ni-YSZ in the SOEC mode.",Sr2FeNbO6 Applied in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell as the Hydrogen Electrode: Kinetic Studies by Comparison with Ni-YSZ,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.11.078
