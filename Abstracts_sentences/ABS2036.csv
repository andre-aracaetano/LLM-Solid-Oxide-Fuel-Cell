1,2036,The precise estimation of chemical equilibrium state is highly crucial when simulating electrochemical and thermodynamic aspects of oxygen ion-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Thermo-electrochemical modeling of oxygen ion-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with internal steam reforming in the water-energy nexus,10.1016/j.nexus.2022.100057
2,2036,"One way to determine the equilibrium state of an internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell system is to compute the total Gibbs free energy of the system (G) and then, adjust the molar amounts of each substance, subject to element balances, so as to minimize G. Multidimensional optimization algorithms can be used for this purpose.",Thermo-electrochemical modeling of oxygen ion-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with internal steam reforming in the water-energy nexus,10.1016/j.nexus.2022.100057
