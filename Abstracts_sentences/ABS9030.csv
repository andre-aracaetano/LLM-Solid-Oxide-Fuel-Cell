1,9030,We have investigated the behavior of an operating solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with supplying a simulated syngas to develop diagnosis method of the SOFC for marine power applications fueled with liquefied natural gas (LNG).,Real-time electrochemical impedance spectroscopy diagnosis of the solid oxide fuel cell for marine power applications,10.1007/s00231-017-2215-0
2,9030,We analyze the characteristics of a syngas-fueled intermediate temperature microtubular SOFC at 500 degrees C for accelerated deterioration by carbon deposition as a model case by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to in-situ find parameters useful for the real-time diagnosis.,Real-time electrochemical impedance spectroscopy diagnosis of the solid oxide fuel cell for marine power applications,10.1007/s00231-017-2215-0
3,9030,EIS analyses are performed by complex nonlinear least squares (CNLS) curve fitting to measured impedance spectra with an equivalent electric circuit model consisting of several resistances and capacitances attributed to the anode and cathode processes as well as Ohmic resistance of the cell.,Real-time electrochemical impedance spectroscopy diagnosis of the solid oxide fuel cell for marine power applications,10.1007/s00231-017-2215-0
