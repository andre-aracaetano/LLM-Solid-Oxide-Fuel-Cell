1,12911,"La-doped Sr2-xLaxFe1.5Mo0.5O6-$ perovskite oxides are synthesized and used as a symmetric electrode to evaluate the effect of La on the crystal structure, conductivity, and catalytic activity for O2 reduction and H2 oxidation reaction.",Electrochemical performance of Sr1.9La0.1Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-d symmetric electrode for solid oxide fuel cells with carbon-based fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.038
2,12911,"The electronic doping effect dominates the oversize effect in Sr2-xLaxFe1.5Mo0.5O6-$ oxide, resulting in unit cell volume expansion and decreased conductivity in air.",Electrochemical performance of Sr1.9La0.1Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-d symmetric electrode for solid oxide fuel cells with carbon-based fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.038
3,12911,"In addition, the introduction of La increases the chemical structural stability of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-$ in reducing condition due to the higher La -O bond compared with Sr-O bond, leading to high catalytic activity for the H2 oxidation reaction.",Electrochemical performance of Sr1.9La0.1Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-d symmetric electrode for solid oxide fuel cells with carbon-based fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.038
4,12911,"At 800 degrees C, the Rp values of Sr1.9La0.1Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-$ symmetric cell in air and wet H2 are as low as 0.075 and 0.21 U cm2, respectively.",Electrochemical performance of Sr1.9La0.1Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-d symmetric electrode for solid oxide fuel cells with carbon-based fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.038
5,12911,"Moreover, the peak power densities of 769, 561, 439, and 653 mW cm-2 at 850 degrees C are obtained when wet H2, CO, CH4, and C3H8 are used as fuels on Sr1.9La0.1Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-$/LSGM/Sr1.9La0.1Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-$ cell.",Electrochemical performance of Sr1.9La0.1Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-d symmetric electrode for solid oxide fuel cells with carbon-based fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.038
