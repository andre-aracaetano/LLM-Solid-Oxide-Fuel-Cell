1,20294,Solid oxide fuel cells need a diffusion barrier layer to protect the zirconia-based electrolyte if a cobalt-containing cathode material like lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) is used.,Annealing of Gadolinium-Doped Ceria (GDC) Films Produced by the Aerosol Deposition Method,10.3390/ma11112072
2,20294,This protective layer must prevent the direct contact and interdiffusion of both components while still retaining the oxygen ion transport.,Annealing of Gadolinium-Doped Ceria (GDC) Films Produced by the Aerosol Deposition Method,10.3390/ma11112072
3,20294,Gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) meets these requirements.,Annealing of Gadolinium-Doped Ceria (GDC) Films Produced by the Aerosol Deposition Method,10.3390/ma11112072
4,20294,"However, for a favorable cell performance, oxide ion conducting films that are thin yet dense are required.",Annealing of Gadolinium-Doped Ceria (GDC) Films Produced by the Aerosol Deposition Method,10.3390/ma11112072
5,20294,"Films with a thickness in the sub-micrometer to micrometer range were produced by the dry room temperature spray-coating technique, aerosol deposition.",Annealing of Gadolinium-Doped Ceria (GDC) Films Produced by the Aerosol Deposition Method,10.3390/ma11112072
6,20294,"Since commercially available GDC powders are usually optimized for the sintering of screen printed films or pressed bulk samples, their particle morphology is nanocrystalline with a high surface area that is not suitable for aerosol deposition.",Annealing of Gadolinium-Doped Ceria (GDC) Films Produced by the Aerosol Deposition Method,10.3390/ma11112072
7,20294,"Therefore, different thermal and mechanical powder pretreatment procedures were investigated and linked to the morphology and integrity of the sprayed films.",Annealing of Gadolinium-Doped Ceria (GDC) Films Produced by the Aerosol Deposition Method,10.3390/ma11112072
8,20294,"Only if a suitable pretreatment was conducted, dense and well-adhering GDC films were deposited.",Annealing of Gadolinium-Doped Ceria (GDC) Films Produced by the Aerosol Deposition Method,10.3390/ma11112072
