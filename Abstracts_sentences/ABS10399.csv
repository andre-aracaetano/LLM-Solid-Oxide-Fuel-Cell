1,10399,Performance analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell-microgas turbine (SOFC-MGT) hybrid system has been made.,Biomass Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Microgas Turbine Hybrid System: Effect of Fuel Composition,10.1115/1.2890104
2,10399,We assume a fuel composition that is methane based with varying concentrations of other species that are expected to be present in biomass-derived gas streams in preparation for the study of biomass fueled SOFC-MGT hybrid system.,Biomass Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Microgas Turbine Hybrid System: Effect of Fuel Composition,10.1115/1.2890104
3,10399,"This is based on the fact that the chemical composition of biomass fuel produced front different fuel production processes is diversified, i.e., in one case one chemical species rich in concentration and in another case another chemical species rich.",Biomass Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Microgas Turbine Hybrid System: Effect of Fuel Composition,10.1115/1.2890104
4,10399,"In the analysis, the multistage model for internal reforming SOFC module developed previously with some modification is used.",Biomass Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Microgas Turbine Hybrid System: Effect of Fuel Composition,10.1115/1.2890104
5,10399,"With this model, studies cover not only the performance of the hybrid system but also the spatial distributions of temperature and concentration of some chemical species inside the module, namely, in the cell stack and in the internal reformer.",Biomass Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Microgas Turbine Hybrid System: Effect of Fuel Composition,10.1115/1.2890104
