1,6549,CrxN/Mn1.7Cu1.3 dual layer coating was prepared on SUS 430 steel via multi-arc ion plating and magnetron sputtering in sequence for use of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) interconnects.,CrxN/Mn1.7Cu1.3 coating on ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130955
2,6549,The coated steel was exposed to air at 800 degrees C corresponding to SOFC cathode environment to evaluate the oxidation behavior and electrical property of the surface scale.,CrxN/Mn1.7Cu1.3 coating on ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130955
3,6549,Results indicated that the Mn1.7Cu1.3 outer layer was thermally converted into Mn1.7Cu1.3O4 spinel outer layer and the CrxN inner layer was gradually oxidized to form a protective Cr2O3 layer at the interface of CrxN and Mn1.7Cu1.3O4.,CrxN/Mn1.7Cu1.3 coating on ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130955
4,6549,"After the CrxN layer was completely oxidized, the surface scale mainly consisted of an outer Mn1.7Cu1.3O4 spinel layer and an inner Cr2O3 layer.",CrxN/Mn1.7Cu1.3 coating on ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130955
5,6549,Area specific resistance of the surface scale formed on CrxN/Mn1.7Cu1.3 coated steel after 15 weeks oxidation was 17.28 m Omega.cm(2).,CrxN/Mn1.7Cu1.3 coating on ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130955
