1,16403,Alloy 441 stainless steel (UNS S 44100) is being considered for application as an SOFC interconnect material.,Exploration of alloy 441 chemistry for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.023
2,16403,There are several advantages to the selection of this alloy over other iron-based or nickel-based alloys: first and foremost alloy 441ss is a production alloy which is both low in cost and readily available.,Exploration of alloy 441 chemistry for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.023
3,16403,"Second, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) more closely matches the CTE of the adjoining ceramic components of the fuel cell.",Exploration of alloy 441 chemistry for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.023
4,16403,"Third, this alloy forms the Laves phase at typical SOFC operating temperatures of 600-800 degrees C.",Exploration of alloy 441 chemistry for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.023
5,16403,It is thought that the Laves phase preferentially consumes the Si present in the alloy microstructure.,Exploration of alloy 441 chemistry for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.023
6,16403,"As a result it has been Postulated that the long-term area specific resistance (ASR) performance degradation often seen with other ferritic stainless steels, which is associated with the formation of electrically resistive Si-rich oxide subscales, may be avoidable with alloy 441 ss.",Exploration of alloy 441 chemistry for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.023
7,16403,"In this paper we explore the physical metallurgy of alloy 441, combining computational thermodynamics with experimental verification, and discuss the results with regards to Laves phase formation under SOFC operating conditions.",Exploration of alloy 441 chemistry for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.023
8,16403,We show that the incorporation of the Laves phase into the microstructure cannot in itself remove sufficient Si from the ferritic matrix in order to completely avoid the formation of Si-rich oxide subscales.,Exploration of alloy 441 chemistry for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.023
9,16403,"However, the thickness, morphology, and continuity of the Si-rich subscale that forms in this alloy is modified in comparison to non-Laves forming ferritic stainless steel alloys and therefore may not be as detrimental to long-term SOFC performance.",Exploration of alloy 441 chemistry for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect application,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.023
