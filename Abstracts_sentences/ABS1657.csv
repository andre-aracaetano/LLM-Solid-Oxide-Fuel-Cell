1,1657,Research and development has made it possible to use metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) instead of ceramic materials.,High temperature corrosion of metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells,
2,1657,"The use of metallic interconnects was formerly hindered by the high operating temperature, which made the interconnect degrade too much and too fast to be an efficient alternative.",High temperature corrosion of metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells,
3,1657,"When the operating temperature was lowered, the use of metallic interconnects proved to be favourable since they are easier and cheaper to produce than ceramic interconnects.",High temperature corrosion of metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells,
4,1657,"However, metallic interconnects continue to be degraded despite the lowered temperature, and their corrosion products contribute to electrical degradation in the fuel cell.",High temperature corrosion of metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells,
5,1657,"Coatings of nickel, chromium, aluminium, zinc, manganese, yttrium or lanthanum between the interconnect and the electrodes reduce this degradation during operation.",High temperature corrosion of metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells,
