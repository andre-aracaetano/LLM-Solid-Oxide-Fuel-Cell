6,8604,Results showed that the co-sintered layer with a thickness of approximately 5 mu m presented a maximum open circuit voltage of similar to 0.956 Vat 650 degrees C and a maximum power density of 592 mW/cm(2) at 750 degrees C. Result indicates that the sintering assisted VCS is a promising method to prepare the LSGM electrolyte applied in intermediate temperature SOFCs.,Enhanced sintering behavior of LSGM electrolyte and its performance for solid oxide fuel cells deposited by vacuum cold spray,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.06.007
