1,11253,A La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM)-based honeycomb-type solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a 0.5 mm thick electrolyte wall was successfully fabricated and operated.,Self-supported LaGaO3-based honeycomb-type solid oxide fuel cell with high volumetric power density,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.009
2,11253,This cell shows a much higher volumetric power density than a ZrO2-based cell in the temperature range from 973 to 1173 K. Detailed results of internal resistance analysis suggest that IR loss is the predominant internal resistance of the cell.,Self-supported LaGaO3-based honeycomb-type solid oxide fuel cell with high volumetric power density,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.009
3,11253,"Furthermore, improved power density is achieved by decreasing LSGM electrolyte wall thickness.",Self-supported LaGaO3-based honeycomb-type solid oxide fuel cell with high volumetric power density,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.009
4,11253,"The effective area power densities are about 0.50 and 0.27 W/cm(2) at 1073 and 973 K, respectively, using a 0.5 mm thick electrolyte wall.",Self-supported LaGaO3-based honeycomb-type solid oxide fuel cell with high volumetric power density,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.009
5,11253,A 0.5 mm thick 4-wall cell was also successfully fabricated and operated at 1073 K; the estimated volumetric power density of this cell is as high as 600 W/L when five channels are used.,Self-supported LaGaO3-based honeycomb-type solid oxide fuel cell with high volumetric power density,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.009
