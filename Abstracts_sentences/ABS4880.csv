1,4880,We investigated a solid oxide fuel cell stack that employs anode-supported planar cells in which two intermediate plates are installed every 10 cells to determine the influence of the separation and reconnection of the intermediate plates after high temperature operation.,Restoration of solid oxide fuel cell stacks after failure of partial cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.025
2,4880,We showed that this separation and reconnection caused no significant degradation in stack performance.,Restoration of solid oxide fuel cell stacks after failure of partial cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.025
3,4880,"A 30-cell stack, which was constructed by removing two 10-cell sub-stacks from a 50-cell stack that had operated stably 1200 h, functioned well.",Restoration of solid oxide fuel cell stacks after failure of partial cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.025
4,4880,"The difference between the average voltages of the cells in the 50- and 30-cell stacks was less than 3% when the current density, fuel utilization, and oxygen utilization were 0.30 A cm(-2) 60%, and 15%, respectively.",Restoration of solid oxide fuel cell stacks after failure of partial cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.025
5,4880,The 30-cell stack operated stably for about 1200 h with almost no degradation.,Restoration of solid oxide fuel cell stacks after failure of partial cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.025
6,4880,These findings indicate that our stack can be restored after cells in the stack have broken down simply by removing the 10-cell sub-stacks that contain the broken cells and replacing them with undamaged 10-cell sub-stacks.,Restoration of solid oxide fuel cell stacks after failure of partial cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.025
