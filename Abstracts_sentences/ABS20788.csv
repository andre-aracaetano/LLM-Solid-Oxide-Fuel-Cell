1,20788,Electrochemical cells formed by the interface between dense and porous lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM) and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were submitted to annealing temperatures varying from 1373K to 1673K for 200h and studied by Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) in order to investigate how the high annealing temperature can modify the contact between LSM/YSZ and to which extension these changes influence the electrical behavior of dense and porous LSM electrodes before and after the formation of insulating phases.,Electrical degradation of porous and dense LSM/YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.012
2,20788,Up to 1473 K the annealing process did not lead to substantial electrical behavior modifications at the LSM/YSZ interfaces for both porous and dense electrodes.,Electrical degradation of porous and dense LSM/YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.012
3,20788,"IS measurements show two capacitive semicircles, the best fitting of impedance data brings to an equivalent circuit constituted by a serial combination of the electrolyte resistance and two parallel combinations of a resistance and a constant phase element, CPE.",Electrical degradation of porous and dense LSM/YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.012
4,20788,"The higher frequency semicircles, HF, were attributed to the diffusion of oxide ions from the interface LSM/YSZ to the oxide ion vacancies located at the electrolyte surface.",Electrical degradation of porous and dense LSM/YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.012
5,20788,"The semicircle at lower frequency, LF, will be ascribed to the oxygen species adsorption and diffusion in the LSM.",Electrical degradation of porous and dense LSM/YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.012
6,20788,At 1473K the only changes recorded are related with the sinterization process of the porous electrodes.,Electrical degradation of porous and dense LSM/YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.012
7,20788,"Over of 1473K, the resistance contributions increased largely, especially for porous electrodes, and one additional semicircle was observed.",Electrical degradation of porous and dense LSM/YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.012
8,20788,This semicircle was associated to the oxygen diffusion process at the new insulating phases formed from YSZ and LSM solid state reactions.,Electrical degradation of porous and dense LSM/YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.012
9,20788,Porous and dense electrodes exhibited different rates for the degradation process.,Electrical degradation of porous and dense LSM/YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.012
10,20788,"The porous electrode degraded faster than the dense one, probably because of the morphological effects as gain growth and their coalescence during annealing at higher temperatures.",Electrical degradation of porous and dense LSM/YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.012
