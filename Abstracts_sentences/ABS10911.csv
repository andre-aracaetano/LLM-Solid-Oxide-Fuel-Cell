5,10911,Experimental data are used in conjunction with a physics-based performance model to construct the failure probability function.,Reliability analysis for a multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell system subject to operation condition-dependent degradation,10.1108/JQME-04-2020-0021
6,10911,A dynamic program then solves the optimization problem in terms of time and replacement requirements to minimize the total negative deviation from a given target reliability.,Reliability analysis for a multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell system subject to operation condition-dependent degradation,10.1108/JQME-04-2020-0021
7,10911,Findings Results show that multi-stack SOFC systems face challenges which are only revealed on a system- and not on a module-level.,Reliability analysis for a multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell system subject to operation condition-dependent degradation,10.1108/JQME-04-2020-0021
8,10911,The main finding is that the reliability of multi-stack SOFC systems is not sufficient to serve as sole power source for critical applications such as data center.,Reliability analysis for a multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell system subject to operation condition-dependent degradation,10.1108/JQME-04-2020-0021
9,10911,Practical implications The principal methodology may be applicable to other modular systems which include multiple critical components (of the same kind).,Reliability analysis for a multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell system subject to operation condition-dependent degradation,10.1108/JQME-04-2020-0021
