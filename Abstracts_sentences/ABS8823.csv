1,8823,"A Ni/CeO2-LCeCrN catalyst was developed with a unique hierarchy of exsolved Ni and CeO2 nanoparticles dispersed on a perovskite La0.8Ce0.2-xCr0.85Ni0.15-yO3-delta (LCeCrN) substrate for steam reforming methanol, ethanol, and glycerol, producing reformate gas as fuel for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) power generation.",Catalyst with CeO2 and Ni Nanoparticles on a LaCrO3-Based Perovskite Substrate for Bio-Alcohol Steam Reforming and SOFC Power Generation,10.1021/acsaem.1c02356
2,8823,"Methanol, ethanol, and glycerol are almost completely steam-reformed into H-2, CO, and CO2 at 450, 650, and 700 degrees C at a steam/carbon (S/C) ratio of 1, 2.5, and 4 with a maximum hydrogen yield of 2.2, 5.2, and 6.0 mol, respectively.",Catalyst with CeO2 and Ni Nanoparticles on a LaCrO3-Based Perovskite Substrate for Bio-Alcohol Steam Reforming and SOFC Power Generation,10.1021/acsaem.1c02356
3,8823,"The catalytic performance of Ni/CeO2-LCeCrN catalyst is durable, with no carbon deposition for methanol and slight carbon deposition for ethanol and glycerol reforming for up to 100 h, due to the presence of CeO2 nanoparticles that enhance water adsorption capability and spillover oxygen to oxidize the deposited carbon.",Catalyst with CeO2 and Ni Nanoparticles on a LaCrO3-Based Perovskite Substrate for Bio-Alcohol Steam Reforming and SOFC Power Generation,10.1021/acsaem.1c02356
4,8823,The reformate gas is fed in sequence into the anode of an SOFC single cell for power generation.,Catalyst with CeO2 and Ni Nanoparticles on a LaCrO3-Based Perovskite Substrate for Bio-Alcohol Steam Reforming and SOFC Power Generation,10.1021/acsaem.1c02356
5,8823,"The maximum power density of the cell is comparable at 650 degrees C and slightly lower at 700 and 750 degrees C than that fueled by H-2, suggesting that Ni/CeO2-LCeCrN is an excellent catalyst for steam reforming methanol, ethanol, and glycerol to produce reformate gas for SOFC power generation.",Catalyst with CeO2 and Ni Nanoparticles on a LaCrO3-Based Perovskite Substrate for Bio-Alcohol Steam Reforming and SOFC Power Generation,10.1021/acsaem.1c02356
