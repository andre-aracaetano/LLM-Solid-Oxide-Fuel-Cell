1,14380,"The integration of natural gas powered solid oxide fuel cell combined heat and power (SOFC-CHP) unit into a decentral residential energy system consisting of solar thermal collectors, photovoltaic with both thermal sensible heat storage and lithium-ion battery is simulatively evaluated.",Evaluation of SOFC-CHP's ability to integrate thermal and electrical energy system decentrally in a single-family house with model predictive controller,10.1016/j.seta.2021.101643
2,14380,The system also includes gas boiler and electrical grid as back up.,Evaluation of SOFC-CHP's ability to integrate thermal and electrical energy system decentrally in a single-family house with model predictive controller,10.1016/j.seta.2021.101643
3,14380,The system is investigated along with status quo controllers and how an implementation of a model predictive controller (MPC) and seasonal shutdown of the FC-CHP influences the performances of the SOFC-CHP.,Evaluation of SOFC-CHP's ability to integrate thermal and electrical energy system decentrally in a single-family house with model predictive controller,10.1016/j.seta.2021.101643
4,14380,The performance is also analysed with two different single-family house German energy standards: Sonnenhaus (relatively new high renewable fraction house) and WSchVO95 (old house as per the year 1995 ' s standard).,Evaluation of SOFC-CHP's ability to integrate thermal and electrical energy system decentrally in a single-family house with model predictive controller,10.1016/j.seta.2021.101643
5,14380,The results show that via SOFC-CHP 100% self-supply of the electrical loads is possible and a 10% increase in decentral system self-consumption fraction by introducing MPC control.,Evaluation of SOFC-CHP's ability to integrate thermal and electrical energy system decentrally in a single-family house with model predictive controller,10.1016/j.seta.2021.101643
6,14380,"Also, it could be seen here that the MPC control for FC-CHP and the use of FC-CHP for the old WSchVO95 building has more advantages than anticipated.",Evaluation of SOFC-CHP's ability to integrate thermal and electrical energy system decentrally in a single-family house with model predictive controller,10.1016/j.seta.2021.101643
7,14380,"SOFC-CHP seasonal shutdown along with +12% & +7% self-consumption fraction at the expense of +5% & +2% electricity import in Sonnenhaus and WSchVO95 buildings respectively also increases photovoltaic, solar thermal and battery use.",Evaluation of SOFC-CHP's ability to integrate thermal and electrical energy system decentrally in a single-family house with model predictive controller,10.1016/j.seta.2021.101643
