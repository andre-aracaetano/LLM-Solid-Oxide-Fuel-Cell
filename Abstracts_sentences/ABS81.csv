1,81,"La-doped SrTiO3 (LST)-xCeO(2) (x = 0, 30, 40, 50) composites were evaluated as anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells in terms of chemical compatibility, electrical conductivity and fuel cell performance in H-2 and CH4.",Anode performance of LST-xCeO2 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.007
2,81,"Although the conductivity of LST-xCeO(2) composite slightly decreased from 4.6 to 3.9 S cm(-1) in H-2 at 900 degrees C as the content of CeO2 increased, the fuel cell performance improved from 75.8 to 172.3 mW cm(-2) in 112 and 54.5 to 139.6 mW cm(-2) in CH4 at 900 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) indicated that the addition of CeO2 into LST can significantly reduce the fuel cells polarization thUS leading to a higher performance.",Anode performance of LST-xCeO2 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.007
