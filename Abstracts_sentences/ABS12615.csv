1,12615,"A new design of cathode current-collecting element (CCCE) based on Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3, which contains gas channels and an array of truncated-pyramidshaped contact tips, is synthesized through die pressing followed by a conventional solid-state reaction for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Effects of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-based cathode current-collecting element on the performance of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10853-016-0686-x
2,12615,"This configuration could not only maintain the high electronic conductivity of the material to ensure the efficiency of current collecting, but also improve the gas diffusion rate at the cathode side.",Effects of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-based cathode current-collecting element on the performance of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10853-016-0686-x
3,12615,"The height h of the channel tips on the CCCEs reaches approximately 60, 120, and 240 mu m, respectively, which results in the variation in polarization resistance (R-P) more significantly than the contact area of the tips does.",Effects of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-based cathode current-collecting element on the performance of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10853-016-0686-x
4,12615,The experiments show that the R-P of the symmetric cells decreased from 0.267 to 0.060 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C after employing the CCCE with modified parameters.,Effects of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-based cathode current-collecting element on the performance of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10853-016-0686-x
