2,14483,Composite materials Ba1.2Sr0.8CoO4+delta -Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.9 (GDC) (BSC1208-GDC) were prepared and characterized as cathode for intermediate temperature SOFC (IT-SOFC).,Preparation of Ba1.2Sr0.8CoO4+δ K2NiF4-type structure oxide and cathodic behavioral of Ba1.2Sr0.8CoO4+δ-GDC composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.07.002
3,14483,XRD results show that no reaction occurred between Ba1.2Sr0.8CoO4+delta and CDC at 1000 degrees C.,Preparation of Ba1.2Sr0.8CoO4+δ K2NiF4-type structure oxide and cathodic behavioral of Ba1.2Sr0.8CoO4+δ-GDC composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.07.002
4,14483,"For BSC1208-30 wt% CDC electrode, SEM results suggest that better microstructure was obtained and the electrode formed good contact with the electrolyte after sintering at 1000 degrees C for 2 h. Compared with the pure BSC1208 material, BSC1208-GDC composite materials exhibit better electrochemical properties.",Preparation of Ba1.2Sr0.8CoO4+δ K2NiF4-type structure oxide and cathodic behavioral of Ba1.2Sr0.8CoO4+δ-GDC composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.07.002
