1,6478,"Bilayer electrolytes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) offer the potential for higher power density by lowering the ohmic area specific resistance (ASR) and increasing the open circuit voltage (OCV) of mixed ionic/electronic conducting (MIEC) type electrolyte (e.g., GDC).",Optimizing Bilayer Electrolyte Thickness Ratios for High-Performing Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3c96
2,6478,"However, optimizing the bilayer electrolyte thickness ratio is essential to achieve high power densities at low-temperatures (650 degrees C-500 degrees C).",Optimizing Bilayer Electrolyte Thickness Ratios for High-Performing Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3c96

7,6478,Such enhancement is due to the 9.3% improvement in OCV and 36% reduction in ohmic ASR values with the addition of the YCSB layer.,Optimizing Bilayer Electrolyte Thickness Ratios for High-Performing Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3c96
8,6478,The reduction in ohmic ASR of the bilayer electrolyte SOFCs is due to an increase of GDC electrical conductivity caused by the lower pO2 at the YCSB/GDC interface which must be considered in optimizing the thickness ratio of the bilayer electrolyte for achieving higher power density LT-SOFCs.,Optimizing Bilayer Electrolyte Thickness Ratios for High-Performing Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3c96
