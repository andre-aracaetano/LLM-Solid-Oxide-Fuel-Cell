1,15725,"We report design, fabrication method, and fast thermal-cycling ability of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that use stainless steel (STS) as a support, and a new 3-phase anode.",Thermal cycling and electrochemical characteristics of solid oxide fuel cell supported on stainless steel with a new 3-phase composite anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.04.022
2,15725,"La and Ni co-doped SrTiO3 (La0.2Sr0.8Ti0.9Ni0.1O3-d, LSTN), replaces some of the Ni in conventional Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode; the resultant LSTN-YSZ-Ni 3-phase-composite anode is tested as a new reduction (or decomposition)-resistant anode of STS-supported SOFCs that can be co-fired with STS.",Thermal cycling and electrochemical characteristics of solid oxide fuel cell supported on stainless steel with a new 3-phase composite anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.04.022
3,15725,"A multi-layered cell with YSZ electrolyte (thickness similar to 5 mu m), composite anode, STS-cermet contact-layer, and STS support is designed, then fabricated by tape casting, lamination, and co-firing at 1250 degrees C in reducing atmosphere.",Thermal cycling and electrochemical characteristics of solid oxide fuel cell supported on stainless steel with a new 3-phase composite anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.04.022
4,15725,The maximum power density (MPD) is 325 mW cm(-2) at 650 degrees C; this is one of the highest among STS-supported cells fabricated by co-firing.,Thermal cycling and electrochemical characteristics of solid oxide fuel cell supported on stainless steel with a new 3-phase composite anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.04.022
5,15725,The cell also shows stable open-circuit voltage and Ohmic resistance during 100 rapid thermal cycles between 170 and 600 degrees C. STS support minimizes stress and avoids cracking of electrolyte during rapid thermal cycling.,Thermal cycling and electrochemical characteristics of solid oxide fuel cell supported on stainless steel with a new 3-phase composite anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.04.022
