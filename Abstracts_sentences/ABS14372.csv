1,14372,Ni-YSZ anodes for Solid OXide Fuel Cells are vulnerable to microstructural damage during redox cycling leading to a decrease in the electrochemical performance.,Quantification of the degradation of Ni-YSZ anodes upon redox cycling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.024
2,14372,This study quantifies the microstructural changes as a function of redox cycles at 800 degrees C and associates it to the deterioration of the mechanical properties and polarisation resistance.,Quantification of the degradation of Ni-YSZ anodes upon redox cycling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.024
3,14372,"A physically-based model is used to estimate the triple-phase boundary (TPB) length from impedance spectra, and satisfactorily matches the TPB length quantified by FIB-SEM tomography: within 20 redox cycles, the TPB density decreases from 4.63 mu m(-2) to 1.06 mu m(-2).",Quantification of the degradation of Ni-YSZ anodes upon redox cycling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.024
4,14372,"Although the polarisation resistance increases by an order of magnitude after 20 cycles, after each re-reduction the electrode polarisation improves consistently due to the transient generation of Ni nanoparticles around the TPBs.",Quantification of the degradation of Ni-YSZ anodes upon redox cycling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.024
5,14372,"Nonetheless, the long-term degradation overshadows this transient improvement due to the nickel agglomeration.",Quantification of the degradation of Ni-YSZ anodes upon redox cycling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.024
6,14372,"In addition, FIB-SEM tomography reveals fractures along YSZ grain boundaries, Ni-YSZ detachment and increased porosity in the composite that lead to irreversible mechanical damage: the elastic modulus diminishes from 36.4 GPa to 20.2 GPa and the hardness from 0.40 GPa to 0.15 GPa.",Quantification of the degradation of Ni-YSZ anodes upon redox cycling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.024
7,14372,"These results suggest that microstructural, mechanical and electrochemical properties are strongly interdependent in determining the degradation caused by redox cycling.",Quantification of the degradation of Ni-YSZ anodes upon redox cycling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.024
