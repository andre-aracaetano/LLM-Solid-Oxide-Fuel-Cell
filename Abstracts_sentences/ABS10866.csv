1,10866,A paper-structured catalyst (PSC) for biogas reforming was prepared with the aim of improving coking tolerance.,"Ni-loaded (Ce,Zr)O2-δ-dispersed paper-structured catalyst for dry reforming of methane",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.118
2,10866,"During the paper-making process using inorganic fibers, Ni-loaded (Ce,Zr)O2-delta particles were synthesized via co-precipitation and subsequent chemical reduction (on-paper synthesis).","Ni-loaded (Ce,Zr)O2-δ-dispersed paper-structured catalyst for dry reforming of methane",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.118
3,10866,The effects of the CeO2/ZrO2 weight ratio during preparation and the Ni loading amount on the catalytic activity for dry reforming of CH4 were investigated at 750 degrees C. A Ni loading of 6 wt% with CeO2/ZrO2 >= 1 led to stable CH4 conversion of 85% without coking under a gas hourly space velocity of 3800 h(-1).,"Ni-loaded (Ce,Zr)O2-δ-dispersed paper-structured catalyst for dry reforming of methane",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.118
4,10866,"The oxygen storage capacity of the (Ce,Zr)O2-delta particles dispersed in the inorganic fiber network may contribute to the oxidation of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalyst surface.","Ni-loaded (Ce,Zr)O2-δ-dispersed paper-structured catalyst for dry reforming of methane",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.118
