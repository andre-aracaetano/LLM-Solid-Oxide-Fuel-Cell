2,21061,"The microstructural, morphological, compositional and optical properties of the obtained material were analyzed with X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector (EDS) and UV-visible spectroscopy techniques.",Evaluation of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 perovskite prepared by fast solution combustion,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.105
3,21061,"The XRD results showed the coexistence of rhombohedral R-3c and Pm-3m polymorphs for the perovskite phase, with a decreased fraction of the cubic phase as the temperature and/or time used for the calcination were increased.",Evaluation of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 perovskite prepared by fast solution combustion,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.105
4,21061,"The HR-TEM images confirmed the existence of the R-3c and Pm-3m polymorphs for the sample subjected to calcination at 1300 degrees C, showing that the rapid combustion method did not allow the pure formation of the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 phase for the calcination temperatures below 1400 degrees C, due to the swiftness of the combustion synthesis 500 degrees C for 5 min.",Evaluation of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 perovskite prepared by fast solution combustion,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.105
