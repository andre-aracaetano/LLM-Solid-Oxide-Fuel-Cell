1,16726,"In the present work, it was found that high surface area ceria (CeO2 (HSA)), synthesized by a surfactant-assisted approach, have useful ethanol steam reforming activity under solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) temperatures.",Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol over high surface area CeO2:: The role of CeO2 as an internal pre-reforming catalyst,10.1016/j.apcatb.2006.01.011
2,16726,The catalyst provides good reforming reactivity and high resistance toward carbon deposition compared to Ni/Al2O3 and conventional low surface area ceria (CeO2 (LSA)).,Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol over high surface area CeO2:: The role of CeO2 as an internal pre-reforming catalyst,10.1016/j.apcatb.2006.01.011
3,16726,"Although the hydrogen selectivity at steady state from the ethanol steam reforming over CeO2 (HSA) was lower than Rh/Al2O3, the resistance toward carbon deposition of CeO2 (HSA) was considerably higher.",Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol over high surface area CeO2:: The role of CeO2 as an internal pre-reforming catalyst,10.1016/j.apcatb.2006.01.011
4,16726,"At temperature 900 degrees C, the main products from the steam reforming of ethanol over CeO2 (HSA) (with inlet C2H5OH/H2O molar ratio of 1.0/ 3.0) were H-2 (with the selectivity of 67.5%), CH4, CO, and CO2.",Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol over high surface area CeO2:: The role of CeO2 as an internal pre-reforming catalyst,10.1016/j.apcatb.2006.01.011
5,16726,"In contrast, the formations of C2H4 and C2H6 were also observed from the steam reforming of ethanol over Ni/Al2O3 and CeO2 (LSA).",Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol over high surface area CeO2:: The role of CeO2 as an internal pre-reforming catalyst,10.1016/j.apcatb.2006.01.011
6,16726,The combination use of CeO2 and Ni/Al2O3 was studied in an annular ceramic reactor by applying CeO2 as an internal pre-reforming catalyst.,Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol over high surface area CeO2:: The role of CeO2 as an internal pre-reforming catalyst,10.1016/j.apcatb.2006.01.011
7,16726,"The main purpose of CeO2 is to convert all ethanol and other high hydrocarbon compounds (e.g. C2H4 and C2H6) forming CH4, CO, CO2, and H-2, while Ni/Al2O3 is applied to reform all CH4 left from the pre-reforming section and maximize the yield of hydrogen production.",Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol over high surface area CeO2:: The role of CeO2 as an internal pre-reforming catalyst,10.1016/j.apcatb.2006.01.011
8,16726,"After operated at 900 degrees C for 100 h, this combination pattern offers high hydrogen selectivity (87.0-91.4%) and good resistance toward carbon deposition.",Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol over high surface area CeO2:: The role of CeO2 as an internal pre-reforming catalyst,10.1016/j.apcatb.2006.01.011
9,16726,This successful development eliminates the requirement of expensive noble metal catalysts or the installation of an external pre-reformer in order to reform ethanol internally (IIR-SOFC).,Catalytic steam reforming of ethanol over high surface area CeO2:: The role of CeO2 as an internal pre-reforming catalyst,10.1016/j.apcatb.2006.01.011
