2,18777,"However, supplementing the fuel with a small percentage of excess molecular hydrogen effectively masks the degradation to the catalytic activity of the Ni and carbon fuel cracking reaction reactions.",Palliative effects of H2 on SOFCs operating with carbon containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.071
3,18777,"Experiments described in this work explore the chemistry behind the palliative effect of hydrogen on SOFCs operating with chlorine-contaminated, carbon-containing fuels using a suite of independent, complementary techniques.",Palliative effects of H2 on SOFCs operating with carbon containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.071
4,18777,"Operando Raman spectroscopy is used to monitor carbon accumulation and, by inference, Ni catalytic activity while electrochemical techniques including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and voltammetry are used to monitor overall cell performance.",Palliative effects of H2 on SOFCs operating with carbon containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.071
5,18777,"Briefly, hydrogen not only completely hides degradation observed with chlorine-contaminated carbon-containing fuels, but also actively removes adsorbed chlorine from the surface of the Ni, allowing for the methane cracking reaction to continue, albeit at a slower rate.",Palliative effects of H2 on SOFCs operating with carbon containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.071
6,18777,When hydrogen is removed from the fuel stream the cell fails immediately due to chlorine occupation of methane/biogas reaction sites.,Palliative effects of H2 on SOFCs operating with carbon containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.071
