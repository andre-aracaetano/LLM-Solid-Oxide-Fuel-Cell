4,17554,"XRD results suggested that there was a good chemical stability between Pr1.6Sr0.4NiO4 and YSZ at temperatures below 1050 degrees C. PY20-Ag cathode exhibited higher exchange current density, lower overpotential and ASR (Area Specific Resistance) than PY20 cathode.",Investigations on Pr1.6Sr0.4NiO4-YSZ-Ag composite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpcs.2009.11.010
