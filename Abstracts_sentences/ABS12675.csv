1,12675,"The usability of hydrogen and also carbon containing fuels is one of the important advantages of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which opens the possibility to use fuels derived from conventional sources such as natural gas and from renewable sources such as biogas.",Durability of solid oxide fuel cells using sulfur containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.053
2,12675,Impurities like sulfur compounds are critical in this respect.,Durability of solid oxide fuel cells using sulfur containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.053
3,12675,State-of-the-art Ni/YSZ SOFC anodes suffer from being rather sensitive towards sulfur impurities.,Durability of solid oxide fuel cells using sulfur containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.053
4,12675,"In the current study, anode supported SOFCs with Ni/YSZ or Ni/ScYSZ anodes were exposed to H(2)S in the ppm range both for short periods of 24 h and for a few hundred hours.",Durability of solid oxide fuel cells using sulfur containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.053
5,12675,"In a fuel containing significant shares of methane, the reforming activities of the Ni/YSZ and Ni/ScYSZ anodes were severely poisoned already at low H(2)S concentrations of similar to 2 ppm H(2)S. The poisoning effect on the cell voltage was reversible only to a certain degree after exposure of 500 h in the state-of-the-art cell, due to a loss of percolation of Ni particles in the Ni/YSZ anode layers closest to the electrolyte.",Durability of solid oxide fuel cells using sulfur containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.053
6,12675,"Using SOFCs with Ni/ScYSZ anodes improved the H(2)S tolerance considerably, even at larger H(2)S concentrations of 10 and 20 ppm over a few hundred hours.",Durability of solid oxide fuel cells using sulfur containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.053
