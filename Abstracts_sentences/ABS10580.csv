1,10580,An over-expected amount of heat losses occurred in the internal combustion engine (ICE) of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-ICE hybrid system and achieving the target efficiency of the hybrid system was seriously impeded by these heat losses.,Composition-considered Woschni heat transfer correlation: Findings from the analysis of over-expected engine heat losses in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117851
2,10580,"The objectives of this study are to understand the causes of these over-expected heat losses and to propose a new engine heat transfer correlation applicable to engine operation with unconventional fuels, including but not limited to SOFC anode off-gas.",Composition-considered Woschni heat transfer correlation: Findings from the analysis of over-expected engine heat losses in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117851
3,10580,"First, the effects of composition on the gas convection coefficient were analysed; the engine intake gas in the hybrid system was analysed to have a 1.3-1.4 times larger convention coefficient than general engine intake gas because of its unusual composition.",Composition-considered Woschni heat transfer correlation: Findings from the analysis of over-expected engine heat losses in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117851
4,10580,"Second, considering the effects of composition, we proposed a new engine heat transfer correlation, named 'composition-considered Woschni'.",Composition-considered Woschni heat transfer correlation: Findings from the analysis of over-expected engine heat losses in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117851
5,10580,"Third, to validate this new correlation, experiments and simulations of engine operation were conducted while varying the composition of intake gas.",Composition-considered Woschni heat transfer correlation: Findings from the analysis of over-expected engine heat losses in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117851
6,10580,The simulation results using the composition-considered Woschni correlation showed much better predictivity than those using the original Woschni correlation.,Composition-considered Woschni heat transfer correlation: Findings from the analysis of over-expected engine heat losses in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117851
7,10580,The total root mean square values of the error rates of the main performance indices for all operating conditions decreased from 12.4% to 5.6% by applying this new correlation.,Composition-considered Woschni heat transfer correlation: Findings from the analysis of over-expected engine heat losses in a solid oxide fuel cell-internal combustion engine hybrid system,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117851
