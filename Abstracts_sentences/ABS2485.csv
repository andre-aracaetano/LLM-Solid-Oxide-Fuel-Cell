2,2485,It is necessary to keep a balance between maximizing the power output of fuel cells and minimizing the pretreatment of biomass.,Solid oxide fuel cell using agroforestry waste as fuel: A balance between power output and fuel utilization,10.1002/apj.2792
3,2485,"Herein, we report the comparison of output performance between the apple tree branches (ATB) dried at 110 degrees C and the one pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C in SOFCs.",Solid oxide fuel cell using agroforestry waste as fuel: A balance between power output and fuel utilization,10.1002/apj.2792
4,2485,"The results show that the peak power densities (PPD) of SOFCs operated at 850 degrees C were 157 and 238 mW cm(-2) for the dried and the pyrolyzed samples, respectively.",Solid oxide fuel cell using agroforestry waste as fuel: A balance between power output and fuel utilization,10.1002/apj.2792
5,2485,"And the corresponding apparent fuel utilizations for them were 18.1% and 24.6%, respectively.",Solid oxide fuel cell using agroforestry waste as fuel: A balance between power output and fuel utilization,10.1002/apj.2792
6,2485,"However, if counting the pyrolysis yield (similar to 28 wt%), the overall fuel utilization of the pyrolyzed sample declined from 24.6% to similar to 6.9%.",Solid oxide fuel cell using agroforestry waste as fuel: A balance between power output and fuel utilization,10.1002/apj.2792
7,2485,"In addition, if loading the steel slag (SS)-based catalyst catalyst to the dried sample, its PPD at 850 degrees C were almost doubled to 303 mW cm(-2), but the fuel utilization reduced to 9.2%.",Solid oxide fuel cell using agroforestry waste as fuel: A balance between power output and fuel utilization,10.1002/apj.2792
8,2485,"Meanwhile, SOFCs using the medium-density fiberboard (MDF) as fuel exhibited the parallel trends in electrochemical performance and fuel utilization.",Solid oxide fuel cell using agroforestry waste as fuel: A balance between power output and fuel utilization,10.1002/apj.2792
