2,8105,"AC impedance measurements carried out under open-circuit conditions in the temperature range 800-900 degreesC showed the presence of at least two rate-limiting processes which were influenced by temperature and gas phase composition, The apparent polarization resistance, R-app, of the Ni-YSZ cermet anode,YSZ interface was found to increase with increasing methane partial pressure and decreasing H2O partial pressure.",AC impedance study of Ni-YSZ cermet anodes in methane-fuelled internal reforming YSZ fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00369-7
