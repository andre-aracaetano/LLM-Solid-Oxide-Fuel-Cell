2,8636,"Based on the analysis results and experimental observations, local stresses are observed to have maxima in the near-post-bifurcation regime, but then to decrease significantly in the post-buckling regime.",Nonlinear thermomechanical design of microfabricated thin plate devices in the post-buckling regime,10.1088/0960-1317/20/3/035027
3,8636,"This effect is more significant with plates of larger sidelength and smaller thickness structures, enabling microfabrication of numerous plate and membrane structures that are typically considered susceptible to failure due to buckling.",Nonlinear thermomechanical design of microfabricated thin plate devices in the post-buckling regime,10.1088/0960-1317/20/3/035027
