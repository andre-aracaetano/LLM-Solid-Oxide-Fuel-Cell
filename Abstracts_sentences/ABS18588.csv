1,18588,"Based on reactive air brazing (RAB), we designed a new type of sealant (Ag-xCuAlO(2)) for joining 3 mol.% yttriastabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramics and AISI 310S stainless steel.",A novel Ag-CuAlO2 sealant for reactive air brazing of 3YSZ and AISI 310S,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.017
2,18588,"The CuAlO2 content affected the wettability of the sealant on the YSZ surface, and the joints had a high shear strength when Ag-2",A novel Ag-CuAlO2 sealant for reactive air brazing of 3YSZ and AISI 310S,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.017
3,18588,"wt.%CuAlO2, which had a small contact angle on the YSZ substrate, was used as the sealant.",A novel Ag-CuAlO2 sealant for reactive air brazing of 3YSZ and AISI 310S,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.017
4,18588,"In addition, the thickness of the oxide layer was reduced compared to that for the Ag-CuO sealant.",A novel Ag-CuAlO2 sealant for reactive air brazing of 3YSZ and AISI 310S,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.017
5,18588,"The effects of the processing parameters on the microstructure and shear strength of the joints were investigated, and the as-brazed joints reached their highest shear strength (93.7 MPa) when brazed at 1040 degrees C for 30 min.",A novel Ag-CuAlO2 sealant for reactive air brazing of 3YSZ and AISI 310S,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.017
6,18588,"After high-temperature oxidation at 800 degrees C for 200 h, the shear strength of the joints remained at 50 MPa, and no apparent change in the microstructure was observed, proving that the joints possessed excellent oxidation resistance.",A novel Ag-CuAlO2 sealant for reactive air brazing of 3YSZ and AISI 310S,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.017
