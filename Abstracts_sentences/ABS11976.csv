2,11976,"(x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50), abbreviated as LPSN-xCPO, were prepared and used as composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC).",La0.6PrSr0.4NiO4-Ce0.8Pr0.2O2 composite cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2014.11.017
3,11976,XRD result suggested that no chemical reaction occurred between LPSN and CPO after sintering at 1200 degrees C for 4 h. Electrical conductivity of LPSN-xCPO decreased with x. LPSN-40CPO exhibited the best performance on cathode impedance spectra under open-circuit condition.,La0.6PrSr0.4NiO4-Ce0.8Pr0.2O2 composite cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2014.11.017
