1,4824,"CuFe0.8 (Fe:Cu = 0.8:1, atomic ratio) alloy layer is fabricated on both bare and pre-oxidized SUS 430 steels by direct current magnetron sputtering, followed by exposing at 800 degrees C in air to obtain a protective coating for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) steel interconnects.",CuFe2O4/CuO coating for solid oxide fuel cell steel interconnects,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.117
2,4824,"The CuFe0.8 alloy layer is thermally converted to CuFe2O4/CuO coating, which effectively suppresses the out-migration of Cr. Pre-oxidation treatment not only initially accelerates the formation of CuFe2O4/CuO coating but also further inhibits the Cr and Fe outward diffusion.",CuFe2O4/CuO coating for solid oxide fuel cell steel interconnects,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.117
