1,16890,The heterogeneous (catalytic) and the hetero-/homogeneous (catalytic and gas-phase) combustion processes of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) off-gases with compositions typical of a high cell utilization rate are investigated with high-fidelity 2D simulations in a platinum-coated planar channel using detailed hetero-/homogeneous chemistry.,Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
2,16890,"The pressures are 1-8 bar; the reactant streams have volumetric H2 and CO contents 0.7-1.5 and 5.3-9.7%, respectively; H2O and CO2 dilutions are similar to 40 and similar to 50%, respectively; and the global fuel/air equivalence ratio is 0.90.",Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
3,16890,"Water inhibits chemically the catalytic oxidation of H2, as it leads to high H(s) surface coverage that favors the recombinative desorption of H(s) to H2.",Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
4,16890,"On the other hand, H2O promotes chemically the catalytic oxidation of CO by creating high OH(s) coverage that in turn accelerates the CO consumption.",Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
5,16890,Strong flames are established at the highest H2 content cases and for pressures p >= 3 bar.,Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
6,16890,"For all cases with vigorous homogeneous combustion, the catalytic and gas-phase reaction pathways coexist and compete with each other for the consumption of H2 and CO.",Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
7,16890,The large H2O content leads to gas-phase production of H2 via the reaction H2O,Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
8,16890,+ H = H2 + OH.,Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
9,16890,"However, the gas-phase produced H2 is subsequently consumed by the catalytic pathway, such that nearly complete H2 conversion is attained at the reactor outlet.",Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
10,16890,Gaseous chemistry does not affect the reactor lengths required for complete H2 conversion but substantially reduces the corresponding lengths for CO conversion.,Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
11,16890,"The H2 emissions decrease with increasing pressure and are in the range 8-110 ppmv, while the CO emissions increase with rising pressure and span the range 0.3-52 ppmv, thus leading to corrected CO emissions (at 15% O2) of less than 15 ppmv.",Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
12,16890,"Finally, the peak wall temperatures are largely acceptable in terms of catalyst thermal stability.",Heterogeneous and Combined Heterogeneous/Homogeneous Combustion Modeling of SOFC Off-Gases,10.1021/acs.jpca.2c07049
