4,6359,The oxidation behaviour of coated substrates was studied during different types of oxidation tests.,Mn coating on AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel by pack cementation method for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.12.017
5,6359,Area specific resistance (ASR) of the coated substrates was also tested as a function of temperature and time.,Mn coating on AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel by pack cementation method for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.12.017
6,6359,The results showed that the formed Mn3O4 and MnFe2O4 spinels improved oxidation resistance by limiting the outward diffusion of Cr cations and the inward diffusion of oxygen anions.,Mn coating on AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel by pack cementation method for SOFC interconnect applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.12.017
7,6359,These spinels also caused a reduction of ASR for coated substrates (17.4 m Omega cm(2)) as compared to uncoated substrates(36.1 m Omega cm(2)) after 200 h of isothermal oxidation at 800 degrees C.
