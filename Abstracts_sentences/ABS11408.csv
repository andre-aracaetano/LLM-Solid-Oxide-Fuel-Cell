1,11408,A-deficit La(0.54)Sr(0.44)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) was synthesized by a citrate complexation (Pechini) route.,A-deficit LSCF for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.03.017
2,11408,"Using La(0.54)Sr(0.44)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) as cathode material, a superior cell performance with the maximum power density of 309,470 and 855 mW cm(-2) at 600,650 and 700 degrees C was achieved, in contrast with the maximum power density of 266, 354 and 589 mW cm(-2) using conventional La(0.6)Sr(0.4)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) as cathode material at the same temperatures.",A-deficit LSCF for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.03.017
3,11408,The reason of this improvement was analyzed on the basis of defect chemistry.,A-deficit LSCF for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.03.017
4,11408,Thermal shrinkage experiment testified that the oxygen vacancies in La(0.54)Sr(0.44)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) are more mobile than in La(0.6)Sr(0.4)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta).,A-deficit LSCF for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.03.017
5,11408,"Furthermore, theoretical calculation in terms of their composition and the shift of peak position in XRD pattern showed that the concentration of Oxygen Vacancies Of La(0.54)Sr(0.44)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) is higher than that of La(0.6)Sr(0.4)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta).",A-deficit LSCF for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.03.017
6,11408,"Therefore, the oxygen ion conductivity via vacancies transfer mechanism is enhanced, which induces the polarization resistance of La(0.54)Sr(0.44)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) being decreased with a result of cell performance improved.",A-deficit LSCF for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.03.017
