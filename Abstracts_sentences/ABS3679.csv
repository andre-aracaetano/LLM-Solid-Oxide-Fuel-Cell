1,3679,Electrical conductivity measurements and hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell experiments were carried out at 600-800 degreesC using proton-conducting Yb-doped SrCeO3.,Effect of humidification at anode and cathode in proton-conducting SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00222-4
2,3679,"The total conductivity increased with P-O2 higher than 10(-5) atm and decreased with respect to P-H2O, suggesting that electron hole formation was suppressed in the presence of water.",Effect of humidification at anode and cathode in proton-conducting SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00222-4
3,3679,"In fuel cell tests, the introduction of water to the oxygen cathode resulted in a lower OCV due to the converse hydrogen potential, but a higher ionic transport number in agreement with the conductivity measurements.",Effect of humidification at anode and cathode in proton-conducting SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00222-4
4,3679,"The introduction of water to the hydrogen anode did not affect the OCV but improved (lowered) the area-specific resistance (ASR), probably by promotion of the uptake of protons through hydroxyl insertion.",Effect of humidification at anode and cathode in proton-conducting SOFCs,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00222-4
