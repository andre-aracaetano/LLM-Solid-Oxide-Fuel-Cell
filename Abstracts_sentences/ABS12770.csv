5,12770,"The energy analysis demonstrated that 75.1% of the transferred heat was recovered by the BOP components and pipes; only 25% of the heat, i.e., 638 W, was lost.",Exergetic evaluation of operation results of 5-kW-class SOFC-HCCI engine hybrid power generation system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117037
6,12770,"However, the exergy analysis identified that only 35.1% of the transferred exergy was recovered; thus, 64.9% of the exergy was destroyed.",Exergetic evaluation of operation results of 5-kW-class SOFC-HCCI engine hybrid power generation system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117037
7,12770,"Based on the energy and exergy analysis results, it is observed that the amount of exergy destruction exceeds the heat loss as the latter contributes to the former; this is in addition to the exergy destruction due to the irreversibility of the heat transfer between the components located in the BOP hot box.",Exergetic evaluation of operation results of 5-kW-class SOFC-HCCI engine hybrid power generation system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117037
