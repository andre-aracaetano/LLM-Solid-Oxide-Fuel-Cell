4,13095,Degradation was evaluated during galvanostatic steady-state steam electrolysis operation for more than 3000 h at an oxygen side outlet temperature of 816 degrees C and a current density of -0.6 A cm-2 and showed an average voltage evolution rate of -0.3%/kh demonstrating high stability.,Electrochemical Analysis of an Electrolyte-Supported Solid Oxide Cell-Based MK35x Stack during Long-Term Electrolysis Operation,10.1149/1945-7111/ad417f
5,13095,Initial and final characterization at the part load operating point at -0.39 A cm-2 and 800 degrees C led to the determination of a positive overall degradation rate of 0.4%/kh showing a considerable impact of the operating conditions on the degradation rate.,Electrochemical Analysis of an Electrolyte-Supported Solid Oxide Cell-Based MK35x Stack during Long-Term Electrolysis Operation,10.1149/1945-7111/ad417f
6,13095,By means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis it was shown that the stack's ohmic resistance increased whereas the polarization resistance decreased most likely due to an enhancement in LSMM'/ScSZ oxygen electrode performance.,Electrochemical Analysis of an Electrolyte-Supported Solid Oxide Cell-Based MK35x Stack during Long-Term Electrolysis Operation,10.1149/1945-7111/ad417f
