1,17859,A commercially available honeycomb CO oxidation catalyst used to control the exhaust of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based power system has been characterized after prolonged use.,Chromium-induced deactivation of a commercial honeycomb noble metal-based CO oxidation catalyst,10.1016/j.apcata.2013.10.005
2,17859,"X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, N-2 physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to determine the phase composition, the morphology and the chemical state of the various components.",Chromium-induced deactivation of a commercial honeycomb noble metal-based CO oxidation catalyst,10.1016/j.apcata.2013.10.005
3,17859,"Besides sintering of the active phase, deactivation was found to occur mainly as the result of the deposition of chromium-containing species on the catalyst washcoat.",Chromium-induced deactivation of a commercial honeycomb noble metal-based CO oxidation catalyst,10.1016/j.apcata.2013.10.005
4,17859,These fouling species mainly appeared as highly crystalline Cr2O3 particles and could still maintain acceptable CO oxidation activity under dry atmosphere.,Chromium-induced deactivation of a commercial honeycomb noble metal-based CO oxidation catalyst,10.1016/j.apcata.2013.10.005
5,17859,"However, the formation of surface chromium oxyhydroxide species was found to occur in the presence of water vapor, leading to significant catalyst deactivation.",Chromium-induced deactivation of a commercial honeycomb noble metal-based CO oxidation catalyst,10.1016/j.apcata.2013.10.005
