2,19613,"Coarsening of the Ni particles under SOFC working conditions has to be avoided, hence it leads to a deterioration of the anode's performance.","Mechanically alloyed Ni/8YSZ powder mixtures:: preparation, powder characterization and sintering behavior",10.1023/A:1004489002278
3,19613,In the present work the aim was to improve the stability of the Ni particles by a reduction of the sintering activity of nickel.,"Mechanically alloyed Ni/8YSZ powder mixtures:: preparation, powder characterization and sintering behavior",10.1023/A:1004489002278
4,19613,For this purpose between 10 and 50% by volume of nano-sized zirconia particles have been dispersed in the nickel matrix by dry ball milling in a planetary mill.,"Mechanically alloyed Ni/8YSZ powder mixtures:: preparation, powder characterization and sintering behavior",10.1023/A:1004489002278
5,19613,"For pressed samples made of mechanically alloyed Ni with 10 vol % of 8YSZ, a homogeneous dispersion of 8YSZ particles in the Ni matrix was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.","Mechanically alloyed Ni/8YSZ powder mixtures:: preparation, powder characterization and sintering behavior",10.1023/A:1004489002278
6,19613,it was confirmed by mercury porosity penetration and optical microscopy that this dispersoid structure leads to a retardation of recrystallization.,"Mechanically alloyed Ni/8YSZ powder mixtures:: preparation, powder characterization and sintering behavior",10.1023/A:1004489002278
7,19613,"Also, an essentially lowered densification during sintering was found, compared to samples made of the pure Ni powder.","Mechanically alloyed Ni/8YSZ powder mixtures:: preparation, powder characterization and sintering behavior",10.1023/A:1004489002278
8,19613,Samples made of mechanically alloyed Ni with a higher zirconia amount showed a higher densification during sintering and annealing than samples containing 10 vol % 8YSZ.,"Mechanically alloyed Ni/8YSZ powder mixtures:: preparation, powder characterization and sintering behavior",10.1023/A:1004489002278
