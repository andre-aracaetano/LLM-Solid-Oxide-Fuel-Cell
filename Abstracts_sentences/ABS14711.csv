2,14711,This study aims to characterize the diffusion regimes and the possible inaccuracies of the mass transport calculation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) anodes when a volume-averaged pore diameter is used.,3D Characterization of Diffusivities and Its Impact on Mass Flux and Concentration Overpotential in SOFC Anode,10.1149/2.0111704jes
3,14711,"3D pore size distribution ismeasured based on the extracted pore phase from an X-ray CT scan, which is further used for the calculation of a Knudsen number (Kn) map in the porous medium, followed by the voxel-based distribution of the effective diffusion coefficients for different fuel gases.",3D Characterization of Diffusivities and Its Impact on Mass Flux and Concentration Overpotential in SOFC Anode,10.1149/2.0111704jes
4,14711,"Diffusion fluxes in a binary gas mixture using the lower boundary, upper boundary and average effective coefficients are compared, and the impact on overpotential is analyzed.",3D Characterization of Diffusivities and Its Impact on Mass Flux and Concentration Overpotential in SOFC Anode,10.1149/2.0111704jes
5,14711,"The results show that pore diameters from tens to hundreds of nanometers result in a broad range of Knudsen number (1.1 similar to 4.8 and 0.6 similar to 3 for H-2 and CH4 respectively), indicative of the transitional diffusion regime.",3D Characterization of Diffusivities and Its Impact on Mass Flux and Concentration Overpotential in SOFC Anode,10.1149/2.0111704jes
6,14711,"The results highlight that for a porous material, such as an SOFC anode where Knudsen effects are non-negligible, using a volume-averaged pore size can overestimate the mass flux by +/- 200% compared to the actual value.",3D Characterization of Diffusivities and Its Impact on Mass Flux and Concentration Overpotential in SOFC Anode,10.1149/2.0111704jes
7,14711,The characteristic pore size should be chosen sensibly in order to improve the reliability of the mass transport and electrochemical performance evaluation.,3D Characterization of Diffusivities and Its Impact on Mass Flux and Concentration Overpotential in SOFC Anode,10.1149/2.0111704jes
