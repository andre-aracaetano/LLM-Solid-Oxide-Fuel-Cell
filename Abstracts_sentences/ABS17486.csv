1,17486,"Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-delta (PSCFNx, x = 0.1, 0.2) catalysts are prepared and utilized as electrodes in symmetric solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).","Bifunctional electrocatalysts Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2) for the HOR and ORR of a symmetric solid oxide fuel cell",10.1039/d3ta03475e
2,17486,"Although the PSCFNx cathode retains its perovskite phase during operation in SOFCs, the anode is totally decomposed and decorated with an exsolved metallic Ni-Fe alloy (denoted as re-PSCFNx) in a reducing atmosphere.","Bifunctional electrocatalysts Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2) for the HOR and ORR of a symmetric solid oxide fuel cell",10.1039/d3ta03475e
3,17486,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) combined with distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis reveals that the rate-limiting step for the HOR at the anode is the hydrogen adsorption-dissociation process, while the charge transfer process is found to dominate the ORR at the cathode.","Bifunctional electrocatalysts Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2) for the HOR and ORR of a symmetric solid oxide fuel cell",10.1039/d3ta03475e
4,17486,"As the doping of Ni is increased, the cathode polarization resistance for the ORR decreases from 0.19 Omega cm(2) for PSCFN0.1 to 0.09 Omega cm(2) for PSCFN0.2 at 800 degrees C in air.","Bifunctional electrocatalysts Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2) for the HOR and ORR of a symmetric solid oxide fuel cell",10.1039/d3ta03475e
5,17486,"A similar trend is observed for the anode polarization resistance for the HOR, which exhibits a reduction from 2.46 Omega cm(2) of re-PSCFN0.1 to 1.28 Omega cm(2) of re-PSCFN0.2 at 800 degrees C in H-2.","Bifunctional electrocatalysts Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2) for the HOR and ORR of a symmetric solid oxide fuel cell",10.1039/d3ta03475e
6,17486,"When fueled with hydrogen, a single cell based on the PSCFN0.2/La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM)(240 mu m)/re-PSCFN0.2 configuration delivers a maximum power density of 623 mW cm(-2) and slight performance degradation when operated for 220 h at 800 degrees C. Ni doping results in the charge redistribution of B-site ions.","Bifunctional electrocatalysts Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2) for the HOR and ORR of a symmetric solid oxide fuel cell",10.1039/d3ta03475e
7,17486,"Increasing the doping level of Ni results in additional electron transfer channels and oxygen vacancies that adsorb more oxygen species, which facilitates the ORR performance.","Bifunctional electrocatalysts Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2) for the HOR and ORR of a symmetric solid oxide fuel cell",10.1039/d3ta03475e
8,17486,"Furthermore, an increase in the number of Ni-Fe nanoparticles and creation of abundant interfaces in the anode promote the HOR.","Bifunctional electrocatalysts Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2) for the HOR and ORR of a symmetric solid oxide fuel cell",10.1039/d3ta03475e
