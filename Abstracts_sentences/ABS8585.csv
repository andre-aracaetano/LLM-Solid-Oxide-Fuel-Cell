1,8585,"A unique combination of methods (TPD of O-2, thermogravimetry, isotopic heteroexchange of oxygen in different modes) was used to carry out detailed studies of oxygen mobility and reactivity in mixed praseodymium nickelates-cobaltites (PrNi1 - x Co (x) O3 + delta) and their composites with doped cerium dioxide (Ce0.9Y0.1O2 - delta) as promising cathodic materials stable towards the effect of CO2 in the intermediate-temperature region.",Cathodic materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells based on praseodymium nickelates-cobaltites,10.1134/S1023193514070131
2,8585,"It is shown that in the case of composites of PrNi1 - x Co (x) O3+delta-Ce0.9Y0.1O2 - delta synthesized using the Pechini method and ultrasonic treatment, stabilization of the disordered cubic perovskite phase due to redistribution of cations between the phases provides high oxygen mobility.",Cathodic materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells based on praseodymium nickelates-cobaltites,10.1134/S1023193514070131
3,8585,"Preliminary results on tests of cathodic materials of this type supported on planar NiO/YSZ anodes (H.C. Starck) with a thin layer of YSZ electrolyte and a buffer Ce0.9Y0.1O2 - delta layer showed that power density of up to 0.4 W/cm(2) was reached in the region of medium (600-700A degrees C) temperatures, which was close to typical values for fuel cells of this type with cathodes based on strontium-doped perovskites and their composites with electrolytes.",Cathodic materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells based on praseodymium nickelates-cobaltites,10.1134/S1023193514070131
