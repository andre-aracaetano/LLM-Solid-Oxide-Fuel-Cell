1,15174,"This paper presents research on the synthesis and properties of the Mn1.5Co1.5O4 (MC) spinel powder, as well as its application for the preparation of a MC thick film on the AL453 steel to be used for metallic interconnect material in IT-SOFCs.",Mn-Co spinel protective-conductive coating on AL453 ferritic stainless steel for IT-SOFC interconnect applications,10.1007/s10008-012-1952-8
2,15174,"In order to prepare the MC micropowder with excellent homogeneity of the chemical and phase compositions, EDTA gel processes were utilized.",Mn-Co spinel protective-conductive coating on AL453 ferritic stainless steel for IT-SOFC interconnect applications,10.1007/s10008-012-1952-8
3,15174,"In order to improve the contact electrical resistance between an AL453 steel interconnect and the La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSF) cathode and protect the cathode from Cr poisoning, the surface of the AL453 steel was coated with a protective manganese cobaltite spinel matrix using screen printing in combination with an appropriate heat treatment.",Mn-Co spinel protective-conductive coating on AL453 ferritic stainless steel for IT-SOFC interconnect applications,10.1007/s10008-012-1952-8
4,15174,"The oxidation of the AL453/MC composite layer carried out in the air-H2O gas mixture at 1,073 K for 55 h showed that the spinel coating may serve as an effective barrier against outward Cr diffusion from the AL453 steel and, therefore, significantly inhibit the formation of volatile Cr vapors from the chromia scale.",Mn-Co spinel protective-conductive coating on AL453 ferritic stainless steel for IT-SOFC interconnect applications,10.1007/s10008-012-1952-8
5,15174,"The contact ASR study of the interconnect-cathode interface in the AL453/MC/LSCM/LSF/LSCM/MC/AL453 system carried out in the range of 723-1,073 K in air showed a very large drop in ASR compared to the resistance of the AL453/LSCM/LSF/LSCM/AL453 system without the spinel coating.",Mn-Co spinel protective-conductive coating on AL453 ferritic stainless steel for IT-SOFC interconnect applications,10.1007/s10008-012-1952-8
