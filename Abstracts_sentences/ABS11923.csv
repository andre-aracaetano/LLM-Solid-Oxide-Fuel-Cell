1,11923,"Degradation phenomena of La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 (LSCF/CGO) cathodes were investigated via post-mortem analyses of an experimental solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack tested at 700 degrees C for 2000 h using advanced electron microscopy (SEM-EDS, HR-TEM-EDS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS).",Stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathodes during sintering and solid oxide fuel cell operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.064
2,11923,Similar studies were carried out on non-tested reference cells for comparison.,Stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathodes during sintering and solid oxide fuel cell operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.064
3,11923,"The analysis focused on the LSCF/CGO cathode and the CGO barrier layer, as the cathode degradation can be a major contributor to the overall degradation in this type of SOFC.",Stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathodes during sintering and solid oxide fuel cell operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.064
4,11923,SEM-EDS and TOF-SIMS were used to investigate inter-diffusion across the barrier layer electrolyte interface and the barrier layer cathode interface.,Stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathodes during sintering and solid oxide fuel cell operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.064
5,11923,"In addition, TOF-SIMS data were employed to investigate impurity distribution before and after testing.",Stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathodes during sintering and solid oxide fuel cell operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.064
6,11923,HR-TEM-EDS was used to investigate possible phase segregation in the LSCF and to look for reaction between the phases.,Stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathodes during sintering and solid oxide fuel cell operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.064
7,11923,"The results show that phase separation and inter-diffusion across the cathode barrier layer interface and the barrier layer electrolyte interface happened mainly during sintering and cathode firing, and to a very little degree during the test period.",Stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 cathodes during sintering and solid oxide fuel cell operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.064
