3,6351,"In this paper we have studied a metal supported cell (MSC) with a titanate based fuel electrode (La0.4Sr0.4Fe0.03Ni0.03Ti0.94O3, LSFNT) for its fuel cell performance using carbon containing fuel and compared to a state of the art (SoA) fuel electrode supported cell with a Ni/YSZ fuel electrode.",Low Temperature Performance and Durability of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Titanate Based Fuel Electrodes Using Reformate Fuel,10.1149/1945-7111/acbb31
4,6351,"In hydrogen fuel, the cells showed similar performance at intermediate and low temperatures (750 degrees C to 650 degrees C), although the ASR is slightly higher for the MSC at all temperatures and steam/hydrogen ratios.",Low Temperature Performance and Durability of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Titanate Based Fuel Electrodes Using Reformate Fuel,10.1149/1945-7111/acbb31
5,6351,"Additionally, the MSC showed fair initial performance in reformate type fuel compositions (CO/steam and CO/steam/hydrogen), i.e. the fuel electrode possesses activity for the water gas shift reaction, which opens the possibility to use such cells with hydrocarbon fuels after a pre-reformer.",Low Temperature Performance and Durability of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Titanate Based Fuel Electrodes Using Reformate Fuel,10.1149/1945-7111/acbb31
6,6351,Durability testing in pre-reformed fuel gas revealed that further fuel electrode tailoring is required to minimize cell degradation in carbon containing fuels.,Low Temperature Performance and Durability of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Titanate Based Fuel Electrodes Using Reformate Fuel,10.1149/1945-7111/acbb31
