1,17082,"Incorporating the mechanistic model for oxygen reduction at YSZ/LSM interface, a complete micro-model for YSZ/LSM composite cathode considering all forms of polarization was developed which established the interrelationship among the transport phenomena, electrochemical processes and the microstructure of the composite cathode.",Simulation of a composite cathode in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2003.12.015
2,17082,The exchange current densities of the rate-limiting steps used in the simulation were obtained by fitting the proposed mechanistic model to the DC polarization curves.,Simulation of a composite cathode in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2003.12.015
