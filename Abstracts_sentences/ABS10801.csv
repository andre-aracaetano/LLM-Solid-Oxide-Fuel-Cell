1,10801,"La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LSCF) has been sputtered on bare Si and Si3N4 and yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) thin films to investigate annealing temperature- and thickness-dependent microstructure and functional properties, as well as their implications for designing failure-resistant micro-solid oxide fuel cell (mu SOFC) membranes The LSCF thin films crystallise in the 400-500 degrees C range, however, after annealing in the 600-700 degrees C range, cracks are observed.",Microstructure and Microfabrication Considerations for Self-Supported On-Chip Ultra-Thin Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes,10.1002/fuce.200800144
2,10801,The formation of cracks is also thickness-dependent.,Microstructure and Microfabrication Considerations for Self-Supported On-Chip Ultra-Thin Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes,10.1002/fuce.200800144
3,10801,"High electrical conductivity, similar to 520 Scm(-1) at 600 degrees C, and low activation energy, similar to 0.13 eV, in the 400-600 degrees C range, are still maintained for LSCF films as thin as 27 nm.",Microstructure and Microfabrication Considerations for Self-Supported On-Chip Ultra-Thin Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes,10.1002/fuce.200800144
4,10801,"Based on these studies, a strong correlation between microstructure and electrical conductivity has been observed and an annealing temperature-thickness design space that is complementary to temperature-stress design space has been proposed for designing reliable membranes using sputtered LSCF thin films.",Microstructure and Microfabrication Considerations for Self-Supported On-Chip Ultra-Thin Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes,10.1002/fuce.200800144
5,10801,Microfabrication approaches that maintain the highest possible surface and interface quality of heterostructured membranes have been carefully examined.,Microstructure and Microfabrication Considerations for Self-Supported On-Chip Ultra-Thin Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes,10.1002/fuce.200800144
6,10801,"By taking advantage of the microstructure, microfabrication and geometrical structural considerations, we were able to successfully fabricated large-area, self-supported membranes These results are also relevant to conventional or grid-supported SOFC membranes using ultrathin nanocrystalline cathodes and mu SOFCs using cathode thin films other than LSCF",Microstructure and Microfabrication Considerations for Self-Supported On-Chip Ultra-Thin Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes,10.1002/fuce.200800144
