5,9630,"The ratio of proton conductivity to ionic conductivity including the oxygen-ion conductivity of this material was 98% at 600 degrees C, indicating that it is a relatively pure proton conductor with most of the ionic conduction almost exclusively carried out by protons.",Electrical properties of BaZr0.5Ce0.3Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ proton conductor for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2023.118800
6,9630,"Chemical diffusivities were calculated from Fick's 2nd law by non-linear least squares fitting during oxidation/reduction and hydration/dehydration processes and were faster than other proton conductor BZCY (Y-doped BaCeO3-BaZrO3) series, which have a similar zirconium contents.",Electrical properties of BaZr0.5Ce0.3Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ proton conductor for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2023.118800
7,9630,"In addition, the theoretical performance and efficiency of the reversible P-SOEC were determined from the spatial distribution of oxygen and hydrogen partial pressure in BZCYYb5311, calculating the maximum power density (4.5 Wcm(-2) at 600 degrees C, 3% of water vapor pressure) for the fuel cell mode and current density (12.3 Acm(-2) at 1.5 V, 600 degrees C, and 20% of water vapor pressure) for the electrolysis mode.",Electrical properties of BaZr0.5Ce0.3Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ proton conductor for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2023.118800
8,9630,"The fuel consumption efficiency is high (99.1% at 0.6 V at 600 degrees C), while the electrolysis efficiency is low (72.3% at 1.6 V) due to the dominant p-type regime in the electrolyte during electrolysis.",Electrical properties of BaZr0.5Ce0.3Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ proton conductor for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2023.118800
9,9630,"This low electrolysis efficiency can be enhanced by recovering the electrolyte regime by increasing pH(2)O or decreasing pO(2) in the air electrode; however, it will still have low efficiency.",Electrical properties of BaZr0.5Ce0.3Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ proton conductor for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2023.118800
10,9630,"Consequently, BZCYYb5311 is not an efficient electrolyte material for electrolyzers, but is promising for fuel cells because of its superior chemical stability, exceptional pure proton conductivity, and better bulk diffusion than those of the BZCY system.",Electrical properties of BaZr0.5Ce0.3Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ proton conductor for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2023.118800
