1,4228,"Chromites, titanates and Pt-YSZ-CeO, cermets have been investigated as potential electrode materials for an alternative concept of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), the symmetrical SOFCs (SFC).",Potential electrode materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.172
2,4228,"In this Configuration, the same electrode material is used simultaneously as anode and cathode.",Potential electrode materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.172
3,4228,"Interconnector materials, Such as chromites, Could be considered as potential SFC electrodes, at least Under pore hydrogen-fed at relatively high temperatures, as they do not exhibit significant catalytic activity towards hydrocarbon oxidation.",Potential electrode materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.172
4,4228,"This may be overcome by partially Substituting Cr in the perovskite B-sites by other transition metal Cations Such as Mn. La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) is a good candidate for such SFCs, rendering fuel cell performances in excess of 500 and 300mW/cm(2) using pure H-2 and CH4 as fuel, at 950 degrees",Potential electrode materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.172
5,4228,"C. Similarly, typical n-type electronic conductors traditionally regarded as anode materials, Such as strontium titanates, may also operate under oxidising conditions as cathodes by substituting some Ti content for Fe to introduce p-type conductivity.",Potential electrode materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.172
6,4228,"Preliminary electrochemical experiments on La4Sr8Ti12-xFexO38-delta-based SFCs show that they perform reasonably well under humidified H-2, at high temperatures.",Potential electrode materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.172
7,4228,"A third group of materials is the Support material of any typical cermet anode, i.e. YSZ, CeO2 plus a current collector.",Potential electrode materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.172
8,4228,"It has been found that this combination Could be optimised to operate as SFC electrodes, rendering performances of 400mW/cm(2) under humidified pore H-2 at 950 degrees C.",Potential electrode materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3989/cyv.2008.v47.i4.172
