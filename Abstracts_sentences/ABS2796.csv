1,2796,"The dry reformate and wet reformate operations of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with 200 nm-thick, nanoporous Ni thin-film anode were investigated in terms of power performance at 500 degrees C.","Stability Enhancement of Reformate-Fueled, Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Nickel Thin-Film Anode by Water Bubbling",10.1007/s40684-022-00484-2
2,2796,"The initial power density of the SOFC fueled with dry reformate (H-2 75%, CO 10%, CO2 10%, CH4 5%) was 5% lower than that of the SOFC fueled with H-2, which was almost similar to that of the SOFC fueled with wet reformate humidified by water bubbling at room temperature.","Stability Enhancement of Reformate-Fueled, Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Nickel Thin-Film Anode by Water Bubbling",10.1007/s40684-022-00484-2
3,2796,The reduction rate in power density of the SOFC fueled with the dry reformate was as high as 6%/hr; the reduction rate in power density of the SOFC fueled with the wet reformate was decreased by 55% through carbon poisoning alleviation of the Ni thin-film anode.,"Stability Enhancement of Reformate-Fueled, Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Nickel Thin-Film Anode by Water Bubbling",10.1007/s40684-022-00484-2
