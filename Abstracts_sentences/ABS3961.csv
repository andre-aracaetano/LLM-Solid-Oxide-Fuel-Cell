1,3961,A novel mica-based compressive seal concept was examined at elevated temperatures under compressive stress to evaluate its stability.,Mid-term stability of novel mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00020-X
2,3961,"The hybrid mica compressive seals, composed of cleaved Muscovite mica and two compliant inter-layers, were reported earlier to have very low leak rates at 800 degreesC. In the present study, we examined the mid-term (similar to350-700 h) stability of the mica-based compressive seals with three different inter-layers: a low melting borosilicate glass, a glass ceramic material, and a metallic material.",Mid-term stability of novel mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00020-X
3,3961,The 800 degreesC leak test results showed excellent stability for the three different inter-layers in air at a compressive stress of 100 psi as the leak rates remained almost unchanged during the test.,Mid-term stability of novel mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00020-X
4,3961,Microstructural characterization of the interfaces showed very limited interfacial reaction or glass penetration at the glass/8YSZ substrate interface.,Mid-term stability of novel mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00020-X
5,3961,The results clearly demonstrate the applicability of the mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells.,Mid-term stability of novel mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00020-X
