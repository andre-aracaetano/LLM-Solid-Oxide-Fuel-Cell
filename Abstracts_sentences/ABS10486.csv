1,10486,The solid oxide fuel cell nanometer composite cathodes were prepared by infiltration of La(0.6)sr(0.4)Co(0.8)Fe(0.2)O(3-delta)(LSCF) precursor solution into porous Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9(SDC) scaffolds followed by being calcined at 800 degrees C for 4 h. The composition and the microstructure of the cathodes were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM).,Preparation and Oxygen-reduction Mechanism Investigation of Nanostructure LSCF-SDC Composite Cathodes,10.15541/jim20160330
2,10486,"Average particle size of the LSCF phase is about 50 nm after being calcined at 800 degrees C for 4 h. The reduction reaction mechanism of O-2 in the LSCF/SDC cathodes and the influence of LSCF loadings on the cathode properties were studied in terms of frequency response, electrode resistance and reaction order at different oxygen partial pressures p(O-2).",Preparation and Oxygen-reduction Mechanism Investigation of Nanostructure LSCF-SDC Composite Cathodes,10.15541/jim20160330
3,10486,Three elementary steps are considered to be involved in the cathodes reaction: (1) absorption and dissociation of molecular O-2; (2) oxygen ion conduction in the bulk cathode; (3) oxygen ion transfer at the cathode-electrolyte interface.,Preparation and Oxygen-reduction Mechanism Investigation of Nanostructure LSCF-SDC Composite Cathodes,10.15541/jim20160330
4,10486,The oxygen ion conduction in the bulk cathode is found to be the rate-determining steps in the nano-sized LSCF-SDC composite cathode.,Preparation and Oxygen-reduction Mechanism Investigation of Nanostructure LSCF-SDC Composite Cathodes,10.15541/jim20160330
5,10486,The reduction reaction mechanism of O-2 in the cathodes is similar to the samples with different LSCF loadings.,Preparation and Oxygen-reduction Mechanism Investigation of Nanostructure LSCF-SDC Composite Cathodes,10.15541/jim20160330
6,10486,The polar resistance of the cathode firstly decreases and then increases with increasing the LSCF loadings.,Preparation and Oxygen-reduction Mechanism Investigation of Nanostructure LSCF-SDC Composite Cathodes,10.15541/jim20160330
7,10486,The cathode polar resistance reaches the lowest when the volume fraction of LSCF loadings is 16.5vol%.,Preparation and Oxygen-reduction Mechanism Investigation of Nanostructure LSCF-SDC Composite Cathodes,10.15541/jim20160330
