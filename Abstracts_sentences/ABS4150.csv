1,4150,"A typical biogas system with three utilization pathways, i. e., biogas upgrading, biogas combined heat and power (CHP), biogas solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were designed.","Energetic-environmental-economic assessment of the biogas system with three utilization pathways: Combined heat and power, biomethane and fuel cell",10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.026
2,4150,"It was assessed from the viewpoint of energy, environment and economy by using energy efficiency, green degree and net present value index respectively.","Energetic-environmental-economic assessment of the biogas system with three utilization pathways: Combined heat and power, biomethane and fuel cell",10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.026
3,4150,"The assessment considered the trade-off relationships among these indexes, which is more comprehensive than previous systematic evaluation work only included single or two of the pathway(s) by using one or two of the index(es).","Energetic-environmental-economic assessment of the biogas system with three utilization pathways: Combined heat and power, biomethane and fuel cell",10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.026
4,4150,Assessment results indicated that biogas upgrading pathway has the highest systematic energy efficiency (46.5%) and shortest payback period (8.9 year) with the green degree production is the lowest (9.29 gd/day).,"Energetic-environmental-economic assessment of the biogas system with three utilization pathways: Combined heat and power, biomethane and fuel cell",10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.026
5,4150,"While for biogas SOFC pathway, although the green degree production is the highest (21.77 gd/day), the payback period is longer (14.5 year) and the energy efficiency is 13.6% lower than the biogas upgrading pathway.","Energetic-environmental-economic assessment of the biogas system with three utilization pathways: Combined heat and power, biomethane and fuel cell",10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.026
