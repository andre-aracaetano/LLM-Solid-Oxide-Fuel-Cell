1,5116,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have advanced rapidly for the last decades.,Effects of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia with copper oxide on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.144
2,5116,"Since 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) has been considered the most conventional material for SOFC electrolyte, a number of studies have been focused on improving 8YSZ performance by changing dopants or adding a trace of metal oxide.",Effects of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia with copper oxide on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.144
3,5116,"In this study, the effect of a trace of CuO (100 ppm) on the performance of 8YSZ-based SOFCs is investigated.",Effects of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia with copper oxide on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.144
4,5116,It is found that addition of a trace of CuO not only promotes a densification of the YSZ electrolyte by acting as a sintering aid but also increases the amount of the oxygen vacancy in the YSZ electrolyte.,Effects of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia with copper oxide on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.144
5,5116,"The ionic conductivities are about 0.0173 S cm(-1) and 0.0196 S cm(-1) in pristine and CuO (100 ppm) YSZ electrolyte, respectively.",Effects of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia with copper oxide on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.144
6,5116,"The cell performance is about 0.5103 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, which is about 1.5 times higher than the cell based on the pure YSZ electrolyte.",Effects of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia with copper oxide on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.144
7,5116,The gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC)/8YSZ bilayer cell test also shows similar improvement to the single YSZ cell tests.,Effects of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia with copper oxide on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.144
8,5116,"Thus, the introduction of a trace of Cu (100 ppm) to the 8YSZ can be promising for a solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte.",Effects of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia with copper oxide on solid oxide fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.02.144
