2,12793,"As an effect of Sr substitution in A-site of perovskite, ASR of Nd0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (NSC55) was 0.14 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC55) on Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CGO91) and Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (CSO82) showed the lowest ASR as 0.10 Omega cm(2) and 0.085 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C among various perovskite compositions in this study.",Performance analysis of cobalt-based cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.086
3,12793,ASR of B-site substituted Pr0.3Sr0.7Co0.3Fe0.7O3-delta (PSCF3737) in the Pr0.3Sr0.7Co1-yFeyO3-delta Was about 0.,Performance analysis of cobalt-based cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.086
4,12793,"13 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Comparing ASR of SSC55 as a perovskite structure with the value Of Sm0.5Sr1.5Co1-yFeyO4-delta (y=0, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) as a spinel structure, the ASR of SSC55 was 0.085 Omega cm(2).",Performance analysis of cobalt-based cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.086
5,12793,"However, the value of Sm0.5Sr1.5Co1-yFeyO4-delta (y=0, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) was much higher than SSC55 at 700 degrees C.",Performance analysis of cobalt-based cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.086
