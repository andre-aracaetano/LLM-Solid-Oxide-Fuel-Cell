4,20699,"Conclusions of the paper's evaluation include: (1) effective instantaneous balancing of the dehumidifier and regenerator across a range of environmental and operational values, (2) operation of the dehumidifier is dictated, to some degree by the available thermal energy (CHP prime mover, process heat), (3) encouraging thermal COP values, for a system of this scale, in the range of 0.4-0.66 are achievable with a low-grade thermal input (45-60 degrees C) typical of an SOFC CHP system and (4) potential for non-synchronous operation in a tri-generation system context, bringing about improvements to peak cooling output and total system efficiency.",Experimental evaluation of a liquid desiccant air conditioning system for tri-generation/waste-heat-driven applications,10.1093/ijlct/ctw012
