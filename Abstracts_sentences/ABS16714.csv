7,16714,The consideration of vibrational contributions to the free formation energy of Y on Zr site shows an increase of the stability of Y-Zr(0) and Y-Zr(1-),Y doping of BaZrO3 may lead to optimum conditions for proton conduction at operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells: a first principles study,10.1088/2053-1591/acd98e
8,16714,Under Ba-rich conditions Fermi level pinning results in a free formation energy for the doubly positively charged O vacancy of 0.481 eV which corresponds to a high V-O(2+) concentration and optimum conditions for proton conduction.,Y doping of BaZrO3 may lead to optimum conditions for proton conduction at operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells: a first principles study,10.1088/2053-1591/acd98e
9,16714,In Zr-rich case the respective value is 0.863 eV which leads also to relatively high V-O(2+) occurrence but the situation is less favourable than for the Ba-rich environment.,Y doping of BaZrO3 may lead to optimum conditions for proton conduction at operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells: a first principles study,10.1088/2053-1591/acd98e
