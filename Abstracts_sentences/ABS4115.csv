1,4115,A series of barium aluminosilicate glasses modified with CaO and B2O3 were prepared and evaluated with respect to their suitability in sealing planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Synthesis and properties of a barium aluminosilicate solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.079
2,4115,"At a target operating temperature of 750 degrees C, the long-term coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of one particular composition (35 mol% BaO, 15 mol% CaO, 10 mol% B2O3, 5 mol% Al2O3, and bal. SiO2) was found to be particularly stable, due to devitrification to a mixture of glass and ceramic phases.",Synthesis and properties of a barium aluminosilicate solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.079
3,4115,"This sealant composition exhibits minimal chemical interaction with the yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte, yet forms a strong bond with this material.",Synthesis and properties of a barium aluminosilicate solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.079
