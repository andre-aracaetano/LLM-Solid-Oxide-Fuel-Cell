1,19274,A simple configuration for an Fe-air rechargeable battery operating at high temperature was investigated.,Iron-Air Battery Operating at High Temperature,10.1002/ente.201600438
2,19274,"Two different ceramic electrolytes, that is, gadolinia-doped ceria (CGO) and strontium/magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM), were studied.",Iron-Air Battery Operating at High Temperature,10.1002/ente.201600438
3,19274,"Strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite-cobaltite (LSFCO) perovskite was used as the air electrode, whereas an Fe-0/Fe2O3-CGO composite was used as the Fe electrode.",Iron-Air Battery Operating at High Temperature,10.1002/ente.201600438
4,19274,The synthesized CGO and LSGM supporting electrolytes were characterized by proper ionic conductivity for this application (7.4x10(-2) Scm(-1) at 800 degrees C).,Iron-Air Battery Operating at High Temperature,10.1002/ente.201600438
5,19274,The LSFCO perovskite electrode showed excellent reversibility in symmetrical cells.,Iron-Air Battery Operating at High Temperature,10.1002/ente.201600438
6,19274,Low overpotentials were recorded for the evolution of oxygen (0.1 V at 1.7 Acm(-2)) and the oxygen reduction process (0.1 V at 2.4 Acm(-2)) at 800 degrees C.,Iron-Air Battery Operating at High Temperature,10.1002/ente.201600438
7,19274,The high-temperature battery based on the CGO electrolyte showed a pronounced propensity to spontaneously discharge.,Iron-Air Battery Operating at High Temperature,10.1002/ente.201600438
8,19274,"This was caused by redox behavior involving the interconversion between the Ce4+ and Ce3+ ions in the crystallographic structure, which caused a parasitic electron drag through the electrolyte.",Iron-Air Battery Operating at High Temperature,10.1002/ente.201600438
9,19274,"On the other hand, the LSGM-based battery showed promising cyclability characteristics at 800 degrees C with an open-circuit voltage higher than 1V, an electric capacity of 0.3 Ahg(-1), and an energy density of 0.22 Whg(-1).",Iron-Air Battery Operating at High Temperature,10.1002/ente.201600438
10,19274,"However, significant improvements in the coulombic efficiency (approximate to 42%) for this battery system are necessary for practical applications.",Iron-Air Battery Operating at High Temperature,10.1002/ente.201600438
