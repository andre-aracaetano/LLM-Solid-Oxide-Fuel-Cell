5,12682,Under SOFC stack conditions rapidly growing oxide nodules were observed bridging the 200 mu m seal gal) between the metallic components after a few hundred hours of operation.,Chemical interaction between glass-ceramic sealants and interconnect steels in SOFC stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.046
6,12682,"These oxide nodules, rich in iron, gave rise to local short-circuiting effects eventually resulting in stack failure.",Chemical interaction between glass-ceramic sealants and interconnect steels in SOFC stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.046
7,12682,"The present study, combined with recent model investigations triggered by the stack results, indicates that severe degradation only occurs in the case of glass-ceramic sealants which contain minor amounts of PbO. Furthermore, the rate of corrosion attack of the metallic components strongly depends on the silicon (Si) content of the ferritic steel.",Chemical interaction between glass-ceramic sealants and interconnect steels in SOFC stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.046
8,12682,"The stack tests suggest that increasing the Si content increases the corrosion rate, and thus detrimentally influences the stack performance.",Chemical interaction between glass-ceramic sealants and interconnect steels in SOFC stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.046
