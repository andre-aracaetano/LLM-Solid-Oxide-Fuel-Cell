1,14681,Oxygen vacancy (V-O) formation energy and its migration barrier are two determining factors for the effectiveness of solid electrolytes (SEs) in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,"Insight into the Mechanism of the Ionic Conductivity for Ln-Doped Ceria (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) through First-Principles Calculation",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01853
2,14681,"In this work, a series of aliovalent rare-earth-doped ceria (Ln(x)Ce(1-x)O(2-delta), Ln = lanthanides) compounds serving as SEs are comprehensively and comparatively calculated, through which the determinant factors for oxygen vacancy formations and their migration activity are figured out at an atomistic level via the first-principles calculations with the consideration of electronic correlations.","Insight into the Mechanism of the Ionic Conductivity for Ln-Doped Ceria (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) through First-Principles Calculation",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01853
3,14681,"Initially, it is found that the oxygen vacancy formation energies of the Ln-doped ceria are largely reduced in contrast to the undoped ceria (CeO2-delta), which obviously agree with the literature.","Insight into the Mechanism of the Ionic Conductivity for Ln-Doped Ceria (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) through First-Principles Calculation",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01853
4,14681,"Then, the migration activity of an oxygen vacancy in Ln(x)Ce(1-x)O(2-delta) is closely correlated to the association energies of Ln-V-O, in which the different 4fSd bonding properties for different Ln ions should be taken into account.","Insight into the Mechanism of the Ionic Conductivity for Ln-Doped Ceria (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) through First-Principles Calculation",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01853
5,14681,"Additionally, the analysis of charge difference gradient (CDG) is revealed to be the intrinsic driving force for oxygen vacancy migration.","Insight into the Mechanism of the Ionic Conductivity for Ln-Doped Ceria (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) through First-Principles Calculation",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01853
6,14681,"We hope that our investigation provides a microscopic insight into the oxygen vacancy defect physics, and it is also a benefit for the design of more advanced relevant functional materials.","Insight into the Mechanism of the Ionic Conductivity for Ln-Doped Ceria (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) through First-Principles Calculation",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b01853
