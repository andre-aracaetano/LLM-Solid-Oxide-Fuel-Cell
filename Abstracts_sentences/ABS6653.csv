1,6653,"A two-dimensional axisymmetric micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SOFC) model is developed to study the influence of component (anode, cathode or electrolyte) thickness on residual stress at the room temperature.",Residual stress analysis of a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.256
2,6653,The results show that the anode is mainly subjected to tension stress while electrolyte and cathode are mostly exposed to compressive stress.,Residual stress analysis of a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.256
3,6653,"However, the stress in a component can be reduced by increasing its thickness with other components unchanged.",Residual stress analysis of a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.256
4,6653,"Then the Weibull analysis method is adopted to calculate the failure probability of the anode, it is found that the anode is prone to failure with a thinner anode or thicker cathode and electrolyte; the electrolyte thickness has a more significant effect on the anode failure probability than the cathode; and the component thickness must be coordinated in order to maximize the mechanical performance.",Residual stress analysis of a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.256
5,6653,"The formula of the minimum anode thickness under the failure probability criterion 1E-6 is given, which brings considerable convenience to the design of MT-SOFC.",Residual stress analysis of a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.256
