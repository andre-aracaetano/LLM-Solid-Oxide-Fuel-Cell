2,6367,"Here, it is shown that in multilayer heteroepitaxial films prepared by alternately stacking conventional mixed ionic and electronic conductors of (La0.6Sr0.4)CoO3-delta (LSC) and gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC), extremely fast oxide ion incorporation and transport can be achieved at relatively lower temperatures.",Multilayered LSC and GDC: An approach for designing cathode materials with superior oxygen exchange properties for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.014
3,6367,Multilayer LSC and GDC heteroepitaxial films prepared on YSZ electrolytes exhibit enhanced oxygen surface exchange coefficient (k*) values as compared to single LSC thin films.,Multilayered LSC and GDC: An approach for designing cathode materials with superior oxygen exchange properties for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.014
4,6367,"This is attributed to the existence of Ce3+ induced by the LSC-GDC interface, implying the presence of a relatively high density of oxygen vacancies which facilitate oxide ion incorporation and transport.",Multilayered LSC and GDC: An approach for designing cathode materials with superior oxygen exchange properties for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.014
5,6367,"Accordingly, unprecedented values of k* in the order of 10(-5) cm/s were obtained for LSC-GDC multilayer thin film cathodes even at a relatively low temperature of 500 degrees C.",Multilayered LSC and GDC: An approach for designing cathode materials with superior oxygen exchange properties for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.014
6,6367,The results here conclusively show that leveraging the effect of heterointerfaces through multilayering can be a viable approach to achieving superior cathode materials with enhanced oxygen exchange properties.,Multilayered LSC and GDC: An approach for designing cathode materials with superior oxygen exchange properties for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.014
