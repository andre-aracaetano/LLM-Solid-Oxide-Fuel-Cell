1,636,A common approach to reliable load-following is to slave fuel cell response to the reactants supply subsystem (e.g. fuel processor).,Simulating process settings for unslaved SOFC response to increases in load demand,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00088-5
2,636,"A change-in-power demand may be time-sensitive, however, and slaving the fuel cell response to that of the slower balance-of-plant components may not be practical.",Simulating process settings for unslaved SOFC response to increases in load demand,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00088-5
3,636,A model has been constructed to simulate the unrestrained load-following characteristics of a commercial-grade fuel cell.,Simulating process settings for unslaved SOFC response to increases in load demand,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00088-5
4,636,"Analyses have shown that initial conditions exist which facilitate timely responses to increases in load demand, among them lower fuel utilization, larger operating voltage and optimized cell potential reduction.",Simulating process settings for unslaved SOFC response to increases in load demand,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00088-5
