2,2034,A thin electron-blocking interlayer was formed in situ at the anode/electrolyte interface when the anode-supported half cell was prepared via a high-temperature sintering process.,"In-situ formed Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ@Ba (Ce, Zr)1-x(Sm, Y)xO3-δ core/shell electron-blocking layer towards Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ-based solid oxide fuel cells with high open circuit voltages",10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.06.018
3,2034,"Raman spectra and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) results revealed that the electron-blocking interlayer consisted of Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta@Ba(Ce, Zr)(1-x)(Sm, Y)(x)O3-delta core/shell-like grains.","In-situ formed Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ@Ba (Ce, Zr)1-x(Sm, Y)xO3-δ core/shell electron-blocking layer towards Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ-based solid oxide fuel cells with high open circuit voltages",10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.06.018
4,2034,"The Ba(Ce, Zr)(1-x),(Sm, Y)(x)O3-delta shell protected SDC grains from reduction and consequently the electronic conduction through the SDC electrolyte film was nearly completely eliminated in the new structured fuel cell.","In-situ formed Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ@Ba (Ce, Zr)1-x(Sm, Y)xO3-δ core/shell electron-blocking layer towards Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ-based solid oxide fuel cells with high open circuit voltages",10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.06.018
5,2034,"The fuel cell exhibited significantly improved open circuit voltages (OCVs), high power densities as well as good operating durability, demonstrating that BZY-Ni is a promising anode for CeO2-based SOFCs operating at a higher efficiency.","In-situ formed Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ@Ba (Ce, Zr)1-x(Sm, Y)xO3-δ core/shell electron-blocking layer towards Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ-based solid oxide fuel cells with high open circuit voltages",10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.06.018
