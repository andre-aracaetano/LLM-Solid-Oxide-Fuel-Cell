1,2391,Composites consisting of silver and yttria stabilized bismuth oxide (YSB) have been investigated as cathodes for low-temperature honeycomb solid oxide fuel cells with stabilized zirconia as electrolytes.,Composite cathode based on yttria stabilized bismuth oxide for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.1542933
2,2391,"At 600 degreesC, the interfacial polarization resistances of a porous YSB-Ag cathode is about 0.3 Omega cm(2), more than one order of magnitude smaller than those of other reported cathodes on stabilized zirconia.",Composite cathode based on yttria stabilized bismuth oxide for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.1542933
3,2391,"For example, the interfacial resistances of a traditional YSZ-lanthanum maganites composite cathode is about 11.4 Omega cm(2) at 600 degreesC. Impedance analysis indicated that the performance of an YSB-Ag composite cathode fired at 850 degreesC for 2 h is severely limited by gas transport due to insufficient porosity.",Composite cathode based on yttria stabilized bismuth oxide for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.1542933
4,2391,The high performance of the YSB-Ag cathodes is very encouraging for developing honeycomb fuel cells to be operated at temperatures below 600 degreesC.
