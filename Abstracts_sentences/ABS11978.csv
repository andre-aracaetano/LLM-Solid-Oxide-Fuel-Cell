1,11978,A dense BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BZY) proton-conducting electrolyte membrane is successfully fabricated on a NiO-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (NiO-BZCY) anode substrate by a co-pressing process after co-firing at 1400 degrees C. BZY powders are synthesized via a citric acid-nitrate gel combustion process after calcination at 1100 degrees C.,Fabrication and performance of a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell based on a thin BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ electrolyte membrane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.012
