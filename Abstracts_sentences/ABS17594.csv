1,17594,In this research a cell stack with standard power output of 100 [W] was tested over a period of 3700 h. After the long-term operation a subsequent post-test analysis of the anode microstructure was conducted using a combination of focused ion beam and scanning electron microscopy.,Local evolution of anode microstructure morphology in a solid oxide fuel cell after long-term stack operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.092
