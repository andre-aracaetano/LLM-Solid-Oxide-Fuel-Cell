1,851,"Despite the significant experimental work in flame-assisted fuel cells (FFCs), a detailed model of FFC polarization losses does not exist in the literature.",Modeling of the Kinetic Factors in Flame-Assisted Fuel Cells,10.3390/su14074121
2,851,This paper thus presents a combination of theoretical and empirical models to describe the performance of FFCs.,Modeling of the Kinetic Factors in Flame-Assisted Fuel Cells,10.3390/su14074121
3,851,Previous models for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) polarization losses typically assumed values of the charge transfer coefficient (alpha) of 0.5 and a Nernst diffusion layer thickness (delta) equal to the anode thickness.,Modeling of the Kinetic Factors in Flame-Assisted Fuel Cells,10.3390/su14074121
4,851,"The theoretical model developed in this work, parametrized in alpha and delta, is empirically fitted to the experimental polarization curves to understand the variation of these parameters while the FFC operates with different fuel partial pressures.",Modeling of the Kinetic Factors in Flame-Assisted Fuel Cells,10.3390/su14074121
5,851,"Model results indicate that at low fuel concentrations (C-R,C-0), the current density of the fuel cell (j) is limited by mass transfer limitations.",Modeling of the Kinetic Factors in Flame-Assisted Fuel Cells,10.3390/su14074121
6,851,"As C-R,C-0 increases, j is then limited by activation due to the limited number of activation sites in the fuel cell.",Modeling of the Kinetic Factors in Flame-Assisted Fuel Cells,10.3390/su14074121
7,851,"Activation loss (eta(act)) remains constant at low C-R,C-0 (concentration limited) and increases rapidly with an increase in C-R,C-0 under activation-limited conditions.",Modeling of the Kinetic Factors in Flame-Assisted Fuel Cells,10.3390/su14074121
8,851,"The value of alpha, which varies significantly from 0.5, under concentration-limited conditions remains constant at similar to 0.24 and decreases rapidly with C-R,C-0 under activation-limited conditions.",Modeling of the Kinetic Factors in Flame-Assisted Fuel Cells,10.3390/su14074121
9,851,"The value of .5, which is much smaller than anode thickness, remains constant at -10 mu m under concentration-limited conditions and increases to a constant value of similar to 17.5 mu m under activation limitations.",Modeling of the Kinetic Factors in Flame-Assisted Fuel Cells,10.3390/su14074121
10,851,"Overcoming activation losses under high C-R,C-0 conditions requires further investigation of FFCs.",Modeling of the Kinetic Factors in Flame-Assisted Fuel Cells,10.3390/su14074121
