2,10292,"For LCFN/STO, X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electronmicroscopy show film growth along (100) direction.","Pulsed laser deposition of La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3 - δ thin films on SrTiO3: Preparation, characterization and electrical properties",10.1016/j.tsf.2014.10.074
3,10292,The electrical resistivity measurements reveal that PO2= 40,"Pulsed laser deposition of La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3 - δ thin films on SrTiO3: Preparation, characterization and electrical properties",10.1016/j.tsf.2014.10.074
4,10292,Pa provides an optimumelectrical propertieswith an electrical conductivity as high as 69 Scm(-1) and small polaron activation energy of 0.09 eV. It is attributed to increased films oxygen concentration and enhanced grains intimate contact.,"Pulsed laser deposition of La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3 - δ thin films on SrTiO3: Preparation, characterization and electrical properties",10.1016/j.tsf.2014.10.074
