3,9896,"To address this issue, a link function degradation model is proposed, and its parameters are identified online with a cyclic batch identification procedure based on the maximum likelihood method, which provides results representing the degradation trend on a timescale of 103h.",Online identification of a link function degradation model for solid oxide fuel cells under varying-load operation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.177
4,9896,"The link function takes the form of an empirical function, which describes how operating parameters affect the degradation and is easy to integrate with control designs.",Online identification of a link function degradation model for solid oxide fuel cells under varying-load operation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.177
5,9896,The existence of the link function is proven on the varying-load experiment datasets of two flat-chip SOFCs because it statistically improves the prediction accuracy and stability compared with a constant degradation speed model.,Online identification of a link function degradation model for solid oxide fuel cells under varying-load operation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.177
