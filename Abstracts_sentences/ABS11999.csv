5,11999,"Further, it is found that only 1/3 of the oxygen-ion vacancies, i.e. those that are replaceable by protons, participate in the conduction process, while the remaining deeply trapped V-O(..) are virtually immobilized.",Galvanic cell measurements on a fast proton conducting complex perovskite electrolyte,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00409-2
6,11999,"With an electrolyte disc of 1.0 mm thickness, a hydrogen fuel cell operating at 500-600 degrees C is shown to generate an open circuit voltage of 1.0 V and short circuit current density near 130 mA/cm(2), Also, no electrolytic degradation with respect to the cell EMF was detected after operation in O-2 or CO/CO2 gases for more than 100 h, These qualities make the compound an excellent candidate as a solid oxide electrolyte for hydrogen fuel cells, humidity/hydrogen sensors and pumps.",Galvanic cell measurements on a fast proton conducting complex perovskite electrolyte,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00409-2
