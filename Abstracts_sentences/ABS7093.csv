1,7093,A novel La0.9Ca0.1Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-delta(LCFNb) perovskite for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) anode is prepared by means of the citrate-nitrate route and composited with Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) by impregnation method to form nano-scaled LCFNb/SDC anode catalytic layers.,Efficient and stable iron based perovskite La0.9Ca0.1Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-δ anode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.077
2,7093,"The single cells with LCFNb and LCFNb/SDC impregnated anodes both achieve relatively high power output with maximum power densities (MPDs) reaching up to 610, 823 mW.cm(-2) in H-2 at 800 degrees C, respectively, presenting a high potential of LCFNb for use as SOFCs anode.",Efficient and stable iron based perovskite La0.9Ca0.1Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-δ anode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.077
3,7093,The power outputs of the single cells with LCFNb/SDC composite anode in CO and syngas (CO-H-2 mixture) are almost identical to that in H-2 at each testing temperature.,Efficient and stable iron based perovskite La0.9Ca0.1Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-δ anode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.077
4,7093,"This composite anode also presents excellent durability in both H-2 and CO for as long as 50 h, showing desirable anti reduction and carbon deposition resistance abilities.",Efficient and stable iron based perovskite La0.9Ca0.1Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-δ anode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.077
5,7093,"Besides, the cell output is stable in 100 ppm H2S-H-2 atmospheres for 20 h at a current density of 600 mA.cm(-2) with negligible sulfur accumulation on the anode surface.",Efficient and stable iron based perovskite La0.9Ca0.1Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-δ anode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.077
