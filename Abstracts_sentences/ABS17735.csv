1,17735,The behaviour of the promising glass sealant 54.4SiO2-13.7Na2O-1.7K2O-5.0CaO-12.4MgO-0.6Y2O3-11.3Al2O30.9B2O3 for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) under SOFC operating conditions was studied.,Behaviour of 54.4SiO2-13.7Na2O-1.7K2O-5.0CaO-12.4MgO-0.6Y2O3-11.3Al2O3-0.9B2O3 HT-SOFC glass sealant under oxidising and reducing atmospheres,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.11.151
2,17735,"First, the kinetics of the crystallisation processes at the operating temperature (850 degrees C) was discussed (maximum exposure time of 1000 h), and the effect of crystallisation on the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the sealant was studied.",Behaviour of 54.4SiO2-13.7Na2O-1.7K2O-5.0CaO-12.4MgO-0.6Y2O3-11.3Al2O3-0.9B2O3 HT-SOFC glass sealant under oxidising and reducing atmospheres,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.11.151
3,17735,"Furthermore, the degradation processes at the interface of the glass sealant and functional SOFC materials (Crofer 22 APU, YSZ, and NiO(Ni)-YSZ) during exposure to 850 degrees C in oxidising and reducing atmospheres for 500 h were studied.",Behaviour of 54.4SiO2-13.7Na2O-1.7K2O-5.0CaO-12.4MgO-0.6Y2O3-11.3Al2O3-0.9B2O3 HT-SOFC glass sealant under oxidising and reducing atmospheres,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.11.151
4,17735,The tests demonstrated good performance of the sealant studied and possibility of its application in SOFCs.,Behaviour of 54.4SiO2-13.7Na2O-1.7K2O-5.0CaO-12.4MgO-0.6Y2O3-11.3Al2O3-0.9B2O3 HT-SOFC glass sealant under oxidising and reducing atmospheres,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.11.151
