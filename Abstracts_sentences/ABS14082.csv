1,14082,"In this paper, the Ce1xSmxO2x/2 (x=0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) samples were synthesized and then mixed with GdBaCo2O5+ (GBCO) to form GBCOCe1xSmxO2x/2 composite cathodes.",The Effect of Adding Ce1-xSmxO2-x/2 with Different Sm Contents on the Electrochemical Performance of GdBaCo2O5+δ Based Composite Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201200141
2,14082,The electrochemical performance of the composite cathodes was investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure.,The Effect of Adding Ce1-xSmxO2-x/2 with Different Sm Contents on the Electrochemical Performance of GdBaCo2O5+δ Based Composite Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201200141
3,14082,The impedance spectra results demonstrated that the introduction of proper Ce1xSmxO2x/2 phase remarkably enhanced the electrochemical performance ofGBCO cathode and caused a reduction in the total polarization resistance (Rp).,The Effect of Adding Ce1-xSmxO2-x/2 with Different Sm Contents on the Electrochemical Performance of GdBaCo2O5+δ Based Composite Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201200141
4,14082,"Furthermore, as the amount of Ce1xSmxO2x/2 in composite cathode was fixed, the variation of Sm content in Ce1xSmxO2x/2 also had a significant influence on the electrochemical performance of the GBCOCe1xSmxO2x/2 cathodes.",The Effect of Adding Ce1-xSmxO2-x/2 with Different Sm Contents on the Electrochemical Performance of GdBaCo2O5+δ Based Composite Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201200141
5,14082,"For example, the Rp of GBCO cathodes containing 10wt.% Ce1xSmxO2x/2 considerably reduced from 0.37 to 0.17cm2 at 600 degrees C with the decreasing Sm content x from 0.2 to 0.025.",The Effect of Adding Ce1-xSmxO2-x/2 with Different Sm Contents on the Electrochemical Performance of GdBaCo2O5+δ Based Composite Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201200141
6,14082,"The improvement in performance of the GBCOCe1xSmxO2x/2 cathodes compared to pure GBCO cathode could be mainly attributed to the catalytic activity of Ce1xSmxO2x/2 towards the surface diffusion related processes, which was an elementary step in oxygen reduction reaction at cathode.",The Effect of Adding Ce1-xSmxO2-x/2 with Different Sm Contents on the Electrochemical Performance of GdBaCo2O5+δ Based Composite Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201200141
