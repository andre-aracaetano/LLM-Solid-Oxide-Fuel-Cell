1,2271,"Anode-supported yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/samaria doped ceria (SDC) bi-layer electrolytes with uniform thickness and high density were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition at 1000 degrees C. Fuel cells with such bi-layer electrolytes were fabricated and tested, yielding open circuit voltages from 0.94 to 1.0 V at 600-700 degrees C. Power densities from 0.4 to 1.0 W cm(-2) at 0.7V were achieved in air at temperatures of 600-700 degrees C. Cell performance was improved in flowing oxygen, with an estimated peak power density of over 2 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C, assuming the same overall resistance over the entire range of current density.",Performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with thin bi-layer electrolyte by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.036
2,2271,"The high cell performance was attributed to the very low ohmic resistance of the fuel cell, owing to the small thickness of the electrolyte.",Performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with thin bi-layer electrolyte by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.036
3,2271,Stable performance was also demonstrated in that the voltage of the fuel cell showed very little change at a constant current density of 1 A cm(-2) during more than 400h of operation at 650 degrees C in flowing oxygen.,Performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with thin bi-layer electrolyte by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.036
4,2271,SEM analysis of the fuel cell after testing showed that the bi-layer electrolyte had retained its chemical and mechanical integrity.,Performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with thin bi-layer electrolyte by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.036
