1,16093,"In this work, two solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were tested at 750 degrees C but at different testing times in order to study the long-term voltage behavior and identify voltage degradation mechanisms.",Interfacial long-term effects of LSCF cathodes at medium current densities,10.1007/s11581-022-04769-z
2,16093,The main objective here is to determine if the normally observed Sr segregation continues at the electrolyte/ceria interface or remains constant over different testing times at medium current densities.,Interfacial long-term effects of LSCF cathodes at medium current densities,10.1007/s11581-022-04769-z
3,16093,Distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis is extended to long-term impedance spectroscopy (IS) data to address any possible concerns with the complex non-linear least square fitting (CNLS) analysis.,Interfacial long-term effects of LSCF cathodes at medium current densities,10.1007/s11581-022-04769-z
4,16093,"For the long-term cell test, no significant change in performance is observed based upon the initial and final voltage-current density curves.",Interfacial long-term effects of LSCF cathodes at medium current densities,10.1007/s11581-022-04769-z
5,16093,DRT analysis on this cell shows five distinct processes.,Interfacial long-term effects of LSCF cathodes at medium current densities,10.1007/s11581-022-04769-z
6,16093,The CNLS data analysis proved to be a little more complex as resulting resistances are somewhat scattered.,Interfacial long-term effects of LSCF cathodes at medium current densities,10.1007/s11581-022-04769-z
7,16093,The cell ohmic resistance increased from about 0.2 to 0.23 ohm cm(2).,Interfacial long-term effects of LSCF cathodes at medium current densities,10.1007/s11581-022-04769-z
8,16093,The total cell polarization resistance stabilizes from about 1.2 to 1.15 ohm cm(2).,Interfacial long-term effects of LSCF cathodes at medium current densities,10.1007/s11581-022-04769-z
9,16093,Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data indicate that Sr has increased at the electrolyte/ceria interface when compared to a green cell.,Interfacial long-term effects of LSCF cathodes at medium current densities,10.1007/s11581-022-04769-z
10,16093,"However, the EDS data for the short-term cell test suggest that most of the Sr migration has occurred in the initial stages of testing and most likely due to the initial electrochemical performance characterization.",Interfacial long-term effects of LSCF cathodes at medium current densities,10.1007/s11581-022-04769-z
