7,9950,"Simulations suggest that operation at lower system specific power and higher stack temperature can extend the lifetime by a factor up to 10, because the beneficial decrease in cathode overpotential prevails over the higher release of volatile chromium species, faster metallic interconnect corrosion and higher thermodynamic risks of zirconate formation, for maximum SRU temperature below 1150 K.",Progressive activation of degradation processes in solid oxide fuel cells stacks: Part I: Lifetime extension by optimisation of the operating conditions,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.078
