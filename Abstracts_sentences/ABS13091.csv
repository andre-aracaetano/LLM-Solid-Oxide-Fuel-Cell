1,13091,This paper investigates the performance of a planar cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with composite electrodes using a detailed numerical model.,"Modeling of transport, chemical and electrochemical phenomena in a cathode-supported SOFC",10.1016/j.ces.2009.03.043
2,13091,"The methane reforming reaction is included in the model and takes place mostly in the porous, thin anode at the high operating temperature of 800-1000 degrees C. A single computational domain comprises the fuel and air channels and the electrodes-electrolyte assembly eliminating the need for internal boundary conditions.","Modeling of transport, chemical and electrochemical phenomena in a cathode-supported SOFC",10.1016/j.ces.2009.03.043
3,13091,"The equations governing transport and chemical and electrochemical processes for mass, momentum, chemical and charged species and energy are solved using Star-CD augmented by subroutines written in-house.","Modeling of transport, chemical and electrochemical phenomena in a cathode-supported SOFC",10.1016/j.ces.2009.03.043
4,13091,"The operating cell voltage is determined by the potential difference between the cathode and the anode, whose potentials are fixed.","Modeling of transport, chemical and electrochemical phenomena in a cathode-supported SOFC",10.1016/j.ces.2009.03.043
5,13091,"Results of temperature, chemical species, current density and electric potential distribution for a co-flow configuration are shown and discussed.","Modeling of transport, chemical and electrochemical phenomena in a cathode-supported SOFC",10.1016/j.ces.2009.03.043
6,13091,"It is found that the sub-cooling effect observed in anode-supported cells is almost ameliorated, making the cathode-supported cell favorable from the viewpoint of material stability.","Modeling of transport, chemical and electrochemical phenomena in a cathode-supported SOFC",10.1016/j.ces.2009.03.043
