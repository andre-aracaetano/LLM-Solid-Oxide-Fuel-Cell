3,8027,"Based on leakage tests performed at Forschungszentrum Julich it was obvious that stacks, having been operated successfully in a furnace, are not necessarily usable in a system, e.g. because of deviating pressure differences and temperature gradients.",Investigation of solid oxide fuel cell sealing behavior under stack relevant conditions at Forschungszentrum Julich,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.041
4,8027,"Thorough investigations including stack and stack dummy tests, and finite element modeling (FEM) were performed to get a comprehensive understanding of the various parameters, influencing the leak tightness of the sealing material.",Investigation of solid oxide fuel cell sealing behavior under stack relevant conditions at Forschungszentrum Julich,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.041
