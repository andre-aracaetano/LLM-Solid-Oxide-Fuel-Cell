4,12811,"Advantages come from the substitution of steam with CO2 to be handled in the system, representing a potential strategy of CO2 reuse.",Steam vs. Dry Reformer: Experimental Study on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Short Stack,10.3390/catal8120599

6,12811,"Results show that higher performances can be obtained under same operating conditions, due to the high concentration of syngas (that has low content of inert species) produced via dry reforming.",Steam vs. Dry Reformer: Experimental Study on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Short Stack,10.3390/catal8120599
7,12811,"The analysis of different dry reforming concentrations shows that the amount of methane seems to be more relevant, in terms of voltage performances, than high hydrogen concentration.",Steam vs. Dry Reformer: Experimental Study on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Short Stack,10.3390/catal8120599
8,12811,"Among tested dry reforming compositions, the most performing exhibits an improvement of at least 5% in produced voltage in the range 150-375 mA cm(-2) with respect to mixture produced by steam reforming (S/C ratio of 2.5).",Steam vs. Dry Reformer: Experimental Study on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Short Stack,10.3390/catal8120599
9,12811,"It was also proved that this performance enhancement does not imply greater thermal stresses, since stack temperature slightly reduces and lower temperature variations arise at anode and cathode when operating current varies.",Steam vs. Dry Reformer: Experimental Study on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Short Stack,10.3390/catal8120599
