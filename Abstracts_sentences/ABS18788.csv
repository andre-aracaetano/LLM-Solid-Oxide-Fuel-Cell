1,18788,"Hydrothermal reaction in Cerium and Gadolinium solution as an optimization method is developed and first reported for the densification of gadolinia doped ceria, the barrier layer between Zirconia electrolyte and (La,Sr) (Co,Fe)O3-delta cathode.",Lower down both ohmic and cathode polarization resistances of solid oxide fuel cell via hydrothermal modified gadolinia doped ceria barrier layer,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.05.020
2,18788,"This method is based on the hydrothermal reaction for nano particles in-situly grown on porous surface, to improve barrier layer density, alongside the sintering of cathode at 1075 degrees C. As a result, the ohmic resistance is prominently decreased by -16.4 % at 750 degrees C for electrolyte supported symmetrical cell.",Lower down both ohmic and cathode polarization resistances of solid oxide fuel cell via hydrothermal modified gadolinia doped ceria barrier layer,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.05.020
3,18788,"Whereas, the cathode polarization resistance is decreased by as much as a factor of -3 from 0.3702 omega center dot cm2 to 0.1325 omega center dot cm2 at 750 degrees C and pO2 = 0.21 atm.",Lower down both ohmic and cathode polarization resistances of solid oxide fuel cell via hydrothermal modified gadolinia doped ceria barrier layer,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.05.020
