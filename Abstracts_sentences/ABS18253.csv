1,18253,The aim of this study is to specify an optimal method for coating LSM layer on a YSZ substrate.,Fabrication of improved La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode layer for solid oxide fuel cells using economical coating methods,10.1111/ijac.12843
2,18253,Initially the prepared powders were validated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique.,Fabrication of improved La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode layer for solid oxide fuel cells using economical coating methods,10.1111/ijac.12843
3,18253,"A mixture of NiO-YSZ (50:50wt%) powders were created by mechanical milling method; then the mix was prepressed in a disk shape die as the base substrate; after that, YSZ powder was added on the substrate and they were pressed and sintered at 1450 degrees C for 3 hours.",Fabrication of improved La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode layer for solid oxide fuel cells using economical coating methods,10.1111/ijac.12843
4,18253,"Three different methods including dip coating, spraying, and brush painting using various concentrations of LSM suspensions, were applied on the obtained substrate.",Fabrication of improved La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode layer for solid oxide fuel cells using economical coating methods,10.1111/ijac.12843
5,18253,"Then, LSM coated disks were sintered at 1250 degrees C for 2 hours.",Fabrication of improved La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode layer for solid oxide fuel cells using economical coating methods,10.1111/ijac.12843
6,18253,"The coating surface and the cross section of the as-sintered disks which were investigated and scanned by an electron microscope (SEM), illustrated a uniform coating in dip-coated samples; also, another advantage of this method was the negligible agglomeration of the LSM layer.",Fabrication of improved La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode layer for solid oxide fuel cells using economical coating methods,10.1111/ijac.12843
7,18253,"Moreover, the linear EDS elemental analysis from the surface of the layerwhich is coating the substrateindicated the desired results for the coating which was fabricated by the dip coating method.",Fabrication of improved La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode layer for solid oxide fuel cells using economical coating methods,10.1111/ijac.12843
