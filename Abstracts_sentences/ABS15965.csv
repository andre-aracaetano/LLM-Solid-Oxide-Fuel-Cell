3,15965,"((PL)(2-x)NCA and the Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9(SDC) electrolyte are chemically compatible at 1000 degrees C for 5 h. The average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) values of (PL)(2-x)NCA range from 14.1 x 10(-6)K(-1) to 14.5 x 10(-6) K-1 for temperatures between 30 and 1000 degrees C, which is close to that of conventional SOFC electrolyte materials.","Electrode properties of (Pr0.9La0.1)2-x(Ni0.74Cu0.21Al0.05)O4+δ (with x=0, 0.05, and 0.1) as cathodes in IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.04.078
