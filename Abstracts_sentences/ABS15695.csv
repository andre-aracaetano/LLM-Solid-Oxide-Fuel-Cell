1,15695,"In this work, the effect of porous interlayer on the microstructural change of LSM cathodes and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte was investigated under a current-accelerated condition at 1000 degrees C.",Effect of porous interlayer on the long-term stability of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.97MnO3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.02.063
2,15695,"The polarization resistance of LSM cathode on bare yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte decreased significantly after discharge at 1.2 A cm(-2) for 5 h, and then started to increase gradually.",Effect of porous interlayer on the long-term stability of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.97MnO3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.02.063
3,15695,"However, when a porous YSZ interlayer was employed between LSM cathode and YSZ electrolyte, the polarization resistance did not increased even after discharge at the same condition for 40 h. The performance changes of the two kinds of cathodes were related with the microstructural change of the interface between LSM cathode and YSZ interlayer.",Effect of porous interlayer on the long-term stability of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.97MnO3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.02.063
4,15695,"Quantitative analysis for the microstructural change of LSM cathode on YSZ interlayer revealed that even after discharge at 1.2 A cm(-2) for 40 h, 90% of the triple phase boundary of LSM, YSZ and gas phase remained active for oxygen reduction reaction.",Effect of porous interlayer on the long-term stability of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.97MnO3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.02.063
5,15695,"On the other hand, the LSM cathode on YSZ electrolyte with a porous Sm-doped ceria interlayer showed remarkable long-term stability even after discharge at 1.2 A cm(-2) for 160 h.
