1,13334,"(CeO2)(0.8)(SmO1.5)(0.2) (CSO) has been suggested for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications, because of its higher electrical conductivity and chemical stability, compared to other ceria-based materials.",SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF (CEO2)(0.8)(SMO1.5)(0.2) THIN-FILMS FROM POLYMERIC PRECURSORS,10.1149/1.2221125
2,13334,However CSO is difficult to densify under conditions compatible with other SOFC components.,SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF (CEO2)(0.8)(SMO1.5)(0.2) THIN-FILMS FROM POLYMERIC PRECURSORS,10.1149/1.2221125
3,13334,A thin film synthesis technique has been developed for the fabrication of dense CSO films from precursor solutions at relatively low temperatures.,SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF (CEO2)(0.8)(SMO1.5)(0.2) THIN-FILMS FROM POLYMERIC PRECURSORS,10.1149/1.2221125
4,13334,"Dense, smooth, and homogeneous films were obtained on Pt, single-crystal Si, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) substrates by spin-coating a polymeric precursor and subsequent heat-treatment.",SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF (CEO2)(0.8)(SMO1.5)(0.2) THIN-FILMS FROM POLYMERIC PRECURSORS,10.1149/1.2221125
5,13334,Crystallization of the film occurred at temperatures as low as 320 degrees C.,SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF (CEO2)(0.8)(SMO1.5)(0.2) THIN-FILMS FROM POLYMERIC PRECURSORS,10.1149/1.2221125
6,13334,"The developed oxide film did not react with La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, LSCF, or (ZrO2)(0.84)(YO1.5)(0.16) (YSZ) at temperatures up to 1200 degrees C. When a CSO layer was applied between LSCF and YSZ, a significant improvement in the interfacial resistance was observed.",SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF (CEO2)(0.8)(SMO1.5)(0.2) THIN-FILMS FROM POLYMERIC PRECURSORS,10.1149/1.2221125
7,13334,The results suggest that CSO can be used as a buffer layer on YSZ electrolytes for improved performance of high temperature SOFCs.,SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF (CEO2)(0.8)(SMO1.5)(0.2) THIN-FILMS FROM POLYMERIC PRECURSORS,10.1149/1.2221125
