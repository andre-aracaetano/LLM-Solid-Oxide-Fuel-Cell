1,15774,"Recently, mixed ion and electron conducting layered perovskite-type LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta) (Ln(3+) = rare earth) have been considered as cathodes for intermediate temperature (IT) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Electrochemical studies of Gd0.5Pr0.5BaCo2O5 + δ (GPBC) cathode for oxide ion and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.010
2,15774,"Here, we report the electrochemical performance of Gd0.5Pr0.5BaCo2O5 (+ delta) (GPBC) for proton (H+) and oxide (O2-) conducting SOFC5. GPBC was prepared by conventional ceramic method in air at 900 degrees C. Symmetrical cell of proton conducting Ba0.5Sr0.3Ce0.6Zr0.2Gd0.1Y0.1O3 (-) (delta) (BSCZGY) and GPBC showed an area-specific polarization resistance (ASR) of 2.4 Omega cm(2) and 1.9 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in air and wet air, respectively, and exhibited an activation energy of 12 eV in both atmospheres.",Electrochemical studies of Gd0.5Pr0.5BaCo2O5 + δ (GPBC) cathode for oxide ion and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.010
3,15774,The observed low (similar to 10 times) ORR ASR performance of GPBC may be owing to thin and dense electrodes and low proton conducting BSCZGY electrolyte used in the present work.,Electrochemical studies of Gd0.5Pr0.5BaCo2O5 + δ (GPBC) cathode for oxide ion and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.010

5,15774,"Symmetrical cell utilizing a commercial oxide ion conducting Y2O3-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) (Tosoh) showed slightly higher ORR ASR and activation energy values (1.6 eV), which can be attributed to interfacial reaction with GPBC cathode during the cell fabrication at elevated temperature.",Electrochemical studies of Gd0.5Pr0.5BaCo2O5 + δ (GPBC) cathode for oxide ion and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.010
