1,6794,The composite cathodes of La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 (LDC)-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM)-8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with different LDC contents were investigated for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with thin film YSZ electrolyte.,La0.4Ce0.6O1.8-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia composite cathode for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.012
2,6794,The oxygen temperature-programmed desorption profiles of the LDC-LSM-YSZ composites indicate that the addition of LDC increases surface oxygen vacancies.,La0.4Ce0.6O1.8-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia composite cathode for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.012
3,6794,"The cell performance was improved largely after the addition of LDC, and the best cell performance was achieved on the cells with the composite cathodes containing 10 wt% or 15 wt% LDC.",La0.4Ce0.6O1.8-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia composite cathode for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.012
4,6794,The electrode polarization resistance was reduced significantly after the addition of LDC.,La0.4Ce0.6O1.8-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia composite cathode for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.012
5,6794,"At 800 degrees C and 650 degrees C, the polarization resistances of the cell with a 10 wt% LDC composite cathode are 70% and 40% of those of the cell with a LSM-YSZ composite cathode, respectively.",La0.4Ce0.6O1.8-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia composite cathode for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.012
6,6794,The impedance spectra show that the processes associated with the dissociative adsorption of oxygen and diffusion of oxygen intermediates and/or oxygen ions on LSM surface and transfer of oxygen species at triple phase boundaries are accelerated after the addition of LDC.,La0.4Ce0.6O1.8-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia composite cathode for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.012
