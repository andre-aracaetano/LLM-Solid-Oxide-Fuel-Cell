1,20760,"A study was conducted to explore the effects of Sr doping on the electrical properties of perovskite LaFeO3 thin-film protective conversion coatings grown onto a K41 ferritic stainless steel, a typical interconnect material for intermediate temperature solid oxide cell (SOC) applications.",Preparation and Electrical Properties of Sr-Doped LaFeO3 Thin-Film Conversion Coatings for Solid Oxide Cell Steel Interconnect Applications,10.3390/en15020632
2,20760,The Sr-doped coatings were prepared in La2O3- and SrO-containing molten carbonate baths with minor added amounts of nitrate salt for accelerated coating formation.,Preparation and Electrical Properties of Sr-Doped LaFeO3 Thin-Film Conversion Coatings for Solid Oxide Cell Steel Interconnect Applications,10.3390/en15020632
3,20760,"For comparison purposes, undoped coatings were obtained using the same carbonate bath, with the only difference being that SrO was replaced by inert MgO. SEM/EDX and XRD analyses were used for coating characterization and confirmed the effective incorporation of Sr but not of Mg into the LaFeO3 layer.",Preparation and Electrical Properties of Sr-Doped LaFeO3 Thin-Film Conversion Coatings for Solid Oxide Cell Steel Interconnect Applications,10.3390/en15020632
4,20760,"Although both the Sr-doped and undoped coatings consisted of a LaFeO3 layer grown above an inner Fe-Cr spinel, the coating thickness of the Sr-doped coating was distinctly higher, approximately 2 mu m, which is twice that of the undoped coating.",Preparation and Electrical Properties of Sr-Doped LaFeO3 Thin-Film Conversion Coatings for Solid Oxide Cell Steel Interconnect Applications,10.3390/en15020632
5,20760,Electrical measurements in terms of Area-Specific Resistance (ASR) were conducted at 700 degrees C in air and showed that Sr-doping significantly improved the electrical conductivity of the coated K41 steel.,Preparation and Electrical Properties of Sr-Doped LaFeO3 Thin-Film Conversion Coatings for Solid Oxide Cell Steel Interconnect Applications,10.3390/en15020632
6,20760,"Due to the Sr-doping, the ASR values of the coated steel dropped from 60 to 37 m omega cm(2) after 300 h of exposure, in spite of the higher Sr-doped coating thickness.",Preparation and Electrical Properties of Sr-Doped LaFeO3 Thin-Film Conversion Coatings for Solid Oxide Cell Steel Interconnect Applications,10.3390/en15020632
7,20760,The study concludes that Sr-doped thin-film perovskite coatings appear to be a promising solution for improved SOCs steel interconnect stability at intermediate temperatures.,Preparation and Electrical Properties of Sr-Doped LaFeO3 Thin-Film Conversion Coatings for Solid Oxide Cell Steel Interconnect Applications,10.3390/en15020632
