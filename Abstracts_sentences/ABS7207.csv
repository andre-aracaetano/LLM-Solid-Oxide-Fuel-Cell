1,7207,(La(0.74)Bio(0.10)Sr(0.16))MnO3-delta (LBSM)-(Bi2O3)(0.7)(Er2O3)(0.3)(ESB) composite cathodes were fabricated for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Sc-stabilized zirconia as the electrolyte.,(La0.74Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-δ-(Bi2O3)0.7(Er2O3)0.3 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.017
2,7207,The performance of these cathodes was investigated at temperatures below 750 degrees C by AC impedance spectroscopy and the results indicated that LBSM-ESB had a better performance than traditional composite electrodes such as LSM-GDC and LSM-YSZ.,(La0.74Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-δ-(Bi2O3)0.7(Er2O3)0.3 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.017
3,7207,"At 750 degrees C, the lowest interfacial polarization resistance was only 0.11 ohm cm(2) for the LBSM-ESB cathode, 0.49 ohm cm(2) for the LSM-GDC cathode, and 1.31 ohm cm(2) for the LSM-YSZ cathode.",(La0.74Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-δ-(Bi2O3)0.7(Er2O3)0.3 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.017
4,7207,"The performance of the cathode was improved gradually by increasing the ESB content, and the performance was optimal when the amounts of LBSM and ESB were equal in composite cathodes.",(La0.74Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-δ-(Bi2O3)0.7(Er2O3)0.3 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.017
5,7207,"This study shows that the sintering temperature of the cathode affected performance, and the optimum sintering temperature for LBSM-ESB was 900 degrees C.
