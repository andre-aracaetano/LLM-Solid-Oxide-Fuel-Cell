1,16625,"Cubic perovskite oxides La(0.5)Ba(0.5)Co(1-y)Fe(y)O(3-delta) (LBCF-y) with Fe content y = 0.1-0.7 were synthesized by sol-gel method and were studied with respect to their oxygen content, defect chemistry, thermal expansion behavior, and electrical and electrochemical properties.","Effect of iron substitution content on structure, thermal expansion behavior and electrochemical properties of La0.5Ba0.5Co1-yFeyO3-δ",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.083
2,16625,LBCF-y had increased oxygen content and cell volumes with higher Fe content.,"Effect of iron substitution content on structure, thermal expansion behavior and electrochemical properties of La0.5Ba0.5Co1-yFeyO3-δ",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.083
3,16625,"The chemical defects at B-sites of LBCF-y are Fe(4+), Co(4+) and Co(3+) ions for y = 0.1-0.3, and Fe(4+), Fe(3+) and Co(3+) ions for y >= 0.5 respectively.","Effect of iron substitution content on structure, thermal expansion behavior and electrochemical properties of La0.5Ba0.5Co1-yFeyO3-δ",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.083
4,16625,"Thermal expansion coefficients of LBCF-y oxides firstly increased to a maximum at y = 0.3 then decreased gradually with bigger y. Conductivities of LBCF-y decreased with higher Fe content, and the maximum conductivity was 800 S cm(-1) at 500 K for LBCF-0.1 sample.","Effect of iron substitution content on structure, thermal expansion behavior and electrochemical properties of La0.5Ba0.5Co1-yFeyO3-δ",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.083
5,16625,Fe substitutions for Co in LBCF-y cathodes increase the high-frequency resistance associated with oxygen ionic diffusion process while hardly influence the low-frequency gas diffusion process.,"Effect of iron substitution content on structure, thermal expansion behavior and electrochemical properties of La0.5Ba0.5Co1-yFeyO3-δ",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.083
6,16625,"Very low area-specific resistances, <0.1 ohm crn(2) at 923 K, were obtained for LBCF-y (y = 0.1-0.7) oxides, demonstrating their potential applications as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.","Effect of iron substitution content on structure, thermal expansion behavior and electrochemical properties of La0.5Ba0.5Co1-yFeyO3-δ",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.083
