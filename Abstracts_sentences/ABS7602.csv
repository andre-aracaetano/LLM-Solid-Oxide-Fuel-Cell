5,7602,Symmetrical cells with a configuration of PBSCF vertical bar YSZ vertical bar PBSCF show a low interfacial polarization resistance of 0.03 Omega cm(2) with minimal degradation at 700 degrees C for 600 h. Ni-SDC vertical bar YSZ vertical bar PBSCF single cells exhibit a peak power density of 0.62 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C operated on H-2 with good thermal cycling stability for 110 h. Single cells also show excellent coking tolerance with stable operation on CH4 for over 120 h.,"High-Performance, Thermal Cycling Stable, Coking-Tolerant Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Nanostructured Electrodes",10.1021/acsami.0c18434
