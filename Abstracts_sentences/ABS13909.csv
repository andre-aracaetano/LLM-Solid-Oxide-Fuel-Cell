1,13909,"This study systematically investigated the effects of a single B-site dopant (Fe, x = 0-1.0) on the structure and oxygen reduction reaction of the Ba(0.9)K(0.1)CoO3-delta (BKC) material used as a cathode for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).",Fe-Doped Ba0.9K0.1FexCo1-xO3-d Perovskite Cathode Material for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c00314

3,13909,"The results indicated that cubic perovskite structure BKFxC (Fe, x = 0.5, 0.6) materials had been formed by calcination at 900 degrees C for 5 h. Moreover, in order to examine the electrochemical properties of BKFxC, the BKFxC cathode was constructed on the Sm(0.075)Nd(0.075)Ce(0.85)O2-delta (SNDC) electrolyte (BKFC/SNDC/BKFC: denoted as symmetric cells); the lowest polarization resistance (RP) was obtained for the BKF0.5C symmetric cell (1.6 Omega center dot cm(2) at 550 degrees C), which demonstrated much higher electrocatalytic activity than that of a similar cell with the BKF0.6C cathode (2.87 Omega center dot cm(2) at 550 degrees C).",Fe-Doped Ba0.9K0.1FexCo1-xO3-d Perovskite Cathode Material for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c00314
4,13909,"A single cell with the BKF0.5C cathode achieved a top power density of 752 mW center dot cm(-2) at 550 degrees C, which is 0.35 times higher than that of the single cell with the BKF0.6C cathode (power density: 556 mW center dot cm-2).",Fe-Doped Ba0.9K0.1FexCo1-xO3-d Perovskite Cathode Material for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c00314
5,13909,"The corresponding total interface RP of the fuel cell was 0.303 Omega center dot cm(2), lower than that of the doping amount of 0.6 (550 degrees C, 0.402",Fe-Doped Ba0.9K0.1FexCo1-xO3-d Perovskite Cathode Material for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c00314

7,13909,"Meanwhile, O-2 temperature-programmed desorption (O-2-TPD) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis were used to characterize the valence of Fe and Co changing from +4 to +3 as well as the stable structure of the material from room temperature to 600/1000 degrees C. As a result, a highly efficient method for the innovative BKFC cathode was developed in this work.",Fe-Doped Ba0.9K0.1FexCo1-xO3-d Perovskite Cathode Material for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c00314
