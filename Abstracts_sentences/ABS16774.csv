1,16774,A system consisting of a solid oxide electrolyte of the Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 - x (CGO) composition in contact with a two-layer cathode based on a nonstoichiometric composition (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3 +/- delta (LSM1) and a stoichiometric perovskite La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 +/- delta (LSM2) is prepared by the tape-casting process.,Electrochemical Characteristics of Cathodes Based on Perovskites Modified by Ceria,10.1134/S1023193510070141
2,16774,It was shown that the best electrochemical characteristics are achieved for a three-layer system LSM2/{CGO-LSM1}/CGO sintered at 1410 degrees C.,Electrochemical Characteristics of Cathodes Based on Perovskites Modified by Ceria,10.1134/S1023193510070141
3,16774,The use of Ce-modified perovskites La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (+/-) (delta) and La0.6Sr0.6CoO3 +/- delta as the collector layer of two-layer electrodes allows the electrochemical characteristics at moderately high temperatures ( 600-750 degrees C) to be improved.,Electrochemical Characteristics of Cathodes Based on Perovskites Modified by Ceria,10.1134/S1023193510070141
