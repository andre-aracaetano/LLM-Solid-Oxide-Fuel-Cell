1,16846,A composite anode of NiFe-MgO (2.5 wt.%)-La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM) (10 wt.%) for solid oxide fuel cells using directly CH4 as fuel was studied.,Power-generating property of direct CH4 fueled SOFC using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1007/s10008-010-1077-x
2,16846,"Compared with previously reported NiFe-LSGM (10 wt.%) cermet anode, the NiFe-MgO-LSGM anode exhibited superior power generation performance, stability under CH4 atmosphere at 973 K, and high tolerance against the carbon deposition.",Power-generating property of direct CH4 fueled SOFC using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1007/s10008-010-1077-x
3,16846,These improvements by the additives are explained by the increase in basic property of anode material.,Power-generating property of direct CH4 fueled SOFC using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1007/s10008-010-1077-x
4,16846,The anode activity of NiFe-MgO-LSGM cermet for CH4 fuel is still lower than that for H-2 one.,Power-generating property of direct CH4 fueled SOFC using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1007/s10008-010-1077-x
5,16846,"However, comparing with that of NiFe-LSGM cermet, anodic overpotential slightly decreased by the addition of MgO, suggesting the improved surface activity.",Power-generating property of direct CH4 fueled SOFC using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1007/s10008-010-1077-x
