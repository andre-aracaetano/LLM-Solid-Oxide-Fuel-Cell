1,12689,The uniformity of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) stacks largely affects the stability and per-formance of the SOFC power generation system with multiple stacks.,External temperature field test and leakage fault diagnosis for SOFC stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.175
2,12689,"However, the health conditions of the stacks are usually assessed by the long-time electrochemical perfor-mance test, and some small faults are not able to be quickly identified when the I-V performances have small differences.",External temperature field test and leakage fault diagnosis for SOFC stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.175
3,12689,"In this paper, a non-contact temperature sensor array constructed by thermocouples is proposed for NDE (non-destructive evaluation) application in SOFC stacks.",External temperature field test and leakage fault diagnosis for SOFC stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.175
4,12689,The temperature sensor array is fixed near the outer surfaces of the 1 kW-class stack to measure the external temperature field of the stack.,External temperature field test and leakage fault diagnosis for SOFC stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.175
5,12689,"Based on the experimental results, it is found that the proposed method is feasible for the examination of the external temperature field of stacks under different operation conditions, which helps to screening the stacks before assembling to the system.",External temperature field test and leakage fault diagnosis for SOFC stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.175
6,12689,"At the same time, a real-time online monitoring of fuel leakage is performed using the temperature sensor array, and stacks with unusual temperature distribution due to the leakages can be quickly recognized by comparing with the healthy stack.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.",External temperature field test and leakage fault diagnosis for SOFC stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.175
