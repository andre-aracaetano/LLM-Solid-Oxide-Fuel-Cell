1,17357,"An ageing investigation of LSCF/CGO/YSZ half-cell, at 700 degrees C in air at OCP, was performed for different CGO buffer layer thicknesses (0, 0.11, 0.45, 1.1 and 2 mu m), using impedance spectroscopy (IS).",Efficiency of a dense thin CGO buffer layer for solid oxide fuel cell operating at intermediate temperature,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.07.004
2,17357,The ageing behavior of the half-cell has been found to be strongly dependent on the CGO thickness.,Efficiency of a dense thin CGO buffer layer for solid oxide fuel cell operating at intermediate temperature,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.07.004
3,17357,"With addition of the CGO buffer layer the initial apparent electrolyte resistance was significantly reduced, while the LSCF cathodes showed limited performance degradation over a period of 530 h. X-ray microanalyses have shown that the recorded degradation of the LSCF cathode without buffer layer is due to the diffusion and the segregation of Sr at the LSCF/YSZ interface.",Efficiency of a dense thin CGO buffer layer for solid oxide fuel cell operating at intermediate temperature,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.07.004
