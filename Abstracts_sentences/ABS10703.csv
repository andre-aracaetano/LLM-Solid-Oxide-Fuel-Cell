5,10703,While cost of fuel is the dominant overall cost of the locomotive power plant over its life cycle the efficiency of the SOFC is not high enough to offset its higher capital cost under most scenarios.,Feasibility analysis for solid oxide fuel cells as a power source for railroad road locomotives,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.07.067
6,10703,This could significantly change under regulatory standards that may dramatically increase the operating costs or capital costs of internal combustion engines for rail use in the future.,Feasibility analysis for solid oxide fuel cells as a power source for railroad road locomotives,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.07.067
