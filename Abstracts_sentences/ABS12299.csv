2,12299,Their mechanical stability under working conditions was evaluated satisfactorily by applying thermal cycling to the membranes.,Electrical characterization of thermomechanically stable YSZ membranes for micro solid oxide fuel cells applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.12.019
3,12299,"Membranes mechanically stable at operating temperatures as high as 700 degrees C were obtained for deposition temperatures in the range between 400 and 700 degrees C. Thermomechanical behavior as measured by X-ray microdiffraction was correlated with the evolution of the microstructure with the temperature from TEM analysis, comparing as-deposited and post-deposition annealed membranes.",Electrical characterization of thermomechanically stable YSZ membranes for micro solid oxide fuel cells applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.12.019
4,12299,"Electrical properties of both yttria-stabilized zirconia films and membranes were studied by DC conductivity and impedance spectroscopy, respectively.",Electrical characterization of thermomechanically stable YSZ membranes for micro solid oxide fuel cells applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.12.019
5,12299,A difference of almost one order of magnitude was measured between bulk and stressed films while conductivities close to the bulk were observed for YSZ membranes.,Electrical characterization of thermomechanically stable YSZ membranes for micro solid oxide fuel cells applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.12.019
6,12299,Values of area specific resistance of 0.15 Omega cm(2) were measured at temperatures below 450 degrees C for 240 nm thick YSZ membranes deposited at 600 degrees C and annealed at the same temperature for 2.5 h.
