1,798,The electric power produced by a Ni/Gd-doped ceria (GDC) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a GDC electrolyte (40 mu m thick) and a (La0.8Sr0.2)(Co0.8Fe0.2)O-3 (LSCF) cathode using a 3 vol% H2O-containing H-2 fuel was measured.,Influence of cathode on electric power of solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.122.226
2,798,"The addition of 10 or 50 mass % GDC powder (Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9) to the LSCF cathode reduced the power density from 320 mW/cm(2) in the case of no GDC to 137 or 122 mW/cm(2), respectively.",Influence of cathode on electric power of solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.122.226
