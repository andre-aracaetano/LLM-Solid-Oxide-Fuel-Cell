1,18720,"This pager reports the results of chemical diffusion coefficient measurements for oxygen in (La,Sr)(Mn,Co)O-3 and (La,Sr)(Mn,Fe)O-3 using a manometric method in the temperature range of 773 to 1023 K.","Chemical diffusion in perovskite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells:: the Sr doped LaMn1-xMxO3 (M=Co, Fe) systems",10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00097-3
2,18720,It was observed that the addition of Fe or Co into (La4xSrx)(1-y)MnO3 results in a substantial increase of the chemical diffusion coefficient.,"Chemical diffusion in perovskite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells:: the Sr doped LaMn1-xMxO3 (M=Co, Fe) systems",10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00097-3
3,18720,"In the range 25-100 mol% of Co or Fe substitution at B-site in (La,Sr)MnO3, the chemical diffusion coefficient exhibits much lower activation energy than that in (La,Sr)MnO3.","Chemical diffusion in perovskite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells:: the Sr doped LaMn1-xMxO3 (M=Co, Fe) systems",10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00097-3
4,18720,"The chemical diffusion data in (La,Sr)(Mn,Co)O-3 and (La,Sr)(Mn,Fe)O-3 system determined by the manometric method are generally in agreement with those determined by electrochemical relaxation methods reported in the literature.","Chemical diffusion in perovskite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells:: the Sr doped LaMn1-xMxO3 (M=Co, Fe) systems",10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00097-3
5,18720,"A comparison of the chemical diffusion data indicates that the oxygen mobility is lowest in (La,Sr)MnO3 and highest in (La,Sr)CoO3.","Chemical diffusion in perovskite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells:: the Sr doped LaMn1-xMxO3 (M=Co, Fe) systems",10.1016/S0272-8842(00)00097-3
