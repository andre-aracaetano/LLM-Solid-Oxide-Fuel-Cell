1,3484,"Pr0.6Sr0.4Cu0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (PSCF-SDC) (70:30 wt.%), a new cobalt-free composite cathode, is investigated for BaZr0.3Ce0.5Y0.2O3-delta-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs).",A new cobalt-free composite cathode Pr0.6Sr0.4Cu0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.159
2,3484,The influence of firing temperature on cathode microstructure and electrochemical performance of fuel cells is researched and analyzed.,A new cobalt-free composite cathode Pr0.6Sr0.4Cu0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.159
3,3484,These results show that the optimum sintering temperature of PSCF-SDC composite cathode is 800 degrees C.,A new cobalt-free composite cathode Pr0.6Sr0.4Cu0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.159
4,3484,The low polarization resistance of 0.14 Omega cm(2) and the maximum power density of 456 mW cm(-2) are achieved at 650 degrees C. Cell performance is further enhanced when the BaZr0.3Ce0.5Y0.2O3-delta electrolyte is replaced by BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta with higher proton conductivity; resulting in an improved maximum power density of 556 mW cm(-2) at 650 degrees C.
