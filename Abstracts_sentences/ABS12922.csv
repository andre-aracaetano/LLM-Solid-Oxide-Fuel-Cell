2,12922,The anode microstructures before and after 100 hours operation were quantitatively analyzed by three-dimensional reconstruction based on focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy technique.,Quantitative Study on the Correlation between Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Composite Anode Performance and Reduction Temperature Based on Three-Dimensional Reconstruction,10.1149/2.0721506jes
3,12922,"The anode reduced at 500 degrees C showed the worst initial performance and stability in operation which was attributed to the smallest specific nickel-yttria-stabilized-zirconia interface area and the very porous nickel formed in low temperature reduction, The anode reduced at 800 degrees C showed the smallest polarization resistance which was attributed to the largest active three phase boundary density.",Quantitative Study on the Correlation between Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Composite Anode Performance and Reduction Temperature Based on Three-Dimensional Reconstruction,10.1149/2.0721506jes
4,12922,"The anode reduced at 1000 degrees C showed the most stable performance with polarization resistance enhanced in operation, which was attributed to the largest specific nickel-yttria-stabilized-zirconia interface area and the dense nickel phase formed in high temperature reduction.",Quantitative Study on the Correlation between Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Composite Anode Performance and Reduction Temperature Based on Three-Dimensional Reconstruction,10.1149/2.0721506jes
5,12922,It is found that the performance of anode is determined not only by the active three phase boundary density but also the interface bonding between nickel and yttria-stabilized-zirconia in composite anode.,Quantitative Study on the Correlation between Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Composite Anode Performance and Reduction Temperature Based on Three-Dimensional Reconstruction,10.1149/2.0721506jes
6,12922,"Nickel-yttria-stabilized-zirconia interfacial bonding can be enhanced with the increase of reduction temperature, which is able to inhibit the nickel sintering and improve the anode performance stability in long-time operation.",Quantitative Study on the Correlation between Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Composite Anode Performance and Reduction Temperature Based on Three-Dimensional Reconstruction,10.1149/2.0721506jes
