2,6599,The SSC powders were synthesized using the glycine-nitrate method and La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.15Co0.05O3(LSGMC5) powders were synthesized using the citrate method.,High performance Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.15Co0.05O3 composite cathodes,10.1016/j.elecom.2006.03.034
3,6599,"The calcining temperature for the SSC and LSGMC5 powders had strong effect on the microstructure of the composite electrode and electrode/electrolyte interface, which affected the performance of the SSC-LSGMC5 electrode strongly.",High performance Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.15Co0.05O3 composite cathodes,10.1016/j.elecom.2006.03.034
4,6599,The electrode based on SSC calcined at 1223 K and LSGMC5 calcined at 1273 K exhibited the highest performance among the electrodes studied.,High performance Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.15Co0.05O3 composite cathodes,10.1016/j.elecom.2006.03.034
5,6599,"The electrode resistance was about 0.07 Omega cm(2), and the over-potential under 1 A cm(-2) current density was as low as 0.077 V at 973 K in oxygen, which could be an ideal cathode for ITSOFC based on lanthanum gallate electrolytes.",High performance Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.15Co0.05O3 composite cathodes,10.1016/j.elecom.2006.03.034
