1,2302,"Nickel oxide and yttria doped zirconia composite strength is crucial for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells, especially during transient operation, but also for the initial stacking process, where cell curvature after sintering can cause problems.",Strength of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201100038
2,2302,This work first compares tensile and ball-on-ring strength measurements of as-sintered anodes support.,Strength of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201100038
3,2302,"Secondly, the strength of anode support sintered alone is compared to the strength of a co-sintered anode support with anode and electrolyte layers.",Strength of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201100038
4,2302,"Finally, the orientation of the specimens to the bending axis of a co-sintered half-cell is investigated.",Strength of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201100038
5,2302,"Even though the electrolyte is to the tensile side, it is found that the anode support fails due to the thermo-mechanical residual stresses.",Strength of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201100038
