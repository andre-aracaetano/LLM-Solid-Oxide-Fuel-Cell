2,4897,"A single electrolyte-supported cell using standard electrodes has been fabricated and tested in both modes of operation, and it has been demonstrated that this material could compete with that of standard zirconia electrolytes, especially in the high temperature (HT) range.",LaNb0.84W0.16O4.08 as a novel electrolyte for high temperature fuel cell and solid oxide electrolysis applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.039
3,4897,"The measured current density of a non-optimized cell (similar to 360 mu m of electrolyte thickness) at 950 degrees C at 0.5 V (fuel cell mode) and 1.3 V (electrolysis mode) using 50%H2O-50% H-2 as the fuel was about - 200 mA cm(-2) and about 250 mA cm(-2), respectively.",LaNb0.84W0.16O4.08 as a novel electrolyte for high temperature fuel cell and solid oxide electrolysis applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.039
4,4897,The reason for the better performance in electrolysis mode is probably associated with the inherent oxygen excess of the LaNb0.84W0.16O4.08 phase.,LaNb0.84W0.16O4.08 as a novel electrolyte for high temperature fuel cell and solid oxide electrolysis applications,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.039
