1,9236,"The performance and stability of Cu-ceria-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) and carbon-ceria-YSZ, solid-oxide-fuel-cell (SOFC) anodes were examined in neat (100%) methanol at 973 K and compared to the performance of the same anodes in dry H-2.",Deactivation of ceria-based SOFC anodes in methanol,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.101
2,9236,"The presence of Cu catalyzed the decomposition of methanol, so that the initial performance of cells with Cu-ceria-YSZ anodes was similar to CO and H2.",Deactivation of ceria-based SOFC anodes in methanol,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.101
3,9236,"However, with carbon-ceria-YSZ anodes, the open-circuit voltage was significantly higher and the reaction over-potential significantly lower in methanol than in H2, suggesting that methanol is a more effective reductant of the anode three-phase boundary region.",Deactivation of ceria-based SOFC anodes in methanol,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.101
4,9236,Carbon-ceria-YSZ anodes were found to undergo rapid and irreversible deactivation in methanol.,Deactivation of ceria-based SOFC anodes in methanol,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.101
5,9236,Steady-state rates of methanol decomposition over ceria-YSZ were found to undergo a similar deactivation as the carbon-ceria anodes.,Deactivation of ceria-based SOFC anodes in methanol,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.101
6,9236,"Although no evidence for carbon deposition was observed with methanol at 973 K, the addition of steam was found to partially stabilize both anode and catalyst performance.",Deactivation of ceria-based SOFC anodes in methanol,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.101
7,9236,"Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of ceria particles in YSZ showed a large change in the morphology of the ceria particles when the samples were heated in methanol, while negligible changes were observed when heating in H-2.",Deactivation of ceria-based SOFC anodes in methanol,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.101
8,9236,It is suggested that the results with methanol can be explained as resulting from the very low P(O-2) that is effectively produced by having methanol in contact with ceria.,Deactivation of ceria-based SOFC anodes in methanol,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.101
