1,19374,Investigation of the cathode reaction in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) by impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements using evolutionary-based programming analysis is demonstrated.,Electrochemical Impedance Analysis of SOFC Cathode Reaction Using Evolutionary Programming,10.1002/fuce.201100126
2,19374,"In contrast to the conventional analysis methods used for impedance spectroscopy measurements, e.g., equivalent circuits, the impedance spectroscopy genetic programming (ISGP) program seeks for a distribution of relaxation times that has the form of a peak or a sum of several peaks, assuming the Debye kernel.",Electrochemical Impedance Analysis of SOFC Cathode Reaction Using Evolutionary Programming,10.1002/fuce.201100126
3,19374,Using this method one finds a functional (parametric) form of the distribution of relaxation times.,Electrochemical Impedance Analysis of SOFC Cathode Reaction Using Evolutionary Programming,10.1002/fuce.201100126
4,19374,A symmetric cell configuration of Pt|LSCF|GDC|LSCF|Pt was examined using IS measurements combined with IV measurements.,Electrochemical Impedance Analysis of SOFC Cathode Reaction Using Evolutionary Programming,10.1002/fuce.201100126
5,19374,Different samples at different temperatures and different oxygen partial pressures were examined in order to investigate their influence on the oxygen reduction reaction.,Electrochemical Impedance Analysis of SOFC Cathode Reaction Using Evolutionary Programming,10.1002/fuce.201100126
6,19374,The resulting IS data was analyzed using the ISGP program and the resulting peaks constructing the distribution of relaxation times were assigned for the different processes that occur at the cathode side.,Electrochemical Impedance Analysis of SOFC Cathode Reaction Using Evolutionary Programming,10.1002/fuce.201100126
