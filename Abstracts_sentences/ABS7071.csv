4,7071,It was found that the performance of a Ni-YSZ anode-supported SOFC depends strongly upon the anode microstructure which is decided by the characteristics of nickel oxide powder.,The effect of nickel oxide microstructure on the performance of Ni-YSZ anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.027
5,7071,The highest SOFC performance was obtained from the cell with the finest nickel oxide powder synthesized by glycine-nitrate combustion method while the lowest performance was with the coarsest powder purchased from a general chemical supplier.,The effect of nickel oxide microstructure on the performance of Ni-YSZ anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.027
