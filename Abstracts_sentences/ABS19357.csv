1,19357,"While exsolution is widely observed among perovskite hosts as an attractive technique for in-situ catalyst synthesis, our current understanding of the complex exsolution-host relationships is solely based on the conventional approach of using a small amount of a single dopant at a limited high-temperature range (> 800 degrees C).",Controlling exsolution with a charge-balanced doping approach,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106193
2,19357,"Herein, we develop a charge-balanced double-doping approach that opens new doors for the synthesis of a wide range of compositions, and the highly tunable nature of these compositions provides a basis for controlling exsolved particle size, distribution, composition, and surface anchorage.",Controlling exsolution with a charge-balanced doping approach,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106193
3,19357,"Against the conventional wisdom that high doping level leads to unstable exsolution, we show that increased double-doping levels, enabled by our novel method, can stabilize the perovskite phase in reducing conditions to provide high conductivity (> 35 S/cm) at low temperatures (450-650 degrees C) and exsolve smaller, more densely populated particles with different chemistry than their lightly doped analogues.",Controlling exsolution with a charge-balanced doping approach,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106193
4,19357,"Furthermore, we find that associated defects might be the main factor that determines nucleation sites, and the conductivity of the host may play a crucial role in exsolution kinetics by facilitating cation transport.",Controlling exsolution with a charge-balanced doping approach,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106193
5,19357,This study paves the way for controlling exsolved electrocatalyst properties by engineering the charge-balanced B-site and offers new knowledge that links exsolution to defect chemistry.,Controlling exsolution with a charge-balanced doping approach,10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106193
