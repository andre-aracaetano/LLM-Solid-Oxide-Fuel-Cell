1,20602,Chemical doping of ceramic oxides may provide a possible route for realizing high-efficient oxygen transport membranes.,CO2-Tolerant Oxygen Permeation Membranes Containing Transition Metals as Sintering Aids with High Oxygen Permeability,10.3390/pr9030528
2,20602,"Herein, we present a study of the previously unreported dual-phase mixed-conducting oxygen-permeable membranes with the compositions of 60 wt.% Ce0.85Pr0.1M0.05O2-delta-40 wt.%Pr0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Al0.2O3-delta (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) (CPM-PSFA) adding sintering aids, which is expected to not only improve the electronic conductivity of fluorite phase, but also reduce the sintering temperature and improve the sintering properties of the membranes.",CO2-Tolerant Oxygen Permeation Membranes Containing Transition Metals as Sintering Aids with High Oxygen Permeability,10.3390/pr9030528
3,20602,"X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) results indicate that the CPM-PSFA contain only the fluorite and perovskite two phases, implying that they are successfully prepared with a modified Pechini method.",CO2-Tolerant Oxygen Permeation Membranes Containing Transition Metals as Sintering Aids with High Oxygen Permeability,10.3390/pr9030528
4,20602,"Backscattered scanning electron microscopy (BSEM) results further confirm that two phases are evenly distributed, and the membranes are very dense after sintering at 1275 degrees C for 5 h, which is much lower than that (1450 degrees C, 5 h) of the composite 60 wt.%Ce0.9Pr0.1O2-delta-40 wt.%Pr0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Al0.2O3-delta (CP-PSFA) without sintering aids.",CO2-Tolerant Oxygen Permeation Membranes Containing Transition Metals as Sintering Aids with High Oxygen Permeability,10.3390/pr9030528
5,20602,The results of oxygen permeability test demonstrate that the oxygen permeation flux through the CPCu-PSFA and CPCo-PSFA is higher than that of undoped CP-PSFA and can maintain stable oxygen permeability for a long time under pure CO2 operation condition.,CO2-Tolerant Oxygen Permeation Membranes Containing Transition Metals as Sintering Aids with High Oxygen Permeability,10.3390/pr9030528
6,20602,"Our results imply that these composite membranes with high oxygen permeability and stability provide potential candidates for the application in oxygen separation, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and oxy-fuel combustion based on carbon dioxide capture.",CO2-Tolerant Oxygen Permeation Membranes Containing Transition Metals as Sintering Aids with High Oxygen Permeability,10.3390/pr9030528
