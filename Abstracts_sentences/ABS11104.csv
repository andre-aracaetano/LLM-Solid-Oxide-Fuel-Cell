4,11104,"Cells without a functional layer yielded a power density of 228mWcm(-2) at 650 degrees C, while cells with a porous LSGM functional layer yielded a power density of 434mWcm(-2) at 650 degrees C. Cells with an AFL yielded a higher open circuit voltage, possibly due to reduced Ti diffusion into the electrolyte.",Fabrication of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with a Thin (La0.9Sr0.1)0.98(Ga0.8Mg0.2)O3-δ Electrolyte on a Sr0.8La0.2TiO3 Support,10.1002/fuce.201300155
