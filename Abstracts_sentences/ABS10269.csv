2,10269,"This approach has two limitations: First, the Nernst equation cannot be applied to non-equilibrium gas feeds (e.g., CH4/H2O mixtures).",A new framework for physically based modeling of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2007.08.030
3,10269,"Second, the Butler-Volmer equations used to describe current/overpotential relationships do not account for the complex electrochemical processes at the three-phase boundaries.",A new framework for physically based modeling of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2007.08.030
4,10269,"We present here a new modeling approach that is based on the combination of (1) the elementary-kinetic description of electrochemistry, where multi-step chemical mechanisms account for coupled charge-transfer and surface chemistry, (2) the physical representation of electric potential steps due to inter-facial double layers, allowing to calculate the cell voltage without using the Nernst equation, (3) a quasi-three-dimensional multi-scale transport model describing surface transport towards the three-phase boundaries (nanoscopic scale), continuum mass and charge transport in the porous electrodes (microscopic scale), and gas-phase channel transport (macroscopic scale), and (4) a fully transient representation of all model equations for the prediction of electrochemical impedance spectra.",A new framework for physically based modeling of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2007.08.030
