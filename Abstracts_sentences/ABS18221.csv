1,18221,"Single phase La1-xSrxMn0.5Cr0.5O3 +/-delta (LSMC, x(Sr)= 0 and 0.2) and composite LSMC:Gd-doped ceria (GDC) mixed ionic and electronic conducting anodes were studied in half-cell and full-cell electrochemical configurations using humidified fuel environments at 700 to 800 degrees C.",Comparison of Sr-doped and Sr-free La1-xSrxMn0.5Cr0.5O3±δ SOFC Anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.05.027
2,18221,"We demonstrate here that the removal of Sr from La1-xSrxMn0.5Cr0.5O3 +/-delta improves both the thermo-chemical stability and the electronic conductivity of these materials in a humidified H-2 environment, while also enhancing their H-2 oxidation activity, when operating at 700 and 800 degrees C.",Comparison of Sr-doped and Sr-free La1-xSrxMn0.5Cr0.5O3±δ SOFC Anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.05.027
3,18221,"It is also shown that the addition of 50:50 wt.% GDC: LaMr(0.5)Cr(0.5)O(3 +/-delta) results in the retention of all of these benefits, as compared to a mixture of GDC with the Sr-containing La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.5Cr0.5O3 +/-delta (x(Sr)= 0.2) oxide.",Comparison of Sr-doped and Sr-free La1-xSrxMn0.5Cr0.5O3±δ SOFC Anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.05.027
