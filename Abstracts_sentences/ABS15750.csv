2,15750,The aim of this work is to examine carbon formation on the Ni-SDC anode when feeding with CO under conditions when carbon deposition is thermodynamically favoured.,Ni-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating with CO,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.203
3,15750,Electrochemical tests were conducted at intermediate temperatures (550-700 degrees C) using 20 and 40% CO concentrations.,Ni-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating with CO,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.203
4,15750,"Cell operating with 40% CO at 600-700 degrees C provided maximum power densities of 239-270 mW cm(-2), 1.5 times smaller than that achieved with humidified H-2.",Ni-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating with CO,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.203
5,15750,Much lower maximum power densities were attained with 20% CO (50-88 mW cm(-2)).,Ni-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating with CO,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.203
6,15750,Some degradation was observed during the 6 h galvanostatic operation at 0.1 A cm(-2) with 40% CO fuel at 550 degrees C which is believed due to the accumulation of carbon at the anode.,Ni-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating with CO,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.203
7,15750,"The degradation in cell potential occurred at a rate of 4.5 mV h(-2), but it did not lead to cell collapse.",Ni-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating with CO,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.203
8,15750,EDX mapping at the cross-section of the anode revealed that carbon formed in the Ni-SDC cell was primarily deposited in the anode section close to the fuel entry point.,Ni-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating with CO,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.203
9,15750,"Carbon was not detected at the electrolyte-anode interface and the middle of the anode, allowing the cell to continue operation with CO fuel without a catastrophic failure.",Ni-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating with CO,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.203
