1,20901,"In view of utilization as cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), the La2-xSrxNiO4 +/-delta (x = 0.2 and 0.8, delta > 0) series of compounds were evaluated with respect to their electrical conducting, thermomechanical and electrochemical properties.","Survey on electrochemical properties of La2-xSrxNiO4±δ (x=0.2 and 0.8, δ > 0) cathodes related with structural stability under cathodic polarization conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.041
2,20901,"On the one hand, La1.2Sr0.8NiO4-delta exhibits a higher electrical conductivity (>180 S cm(-1) in the temperature range 600-800 degrees C) and a lower electrode polarization under open-circuit voltage conditions (similar to 0.12 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C) than La(1.8)Sro(0.2)NiO(4+delta), together with a suitable thermal expansion coefficient (13.8 x 10(-6) K-1 averaged between 50 and 1000 degrees C).","Survey on electrochemical properties of La2-xSrxNiO4±δ (x=0.2 and 0.8, δ > 0) cathodes related with structural stability under cathodic polarization conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.041
3,20901,"On the other hand, the structure and electrochemical properties of La1.2Sr0.8NiO4-delta electrode were obviously changed after being subjected to cathodic polarization.","Survey on electrochemical properties of La2-xSrxNiO4±δ (x=0.2 and 0.8, δ > 0) cathodes related with structural stability under cathodic polarization conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.041
4,20901,"The cathodically polarized La1.2Sr0.8NiO4-delta electrode showed an aggregation of strontium oxide onto the surface, concomitant with a degradation of electrochemical properties.","Survey on electrochemical properties of La2-xSrxNiO4±δ (x=0.2 and 0.8, δ > 0) cathodes related with structural stability under cathodic polarization conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.041
5,20901,"By contrast, the structure and electrochemical properties of La1.8Sr0.2NiO4+delta electrode before and after cathodic polarization were basically unvaried.","Survey on electrochemical properties of La2-xSrxNiO4±δ (x=0.2 and 0.8, δ > 0) cathodes related with structural stability under cathodic polarization conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.041
6,20901,The disparate changes in structure and electrochemical properties of the two electrodes were interpreted in terms of their differing peculiarities in oxygen nonstoichiometry.,"Survey on electrochemical properties of La2-xSrxNiO4±δ (x=0.2 and 0.8, δ > 0) cathodes related with structural stability under cathodic polarization conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.041
7,20901,"The results of this work highlight the importance of strontium content and thereby oxygen nonstoichiometry of La1-xSrxNiO4 +/-delta electrodes to their structural stability under cathodic polarization conditions, which is a critical point to be used as cathodes in SOFCs.","Survey on electrochemical properties of La2-xSrxNiO4±δ (x=0.2 and 0.8, δ > 0) cathodes related with structural stability under cathodic polarization conditions",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.041
