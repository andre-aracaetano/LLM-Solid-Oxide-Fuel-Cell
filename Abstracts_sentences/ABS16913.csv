2,16913,"Two models for collecting current from single terminal (ST) and double terminal (DT) of anode tube were proposed and used to calculate the current collecting efficiency as functions of anode thickness, tube length and operating temperature.",Current collecting efficiency of micro tubular SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.071
3,16913,It was shown that design of the cell geometry and current correcting method are significantly important to achieve high performance micro tubular SOFC stacks.,Current collecting efficiency of micro tubular SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.071
4,16913,The efficiency loss estimated from the DT model was about 2-4-fold lower than those of obtained from the ST model.,Current collecting efficiency of micro tubular SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.071
5,16913,The DT model was shown to be more effective for higher operating temperature and the tube length.,Current collecting efficiency of micro tubular SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.071
