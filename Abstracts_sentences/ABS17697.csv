2,17697,"The cells were manufactured based on green symmetrical porous YSZ electrode backbones cast on the green YSZ electrolyte tape, rolled into tubular geometry, co-sintered and impregnated with functional materials.",A Novel Solid Oxide Electrochemical Oxygen Pump for Oxygen Therapy,10.1149/1945-7111/ac7008
3,17697,The prepared cell had a thin 16 mu m-electrolyte and supporting 76 mu m-symmetric electrodes.,A Novel Solid Oxide Electrochemical Oxygen Pump for Oxygen Therapy,10.1149/1945-7111/ac7008
4,17697,"At 700 degrees C, 2.8 A current (0.8 A cm(-2)) was obtained under 0.5 V in the single tubular cell infiltrated with 30% CGO and 45% LSCF.",A Novel Solid Oxide Electrochemical Oxygen Pump for Oxygen Therapy,10.1149/1945-7111/ac7008
5,17697,"A four cell bundle produced theoretical 1.82 l hr(-1) O-2 with a power consumption of 2.18 W at 700 degrees C. Excellent stability of the cells was achieved during severe current and thermal cycling tests, indicating the successful fabrication of the tubular cells using the tape co-casting method.",A Novel Solid Oxide Electrochemical Oxygen Pump for Oxygen Therapy,10.1149/1945-7111/ac7008
