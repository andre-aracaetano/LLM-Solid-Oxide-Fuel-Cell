3,9866,The results show that La1.6Sr0.4NiO4-Ag hollow nanofibers with an average diameter in 400 nm are obtained after sintering at 800 degrees C for 2 h. The La1.6Sr0.4NiO4-Ag nanofiber forms mesh-like morphology and good contact with the electrolyte after sintering at 850 degrees C for 1 h. The Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements show that the area specific resistance (ASR) of La1.6Sr0.4NiO4-Ag nanofiber cathode is 0.32 cm(2)at 700 degrees C in air.,Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of La1.6Sr0.4NiO4-Ag Hollow Nanofibers,
4,9866,The oxygen partial pressure measurement indicates that the rate limiting step of the nanofiber cathode is charge transfer process from 600 to 700 degrees C.,Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of La1.6Sr0.4NiO4-Ag Hollow Nanofibers,
