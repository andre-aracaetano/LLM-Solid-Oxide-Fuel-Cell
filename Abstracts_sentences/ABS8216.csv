4,8216,"It is found that the structural features in the mesoscale-modified cell, such as interfacial area enlargement and thickness inhomogeneity, cause nonuniform distributions of physicochemical quantities that contribute to electrochemical reactions.",Mechanism of improved electrochemical performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells by mesostructural modification of electrode-electrolyte interface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230107
5,8216,"Consequently, the decreases in the ohmic and activation overpotentials of the mesoscale-modified cell relative to the flat cell are respectively larger and smaller than those estimated under the assumptions that the ionic and charge-transfer current densities are uniformly distributed in a cell.",Mechanism of improved electrochemical performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells by mesostructural modification of electrode-electrolyte interface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230107
6,8216,"Moreover, the ionic current density distribution has a strong nonuniformity at a high current density, leading to a large relative decrease in ohmic loss.",Mechanism of improved electrochemical performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells by mesostructural modification of electrode-electrolyte interface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230107
7,8216,"Furthermore, the cell overpotential is more reduced at a higher current density; thus, the mesostructural modification of anode-supported SOFCs can lead to a higher cell performance.",Mechanism of improved electrochemical performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells by mesostructural modification of electrode-electrolyte interface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230107
