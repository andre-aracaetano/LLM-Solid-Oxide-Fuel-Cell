1,7792,The effect of inserting an anode functional layer (AFL) of NiO/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-YSZ between the NiO-YSZ anode and the YSZ electrolyte on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells has been examined.,NiO/YSZ-YSZ Nanocomposite Functional Layer for High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3294768
2,7792,"Dual NiO/YSZ-YSZ composite powders synthesized by the polymerizable complex method result in composite nanosized NiO and YSZ particles adhered to core YSZ particles, and their mean particle size and surface area are 0.4 mu m and 39.0 m(2) g(-1), respectively.",NiO/YSZ-YSZ Nanocomposite Functional Layer for High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3294768
3,7792,"The AFL is fabricated by dip-coating the anode substrate into a slurry of composite powders, and its thickness can be controlled by varying the withdrawn speed, while the composite-anode-supported YSZ electrolyte is also prepared by dip-coating the composite anode into the YSZ slurry, followed by sintering at 1400 degrees C.",NiO/YSZ-YSZ Nanocomposite Functional Layer for High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3294768
4,7792,It is concluded that the composite AFL is capable of minimizing the possibility of defect occurrence between anode and electrolyte layers during processing as well as considerably increasing the interface of the three-phase boundary.,NiO/YSZ-YSZ Nanocomposite Functional Layer for High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3294768
5,7792,"A unit cell with a 15 mu m thick AFL in conjunction with the LSM-YSZ cathode shows a maximum power density of 1.58 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C in hydrogen (3% H2O), which is about three times higher than that of the unit cell without the AFL.",NiO/YSZ-YSZ Nanocomposite Functional Layer for High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1149/1.3294768
