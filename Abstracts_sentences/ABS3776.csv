1,3776,"In this work corrosion kinetics of the porous IN625 alloy is studied in the temperature range of 700 degrees C-800 degrees C in air and humidified hydrogen for up to 1000 h. Moreover, an effective and simple method of reducing corrosion rates of porous alloys by the infiltration of the rare earth elements is shown.",High temperature corrosion and corrosion protection of porous Ni22Cr alloys,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2014.10.051
2,3776,Modification by the yttrium containing precursor reduces the corrosion rate by a factor of 50 in air at 700 degrees C so that the lifetime of the infiltrated alloy is greatly extended.,High temperature corrosion and corrosion protection of porous Ni22Cr alloys,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2014.10.051
