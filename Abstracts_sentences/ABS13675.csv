3,13675,"Similar to most electrochemical transport phenomena, it is assumed that local equilibrium prevails.","THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS WITH 2-LAYER, COMPOSITE ELECTROLYTES - ELECTROLYTE STABILITY",10.1149/1.2085811
4,13675,An equivalent circuit approach is used to estimate the partial pressure of oxygen at the interface.,"THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS WITH 2-LAYER, COMPOSITE ELECTROLYTES - ELECTROLYTE STABILITY",10.1149/1.2085811
5,13675,"It is shown that thermodynamic stability of the electrolyte (ceria or bismuth oxide) depends upon the transport characteristics of the composite electrolyte, in particular the electronic conductivity of the air-side part of the electrolyte.","THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS WITH 2-LAYER, COMPOSITE ELECTROLYTES - ELECTROLYTE STABILITY",10.1149/1.2085811
6,13675,"For example, the greater the electronic conductivity of the air-side part of the electrolyte, the greater is the interface partial pressure of oxygen and the greater is the thermodynamic stability.","THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS WITH 2-LAYER, COMPOSITE ELECTROLYTES - ELECTROLYTE STABILITY",10.1149/1.2085811
7,13675,"The analysis shows that it would be advantageous to use composite electrolytes instead of all-zirconia electrolytes, thus making low-temperature (approximately 600-800-degrees-C) SOFCs feasible.","THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS WITH 2-LAYER, COMPOSITE ELECTROLYTES - ELECTROLYTE STABILITY",10.1149/1.2085811
