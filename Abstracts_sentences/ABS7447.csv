2,7447,"For electrolyte application in solid oxide fuel cells, YSZ can be used with SDC and act as an electron barrier.",Nanostructure and conductivity study of yttria doped zirconia films deposited on samaria doped ceria,10.1016/j.apsusc.2011.04.058
3,7447,"The conductivity of YSZ and SDC was measured after sintering at 1000 degrees C. Results indicated that YSZ film became columnar structure, and a new layer formed between the YSZ film and SDC, due to the inter-diffusion between zirconium ions and cerium ions.",Nanostructure and conductivity study of yttria doped zirconia films deposited on samaria doped ceria,10.1016/j.apsusc.2011.04.058
