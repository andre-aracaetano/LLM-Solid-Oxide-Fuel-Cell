1,5354,A cobalt-free cubic perovskite oxide SrFe0.9Sb0.1O3-delta (SFSb) is investigated as a novel cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs).,A cobalt-free SrFe0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cathode material for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with stable BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.015
2,5354,XRD results show that SFSb cathode is chemically compatible with the electrolyte BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) for temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. Thin proton-conducting BZCYYb electrolyte and NiO-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (NiO-BZCYYb) anode functional layer are prepared over porous anode substrates composed of NiO-BZCYYb by a one-step dry-pressing/co-firing process.,A cobalt-free SrFe0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cathode material for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with stable BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.015
3,5354,Laboratory-sized quad-layer cells of NiO-BZCYYb/NiO-BZCYYb/BZCYYb/SFSb are operated from 550 to 700 degrees C with humidified hydrogen (similar to 3% H2O) as fuel and the static air as oxidant.,A cobalt-free SrFe0.9Sb0.1O3-δ cathode material for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with stable BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.015
