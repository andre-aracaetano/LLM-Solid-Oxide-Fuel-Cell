1,13850,"A 5-cell solid oxide fuel cell stack was tested during 10,000 h of continuous operation with simulated reformate gas as fuel (71 vol.% H-2, 20.7 vol.% CO2 and 8.3 vol.% steam) under high fuel utilization (73%) and constant current load (0.5 A cm(-2) or 25 A) at 750 degrees C.","Monitoring the degradation of a solid oxide fuel cell stack during 10,000 h via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.electacta.2011.10.080
2,13850,In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to monitor the evolution of ohmic and polarisation resistances of individual cells in the stack without interrupting the current load.,"Monitoring the degradation of a solid oxide fuel cell stack during 10,000 h via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.electacta.2011.10.080
3,13850,Impedance spectra were recorded on each cell periodically (every 1000 h) or after uncontrolled incidents happened with the test setup.,"Monitoring the degradation of a solid oxide fuel cell stack during 10,000 h via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.electacta.2011.10.080
4,13850,"It has been found that the stack degradation is mainly attributed to the increased ohmic resistance, pointing to possible causes such as interconnect corrosion and reduced effective contact areas between cells and interconnects.","Monitoring the degradation of a solid oxide fuel cell stack during 10,000 h via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.electacta.2011.10.080
5,13850,"The degradation rate during the first 5000 h was about 1% kh(-1), but increased afterwards up to 1.5% kh(-1) due to the impact of incidents.","Monitoring the degradation of a solid oxide fuel cell stack during 10,000 h via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.electacta.2011.10.080
6,13850,"Both types of incidents (fuel supply fluctuations and overloading failure of the electronic load) were complicated by inhomogeneous fuel distribution among cells, leading to most probably partial re-oxidation of the anode, accelerating the stack degradation.","Monitoring the degradation of a solid oxide fuel cell stack during 10,000 h via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.electacta.2011.10.080
