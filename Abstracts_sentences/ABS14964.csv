3,14964,"When looking for alternatives, the conductivity values for each material found in widely cited literature can be confusing, as the reported values are sometimes in conflict with each other.",Comparison of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolyte materials for operation at 500 °C,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115138
4,14964,"Therefore, we present a systematic comparison of the conductivity of the three most popular, commercially available electrolyte materials, i.e., YSZ, scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ), and gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC).",Comparison of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolyte materials for operation at 500 °C,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115138
5,14964,"By using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterize the ionic conductivities, we find that at 500 degrees C, GDC has a higher ionic conductivity (5.8 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)) than ScSZ (2.5 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) ) and YSZ (1.1 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)).",Comparison of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolyte materials for operation at 500 °C,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115138

7,14964,"This conductivity comparison can be used as a guide when deciding on electrolyte materials for different SOFC applications, especially when the fabrication of different thickness of the electrolyte layer has to be considered and rectify misleading information in the literature.",Comparison of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolyte materials for operation at 500 °C,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115138
