1,15662,"In this study, a unique dual-structured hollow fibre design has been developed for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFCs), using a single-step phase-inversion assisted co-extrusion technique.",A dual-structured anode/Ni-mesh current collector hollow fibre for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.043
2,15662,The dual-structured design consists of an outer anode layer and an inner anodic current collecting layer that are formed simultaneously during fabrication.,A dual-structured anode/Ni-mesh current collector hollow fibre for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.043
3,15662,"Meanwhile, a plurality of micro-channels initiating from the exterior surface of the anode layer penetrate through the two layers, forming a highly asymmetric anode and a mesh current collecting layer, which significantly facilitates the gas transport.",A dual-structured anode/Ni-mesh current collector hollow fibre for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.043
4,15662,"With the increasing thickness of the current collecting layer (approximately 15-60 mu m), electrical conductivity increases from 1.9 x 10(4) S cm(-1) to 4.0 x 10(4) S cm(-1), while the mechanical strength drops slightly from approximately 168-113 MPa due to its 'dragging effect' during co-sintering.",A dual-structured anode/Ni-mesh current collector hollow fibre for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.043
5,15662,"The benefits of improved current collection may potentially overweigh the reduced mechanical property, especially when dualstructured hollow fibres of this type are bundled together to form a stack.",A dual-structured anode/Ni-mesh current collector hollow fibre for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.043
6,15662,"Moreover, benefiting from this innovative design, sustainable development of a larger scale of MT-SOFC stack or system becomes less challenging, since technical issues, such as concentration polarization and efficient current collection, hampering the MT-SOFC system design, can be completely overcome.",A dual-structured anode/Ni-mesh current collector hollow fibre for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.043
