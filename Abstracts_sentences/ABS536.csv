1,536,"This paper summarizes Contained Energy, LLC's (CEL's) 2 year work effort to produce a DCFC single cell with a minimum performance of 120 W.L-1 at 50% efficiency.",Direct carbon fuel cell: A proposed hybrid design to improve commercialization potential,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.048
2,536,It explains the challenge of high temperature that is required to get the power densities necessary to produce feasible-sized operational units and also explains problems encountered with partial oxidation of the carbon at those temperatures which causes low efficiencies.,Direct carbon fuel cell: A proposed hybrid design to improve commercialization potential,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.048
3,536,"Finally, in an attempt to balance these two opposing parameters, CEL introduces a novel ceramic DCFC concept, reviews lessons learned and makes recommendations for future DCFC work.",Direct carbon fuel cell: A proposed hybrid design to improve commercialization potential,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.048
