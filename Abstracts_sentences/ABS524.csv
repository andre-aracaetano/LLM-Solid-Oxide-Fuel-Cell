1,524,"Lanthanum-based iron and cobalt-containing perovskite (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta, LSCF) is a good candidate for cathode materials due to its electro-catalytic activity at a relatively low operating temperature in solid oxide fuel cell (700-800 degrees C).",Multi-pore structured cathodes with inorganic dispersants for solid oxide fuel cells,
2,524,"To increase the mass transport and triple-phase boundaries, multi-pore cathode electrodes were fabricated with pore formers and LSCF.",Multi-pore structured cathodes with inorganic dispersants for solid oxide fuel cells,
3,524,"In a cathode fabricated with a layered structured pore former, the fuel cell performance increased by 30%, from 1.1 Wcm(-2) to 1.4 Wcm(-2).",Multi-pore structured cathodes with inorganic dispersants for solid oxide fuel cells,
4,524,The multi-pore structure extended the vicinity of the mixed conductor and fuel and resulted in higher fuel cell performance.,Multi-pore structured cathodes with inorganic dispersants for solid oxide fuel cells,
5,524,The porous cathode with pore formers is expected to reduce the required amount of LSCF materials and lower the cost of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Multi-pore structured cathodes with inorganic dispersants for solid oxide fuel cells,
