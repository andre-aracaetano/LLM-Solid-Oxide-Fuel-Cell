1,15784,"Fast oxygen exchange kinetics, a key figure of merit in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrodes, is often dramatically hindered by the presence of even small concentrations of impurities, for example, Si which is common 50 in ceramics processing.",Improving the Si Impurity Tolerance of Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-δ SOFC Electrodes with Reactive Surface Additives,10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00501
2,15784,"In this work, rapid degradation of oxygen exchange kinetics was found on dense thin films of Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (PCO), a mixed ionic electronic conducting 0 electrode for SOFCs, using a new optical transmission relaxation (OTR) technique which facilitates kinetics measurements of bare film surfaces (i.e., in the absence of current collectors typical of conventional measurements).",Improving the Si Impurity Tolerance of Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-δ SOFC Electrodes with Reactive Surface Additives,10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00501
3,15784,"Si was identified by TEM and XPS as a significant impurity, forming a blocking layer on the electrode surface.",Improving the Si Impurity Tolerance of Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-δ SOFC Electrodes with Reactive Surface Additives,10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00501
