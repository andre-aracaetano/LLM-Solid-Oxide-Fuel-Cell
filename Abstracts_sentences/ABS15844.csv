3,15844,"The products were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis/thermal gravimetry (DTA/TG), and the four-point probe technique (4PPT).","Electrical, structural and thermal properties of nanoceramic (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Ho2O3)x(Tm2O3)y ternary system",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.024
4,15844,XRD and DTA/TG measurements indicate that all of the samples have the stable fluorite type face centered cubic (fcc) delta-phase.,"Electrical, structural and thermal properties of nanoceramic (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Ho2O3)x(Tm2O3)y ternary system",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.024
5,15844,4PPT measurements were performed in the temperature range 150-1000 degrees C in air and these measurements showed that the electrical conductivity of the samples decrease with increasing amount of Tm2O3.,"Electrical, structural and thermal properties of nanoceramic (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Ho2O3)x(Tm2O3)y ternary system",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.024
6,15844,This increase in the electrical conductivity of the samples could be attributed to the increase in the numbers of highly polarizable cations and oxide ion vacancies.,"Electrical, structural and thermal properties of nanoceramic (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Ho2O3)x(Tm2O3)y ternary system",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.024
7,15844,The highest conductivity value was found as 5.31 x 10(-1),"Electrical, structural and thermal properties of nanoceramic (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Ho2O3)x(Tm2O3)y ternary system",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.024
8,15844,Omega cm(-1) for the (Bi2O3)(1-x-y)(Ho2O3)(x)(Tm2O3)(y) ternary system (for x=20 and y=5 mol%) at 1000 degrees C.,"Electrical, structural and thermal properties of nanoceramic (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Ho2O3)x(Tm2O3)y ternary system",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.024
9,15844,"The activation energies of the samples were calculated from log a graphics versus 1000/T. These calculated results showed that the translation motion of the charge carriers, oxygen vacancies, and space charge polarizations are responsible for the change in activation energy as a function of temperature.","Electrical, structural and thermal properties of nanoceramic (Bi2O3)1-x-y(Ho2O3)x(Tm2O3)y ternary system",10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.024
