1,18977,"Earlier studies have shown a strong correlation between the enthalpy of formation, Delta H-f,H-ox, and the ionic conductivity, sigma(i), near room temperature in doped ceria systems, which are promising solid electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Defect Chemistry of Singly and Doubly Doped Ceria: Correlation between Ion Transport and Energetics,10.1002/anie.201404618
2,18977,"The present work demonstrates that this correlation holds at the operating temperature of IT-SOFCs, 600-700 degrees C. Solid solutions of Ce1-xNdxO2-0.5x, Ce1-xSmxO2-0.5x, and Ce1-xSm0.5xNd0.5xO2-0.5x are studied.",Defect Chemistry of Singly and Doubly Doped Ceria: Correlation between Ion Transport and Energetics,10.1002/anie.201404618
3,18977,"The Delta H-f,H-ox at 702 degrees C is determined by considering the excess heat content between 25 and 702 degrees C combined with the value of Delta H-f,H-ox at 25 degrees C. Both sigma(i) and Delta H-f,H-ox show maxima at x=0.15 and 0.20 for the singly and doubly doped ceria, respectively, suggesting that the number of mobile oxygen vacancies in these solid solutions reaches a maximum near those compositions.",Defect Chemistry of Singly and Doubly Doped Ceria: Correlation between Ion Transport and Energetics,10.1002/anie.201404618
4,18977,"An increase in temperature results in a shift of the maximum in both Delta H-f,H-ox and si towards higher concentrations.",Defect Chemistry of Singly and Doubly Doped Ceria: Correlation between Ion Transport and Energetics,10.1002/anie.201404618
5,18977,This shift results from a gradual increase in dissociation of the defect associates.,Defect Chemistry of Singly and Doubly Doped Ceria: Correlation between Ion Transport and Energetics,10.1002/anie.201404618
