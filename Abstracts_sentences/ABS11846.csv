1,11846,Effects of decrease in sintering temperature (1473-1623 K) on the electrochemical performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were investigated using Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3 (LSGM) electrolyte film while using La-doped CeO2 with Co addition (Co LDC) as the buffer layer.,Decreased sintering temperature of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with La-doped CeO2 and Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3 films by Co addition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.106
2,11846,The sintering temperature of the single cell was reduced to 1523 K by the use of Co-LDC buffer layer.,Decreased sintering temperature of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with La-doped CeO2 and Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3 films by Co addition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.106
3,11846,"The cell showed maximum power density (MPD) of similar to 1 W cm(-2) and an open circuit voltage (OCV) close to the theoretical value at 973 K, which was comparable with previous results for cells prepared by sintering at 1673 K.",Decreased sintering temperature of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with La-doped CeO2 and Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3 films by Co addition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.106
4,11846,"The cell performance was further improved with increasing the sintering temperature because of the reduced internal resistances, and it was stable after operation for 92 h at 973 K, suggesting that the Co-LDC buffer layer posed no detrimental effect.",Decreased sintering temperature of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with La-doped CeO2 and Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3 films by Co addition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.106
