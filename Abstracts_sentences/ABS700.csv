1,700,Conventional gas turbines (GT) are working with limited fuels and exhibit thermal efficiency between 30 and 40%.,"A novel comparison of energy-exergy, and sustainability analysis for biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell integrated gas turbine hybrid configuration",10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116923
2,700,"This restriction with the fuels and its efficiency range can be improved by adding an electrochemical fuel cell, i.e; a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC).","A novel comparison of energy-exergy, and sustainability analysis for biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell integrated gas turbine hybrid configuration",10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116923
3,700,"This paper proposes three different types of biomasses, including pine sawdust, poplar sawdust, and almond shell, which may all be used to power the novel biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell gas turbine (SOFC-GT) presented herein.","A novel comparison of energy-exergy, and sustainability analysis for biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell integrated gas turbine hybrid configuration",10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116923
4,700,MATLAB based simulation is used to validate the results of this fuel cell based hybrid cycle performance.,"A novel comparison of energy-exergy, and sustainability analysis for biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell integrated gas turbine hybrid configuration",10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116923
5,700,"Three performance parameters are considered namely, current density (id), turbine input temperature (TIT), and pressure ratio (rp) to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.","A novel comparison of energy-exergy, and sustainability analysis for biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell integrated gas turbine hybrid configuration",10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116923
6,700,"For this, energy-exergy approaches based on the first and second law of thermodynamics are used to assess each cycle component as well as the entire system.","A novel comparison of energy-exergy, and sustainability analysis for biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell integrated gas turbine hybrid configuration",10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116923
7,700,The sustainability index and environmental impact factor of each component are evaluated using dimensionless modified exergy indicators.,"A novel comparison of energy-exergy, and sustainability analysis for biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell integrated gas turbine hybrid configuration",10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116923
8,700,"With all three of the suggested biomass fuels, the SOFC-GT hybrid system runs most effectively at pressure-ratio of 6 and TIT 1250 K. Pine sawdust (Case-1) exhibits the largest levels of exergy destruction (2653.14 kW), environmental effect (0.91), and the lowest sustainability index (2.09) but it also has the highest levels of thermal efficiency (63.12%).","A novel comparison of energy-exergy, and sustainability analysis for biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell integrated gas turbine hybrid configuration",10.1016/j.enconman.2023.116923
