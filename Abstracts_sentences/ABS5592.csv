1,5592,"Here we report lightweight, high-performance tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with 0.8 mm diameter operable at/under 550 degrees C.","Design and fabrication of lightweight, submillimeter tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2739211
2,5592,"The SOFCs consist of ordinary materials with a well-designed anode microstructure with porosity of 46% (before reduction) and reduced anode thickness less than 200 mu m. Thus, the weight of the SOFC was realized to be 0.015 g per 1 cm tube length (electrode area=0.25 cm(2)).","Design and fabrication of lightweight, submillimeter tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2739211
3,5592,"The single-cell performance test showed that the peak power densities of the SOFC were 273, 628, and 1017 mW/cm(2) at 450, 500, and 550 degrees C with wet H-2 fuel, respectively.","Design and fabrication of lightweight, submillimeter tubular solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2739211
