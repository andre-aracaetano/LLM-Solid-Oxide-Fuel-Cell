1,18934,The stability of La2xSr1-2xTi1-xNixO3-delta (LSTN) and La7x/4Sr1-7x/4Ti1-xNixO3-delta (25LSTN) materials in high tem- perature reducing conditions has been studied with a special focus on the Ni exsolution process for SOFC anode / SOEC cathode application.,"Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part B: Conditions of Ni exsolution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.034
2,18934,"In a general way, LSTN and 25LSTN compounds are stable after treatments at 800 degrees C in air and wet reducing atmosphere.","Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part B: Conditions of Ni exsolution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.034
3,18934,The low chemical expansion makes them compatible with a use in an electrochemical Solid Oxide Cell.,"Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part B: Conditions of Ni exsolution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.034
4,18934,Those materials are therefore useful for an application as symmetric oxide cell electrode or only hydrogen electrode.,"Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part B: Conditions of Ni exsolution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.034
5,18934,In situ Nickel exsolution is evidenced at 800 degrees C in Ar/H-2 (2%) but is limited by a slow kinetics and a higher temperature pre-reduction is preferred before a use as SOFC anode (SOEC cathode).,"Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part B: Conditions of Ni exsolution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.034
6,18934,"Depending on the treatment, in situ reduction or pre-reduction (T > 1000 degrees C), the compounds are not in the same thermodynamic equilibrium state.","Study of (La,Sr)(Ti,Ni)O3-δ materials for symmetrical Solid Oxide Cell electrode - Part B: Conditions of Ni exsolution",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.034
