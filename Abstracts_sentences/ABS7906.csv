1,7906,The effects of isothermally long-term and thermal cycling tests on the performance of an ASC type commercial solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) have been investigated.,Analysis of Long-Term and Thermal Cycling Tests for a Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4037232
2,7906,"For the long-term test, the cells were tested over 5000 h in two stages, the first 3000 h and the followed 2000 h, under the different flow rates of hydrogen and air.",Analysis of Long-Term and Thermal Cycling Tests for a Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4037232
3,7906,"Regarding the thermal cycling test, 60 cycles in total were also divided into two sections, the temperature ranges of 700 degrees C to 250 degrees C and 700 degrees C to 50 degrees C were applied for the every single cycle of first 30 cycles and the later 30 cycles, respectively.",Analysis of Long-Term and Thermal Cycling Tests for a Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4037232
4,7906,"The results of long-term test show that the average degradation rates for the cell in the first 3000 h and the followed 2000 h under different flow rates of fuel and air are 1.16 and 2.64%/ kh, respectively.",Analysis of Long-Term and Thermal Cycling Tests for a Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4037232
5,7906,"However, there is only a degradation of 6.6% in voltage for the cell after 60 thermal cycling tests.",Analysis of Long-Term and Thermal Cycling Tests for a Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4037232
6,7906,"In addition, it is found that many pores formed in the anode of the cell which caused by the agglomeration of Ni after long-term test.",Analysis of Long-Term and Thermal Cycling Tests for a Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4037232
7,7906,"In contrast, the vertical cracks penetrating through the cathode of the cell and the in-plane cracks between the cathode and barrier layer of the cell formed due to the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch after 60 thermal cycling tests.",Analysis of Long-Term and Thermal Cycling Tests for a Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4037232
