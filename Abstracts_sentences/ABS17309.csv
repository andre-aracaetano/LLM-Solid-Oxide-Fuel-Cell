1,17309,"Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2-delta (CMF) has been used as a new oxide cathode of solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) using LaGaO3-based electrolyte for H-2 production under a feeding gas composition of 20% steam/1% H-2/79% Ar. CMF cathode exhibits good electrolysis performance and well-performed hydrogen production rate with the Faraday's law at 1173-973 K. Through impedance measurement under a DC polarized condition, the studies show that polarization resistance and ohmic resistance decreased with increasing DC bias potential.",Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2-δ as an Alternative Cathode Material for High Temperature Steam Electrolysis Using LaGaO3-based Oxide Electrolyte,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.121
2,17309,"Furthermore, CMF showed good stability, and no significant aggregation and delamination were noticed during the electrolysis measurement.",Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2-δ as an Alternative Cathode Material for High Temperature Steam Electrolysis Using LaGaO3-based Oxide Electrolyte,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.121
