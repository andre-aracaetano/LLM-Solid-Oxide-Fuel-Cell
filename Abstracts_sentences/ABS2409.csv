5,2409,"Among all these compositions, Pr0.8Ca0.3Ba0.94Co2O5+delta (PC0.3B0.94C) exhibits the lowest polarization resistance (Rp) of 0.027 omega cm(2) at 700 & DEG;C. The peak power density (PPD) of 1114 mW cm(-2) is achieved in the PC0.3B0.94C cathode-based button fuel cell at 700 & DEG;C, along with outstanding stability over a period of 130 h. The findings endow the potential utilization of the PC0.3B0.94C cathode for IT-SOFCs under the realistic conditions.",A-site Ca-doped layered double perovskite Pr1-xCaxBa0.94Co2O5+d as high-performance and stable cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164191
