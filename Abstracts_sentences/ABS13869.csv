1,13869,The oil and gas industry generates a significant amount of harmful greenhouse gases that cause irreversible environmental impact; this fact is exacerbated by the world's utter dependence on fossil fuels as a primary energy source and low-efficiency oil and gas operation plants.,Life Cycle Assessment for Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells into Gas Processing Operations,10.3390/en14154668
2,13869,Integration of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) into natural gas plants can enhance their operational efficiencies and reduce emissions.,Life Cycle Assessment for Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells into Gas Processing Operations,10.3390/en14154668
3,13869,"However, a systematic analysis of the life cycle impacts of SOFC integration in natural gas operations is necessary to quantitatively and comparatively understand the potential benefits.",Life Cycle Assessment for Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells into Gas Processing Operations,10.3390/en14154668
4,13869,This study presents a systematic cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) based on the ISO 14040 and 14044 standards using a planar anode-supported SOFC with a lifespan of ten years and a functional unit of one MW electricity output.,Life Cycle Assessment for Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells into Gas Processing Operations,10.3390/en14154668
5,13869,"The analysis primarily focused on global warming, acidification, eutrophication, and ozone potentials in addition to human health particulate matter and human toxicity potentials.",Life Cycle Assessment for Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells into Gas Processing Operations,10.3390/en14154668
6,13869,"The total global warming potential (GWP) of a 1 MW SOFC for 10 years in Qatar conditions is found to be 2,415,755 kg CO2 eq., and the greenhouse gas (GHG) impact is found to be higher during the operation phase than the manufacturing phase, rating 71% and 29%, respectively.",Life Cycle Assessment for Integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells into Gas Processing Operations,10.3390/en14154668
