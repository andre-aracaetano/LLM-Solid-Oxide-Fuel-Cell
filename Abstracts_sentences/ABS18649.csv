1,18649,"Polycrystalline samples of the super ionic conductor La1-xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-delta (LSGM) and, for comparative purpose, the pure and doped varieties of its high-temperature equilibrium Phases La4Ga2O9, LaSrGa3O7, and LaSrGaO4 were prepared by conventional ceramic processing.","Preparation and electrical conductivity of common impurity phases in (La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3 solid electrolytes",
2,18649,"Sui, table preparation conditions were studied by assessment of the underlying phase relations as well as by dilatometric analysis and density measurements.","Preparation and electrical conductivity of common impurity phases in (La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3 solid electrolytes",
3,18649,Electrochemical characterization under variable temperatures entailed 4-pt dc conductivity measurements.,"Preparation and electrical conductivity of common impurity phases in (La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3 solid electrolytes",
4,18649,"It was established that samples of all compounds can be prepared by sintering in the temperature range between 1400 degrees and 1500 degreesC in air, resulting in nearly single phase materials with relative densities in excess of 92%.","Preparation and electrical conductivity of common impurity phases in (La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3 solid electrolytes",
5,18649,The total conductivity of La-rich La1+xSr1-xGa3O7-delta (sigmaapproximate to10(-1) S.cm(-1) at 800 degreesC) was found to be in the same range as that of LSGM while the total conductivities of the La4Ga2O9 and LaSrGaO4 phases are considerably smaller (sigma approximate to 10(-5) - 10(-4) S.cm(-1) at 800 degreesC).,"Preparation and electrical conductivity of common impurity phases in (La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3 solid electrolytes",
