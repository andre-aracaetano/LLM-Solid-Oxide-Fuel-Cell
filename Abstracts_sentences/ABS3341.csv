4,3341,"Benefiting from enhanced electrical conductivity, oxygen surface exchange and diffusion rates, the ORR activity of LBG0.05CF outperforms that of La0.33Ba0.67Co0.7Fe0.3O3-delta (LBCF), as evidenced by the lower polarization resistance (0.035 Omega cm(2)) at 700 degrees C. The Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) electrolyte-supported fuel cell with the LBG0.05CF cathode delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 371 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, which surpasses the PPD (278 mW cm(-2)) for LBCF-based cell.",Impacts of A-site gadolinium doping on electrocatalytic performance of La0.33Ba0.62Gd0.05Co0.7Fe0.3O3-δ to realize promising cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.05.029
