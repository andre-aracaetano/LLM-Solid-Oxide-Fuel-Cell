3,17961,The anode polarization is determined over a range of gas compositions of B-site co-doped Sr0.88Y0.08Ti0.95M0.05O3-delta (SYTMO where M represents the B-site dopants) for sparsely Ni-infiltrated SYTMO.,B-Site doping and catalytic activity of Sr(Y)TiO3,10.1149/1.2752970
4,17961,Co and Cr were selected as the B-site dopants and compared with undoped SYTO based on their differing reducibility.,B-Site doping and catalytic activity of Sr(Y)TiO3,10.1149/1.2752970
