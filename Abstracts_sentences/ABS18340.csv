5,18340,"As sintering temperature was increased the expected transformations from monoclinic to tetragonal to cubic zirconia were observed; however, in gas-phase derived zirconia ceramics two cubic phases were observed at about 1200 degrees C. Most of the grains (90-95%) contained 8 mol% Y2O3, the expected composition, whereas the minority cubic phase, which disappeared on further heating, contained about only 3 mol% Y2O3.",SINTERING OF A PLASMA-DERIVED ZIRCONIA POWDER FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL ELECTROLYTES,10.1016/0167-2738(94)90157-0
