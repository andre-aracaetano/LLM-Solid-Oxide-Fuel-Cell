1,17270,"In this work, we focused on La0.95Ba0.05Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta with the perovskite structure, and investigated the local structure around the oxygen vacancy by pair distribution function (PDF) method and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.","Local structure analysis on (La,Ba)(Ga,Mg)O3-δ by the pair distribution function method using a neutron source and density functional theory calculations",10.1016/j.ssc.2013.03.026
2,17270,"By comparing the G(r) simulated based on the OFT calculation and the experimentally-observed G(r), it was suggested that the oxygen vacancy was trapped by Ba2+ at the La3+ site at least at room temperature.","Local structure analysis on (La,Ba)(Ga,Mg)O3-δ by the pair distribution function method using a neutron source and density functional theory calculations",10.1016/j.ssc.2013.03.026
3,17270,"Such a defect association may be one of the reasons why the La0.95Ba0.05Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta showed lower oxide-ion conductivity than (La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3-delta which was widely-used as an electrolyte of the solid oxide fuel cell.","Local structure analysis on (La,Ba)(Ga,Mg)O3-δ by the pair distribution function method using a neutron source and density functional theory calculations",10.1016/j.ssc.2013.03.026
