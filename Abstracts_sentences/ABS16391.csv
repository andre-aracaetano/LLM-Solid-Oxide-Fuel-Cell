1,16391,We have developed a Co-free solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based upon Fe mixed oxides that gives an extraordinary performance in test-cells with H-2 as fuel.,"Co-free, iron perovskites as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.07.017
2,16391,"As cathode material, the perovskite Sr0.9K0.1FeO3-delta (SKFO) has been selected since it has an excellent ionic and electronic conductivity and long-term stability under oxidizing conditions; the characterization of this material included X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis, scanning microscopy and conductivity measurements.","Co-free, iron perovskites as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.07.017
3,16391,The electrodes were supported on a 300-mu m thick pellet of the electrolyte La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta (LSGM) with Sr2MgMoO6 as the anode and SKFO as the cathode.,"Co-free, iron perovskites as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.07.017
4,16391,"The test cells gave a maximum power density of 680 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and 850 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, with pure H-2 as fuel.","Co-free, iron perovskites as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.07.017
5,16391,The electronic conductivity shows a change of regime at T approximate to 350 degrees C that could correspond to the phase transition from tetragonal to cubic symmetry.,"Co-free, iron perovskites as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.07.017
6,16391,The high-temperature regime is characterized by a metallic-like behavior.,"Co-free, iron perovskites as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.07.017
7,16391,At 800 degrees C the crystal structure contains 0.20(1) oxygen vacancies per formula unit randomly distributed over the oxygen sites (if a cubic symmetry is assumed).,"Co-free, iron perovskites as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.07.017
8,16391,"The presence of disordered vacancies could account, by itself, for the oxide-ion conductivity that is required for the mass transport across the cathode.","Co-free, iron perovskites as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.07.017
9,16391,The result is a competitive cathode material containing no cobalt that meets the target for the intermediate-temperature SOFC.,"Co-free, iron perovskites as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.07.017
