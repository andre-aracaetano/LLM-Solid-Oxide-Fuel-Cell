2,3926,Methane concentration measurements are presented for the TDLS system and are compared with concentration measurements taken using gas chromatography (GC).,Tunable Diode Laser Based Concentration Measurements of Water Vapour and Methane on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1109/JLT.2013.2247378
3,3926,"Furthermore, purge times for the SOFC gas-analysis system have been calculated using TDLS, which are measurements that cannot be obtained directly using GC.",Tunable Diode Laser Based Concentration Measurements of Water Vapour and Methane on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1109/JLT.2013.2247378
4,3926,"Finally, water vapour concentration measurements in the SOFC cathode are shown for different system operating conditions: a dry cathode cycle and during the introduction of water vapour.",Tunable Diode Laser Based Concentration Measurements of Water Vapour and Methane on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1109/JLT.2013.2247378
5,3926,"As GC cannot be used to measure water vapour in the SOFC cathode stream, a direct comparison cannot be made with the TDLS measurements.",Tunable Diode Laser Based Concentration Measurements of Water Vapour and Methane on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1109/JLT.2013.2247378
