2,11946,"To reduce this growth rate, several sintering inhibitors (SiC, SiN, Al2O3, AlN, CeO2 and GDC) were added into Ni-YSZ anode using powder methods.",Effect of various sintering inhibitors on the long term performance of Ni-YSZ anodes used for SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.04.145
3,11946,The modified anodes were screen printed on YSZ electrolyte to prepare symmetric half-cells and their performance was investigated by long term stability test at high temperature.,Effect of various sintering inhibitors on the long term performance of Ni-YSZ anodes used for SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.04.145
4,11946,"X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the most sintering inhibitors were chemically compatible with anode materials except Al2O3 and AlN.
