6,19118,It is shown that the phenomenological model can capture the driving force of Ni spreading/detachment on YSZ surface and the Ni migration reported in experiments can be qualitatively reproduced through the competition between Ni(OH)(2) diffusion and Ni-YSZ wettability change.,Modeling Ni redistribution in the hydrogen electrode of solid oxide cells through Ni(OH)2 diffusion and Ni-YSZ wettability change,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231924
7,19118,"It is also found that the initial microstructure of the active layer and the microstructure characteristics in the support layer can strongly affect the distribution of steam partial pressure and overpotential, hence the Ni redistribution, in the active layer, which may explain the inconsistencies in experiments.",Modeling Ni redistribution in the hydrogen electrode of solid oxide cells through Ni(OH)2 diffusion and Ni-YSZ wettability change,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231924
8,19118,Our results show that there are two missing pieces in current theory of Ni redistribution: a mechanism of fast Ni diffusion under humid atmosphere and the physical reason behind the Ni spreading/detachment.,Modeling Ni redistribution in the hydrogen electrode of solid oxide cells through Ni(OH)2 diffusion and Ni-YSZ wettability change,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231924
