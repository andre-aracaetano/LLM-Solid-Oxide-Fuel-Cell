1,5389,We describe a novel electrochemical cell for X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments during electrical polarization suitable for high-temperature materials such as those used in solid oxide fuel cells.,X-ray Absorption under Operating Conditions for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells Electrocatalysts: The Case of LSCF/YSZ,10.3390/surfaces2010003
2,5389,A half-cell LSCF/YSZ was then investigated under cathodic and anodic conditions (850 degrees C and applied electrical bias ranging from +1 V to -1 V in air).,X-ray Absorption under Operating Conditions for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells Electrocatalysts: The Case of LSCF/YSZ,10.3390/surfaces2010003
3,5389,The in situ XAS measurements allowed us to follow the LSCF degradation into simple oxides.,X-ray Absorption under Operating Conditions for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells Electrocatalysts: The Case of LSCF/YSZ,10.3390/surfaces2010003
4,5389,The rapid deterioration of LSCF is ascribed to the formation of excess of oxygen vacancies leading to the collapse of the mixed perovskite structure.,X-ray Absorption under Operating Conditions for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells Electrocatalysts: The Case of LSCF/YSZ,10.3390/surfaces2010003
