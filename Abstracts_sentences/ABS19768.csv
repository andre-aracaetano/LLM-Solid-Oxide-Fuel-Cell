1,19768,Pressurization influence on electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of both anode-supported and electrolyte-supported cells (ASC and ESC) are measured and compared using a high-pressure SOFC facility.,Comparison of Electrochemical Impedance Measurements between Pressurized Anode-Supported and Electrolyte-Supported Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0041503jes
2,19768,"In it both ASC and ESC apply the same single-cell setup, a planar full cell having 40 x 40 mm(2) effective reactive area sandwiched by a pair of rib-channel flow distributors (interconnectors) on both anode and cathode, using the same flow rates (Q(anode) = 0.5 slpm H-2 + 0.4 slpm N-2 and Q(cathode) = 0.9 slpm air) at 850 degrees C, with five different pressures (1 similar to 5 atm).",Comparison of Electrochemical Impedance Measurements between Pressurized Anode-Supported and Electrolyte-Supported Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0041503jes
3,19768,"It is found that ASC is more sensitive to pressurization than ESC, of which power densities of ASC/ESC at 0.7 V increase from 309/193 mW cm(-2) to 476/250 mW cm(-2), as p increases from 1 atm to 5 atm, corresponding to a 54%/30% increase.",Comparison of Electrochemical Impedance Measurements between Pressurized Anode-Supported and Electrolyte-Supported Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0041503jes
4,19768,"This result is explained by EIS measured data, in which both ohmic and polarization resistances of ASC are smaller than that of ESC.",Comparison of Electrochemical Impedance Measurements between Pressurized Anode-Supported and Electrolyte-Supported Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0041503jes
5,19768,"Moreover, the ohmic resistance is independent of pressurization for both ASC and ESC, remaining constant regardless of either unloaded or loaded conditions, while the polarization resistance decreases noticeably with increasing pressure for both ASC and ESC.",Comparison of Electrochemical Impedance Measurements between Pressurized Anode-Supported and Electrolyte-Supported Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0041503jes
