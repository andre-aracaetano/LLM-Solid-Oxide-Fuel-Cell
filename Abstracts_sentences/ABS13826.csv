3,13826,"In this study, we prepared La0.2Sr0.7Ti0.9Ni0.1O3-delta (LSTN)-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (GDC) (2-phase composite) of SOFC, or LSTN-GDC-Ni (3-phase composite) and tested their redox stability at 600 degrees C as SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) anodes.",Redox stability of La0.2Sr0.7Ti0.9Ni0.1O3-δ (LSTN)-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-δ (GDC) composite anode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.097
4,13826,"The electrolyte (Sc-stabilized zirconia)-supported cells with LSTN-GDC or LSTN-GDC-Ni anodes exposed to wet H2 show comparable performance (i.e., polarization resistance and power density) to that of cell with conventional Ni-GDC anode.",Redox stability of La0.2Sr0.7Ti0.9Ni0.1O3-δ (LSTN)-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-δ (GDC) composite anode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.097
5,13826,"However, during 10 redox cycles (1 h in air + 25 h in H2), they show much better stability with little degradation in Ohmic and polarization resistance values than Ni-GDC anode.",Redox stability of La0.2Sr0.7Ti0.9Ni0.1O3-δ (LSTN)-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-δ (GDC) composite anode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.09.097
