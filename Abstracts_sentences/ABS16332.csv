1,16332,A phenomenon was observed after exposing a fresh bed of activated carbon to a flow of natural gas that included several percent of ethane and propane in addition to the bulk methane.,Hydrocarbon Condensation Heating of Natural Gas by an Activated Carbon Desulfurizer,10.1115/1.3009269
2,16332,For several hours the temperature of the natural gas exiting the carbon bed was about 30 degrees C higher than the temperature of the gas entering the bed.,Hydrocarbon Condensation Heating of Natural Gas by an Activated Carbon Desulfurizer,10.1115/1.3009269
3,16332,This phenomenon can be attributed to release of the latent heat of vaporization due to condensation of all of ethane and propane into the pores of carbon.,Hydrocarbon Condensation Heating of Natural Gas by an Activated Carbon Desulfurizer,10.1115/1.3009269
4,16332,Due to its hydrophobic nature carbon is not expected to produce significant condensation of water vapor.,Hydrocarbon Condensation Heating of Natural Gas by an Activated Carbon Desulfurizer,10.1115/1.3009269
5,16332,The calculated additional water vapor condensation heat release and its related temperature increase was not observed.,Hydrocarbon Condensation Heating of Natural Gas by an Activated Carbon Desulfurizer,10.1115/1.3009269
