1,7737,"This work addresses the fabrication of membrane-type solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at medium temperatures, where all components are fabricated by plasma spray technology, and the evaluation of the performance of the SOFC single unit in a temperature range of 500 to 800 degrees C. Single cells composed of LaSrMgO3 cathodes, LaSrGaMgO3 (LSGM) electrolytes, and Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes were fabricated in successive atmospheric plasma-spraying processes.",Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on fully integrated plasma-sprayed components,10.1361/10599630522710
2,7737,Plasma-spraying processes have been optimized and tailored to each layer to achieve highly porous cathode and anode layers as well as high-density electrolyte layers.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on fully integrated plasma-sprayed components,10.1361/10599630522710
3,7737,A major effort has been devoted to the production of the LSGM electrolyte that has a high density and is free of cracks.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on fully integrated plasma-sprayed components,10.1361/10599630522710
4,7737,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to investigate the conductivity of the electrode layers, and particularly the resistance of the electrolyte layer.",Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on fully integrated plasma-sprayed components,10.1361/10599630522710
5,7737,It revealed that the heat treatment had a great influence on the specific conductivity of the sprayed electrolyte layers and that the specific conductivity of the heat-treated layers was dramatically increased to the same magnitude as is typical for sintered LSGM pellets.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on fully integrated plasma-sprayed components,10.1361/10599630522710
6,7737,The experimental results have demonstrated that the plasma-spraying process has a great potential for the integrated fabrication of medium-temperature SOFC units.,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on fully integrated plasma-sprayed components,10.1361/10599630522710
