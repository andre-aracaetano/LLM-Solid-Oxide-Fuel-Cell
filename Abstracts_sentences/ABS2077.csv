1,2077,"Compared with the conventional method, where dozens of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) units are connected in a large-scale stack to support a high power supply, a planar modular short SOFC stack (p-MSSS) with approximately 10-30 cells is considered to be advantageous for establishing a high power supply SOFC stack.",Geometric optimization of a 10-cell modular planar solid oxide fuel cell stack manifold,10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.04.035
2,2077,"Because an optimized p-MSSS is essential to achieve a high performance of the whole power supply stack, to further provide the optimized results for practical application, the efforts are focused the manifold for a specific 10-cell p-MSSS with a counter-flow distribution pattern.",Geometric optimization of a 10-cell modular planar solid oxide fuel cell stack manifold,10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.04.035
