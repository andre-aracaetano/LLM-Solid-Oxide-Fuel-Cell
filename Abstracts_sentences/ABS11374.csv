5,11374,Cathode microstructure design caused cells to perform differently producing peak power densities of 0.35-0.7 W cm(-2) at 600 A degrees C. Impedance spectroscopy analysis at 600 A degrees C on the FCs produced 0.12-0.24 Omega cm(2) confirming the cathode's structural effect on the overall area-specific resistance of the FCs.,Effects of lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) cathode properties on hollow fibre micro-tubular SOFC performances,10.1007/s10800-012-0429-x
6,11374,The best performing FC with a brush-deposited cathode was compared to a similar FC where cathode was deposited by dip coating; at 600 A degrees C the first produced 0.6 W cm(-2) while the second cell 0.7 W cm(-2).,Effects of lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) cathode properties on hollow fibre micro-tubular SOFC performances,10.1007/s10800-012-0429-x
