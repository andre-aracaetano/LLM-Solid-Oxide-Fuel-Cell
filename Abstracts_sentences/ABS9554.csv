1,9554,"Study was carried out on materials based on perovskite structures of cobaltite compositions of strontium SrCO3-delta and barium BaCO3-delta, obtained by synthesis from a melt of a stoichiometric mixture of cobalt oxide with strontium carbonates Co2O3 + SrCO3 or barium Co2O3 + BaCO3 in a stream of high (150 W/cm(2))","Renewable Energy Sources, Hydropower Materials for Fuel Cells Based on Barium and Strontium Cobaltites Synthetized on a Solar Furnace",10.1134/S004060152305004X
2,9554,"density concentrated solar radiation in a solar furnace, followed by quenching in water and sintering at a temperature of 1300 K. Hexagonal barium and strontium cobaltites had a developed fine microstructure (grains in the form of densely packed polyhedrons of various shapes 2-5 mu m in size), a semiconductor character of electrical conductivity, and a low thermal expansion coefficient (average 12.6 x 10(-6) K-1) in the temperature range 300-1100 K. The change in the electrical resistance of materials is due to the high affinity of cobalt ions for oxygen, which causes oxygen sorption and, as a result, leads to changes in the electronic structure of cobalt ions, as a result of charge transitions 2Co(3+) =","Renewable Energy Sources, Hydropower Materials for Fuel Cells Based on Barium and Strontium Cobaltites Synthetized on a Solar Furnace",10.1134/S004060152305004X
