1,17913,Strontium doped lanthanum manganite cathode stability in 0-10% carbon dioxide containing air has been studied in the temperature range of 1023-1123 K with cathodic biases of 0 V and 0.5 V. The current density of the LSM cathode remains stable after an initial decrease.,Effect of CO2 on the stability of strontium doped lanthanum manganite cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.044
2,17913,Surface analyses of the pre-test and post-test LSM cathodes using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) techniques suggest that the formation of SrCO3 at the LSM surface leads to initial performance degradation.,Effect of CO2 on the stability of strontium doped lanthanum manganite cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.044
3,17913,Our observations also indicate that CO2 does not affect the current density after an initial LSM activation in air.,Effect of CO2 on the stability of strontium doped lanthanum manganite cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.044
4,17913,"Overall, the LSM performance degradation in CO2-containing air is less severe than in humidified air.",Effect of CO2 on the stability of strontium doped lanthanum manganite cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.044
