3,4224,"Compared with the pure LSCrM anode, the cell with Ni/CeO2 impregnated LSCrM presents a significant performance improvement when the pure H-2 is fueled to the anode, and shows a good stability during a constant-current discharge testing (398 mA cm(-2)).",Performance and sulfur poisoning of Ni/CeO2 impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anode in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.127
4,4224,"When the fuel is switched to H-2/H2S mixture, the cell with Ni/CeO2 impregnated LSCrM anode still shows a remarkable constant-current discharge (120 mA cm(-2)) performance compared with pure LSCrM anode.",Performance and sulfur poisoning of Ni/CeO2 impregnated La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ anode in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.127
