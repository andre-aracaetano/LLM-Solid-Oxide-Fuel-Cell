1,1402,Barium calcium aluminium boro-silicate glass (BCABS) is used as a sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) at 800 degrees C.,The effect of ZrO2 on the structure of barium calcium aluminium boro-silicate (BCABS) glass,
2,1402,"One major problem is the reaction of this glass with barium oxide and other materials in the composition such as Ba-Y-Co-Fe (BYCF) and Ba-Sr-Co-Fe (BSCF) used in the fuel cell components, leading to the formation and spreading of barium aluminosilicate glass on the surface of the fuel cells.",The effect of ZrO2 on the structure of barium calcium aluminium boro-silicate (BCABS) glass,
3,1402,This investigation found that adding 0.4 mol% ZrO2 to BCABS prevents the formation of barium aluminosilicate glass.,The effect of ZrO2 on the structure of barium calcium aluminium boro-silicate (BCABS) glass,
4,1402,"The resistivity of the mixture is 4 MO, while the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) is 12.40x10(-6)/degrees C. Therefore, BCABS glass with 0.4mol%ZrO2 generated a novel composite for SOFCs.",The effect of ZrO2 on the structure of barium calcium aluminium boro-silicate (BCABS) glass,
