1,19268,A ferritic alloy interconnect was studied through solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack operation at intermediate temperatures.,Chemical stability of ferritic alloy interconnect for SOFCs,10.1149/1.2735919
2,19268,"Certain pretreatment of the alloy surface proved to be effective for controlling initial degradation of the stack performance, presumably by the formation of stable and conductive oxide scale.",Chemical stability of ferritic alloy interconnect for SOFCs,10.1149/1.2735919
3,19268,Evidences were found that glass sealant containing alkali metals affected the oxidation behavior of the alloy surface not in contact with the cathode material.,Chemical stability of ferritic alloy interconnect for SOFCs,10.1149/1.2735919
4,19268,"A thick scale rich in iron tended to be formed at the air side in the vicinity of the glass sealant, while a thinner scale rich in chromium was preferably found in the other.",Chemical stability of ferritic alloy interconnect for SOFCs,10.1149/1.2735919
5,19268,Alkali metal components were found in that thick oxide layer.,Chemical stability of ferritic alloy interconnect for SOFCs,10.1149/1.2735919
6,19268,"At the interface between the alloy and the cathode current collector, a strontium chromate, which might cause chromium poisoning at the cathode/electrolyte interface, was formed, and that was found to be distributed over the current collector away from the interface.",Chemical stability of ferritic alloy interconnect for SOFCs,10.1149/1.2735919
7,19268,A thermodynamic equilibrium calculation using a thermodynamic database revealed that the chromium component is highly reactive with alkali or alkali earth metals and forms stable chromates.,Chemical stability of ferritic alloy interconnect for SOFCs,10.1149/1.2735919
8,19268,"Some of those chromates are very stable and may hinder the formation of stable oxide scale such as Mn-Cr-O spinels or Cr2O3, and may cause the severe oxidation of the alloy.",Chemical stability of ferritic alloy interconnect for SOFCs,10.1149/1.2735919
