3,4201,The samples etched electrochemically showed incomplete etching of the nickel leaving linked nickel islands inside the pores.,Triple-phase boundary and power density enhancement in thin solid oxide fuel cells by controlled etching of the nickel anode,10.1186/1556-276X-9-286
4,4201,Samples which were wet- etched showed clean pores with no nickel island residues.,Triple-phase boundary and power density enhancement in thin solid oxide fuel cells by controlled etching of the nickel anode,10.1186/1556-276X-9-286
5,4201,"Moreover, the sample with linked nickel islands in the anode pores showed higher output power density as compared to the sample with clean pores.",Triple-phase boundary and power density enhancement in thin solid oxide fuel cells by controlled etching of the nickel anode,10.1186/1556-276X-9-286
6,4201,This enhancement is related to the enlargement of the surface of contact between the fuel-anode-electrolyte (the triple-phase boundary).,Triple-phase boundary and power density enhancement in thin solid oxide fuel cells by controlled etching of the nickel anode,10.1186/1556-276X-9-286
