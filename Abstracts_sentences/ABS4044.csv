2,4044,Catalytic grown carbon fiber mixed with (Li0.67Na0.33)(2)CO3 is used as a fuel.,A SnO2-samarium doped ceria additional anode layer in a direct carbon fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.043
3,4044,"At 750 degrees C, the maximum power outputs of 192 and 143 mW cm-(2) are obtained by the cells with SnO2-SDC and NiO-SDC layers, respectively.",A SnO2-samarium doped ceria additional anode layer in a direct carbon fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.043
4,4044,"In the SnO2-SDC layer, the reduction of SnO2 and the oxidation of Sn happen simultaneously during the cell operation, and the Sn/SnO2 redox cycle provides an additional route for fuel conversion.",A SnO2-samarium doped ceria additional anode layer in a direct carbon fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.043
5,4044,"The formation of an insulating dense interlayer between the anode and electrolyte layers, which usually happens in DCFCs with metal anodes, is avoided in the cell with the SnO2-SDC layer, and the stability of the cell is improved consequently.",A SnO2-samarium doped ceria additional anode layer in a direct carbon fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.043
