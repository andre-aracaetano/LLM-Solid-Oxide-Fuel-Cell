5,16151,"The redox couples Fe3+/Fe2+, Co3+/Co2+ and Mo6+/Mo5+ are revealed by XPS, and more oxygen vacancy delta=0.46 is detected by PL and iodometry for sample x=0.75, which is conducive to the redox catalytic activity and ionic conductivity yielding highest 59.48 S.cm(-1) at 800 degrees C. Sample x= 0.5 with the lowest conductance activation energy 0.42 eV also exhibits best electrochemical performance with the highest power density of 42.6 mW.cm(-2) for the configuration of SFCM/LSGM/SFCM in 0.5% H2S-3% H-2 at 800 degrees C.
