1,19576,"We have examined the initial-stage degradation of a Ni-gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) cermet hydrogen electrode prepared on a GDC buffer layer of a stabilized-zirconia electrolyte supported cell during steam electrolysis operation at 800 degrees C. With use of an air reference electrode, the IR-free electrode potential E and ohmic resistance of the hydrogen electrode side (RH2-side) were recorded.",Depth-direction analysis of nickel depletion in a Ni-gadolinia-doped ceria hydrogen electrode after steam electrolysis operation,10.2109/jcersj2.20189

3,19576,"A cm(-2) for 211 h, the RH2-side increased appreciably, by 36 %, while the value of E was nearly unchanged.",Depth-direction analysis of nickel depletion in a Ni-gadolinia-doped ceria hydrogen electrode after steam electrolysis operation,10.2109/jcersj2.20189
4,19576,It was found via a depth-direction analysis with use of focused ion beam-scanning ion microscopy that the remaining percentage of Ni decreased to ca.,Depth-direction analysis of nickel depletion in a Ni-gadolinia-doped ceria hydrogen electrode after steam electrolysis operation,10.2109/jcersj2.20189
5,19576,"60 % in the layer between 1 and 3 mu m from the top of the GDC buffer layer, followed by a further decrease to 42 % at 0.5 mu m. Since this suggests a significant cathodic polarization within the thin reaction zone, an enlargement of the reaction zone, together with a stabilization of Ni contacting with GDC, could be essential to mitigate such a degradation.",Depth-direction analysis of nickel depletion in a Ni-gadolinia-doped ceria hydrogen electrode after steam electrolysis operation,10.2109/jcersj2.20189
