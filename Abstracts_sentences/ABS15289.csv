6,15289,"From the comparison of activation energy of variable range hopping conduction and Mossbauer spectroscopy between PrNi1-xFexO3-delta and LaNi1-xFexO3-delta, it was suggested that hole carrier concentration of PrNi1-xFexO3-delta was lower than that of LaNi1-xFexO3-delta owing to variation of valence of Pr ion.","Crystal structure, thermal expansion and electrical conduction behavior of PrNi1-xFexO3-δ at high temperature",10.2109/jcersj2.16241
