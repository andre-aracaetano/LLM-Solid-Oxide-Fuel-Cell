1,3311,"In order to reduce the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cell, the oxygen nonstoichiometry, lattice constant and electrical conductivity of Ce1-yMyO2-0.5y-x (M=Gd,Sm,Y) at high temperature under reducing atmosphere were precisely studied.","A study of the fundamental properties of Ce1-yMyO2-0.5y-x(M=Gd,Sm,Y)",
2,3311,The results suggest that it was better to use Ce1-yMyO2-0.5y-x at or below 600 degreesC as electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,"A study of the fundamental properties of Ce1-yMyO2-0.5y-x(M=Gd,Sm,Y)",
3,3311,"Under such a low temperature, the performances of electrodes become a serious problem.","A study of the fundamental properties of Ce1-yMyO2-0.5y-x(M=Gd,Sm,Y)",
4,3311,So the constitution of both La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-CGO-Ag cathode and Ni/CGO anode on Ce1-yMyO2-0.5y-x electrolyte were also studied.,"A study of the fundamental properties of Ce1-yMyO2-0.5y-x(M=Gd,Sm,Y)",
5,3311,It was shown possible to realize SOFC working at 600 degreesC based on Ce1-yMyO2-0.5y-x.,"A study of the fundamental properties of Ce1-yMyO2-0.5y-x(M=Gd,Sm,Y)",
