3,8826,The composition of the cathode was systematically controlled by preparing La0.75Sr0.42Co0.15Fe0.68O3-delta (A-site excess LSCF) and La0.60Sr0.39Co0.20Fe0.81O3-delta (stoichiometric LSCF) thin films on Gd-doped ceria (GDC) substrates by pulsed laser deposition.,Sulfur poisoning behavior of La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ thin films with different compositions,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.03.198
4,8826,The LSCF films were then heat-treated at 800 degrees C for 100 h in synthetic air with a trace amount of SO2 (ppb level).,Sulfur poisoning behavior of La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ thin films with different compositions,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.03.198

7,8826,"The A-site excess LSCF films exhibited significant SrSO4 formation with severe porosity, whereas, only an isolated SrSO4 formation was observed in the stoichiometric LSCF films; instead, the partial poisoning by sulfur minimizes excessive porosity while enhancing Co-rich oxide precipitation.",Sulfur poisoning behavior of La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-δ thin films with different compositions,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.03.198
