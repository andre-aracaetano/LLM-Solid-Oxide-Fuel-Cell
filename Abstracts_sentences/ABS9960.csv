1,9960,Perovskite-based materials are typically used as electrodes in solid oxide cells (SOCs) owing to their high catalytic activity in oxygen exchange reactions.,Phase Stability of Perovskite Oxide Electrodes under Operating Condition in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03283
2,9960,The degradation of typical SOCs is a well-known phenomenon that is primarily attributed to the A-site cation redistribution within perovskite-based electrodes at elevated operating temperatures.,Phase Stability of Perovskite Oxide Electrodes under Operating Condition in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03283
3,9960,"To date, investigations of the degradation and stability of perovskite electrodes have predominantly focused on assessing thin-film electrodes under an open-circuit voltage.",Phase Stability of Perovskite Oxide Electrodes under Operating Condition in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03283
4,9960,This study proposes a detailed degradation mechanism of electrodes based on bulk-dense materials under the operating conditions of an actual solid oxide fuel cell.,Phase Stability of Perovskite Oxide Electrodes under Operating Condition in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03283
5,9960,"Our findings revealed that La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta is decomposed into SrO, spinel phase ((CoFe)(3)O-4), and La-rich perovskite in the subsurface region under cathodic bias conditions.",Phase Stability of Perovskite Oxide Electrodes under Operating Condition in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03283
6,9960,"Additionally, the results of this study indicate that the phase decomposition associated with elements in the B-site must be considered to improve the enhancement of the stability and oxygen reduction reaction activity.",Phase Stability of Perovskite Oxide Electrodes under Operating Condition in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03283
