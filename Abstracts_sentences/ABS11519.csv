2,11519,The properties of this series of samples are affected by the ytterbium element.,Investigation of the crystal structure and ionic conductivity in the ternary system (Yb2O3)x-(Sc2O3)(0.11-x)-(ZrO2)0.89 (x=0-0.11),10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.09.089
3,11519,"A stabilized cubic phase is obtained at room temperature by introducing ytterbium and the unit cell parameters show a linear increasing relationship with content of Yb2O3, which also contributes to abatement of the conductivity from 0.099 S/cm to 0.020 S/cm at 800 degrees",Investigation of the crystal structure and ionic conductivity in the ternary system (Yb2O3)x-(Sc2O3)(0.11-x)-(ZrO2)0.89 (x=0-0.11),10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.09.089
4,11519,"C. However, the conductivity tends to remain a constant at lower temperatures ranging from 500 degrees C to 650 degrees C as the addition of Yb2O3 is reduced to below 3 mol%, achieving high up to 0.015 S/cm at 650 degrees C for a 3Yb8ScSZ body, indicating a potential to be utilized as an electrolyte material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.",Investigation of the crystal structure and ionic conductivity in the ternary system (Yb2O3)x-(Sc2O3)(0.11-x)-(ZrO2)0.89 (x=0-0.11),10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.09.089
