1,1416,"Although coal may be viewed as a dirty fuel due to its high greenhouse emissions when combusted, a strong case can be made for coal to be a major world source of clean H-2 energy.",Hydrogen from coal: Production and utilisation technologies,10.1016/j.coal.2005.05.004
2,1416,"Apart from the fact that resources of coal will outlast oil and natural gas by centuries, there is a shift towards developing environmentally benign coal technologies, which can lead to high energy conversion efficiencies and low air pollution emissions as compared to conventional coal fired power generation plant.",Hydrogen from coal: Production and utilisation technologies,10.1016/j.coal.2005.05.004
3,1416,There are currently several world research and industrial development projects in the areas of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCC) and Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell (IGFC) systems.,Hydrogen from coal: Production and utilisation technologies,10.1016/j.coal.2005.05.004
4,1416,"In such systems, there is a need to integrate complex unit operations including gasifiers, gas separation and cleaning units, water gas shift reactors, turbines, heat exchangers, steam generators and fuel cells.",Hydrogen from coal: Production and utilisation technologies,10.1016/j.coal.2005.05.004
5,1416,"IGFC systems tested in the USA, Europe and Japan employing gasifiers (Texaco, Lurgi and Eagle) and fuel cells have resulted in energy conversions at efficiency of 47.5% (HHV) which is much higher than the 30-35% efficiency of conventional coal fired power generation.",Hydrogen from coal: Production and utilisation technologies,10.1016/j.coal.2005.05.004
6,1416,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) are the front runners in energy production from coal gases.,Hydrogen from coal: Production and utilisation technologies,10.1016/j.coal.2005.05.004
7,1416,These fuel cells can operate at high temperatures and are robust to gas poisoning impurities.,Hydrogen from coal: Production and utilisation technologies,10.1016/j.coal.2005.05.004
8,1416,IGCC and IGFC technologies are expensive and currently economically uncompetitive as compared to established and mature power generation technology.,Hydrogen from coal: Production and utilisation technologies,10.1016/j.coal.2005.05.004
9,1416,"However, further efficiency and technology improvements coupled with world pressures on limitation of greenhouse gases and other gaseous pollutants could make IGCC/IGFC technically and economically viable for hydrogen production and utilisation in clean and environmentally benign energy systems.",Hydrogen from coal: Production and utilisation technologies,10.1016/j.coal.2005.05.004
