1,7991,"In this work, the anti-poisoning performance of flat-tube solid oxide fuel cells (FT-SOFCs) is investigated in high concentrations of H2S. The degradation rate of the cell is 0.52%/ h, 0.27%/ h and 0.305%/ h at 750 degrees C, when the concentration of H2S is 161 ppm, 182 similar to 222 ppm and 226 ppm, respectively, and the performance can be restored by humidification of H2.",Anti-poisoning performance of flat-tube solid oxide fuel cell in high concentration H2S environment,10.1016/j.egyr.2023.05.026

3,7991,"Through energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and Raman spectrum analysis, it is found that the cell performance degradation under high concentration of H2S is mainly caused by the loss of metallic nickel caused by the migration and decomposition of nickel-sulfur compounds, which will reduce the active sites of H2 participating in the anode reaction.",Anti-poisoning performance of flat-tube solid oxide fuel cell in high concentration H2S environment,10.1016/j.egyr.2023.05.026
