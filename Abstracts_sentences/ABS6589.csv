2,6589,"Sintering behaviors, microstructure and thermal properties of the gradient anodes were investigated, and compared with those of two NiO/SDC anodes with single NiO composition (75 and 55% NiO).",Gradient Ni/SDC anodes for solid oxide fuel cells by tape casting,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.423-425.449
3,6589,It was shown that the gradient NiO/SDC anode has fine pore and grain structure and steady thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) than each anode with homogeneous Ni composition distribution.,Gradient Ni/SDC anodes for solid oxide fuel cells by tape casting,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.423-425.449
4,6589,"Owing to the better microstructure and properties, SOFCs based on the gradient anode with a SDC electrolyte film of about 100 mum in thickness and a LSCF cathode showed a maximum power density of 80 MW/cm(2) at 600degreesC.",Gradient Ni/SDC anodes for solid oxide fuel cells by tape casting,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.423-425.449
