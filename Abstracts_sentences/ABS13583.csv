1,13583,"The chemical compatibility of the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) with the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte or Gd-doped ceria electrolyte (GDC), as well as that of the GDC with the YSZ electrolyte were examined.",Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ as a cathode for IT SOFCs with a GDC interlayer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.092
2,13583,It was found that BSCF had a good compatibility with the GDC electrolyte but a poor chemical compatibility with the YSZ electrolyte.,Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ as a cathode for IT SOFCs with a GDC interlayer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.092
3,13583,The BSCF cathode was adopted for anode-supported YSZ electrolyte cells with and without the application of a 1 mu m thick GDC buffering layer between the cathode and the YSZ electrolyte.,Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ as a cathode for IT SOFCs with a GDC interlayer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.092
4,13583,The interfacial reactions of the BSCF with the YSZ electrolyte surface and the GDC coated YSZ surfaces were investigated.,Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ as a cathode for IT SOFCs with a GDC interlayer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.092
5,13583,The single cells were evaluated by using I-V curve measurements and AC impedance spectroscopy.,Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ as a cathode for IT SOFCs with a GDC interlayer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.092
6,13583,The results depicted a great improvement in cell performance and a significant decrease in polarization resistance after adding the GDC buffer layer.,Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ as a cathode for IT SOFCs with a GDC interlayer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.092
7,13583,"The optimum firing temperature of the GDC film onto the YSZ film was around 1250 degrees C, which led to the maximum power density of 1.56 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C using air as oxidant and hydrogen as fuel.",Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ as a cathode for IT SOFCs with a GDC interlayer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.092
