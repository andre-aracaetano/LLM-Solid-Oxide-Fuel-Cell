2,10139,It was used to test SOLIDpower recently developed-Large Stack Module (LSM) in electrolysis mode.,Performance evaluation of a 4-stack solid oxide module in electrolysis mode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.056
3,10139,"Results show high thermal performance of the LSM, with homogeneous temperature distribution and losses in the kilowatt range above 700 degrees C. A performance map was recorded between 712 and 744 degrees C over 22.4-to-29.6 kg h-1 steam flowrates using a fast control strategy to avoid endothermic operation.",Performance evaluation of a 4-stack solid oxide module in electrolysis mode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.056
4,10139,A peak power of 74 kWDC was converted into more than 50 kg day-1 of H2 (35.5 kWhDC kgH2-1).,Performance evaluation of a 4-stack solid oxide module in electrolysis mode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.056
5,10139,"In addition, fuel utilization of more than 90% and steam conversion above 80% were demonstrated at the module level.",Performance evaluation of a 4-stack solid oxide module in electrolysis mode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.056
6,10139,"In the end, the modular design of the LSM seems well suited for system scale up, paving the way for mutualization of auxiliaries and CAPEX reduction.",Performance evaluation of a 4-stack solid oxide module in electrolysis mode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.056
