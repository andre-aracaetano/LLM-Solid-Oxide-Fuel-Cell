1,16644,"The pyrochlore-type Ln(2)Zr(2)O(7) (Ln = La, Nd, Eu) systems were refined by Rietveld analyses of XRD data combined with the MEM-based pattern fitting at RT, 873, 1073, and 1273 K. All the samples kept a single cubic phase of the pyrochlore-type structure in the temperature range up to 1273 K.","Relationship Between Oxide-Ion Conductivity and Ordering of Oxygen Vacancy in the Ln2Zr2O7 (Ln = La, Nd, Eu) System Using High Temperature XRD",10.1115/1.4003785
2,16644,The oxide-ion conductivities of the present systems were discussed on a basis of ordering of oxygen vacancy in the pyrochlore-type structure.,"Relationship Between Oxide-Ion Conductivity and Ordering of Oxygen Vacancy in the Ln2Zr2O7 (Ln = La, Nd, Eu) System Using High Temperature XRD",10.1115/1.4003785
3,16644,"The-oxide-ion conduction of Eu2Zr2O7 was ascribed to diffusion of oxygen along the < 100 > direction, while the hole conduction of La2Zr2O7 occurred along the < 110 > direction, according to the charge density map estimated by the MEM analysis.","Relationship Between Oxide-Ion Conductivity and Ordering of Oxygen Vacancy in the Ln2Zr2O7 (Ln = La, Nd, Eu) System Using High Temperature XRD",10.1115/1.4003785
