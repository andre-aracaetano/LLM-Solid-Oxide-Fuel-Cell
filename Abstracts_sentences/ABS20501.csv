1,20501,"Reduction and reoxidation kinetics of Ni-based solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes were investigated over a range of temperatures between 600 and 800 degrees C. Dense (no open porosity) two-phase NiO+YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) samples, with and without small amounts of oxide additives (CaO, MgO, TiO2), were fabricated and then reduced in a hydrogen-containing environment.",Reduction and reoxidation kinetics of nickel-based SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2167949
2,20501,The time dependence of the reduced layer thickness at various temperatures was measured.,Reduction and reoxidation kinetics of nickel-based SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2167949
3,20501,Reoxidation studies were conducted on fully reduced anodes that were subsequently reoxidized in air over a temperature range between 650 and 800 degrees C. A simple theoretical model was developed to describe the kinetics of reduction and reoxidation based on two series kinetic steps: diffusion and interface reaction.,Reduction and reoxidation kinetics of nickel-based SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2167949
4,20501,"It was observed that the reduction kinetics was linear (interface-controlled), while the reoxidation kinetics was nearly parabolic (diffusion-controlled).",Reduction and reoxidation kinetics of nickel-based SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2167949
5,20501,"Also, the kinetics of reduction was thermally activated with an activation energy of similar to 95 kJ/mol.",Reduction and reoxidation kinetics of nickel-based SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2167949
6,20501,"By contrast, over the temperature range investigated, the kinetics of reoxidation was essentially independent of temperature.",Reduction and reoxidation kinetics of nickel-based SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2167949
7,20501,"The interface control of the reduction process implies that gas-phase diffusion through porous Ni+YSZ, formed upon reduction of NiO to Ni, is considerably faster than the kinetics of the actual reduction reaction occurring at the interface separating the pristine and the reduced regions.",Reduction and reoxidation kinetics of nickel-based SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2167949
8,20501,"By contrast, diffusion control of the reoxidation process was attributed to slow, gaseous diffusion on account of the very small amount of porosity that remains when Ni reoxidizes to NiO, developed presumably due to a slight shape change of Ni particles that may occur at high temperatures.",Reduction and reoxidation kinetics of nickel-based SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2167949
9,20501,"Doping the anodes with stable oxides, such as CaO and MgO, significantly reduced both the reduction and reoxidation kinetics of Ni-based anodes.",Reduction and reoxidation kinetics of nickel-based SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2167949
