1,6110,Progress in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cell and stack development depends strongly on improvements stimulated by post-operational characterizations.,Post-operational characterization of solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.065
2,6110,"Although highly motivated by the analysis of unintended interruptions or stack failures, detailed characterization of SOFC stacks after operation provides information on the behaviour of advanced materials and optimized microstructures as well as interactions during start-up, operation, and shut-down, hence, also with respect to manufacturing quality control and stack structural integrity and its relationship to manufacturing, design, dimensions and tolerances.",Post-operational characterization of solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.065
3,6110,"This work summarized the experience of more than 300 post-test analyses that have been carried out in the past 15 years, their careful dissection, photography, and subsequent detailed characterization that included numerous detailed examinations of all stack components.",Post-operational characterization of solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.065
4,6110,"Particular analyses' concerning the different stack components are highlighted, exemplifying useful analytical methods.",Post-operational characterization of solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.065
