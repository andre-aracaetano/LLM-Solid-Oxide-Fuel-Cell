2,830,The electrochemical performance of the gel-cast (GC) Ni-SDC cermet as anode was investigated contrast with that fabricated from traditional mechanical mixing (MM) technique using fuel cells with about 35 mu m-thick SDC electrolyte and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-SDC cathode.,Electrochemical performance of gel-cast NiO-SDC composite anodes in low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.07.046
3,830,"Maximum power density of the cell with GC anode achieved 491 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, over 100 mW cm(-2) larger than that with MM anode, inferring high catalytic activity of the GC anode.",Electrochemical performance of gel-cast NiO-SDC composite anodes in low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.07.046
4,830,Impedance measurements on the fuel cell at open circuit showed that the anodic interfacial polarization resistance of the GC anode was 0.1 Omega cm(2) lower than that of the MM anode.,Electrochemical performance of gel-cast NiO-SDC composite anodes in low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.07.046
