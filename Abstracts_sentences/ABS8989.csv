1,8989,"The ability to (re)establish basic community infrastructure and governmental functions, such as medical and communication systems, after the occurrence of a natural disaster rests on a continuous supply of electricity.",Optimizing microgrid deployment for community resilience,10.1007/s11081-023-09844-6
2,8989,"Traditional energy-generation systems consisting of power plants, transmission lines, and distribution feeders are becoming more vulnerable, given the increasing magnitude and frequency of climate-related natural disasters.",Optimizing microgrid deployment for community resilience,10.1007/s11081-023-09844-6
3,8989,"We investigate the role that fuel cells, along with other distributed energy resources, play in post-disaster recovery efforts.",Optimizing microgrid deployment for community resilience,10.1007/s11081-023-09844-6
4,8989,"We present a mixed-integer, non-linear optimization model that takes load and power-technology data as inputs and determines a cost-minimizing design and dispatch strategy while considering operational constraints.",Optimizing microgrid deployment for community resilience,10.1007/s11081-023-09844-6
5,8989,"The model fails to achieve gaps of less than 15%, on average, after two hours for realistic instances encompassing five technologies and a year-long time horizon at hourly fidelity.",Optimizing microgrid deployment for community resilience,10.1007/s11081-023-09844-6
6,8989,"Therefore, we devise a multi-phase methodology to expedite solutions, resulting in run times to obtain the best solution in fewer than two minutes; after two hours, we provide proof of near-optimality, i.e., gaps averaging 5%.",Optimizing microgrid deployment for community resilience,10.1007/s11081-023-09844-6
7,8989,"Solutions obtained from this methodology yield, on average, an 8% decrease in objective function value and utilize fuel cells three times more often than solutions obtained with a straight-forward implementation employing a commercial solver.",Optimizing microgrid deployment for community resilience,10.1007/s11081-023-09844-6
