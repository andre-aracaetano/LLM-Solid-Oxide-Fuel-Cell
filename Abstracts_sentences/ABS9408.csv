1,9408,"Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrode microstructures composed of catalyst, electrolyte and pore phases with various microstructural features are synthetically generated and the effects of the mean particle size and volume fraction of each phase on three/triple phase boundaries (TPBs) are computed.",Synthetical designing of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes: Effect of particle size and volume fraction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.071
2,9408,"For mono-sized particles with an equal volume fraction, the active and total TPB density are found to decrease with increasing the mean particle size due to decreased surface area.",Synthetical designing of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes: Effect of particle size and volume fraction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.071
3,9408,"However, both are found to be inversely related to the square of the mean particle size.",Synthetical designing of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes: Effect of particle size and volume fraction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.071
4,9408,"Active TPB densities of 37.62 mu m mu m(-3), 9.27 mu m mu m(-3) and 4.11 mu m mu m(-3) are obtained from the electrode microstructures with mono-sized particles of 0.25 0.50 mu m and 0.75 mu m mean particle size, respectively.",Synthetical designing of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes: Effect of particle size and volume fraction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.071
5,9408,"Moreover, similar to 94% of the total TPB density is determined to be active regardless of the mean particle size.",Synthetical designing of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes: Effect of particle size and volume fraction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.071
6,9408,TPBs for the polydisperse particles with the same volume fraction also show a decreasing trend with the mean particle size in general.,Synthetical designing of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes: Effect of particle size and volume fraction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.071
7,9408,"However, no significant change is observed in inactive TPB formations even for the largest particle size investigated, revealing almost fully percolated phases can be achieved when the volume fraction of each phase is equal (similar to 33.3%).",Synthetical designing of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes: Effect of particle size and volume fraction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.071
8,9408,"On the other, when the volume fractions are also varied, the active TPB is shown to be strongly depended on the volume fraction of the phase having the highest mean particle size.",Synthetical designing of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes: Effect of particle size and volume fraction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.071
9,9408,"In this regard, among the related cases studied, the lowest active TPB density is computed as 0.25 mu m whereas the highest one is measured as 26.64 mu m.
