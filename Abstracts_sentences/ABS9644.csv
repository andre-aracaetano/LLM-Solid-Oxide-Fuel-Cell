2,9644,This study presents a modeling framework that combines thermo-electro-chemo models (including the methanol conversion process and the electrochemical reactions of the carbon monoxide as well as the hydrogen) and a contact thermo-mechanical model that considers the effective mechanical properties of composite electrode material.,Thermo-Electro-Chemo-Mechanical Coupled Modeling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with LSCF-GDC Composite Cathode,10.3390/ijms24044137
3,9644,"Detailed parametric studies are performed focusing on the inlet fuel species (hydrogen, methanol syngas) and flow arrangements (co-flow, counter-flow) under typical operating conditions (operating voltage 0.7 V), and performance indicators of the cell, such as the high-temperature zone, current density, and maximum thermal stress were discussed for parameter optimization.",Thermo-Electro-Chemo-Mechanical Coupled Modeling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with LSCF-GDC Composite Cathode,10.3390/ijms24044137
4,9644,"The simulated results show that the high temperature zone of the hydrogen-fueled SOFC is located at the central part of units 5, 6, and 7, and the maximum value is about 40 K higher than that of methanol syngas-fueled SOFC.",Thermo-Electro-Chemo-Mechanical Coupled Modeling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with LSCF-GDC Composite Cathode,10.3390/ijms24044137
