5,1152,"In this paper, we discussed the conversion of biomass into electricity in two steps: the first step (biomass-to-biogas) is based on an evaluation of biogas potential generated by solid waste of landfill the Batna city (Algeria) by the kinetic model (U.S.EPA, 1993).",Theoretical estimation of the production of biogas from the landfill of Batna city and its electrical conversion by a SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.03.062
6,1152,"In the second step (biogas-to-electricity), the paper considers the technology of a stack of standard solid oxide fuel cells (Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSM) SOFC; this allowed us to determine the best temperature, hydrogen concentration and electrolyte thickness for maximum power density in the fuel cell SOFC.",Theoretical estimation of the production of biogas from the landfill of Batna city and its electrical conversion by a SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.03.062
