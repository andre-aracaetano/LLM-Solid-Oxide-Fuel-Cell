1,16889,"We investigated (1) the change with heating time in the microstructure of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathode, and the amount of reaction product produced at the cathode/electrolyte interface during heat treatment at 1000 degrees C, and (2) the increase in interfacial resistance for the L(0.8)Sr(0.2)MnO(3) cathode/Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte system during heating.",Deterioration of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode at high temperature,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.629
2,16889,The interfacial resistance increased in the same way during heating for samples with three different grain-size distributions.,Deterioration of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode at high temperature,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.629
3,16889,"In contrast, the specific surface area and sinterability of the cathodes changed with heating rime in different ways depending on the grain-size distribution of the starting material.",Deterioration of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode at high temperature,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.629
4,16889,The amount of reaction product La2Zr2O7 on the cathode/electrolyte interface increased with heating time.,Deterioration of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode at high temperature,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.629
5,16889,These results suggest that the increase in the interfacial resistance is mainly caused by the accumulation of the reaction product on the interface rather than by the other structural factors.,Deterioration of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode at high temperature,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.629
