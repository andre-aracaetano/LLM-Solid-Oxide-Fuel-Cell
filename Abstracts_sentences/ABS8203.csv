1,8203,Proton-conductive SrZrO3 films were successfully deposited on Pt/SiOx/Si and porous stainless-steel substrates by liquid delivery metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (LD-MOCVD).,Deposition of SrZrO3 Thin Films Using Liquid Delivery Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition,10.1143/JJAP.48.070205
2,8203,The as-deposited films deposited on the Pt/SiOx/Si substrate at 600 degrees C showed good crystallinity and post-annealing at temperatures below 800 degrees C resulted in improved crystallinity.,Deposition of SrZrO3 Thin Films Using Liquid Delivery Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition,10.1143/JJAP.48.070205
3,8203,A 200-nm-thick film deposited on the porous stainless-steel substrate was flat and solid and did not show any gas leakage.,Deposition of SrZrO3 Thin Films Using Liquid Delivery Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition,10.1143/JJAP.48.070205
4,8203,We consider this deposition technique to be applicable for the fabrication of a new solid oxide fuel cell structure with intermediate-temperature operation.,Deposition of SrZrO3 Thin Films Using Liquid Delivery Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition,10.1143/JJAP.48.070205
