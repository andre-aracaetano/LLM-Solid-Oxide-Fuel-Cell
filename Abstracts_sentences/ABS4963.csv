2,4963,"The variation of transport properties and thus, the area specific resistances (ASR) are explained by a detailed investigation of the defect chemistry.","Defect Chemistry, Electrical Properties, and Evaluation of New Oxides Sr2CoNb1-xTixO6-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) as Cathode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/cssc.201700648
3,4963,"Increasing the titanium content from x = 0-1 produces both oxidation of Co3+ to Co4+ (from 0 up to 40%) and oxygen vacancies (from 6.0 to 5.7 oxygen atom/formula unit), although each charge compensation mechanism predominates in different compositional ranges.","Defect Chemistry, Electrical Properties, and Evaluation of New Oxides Sr2CoNb1-xTixO6-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) as Cathode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/cssc.201700648
4,4963,Neutron diffraction reveals that samples with high Ti-contents lose a significant amount of oxygen upon heating above 600 K. Oxygen is partially recovered upon cooling as the oxygen release and uptake show noticeably different kinetics.,"Defect Chemistry, Electrical Properties, and Evaluation of New Oxides Sr2CoNb1-xTixO6-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) as Cathode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/cssc.201700648
