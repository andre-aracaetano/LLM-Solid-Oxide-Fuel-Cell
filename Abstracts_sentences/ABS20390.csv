6,20390,"The sprayed coatings had hybrid microstructures, including unmelted particles, molten droplets, and vapor clusters.",Very low-pressure plasma-sprayed dense yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings using an axial bi-cathode plasma torch,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2020.126281
7,20390,"With increasing spraying distance, the melting state of YSZ coating got better, while the microstructure became looser, leading to the porosity increased from 2.7% to 7.4%.",Very low-pressure plasma-sprayed dense yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings using an axial bi-cathode plasma torch,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2020.126281
8,20390,"The best mechanical properties were found in the densest coating, whose microhardness and Young's modulus was 11.7 +/- 0.6 GPa, 167.8 +/- 4.0 GPa, respectively, indicating that the mechanical performance of the YSZ coating was more dependent on the density, rather than the melting state.",Very low-pressure plasma-sprayed dense yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings using an axial bi-cathode plasma torch,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2020.126281
