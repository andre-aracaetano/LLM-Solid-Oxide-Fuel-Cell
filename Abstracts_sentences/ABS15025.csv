2,15025,The anode/YSZ film interface was investigated by means of SEM-EDX.,Ni-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode-supported YSZ electrolyte film and its application in solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.043
3,15025,The SEM results showed that the YSZ film was almost fully dense and crack-free.,Ni-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode-supported YSZ electrolyte film and its application in solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.043
4,15025,The analyses of EDX revealed that Ce and Sm cations preferential migrated from the NiO-SDC anode into the YSZ film for less than 3 mu m while no significant diffusion occurred for Y and Zr.,Ni-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode-supported YSZ electrolyte film and its application in solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.043
5,15025,A cell of Ni-SDC/YSZ(14 mu m)/LSM-YSZ was tested from 700 to 850 degrees C using humidified hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.,Ni-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode-supported YSZ electrolyte film and its application in solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.043
6,15025,"The cell provided maximum power densities of 304, 625, 980 and 1270 mW/cm(2) at 700, 750, 800 and 850 degrees C, respectively.",Ni-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode-supported YSZ electrolyte film and its application in solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.043
7,15025,Polarization analysis based on the impedance spectra showed that the anode polarization only accounted for 8% of the total electrode polarization while this ratio for cathode was 92%.,Ni-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode-supported YSZ electrolyte film and its application in solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.043
8,15025,A negligible anode polarization suggested that the diffusion of Cc and Sm and its negative effect on the performance of the cell were suppressed to an acceptable level in this study.,Ni-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode-supported YSZ electrolyte film and its application in solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.043
