1,20316,Replacement of divalent Sr2+ ions by monovalent K+ ions in La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.(85) (LSGM) decreases the electrical conductivity of LSGM and increases the activation energy to 1.42 eV. Substitution of La by substantial amounts of up to 50 atom % of Pr in LSGM yields new mixed oxide ion and electronic conductors.,Synthesis and electrical properties of K- and Pr-substituted LaGaO3 and LaInO3 perovskites,10.1149/1.1414286

3,20316,"Among the investigated oxides, La0.4Pr0.4Sr0.2In0.8Mg0.2O2.8 exhibits the lowest activation energy of 0.44 eV and the highest electrical conductivity of 3.17 x 10(-5) S/cm at 200 degreesC. Oxygen partial pressure dependence of the electrical conductivity reveals that LSIM and Pr-substituted LSIM perovskites are mixed oxide ion and p-type electronic conductors at high oxygen partial pressures.",Synthesis and electrical properties of K- and Pr-substituted LaGaO3 and LaInO3 perovskites,10.1149/1.1414286

5,20316,"Open-circuit voltage measurements employing La0.45Pr0.45Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 as separator in the galvanic cell H(2)parallel to air show that the average transference number (t(O)(2-)) for oxide ion conduction is 0.78-0.90 in the temperature range 450-650C. Powder X-ray diffraction data reveal that LSIM and Pr-substituted LSIM perovskites are not stable at low oxygen partial pressures of about 10(-22) atm, while Pr-substituted LSGM retains the cubic perovskite structure.",Synthesis and electrical properties of K- and Pr-substituted LaGaO3 and LaInO3 perovskites,10.1149/1.1414286
