2,8032,The platform is capable of dealing with fully coupled multiphysical processes and simulating the behaviors of three flow configurations.,Analysis of processes in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.007
3,8032,Border effects were revealed and it is important to understand the scale-up topic in SOFC development.,Analysis of processes in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.007
4,8032,The determining steps in cell performance are proposed and respective schemes are provided to enhance cell performance according to the determining steps.,Analysis of processes in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.007
5,8032,The characteristics of the three flow configurations were analyzed and compared.,Analysis of processes in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.007
6,8032,The cross-flow configuration was given negative recommendations for its unsatisfactory performance in uniformly distributing cell temperature and current density.,Analysis of processes in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.007
7,8032,The co-flow configuration could intrinsically obtain a uniform current density distribution with the disadvantage of steadily increasing cell temperature from fuel inlet to outlet.,Analysis of processes in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.007
8,8032,The counter-flow configuration had localized enhancement effects near the fuel inlet and cell performance substantially benefited from these effects.,Analysis of processes in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.007
9,8032,But the operating conditions of the counter-flow configuration should be deliberately adjusted to avoid an excessively high cell temperature.,Analysis of processes in planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.02.007
