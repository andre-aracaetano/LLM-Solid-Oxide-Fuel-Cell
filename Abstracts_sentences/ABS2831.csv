1,2831,"A simple fracture testing method, combined with acoustic-emission (AE) monitoring was developed in order to investigate the mechanical performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) under simulated environment.",Mechanical damage evaluation of solid oxide fuel cells under simulated operating conditions,10.2109/jcersj.113.562
2,2831,The fracture testing method was applied to ceria electrolyte-supported single cells.,Mechanical damage evaluation of solid oxide fuel cells under simulated operating conditions,10.2109/jcersj.113.562
3,2831,"The fracture damage process was shown to involve vertical cracking and delamination in the cathode, and vertical cracking in the electrolyte, and the fracture damages were most likely due to chemical expansion induced stresses.",Mechanical damage evaluation of solid oxide fuel cells under simulated operating conditions,10.2109/jcersj.113.562
4,2831,It was demonstrated that the AE method may enable one to detect the above-mentioned fracture process and to determine the onset condition for fracture damage in the single cell.,Mechanical damage evaluation of solid oxide fuel cells under simulated operating conditions,10.2109/jcersj.113.562
