1,16034,Electrolyte/anode (YSZ/NiO-YSZ) dual-layer hollow fibres were developed by a co-spinning process based on phase inversion technique for fabrication of micro tubular solid oxide fuel cells (MT-SOFCs).,Electrolyte Thickness Control and Its Effect on YSZ/Ni-YSZ Dual-layer Hollow Fibres,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12755
2,16034,"After being calcined at 1450 degrees C in ambient air and reduced at 700 degrees C in H-2 for 4 h, the precursors were transformed into dual layer YSZ/Ni-YSZ hollow fibers.",Electrolyte Thickness Control and Its Effect on YSZ/Ni-YSZ Dual-layer Hollow Fibres,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12755
3,16034,Full MT-SOFCs were fabricated by dip-coating with La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta(LSM) ink on the outer surface of YSZ/NiO-YSZ dual layer hollow fibers and sintering at 1200 degrees C.,Electrolyte Thickness Control and Its Effect on YSZ/Ni-YSZ Dual-layer Hollow Fibres,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12755
4,16034,"The results show that the YSZ membranes of the dual-layer hollow fibers possess thicknesses of 6, 13, 18 and 28 mu m when the spinning rates of electrolyte dopes are 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 mL/min and the anode dope keeps on a constant rate of 10 mL/min.",Electrolyte Thickness Control and Its Effect on YSZ/Ni-YSZ Dual-layer Hollow Fibres,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12755
5,16034,The bending strength and the gas-tightness of the dual-layer hollow fibers increase with the increase of electrolyte thickness.,Electrolyte Thickness Control and Its Effect on YSZ/Ni-YSZ Dual-layer Hollow Fibres,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12755
6,16034,"However, the electrical conductivity and porosity of the dual-layer hollow fibers are less influenced by YSZ thickness.",Electrolyte Thickness Control and Its Effect on YSZ/Ni-YSZ Dual-layer Hollow Fibres,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12755
7,16034,"The maximum power density of single MT-SOFC with an electrolyte layer of 28 mu m is 75 mW/cm(2), while the output of an MT-SOFC with a 6 mu m-thick YSZ membrane is up to 329 mW/cm(2), both operated at 800 degrees C using 20 mL/min H-2 as fuel and 30 mL/min air as oxidant.",Electrolyte Thickness Control and Its Effect on YSZ/Ni-YSZ Dual-layer Hollow Fibres,10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12755
