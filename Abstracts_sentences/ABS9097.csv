3,9097,"When N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is chosen as the solvent, a dual layered anode substrates with hierarchically oriented pores is achieved, while a sponge-like homogeneous anode substrate is obtained using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent, indicating that solvent is a key factor to affect the anode substrate microstructure.",Solvent effects on the morphology and performance of the anode substrates for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.07.110

5,9097,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with different microstructured anode substrates are prepared, and the maximum power density is significantly enhanced from 320.3 to 719.2 mWcm(-2) by varying the anode substrate from homogeneous sponge-like microstructure to dual-layered microstructure, revealing that the finger-like macro-voids layer can facilitate H-2-H2O mass diffusion, while the thin sponge-like pores layer can serve as anode functional layer and provide sufficient active reaction sites for H-2 oxidation.",Solvent effects on the morphology and performance of the anode substrates for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.07.110
