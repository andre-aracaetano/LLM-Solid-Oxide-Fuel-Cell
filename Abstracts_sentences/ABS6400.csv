2,6400,These ceramic films are prepared by a water-based tape-casting method and sintered in situ at the operation temperature of intermediate temperature (IT)-SOFCs.,Flexible Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 combined with Co3O4 and Al2O3 conductive ceramic film as a cathode current collecting layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229566
3,6400,The effects of addition amounts of Co3O4 and Al2O3 on the electrical conductivity of the CCCL and area specific resistance (ASR) of (La0.75Sr0.25)(0.95)MnO3-delta (LSM) cathode/the CCCL/SUS430 interconnect sandwich are studied.,Flexible Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 combined with Co3O4 and Al2O3 conductive ceramic film as a cathode current collecting layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229566
4,6400,The results indicate that adding 3 wt.% of Co3O4 as sintering aids in Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 precursor powder can promote its sintering and thus reduce its contact resistance with neighboring components.,Flexible Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 combined with Co3O4 and Al2O3 conductive ceramic film as a cathode current collecting layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229566
5,6400,"Further combining Al2O3 as the binder with Cu1.5Mn1.5O4-3 wt.% Co3O4, though electrical conductivity of obtained materials decreases with the amount of Al2O3 addition increasing, the minimum ASR of 24.4 m Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C and a stable ASR of around 27 m Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C are achieved on LSM cathode/Cu1.5Mn1.5O4-3 wt.% Co3O4-10 wt.% Al2O3 CCCL/SUS430 interconnect sandwich.",Flexible Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 combined with Co3O4 and Al2O3 conductive ceramic film as a cathode current collecting layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229566
6,6400,The developed flexible CCCL shows pronounced low contact resistance and high stability.,Flexible Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 combined with Co3O4 and Al2O3 conductive ceramic film as a cathode current collecting layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229566
