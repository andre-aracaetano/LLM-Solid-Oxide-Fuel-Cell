1,2126,The suitability of nickel electroless plating for anode deposition on electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on yttrium-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) has been studied.,Morphological control of electroless plated Ni anodes: Influence on fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.022
2,2126,"A deposition technique was developed and characterisation is presented with respect to microstructure, strength and performance of the resultant anode.",Morphological control of electroless plated Ni anodes: Influence on fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.022
3,2126,The study was carried out on YSZ disk-shaped pellets sintered at different temperatures ranging from 1000 degrees C to 1400 degrees C with analysis of the influence of sintering temperature on the Ni-YSZ interface microstructure and fuel cell performance.,Morphological control of electroless plated Ni anodes: Influence on fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.022
4,2126,"Lower pre-sintering temperature resulted in higher Ni penetration into the YSZ matrix, forming a graded anode and improving the anode-electrolyte interfacial strength.",Morphological control of electroless plated Ni anodes: Influence on fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.022
5,2126,The optimised electrode showed good mechanical stability under redox cycling which resulted in an enhancement of electrode porosity.,Morphological control of electroless plated Ni anodes: Influence on fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.022
6,2126,Complete fuel cells were tested at 800 degrees C with 5% H-2 and air after a porous La0.2Sr0.8Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LSCF) cathode layer had been deposited by slurry coating.,Morphological control of electroless plated Ni anodes: Influence on fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.022
7,2126,The higher Ni penetration on YSZ substrates pre-sintered at low temperature resulted in an improvement of one order of magnitude of power output compared to a cell in which a metal Ni anode was coated over a fully dense (i.e. high pre-sintering temperature) electrolyte surface.,Morphological control of electroless plated Ni anodes: Influence on fuel cell performance,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.06.022
