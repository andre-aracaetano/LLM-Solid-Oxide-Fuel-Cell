2,10659,The objective is to determine a control input that minimizes the expected value of the integral of error between the set-point and the states.,Stochastic state-feedback control using homotopy optimization and particle filtering,10.1007/s40435-021-00853-w

4,10659,The optimal control design is then reformulated as a parameter estimation problem using control vector parameterization where the inputs are considered as a nonlinear function of the error between the state estimates and the set-point.,Stochastic state-feedback control using homotopy optimization and particle filtering,10.1007/s40435-021-00853-w

6,10659,The control performance resulting from proposed homotopy based optimization method is compared with that of direct optimization and an existing nonlinear control method on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) stack model.,Stochastic state-feedback control using homotopy optimization and particle filtering,10.1007/s40435-021-00853-w
