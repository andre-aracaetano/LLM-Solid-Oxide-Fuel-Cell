2,4769,"Such a work is motivated by the increasing interest paid to SOFC technology by industries and governments due to its highly appealing potentialities in terms of energy savings, fuel flexibility, cogeneration, low-pollution and low-noise operation.",Model-based development of low-level control strategies for transient operation of solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.023
3,4769,"The core part of the model is the SOFC stack, surrounded by a number of auxiliary devices, i.e. air compressor, regulating pressure valves, heat exchangers, pre-reformer and post-burner.",Model-based development of low-level control strategies for transient operation of solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.023
4,4769,"Due to the slow thermal dynamics of SOFCs, a set of three lumped-capacity models describes the dynamic response of fuel cell and heat exchangers to any operation change.",Model-based development of low-level control strategies for transient operation of solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.023
5,4769,The dynamic model was used to develop low-level control strategies aimed at guaranteeing targeted performance while keeping stack temperature derivative within safe limits to reduce stack degradation due to thermal stresses.,Model-based development of low-level control strategies for transient operation of solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.023
6,4769,Control strategies for both cold-start and warmed-up operations were implemented by combining feedforward and feedback approaches.,Model-based development of low-level control strategies for transient operation of solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.023
7,4769,"Particularly, the main cold-start control action relies on the precise regulation of methane flow towards anode and post-burner via by-pass valves; this strategy is combined with a cathode air-flow adjustment to have a tight control of both stack temperature gradient and warm-up time.",Model-based development of low-level control strategies for transient operation of solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.023
8,4769,Results are presented to show the potentialities of the proposed model-based approach to: (i) serve as a support to control strategies development and (ii) solve the trade-off between fast SOFC cold-start and avoidance of thermal-stress caused damages.,Model-based development of low-level control strategies for transient operation of solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.023
