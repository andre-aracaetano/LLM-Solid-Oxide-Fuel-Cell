1,6205,"The effect of various lanthanide additives on the performance of Cu-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), cermet anodes for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was investigated at 973 K for H-2 and the direct oxidation of butane.",An examination of lanthanide additives on the performance of Cu-YSZ cermet anodes,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00352-3
2,6205,"In all cases, the lanthanide oxides were added to the SOFC by impregnation of a porous YSZ matrix with aqueous solutions of the nitrate salts, followed by decomposition of nitrate ions by calcination.",An examination of lanthanide additives on the performance of Cu-YSZ cermet anodes,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00352-3
3,6205,"Ceria was found to be significantly more effective in promoting SOFC performance compared with the other lanthanides, and the performance of the lanthanide additives followed the catalytic activity observed for butane oxidation with 100 Torr each of butane and O-2.",An examination of lanthanide additives on the performance of Cu-YSZ cermet anodes,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00352-3
4,6205,Samaria doping of ceria led to a slight decrease in performance but also decreased the catalytic activity of ceria for butane oxidation.,An examination of lanthanide additives on the performance of Cu-YSZ cermet anodes,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00352-3
5,6205,"Membrane-reactor studies with propylene fed to Cu-molybdena-YSZ anodes at 723 K showed a high selectivity to acrolein, while Cu-ceria-YSZ anodes showed only total oxidation products under these conditions, implying that the catalytic properties of the oxides must be important.",An examination of lanthanide additives on the performance of Cu-YSZ cermet anodes,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00352-3
6,6205,"Finally, the application of these results to improved SOFC for direct oxidation of hydrocarbons is discussed.",An examination of lanthanide additives on the performance of Cu-YSZ cermet anodes,10.1016/S0013-4686(02)00352-3
