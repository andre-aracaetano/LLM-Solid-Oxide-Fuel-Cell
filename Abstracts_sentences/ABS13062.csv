1,13062,The properties of Cu-Mn-O spinels containing Mg were studied for use as protective coatings on UNS430 stainless steel interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells.,Copper-Magnesium-Manganese Spinel Coatings for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1149/2.026403jes
2,13062,"Cu-Mn-Mg-O spinel coatings were formed by oxidizing electrodeposited copper, manganese, and magnesium hydroxide films in air at 800 degrees C. A base layer of copper aided uniform manganese deposition and uniform spine!",Copper-Magnesium-Manganese Spinel Coatings for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1149/2.026403jes

5,13062,The CuMn2O4 spinel coating has higher conductivity (similar to 100 S/cm at 800 degrees C) but exhibited buckling defects.,Copper-Magnesium-Manganese Spinel Coatings for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1149/2.026403jes
6,13062,Addition of magnesium to the Cu-Mn-O spinel coatings significantly reduced the buckling damage.,Copper-Magnesium-Manganese Spinel Coatings for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1149/2.026403jes
7,13062,"Although the measured electrical conductivity of MgMn2O4 is 1-2 S/cm at 800 degrees C, Cu0.7Mg0.3Mn2O4 has a conductivity of similar to 60 S/cm at 800 degrees C. Cu-Mn-Mg-O spinel coatings also protect stainless steel by significantly reducing chromium oxide scale formation and diffusion of chromium into the coatings with the advantage of relatively high conductivity.",Copper-Magnesium-Manganese Spinel Coatings for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1149/2.026403jes
