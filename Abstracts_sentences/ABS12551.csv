1,12551,Direct internal reformation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) leads to two major performance and longevity challenges: thermal stresses in the cell due to large temperature gradients and coke formation on the anode.,Dynamic Model for Understanding Spatial Temperature and Species Distributions in Internal-Reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4006477
2,12551,A simplified quasi-two-dimensional direct internal reformation SOFC (DIR-SOFC) dynamic model was developed for investigation of the effects of various parameters and assumptions on the temperature gradients across the cell.,Dynamic Model for Understanding Spatial Temperature and Species Distributions in Internal-Reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4006477

6,12551,Steady state simulations revealed several results where the temperature difference across the cell was considerably affected by operating conditions and cell design parameters.,Dynamic Model for Understanding Spatial Temperature and Species Distributions in Internal-Reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4006477
7,12551,Increasing the performance of the cell through modifications to the electrochemical model to simulate modern cell performance produced significant changes in the cell temperature differential.,Dynamic Model for Understanding Spatial Temperature and Species Distributions in Internal-Reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4006477
8,12551,Improved cell performance led to a maximum increase in the temperature differential across the cell of 31 K. An increase in the interconnect thickness from 3.5 to 4.5 mm was shown to reduce the PEN temperature difference about 50 K. Variation of other physical parameters such as the thermal conductivity of the interconnect and the rib width also showed significant effects on the temperature distribution.,Dynamic Model for Understanding Spatial Temperature and Species Distributions in Internal-Reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4006477
