2,17201,The structural symmetry gradually distorts with the reduced ionic radius.,"Evaluation of perovskite oxides LnBaCo2O5+δ (Ln = La, Pr, Nd and Sm) as cathode materials for IT-SOFC",10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115144
3,17201,The electrical conductivity decreases due to the increasing oxygen vacancy concentration from La to Sm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates that the concentration of oxygen active sites on the surface of LnBC samples decreases with shrinking Ln3+ radius.,"Evaluation of perovskite oxides LnBaCo2O5+δ (Ln = La, Pr, Nd and Sm) as cathode materials for IT-SOFC",10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115144
