2,14121,"When an Ag mesh was used as a current collector, the power density of the cell became lower than that of a cell using a Pt mesh due to the relatively worse contact caused by the lower calcination temperature, particularly in the case of the anode.",Ag current collector for honeycomb solid oxide fuel cells using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.083
3,14121,The preparation method and the electrode structure were investigated for the purpose of increasing the power density of the cell using the Ag current collector.,Ag current collector for honeycomb solid oxide fuel cells using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.083
4,14121,It was found that an interlayer of Ni-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (1:9) between the NiFe-LSGM cermet anode and the LSGM electrolyte was effective for decreasing the pre-calcination temperature for anode fabrication.,Ag current collector for honeycomb solid oxide fuel cells using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.083
5,14121,"Much higher power densities of 300 mW cm(-2) and 140 mW m(-2) at 1073 K and 973 K, respectively, were achieved by inserting an interlayer.",Ag current collector for honeycomb solid oxide fuel cells using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.083
6,14121,These results for the power density of the cell using the Ag mesh current collector after the optimization of the electrode structure and the preparation procedure are close to those of the cell using the Pt mesh current collector cell presented in our previous work.,Ag current collector for honeycomb solid oxide fuel cells using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.083
