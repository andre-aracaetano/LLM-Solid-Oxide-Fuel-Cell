1,8119,"Interactions between sulfur and Ni1-xCux (x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00) were examined by a first-principles analysis based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations to provide a scientific basis for intelligent design of sulfur-tolerant anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Ab initio analysis of sulfur tolerance of Ni, Cu, and Ni-Cu alloys for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.009
2,8119,"Examination of slab models with three and five atomic layers for Ni and Cu (111) surfaces indicates that sulfur species may adsorb on four types of sites: atop, bridge, hcp hollow, and fcc hollow, among which the fcc-hollow centers are the most energetically favorable.","Ab initio analysis of sulfur tolerance of Ni, Cu, and Ni-Cu alloys for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.009
3,8119,"The adsorption energy of sulfur on Ni is approximately 20% higher than that on Cu for both unrelaxed and relaxed five-layer surface models, which is qualitatively in good agreement with experimental observations.","Ab initio analysis of sulfur tolerance of Ni, Cu, and Ni-Cu alloys for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.009
4,8119,"Using two active sites at three-fold hollow sites, the adsorption energy for sulfur on Ni1-xCux is predicted as a function of the alloy composition.","Ab initio analysis of sulfur tolerance of Ni, Cu, and Ni-Cu alloys for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.009
5,8119,"Alloying Ni with Cu improves sulfur tolerance, however not to the degree of pure Cu.","Ab initio analysis of sulfur tolerance of Ni, Cu, and Ni-Cu alloys for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.03.009
