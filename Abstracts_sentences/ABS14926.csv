3,14926,The area specific resistance (ASR) of the LSM/LSTM remains nearly constant under oxidizing/reducing atmospheres with varying gas concentrations.,Stable LSM/LSTM bi-layer interconnect for flat-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.024
4,14926,"For comparison, an LSM/LST with the same thickness is prepared; an increase in the ASR is observed as the concentration of H-2 feed to the LST side decreases.",Stable LSM/LSTM bi-layer interconnect for flat-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.024
5,14926,The difference in the ASR of LSM/LST can be explained by exposure to a relatively high oxygen partial pressure and partial destruction of the interfacial LST layer region where oxygen diffuses from the LSM layer.,Stable LSM/LSTM bi-layer interconnect for flat-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.024
6,14926,"Flat-tubular cells with the LSM/LSTM bi-layer interconnect achieve a maximum power density (MPD) of 463 mW cm(-2) using humidified H-2 fuel and air at 800 degrees C. With decreasing H-2 concentration in the fuel, the polarization resistance increases rather than the ohmic resistance, implying that the LSM/LSTM interconnect provides stable conduction property.",Stable LSM/LSTM bi-layer interconnect for flat-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.024
7,14926,"In comparison with the conventional LSM/LST interconnect cell, it shows improved stability and performance as the concentration of H-2 in the fuel decreases.",Stable LSM/LSTM bi-layer interconnect for flat-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.024
