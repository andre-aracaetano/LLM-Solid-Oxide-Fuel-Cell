1,6455,Nanocrystalline ceria (CeO(2)) films were deposited from aqueous solution at 50 degrees C on porous composite anodes of a commercial solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Cerium Oxide Thin Films on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1166/sam.2010.1059
2,6455,"The anodes were coated in as-received condition, or after pretreatment with either dodecanethiol or with bromoundecyltrichlorosilane followed by in-situ transformations to a sulfonate-functionalized surface.",Cerium Oxide Thin Films on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1166/sam.2010.1059
3,6455,"Regardless of pretreatment, the deposition process coated the pore walls throughout the 40-mu m-thick anode.",Cerium Oxide Thin Films on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1166/sam.2010.1059
4,6455,The morphology of the coating depended on the type of surface treatment.,Cerium Oxide Thin Films on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1166/sam.2010.1059
5,6455,"The sulfonate pretreatment yielded the most continuous and uniform films, typically 100 nm thick after 48 h of deposition.",Cerium Oxide Thin Films on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1166/sam.2010.1059
6,6455,The thiol pretreatment yielded discontinuous coatings of finely dispersed ceria particles.,Cerium Oxide Thin Films on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1166/sam.2010.1059
7,6455,"The ceria coatings on as-received anodes were intermediate in thickness, uniformity, and continuity between those on the sulfonate-and thiol-treated anodes.",Cerium Oxide Thin Films on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1166/sam.2010.1059
8,6455,The microstructures of the anodes (coated and uncoated) after reduction at 900 degrees C in hydrogen also depended on the type of surface treatment.,Cerium Oxide Thin Films on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1166/sam.2010.1059
9,6455,"After reduction, the coatings on the sulfonate-treated anode and on the anode without surfactant pretreatment yielded thin, lacey or fissured shells surrounding the nickel network in the porous cermet anode.",Cerium Oxide Thin Films on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1166/sam.2010.1059
