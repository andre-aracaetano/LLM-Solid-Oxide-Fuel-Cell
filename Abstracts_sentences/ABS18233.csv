1,18233,"In this study, doped ceria solid electrolyte materials Ce 0.8M0.2O2-delta (M = Gd, Sm, and Nd) for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells were synthesized through citrate-nitrate auto combustion method.",Ceria-Based Solid Electrolytes for IT-SOFC Applications,10.12693/APhysPolA.137.530
2,18233,"They were then characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) techniques.",Ceria-Based Solid Electrolytes for IT-SOFC Applications,10.12693/APhysPolA.137.530
3,18233,XRD results show that all the synthesized powders indicate a single-phase with cubic fluorite structure.,Ceria-Based Solid Electrolytes for IT-SOFC Applications,10.12693/APhysPolA.137.530
4,18233,Electrolytes with high density were obtained by sintering the samples at 1400 degrees C for 6 h. The mean crystallite sizes were calculated using the Scherrer formula.,Ceria-Based Solid Electrolytes for IT-SOFC Applications,10.12693/APhysPolA.137.530
5,18233,Surface morphologies of all the sintered electrolytes were obtained by using SEM.,Ceria-Based Solid Electrolytes for IT-SOFC Applications,10.12693/APhysPolA.137.530
6,18233,The total ionic conductivity of all electrolytes was measured from the impedance analysis in 300-700 degrees C temperature range.,Ceria-Based Solid Electrolytes for IT-SOFC Applications,10.12693/APhysPolA.137.530
7,18233,"The ionic conductivities at 700 degrees C are in the order of Ce 0.8Sm0.2O2-delta >Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta >Ce0.8Nd0.2O2-delta, and their corresponding activation energies are found to be 0.61, 0.62, and 0.67 eV, respectively.",Ceria-Based Solid Electrolytes for IT-SOFC Applications,10.12693/APhysPolA.137.530
