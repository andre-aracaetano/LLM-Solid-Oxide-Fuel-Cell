1,13279,"Samarium, gadolinium, and yttrium co-doped ceria (Ce0.8Sm0.16Y0.03Gd0.01O1.9, CSYG) and BaIn0.3Ti0.7O2.85 (BIT07) powders were prepared by sol-gel and solid-state reaction methods, respectively.",Preparation and Properties of Ce0.8Sm0.16Y0.03Gd0.01O1.9-BaIn0.3Ti0.7O2.85 Composite Electrolyte,10.3390/ma15165591
2,13279,"CSYG-BIT07 composite materials were obtained by mechanically mixing the two powders in different ratios and calcining at 1300 degrees C for 5 h. Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as electrical properties and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) measurements.",Preparation and Properties of Ce0.8Sm0.16Y0.03Gd0.01O1.9-BaIn0.3Ti0.7O2.85 Composite Electrolyte,10.3390/ma15165591
3,13279,A series of CSYG-BIT07 composite materials with relative densities higher than 95% were fabricated by sintering at 1300 degrees C for 5 h. The performance of the CSYG-BIT07 composite electrolyte was found to be related to the content of BIT07.,Preparation and Properties of Ce0.8Sm0.16Y0.03Gd0.01O1.9-BaIn0.3Ti0.7O2.85 Composite Electrolyte,10.3390/ma15165591
