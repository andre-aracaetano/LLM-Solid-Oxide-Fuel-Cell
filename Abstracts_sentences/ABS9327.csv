1,9327,"Ni-GDC cermet tubes (similar to 3 train inside diameter, 0.3-0.4 mm wall thickness and similar to 100 mm in length) with different amounts of porosity have been prepared by sintering of NiO-Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.95)",Ni-GDC microtubular cermets,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.036

3,9327,The NiO-GDC nanopowders were synthesized by chemical route and the different pore density was obtained by modifying the processing conditions (calcining and adjustment of carbonous remains).,Ni-GDC microtubular cermets,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.036
4,9327,Ni-GDC cermets were obtained from the sintered NiO-GDC composites using reduction treatment at 700 degrees C for 3 h in reducing atmosphere (5 vol.% H(2)-95 vol.% At).,Ni-GDC microtubular cermets,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.036
