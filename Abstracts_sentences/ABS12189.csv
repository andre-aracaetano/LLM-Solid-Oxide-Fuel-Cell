1,12189,"In this paper, a series of Sr-Ba-borosilicate glass-ceramics (10-40 mole% B2O3) were prepared to investigate the effect of borate content on the thermal properties as well as volatilization behavior.",Tuning the thermal properties of borosilicate glass ceramic seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.07.036
2,12189,"For crystallized samples with increasing borate contents, the dilatometric softening points decrease, from 702 to 660 degrees C, as do the coefficients of thermal expansion, from 9.5 to 7.5 x 10(-6) K-1.",Tuning the thermal properties of borosilicate glass ceramic seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.07.036
3,12189,"In addition, the weight loss from these materials, in wet forming gas at 780 degrees C for 28 days, decreases by a factor of two as the borate content increases from 10 to 40 mole%.",Tuning the thermal properties of borosilicate glass ceramic seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.07.036
