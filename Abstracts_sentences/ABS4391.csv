1,4391,For solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at intermediate temperatures the adjacency of the state-of-the-art yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte with ceria-based materials to both anodic and cathodic sides is regarded as crucial Tor the effectiveness of the cell.,Gadolinia-doped ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia interfaces: Regarding their application for SOFC technology,10.1016/S1359-6454(00)00261-5
2,4391,"Solid-state reaction, however, and interdiffusion phenomena between YSZ and ceria-based materials can cause degradation of the electrolyte.",Gadolinia-doped ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia interfaces: Regarding their application for SOFC technology,10.1016/S1359-6454(00)00261-5
3,4391,"When a gadolinia-doped-ceria (GDC) layer is used to protect YSZ against interaction with Go-containing cathodes, an unfavorable solid stair reaction at the YSZ-GDC interface can be efficiently suppressed when a thin (less than or equal to1 mum thick) interlayer with nominal composition of Ce0.43Zr0.43Gd0.10Y0.04O1.93 is incorporated at the interface.",Gadolinia-doped ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia interfaces: Regarding their application for SOFC technology,10.1016/S1359-6454(00)00261-5
4,4391,"When ceria is to be employed at the electrolyte-anode interface to reduce polarization losses, use of a ceria-40% vol Ni cermet is recommended, since suppression of the reactivity between YSZ and ceria can also be achieved in the presence of Ni.",Gadolinia-doped ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia interfaces: Regarding their application for SOFC technology,10.1016/S1359-6454(00)00261-5
