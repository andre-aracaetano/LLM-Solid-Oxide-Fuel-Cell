1,4395,Application of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with ceria based electrolyte has often been limited by high cost of electrolyte film fabrication and high electrode polarization.,Hierarchically Oriented Macroporous Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Thin Ceria Electrolyte Film,10.1021/am5003662
2,4395,"In this study, dense Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 (GDC) thin film electrolytes have been fabricated on hierarchically oriented macroporous NiO-GDC anodes by a combination of freeze-drying tape-casting of the NiO-GDC anode, drop-coating GDC slurry on NiO-GDC anode, and co-firing the electrolyte/anode bilayers.",Hierarchically Oriented Macroporous Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Thin Ceria Electrolyte Film,10.1021/am5003662
3,4395,"Using 3D X-ray microscopy and subsequent analysis, it has been determined that the NiO-GDC anode substrates have a porosity of around 42% and channel size from around 10 pm at the electrolyte side to around 20 mu m at the other side of the NiO-GDC (away from the electrolyte), indicating a hierarchically oriented macroporous NiO-GDC microstructure.",Hierarchically Oriented Macroporous Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Thin Ceria Electrolyte Film,10.1021/am5003662
4,4395,"Such NiO-GDC microstructure shows a tortuosity factor of similar to 1.3 along the thickness direction, expecting to facilitate gas diffusion in the anode during fuel cell operation.",Hierarchically Oriented Macroporous Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Thin Ceria Electrolyte Film,10.1021/am5003662
5,4395,"SOFCs with such Ni-GDC anode, GDC film (30 mu m) electrolyte, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-GDC (LSCF-GDC) cathode show significantly enhanced cell power output of 1.021 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C using H-2 as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.",Hierarchically Oriented Macroporous Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Thin Ceria Electrolyte Film,10.1021/am5003662
6,4395,Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis indicates a decrease in both activation and concentration polarizations.,Hierarchically Oriented Macroporous Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Thin Ceria Electrolyte Film,10.1021/am5003662
7,4395,This study has demonstrated that freeze-drying tape-casting is a very promising approach to fabricate hierarchically oriented porous substrate for SOFC and other applications.,Hierarchically Oriented Macroporous Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with Thin Ceria Electrolyte Film,10.1021/am5003662
