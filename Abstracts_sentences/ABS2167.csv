4,2167,The resulting thermal responses of the system to the electrical load dynamics as well as those dynamics associated with the filling of a hydrogen collection tank are investigated.,Feasibility of solid oxide fuel cell dynamic hydrogen coproduction to meet building demand,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.144
5,2167,The DIR-SOFC system model also allows for resolution of the fuel cell species and temperature distributions during these dynamics since thermal gradients are a concern for DIR-SOFC.,Feasibility of solid oxide fuel cell dynamic hydrogen coproduction to meet building demand,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.144
