2,20109,"The influence of oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) on structural and morphological properties of CSGO thin films deposited on Si (111) substrate was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques.","Structural, morphological and electrical properties of Sm-Gd Co-doped ceria thin films for micro-solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128110
3,20109,The XRD and FESEM results showed that the films were polycrystalline cubic structure with (111) oriented columnar structure.,"Structural, morphological and electrical properties of Sm-Gd Co-doped ceria thin films for micro-solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128110
4,20109,The co-doping strategy has strongly helped to stabilize the Ce4+ state as the lattice parameter of the films did not show any significant change under the influence of pO2 in the range of 2 x 10(-4)-3 x 10(-2),"Structural, morphological and electrical properties of Sm-Gd Co-doped ceria thin films for micro-solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128110
