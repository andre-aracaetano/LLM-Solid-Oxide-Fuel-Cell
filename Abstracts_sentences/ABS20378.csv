3,20378,"While any structural and chemical perturbation originating from the B-site occupation (poor chemical matching of the acceptor-dopant or Zr/Ti-mixing) leads to a significant reduction of the mobility of protonic defects, Sr/Ba-mixing on the A-site appears to be less critical.",Proton conducting alkaline earth zirconates and titanates for high drain electrochemical applications,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00953-5
4,20378,"The stability of protonic defects is found to essentially scale with the basicity of the lattice oxygen, which is influenced by both A- and B-site occupations.",Proton conducting alkaline earth zirconates and titanates for high drain electrochemical applications,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00953-5
