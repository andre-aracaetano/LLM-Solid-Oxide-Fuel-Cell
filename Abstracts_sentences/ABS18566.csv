1,18566,Experiments using a model gas mixture which was chosen to represent hydrocarbon fuel from hydrothermal gasification of biomass were carried out to study the kinetics of steam reforming of ethane over the Ni/YSZ (37 wt.% Ni) anode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Kinetics of steam reforming of ethane on Ni/YSZ (yttria-stabilised zirconia) catalyst,10.1016/j.fuel.2012.09.081
2,18566,For these studies gas total flow above 350 ml min(-1) (STP) and catalyst particle size of 75-125 mu m were chosen in order to eliminate the pore and film diffusion.,Kinetics of steam reforming of ethane on Ni/YSZ (yttria-stabilised zirconia) catalyst,10.1016/j.fuel.2012.09.081
