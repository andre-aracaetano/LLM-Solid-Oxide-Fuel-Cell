1,11050,"In this work, two asymmetric NiO-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (NiO-BZCY) anode substrates were prepared via the phase-inversion tape casting method for Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC)-based solid oxide fuel cells.",The effect of anode structure on the performance of NiO-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ supported ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-019-02923-8
2,11050,The results showed that the anode support structure significantly influenced the electrochemical properties of the cells.,The effect of anode structure on the performance of NiO-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ supported ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-019-02923-8
3,11050,The cell supported on the anode substrate consisted of a finger-like layer and a sponge-like layer outputs highest electrochemical performance with a maximum power density of 823mWcm(-2) at 650 degrees C and shows great superiority over the cell fabricated by a typical dry-pressing method.,The effect of anode structure on the performance of NiO-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ supported ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-019-02923-8
4,11050,"The excellent performances demonstrate that the phase-inversion tape casting technique is a good strategy in fabricating anode supports for SOFCs, and the anode structure with the relatively dense sponge-like layer as top surface is optimal to construct the complete cell.",The effect of anode structure on the performance of NiO-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ supported ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-019-02923-8
