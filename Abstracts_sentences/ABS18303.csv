3,18303,Ba(NO3)(2) was impregnated into the as prepared Ni-GDC anode followed by heat-treating at 1200 degrees C to form BaO/Ni-GDC anode.,Fabrication and characterization of GDC electrolyte/electrode integral SOFC with BaO/Ni-GDC anode,10.1016/j.materresbull.2013.11.034
4,18303,O-2-TPO analysis showed that carbon deposition on the anode was greatly suppressed in the presence of BaO. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) indicated that the anode activation polarization was negligible for the cell with the configuration of BaO/Ni-GDC//GDC//GDC-LSCF.,Fabrication and characterization of GDC electrolyte/electrode integral SOFC with BaO/Ni-GDC anode,10.1016/j.materresbull.2013.11.034
