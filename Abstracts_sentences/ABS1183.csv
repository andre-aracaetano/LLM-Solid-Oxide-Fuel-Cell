1,1183,La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3 cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells were prepared by the microwave synthesis method The reaction mechanism was studied using a thermal analysis method The influences of microwave synthesis conditions were examined and the characteristics of the samples were determined by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy,Microwave synthesis of La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3 cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s12598-010-0172-6
2,1183,It was found that the optimum conditions were the microwave power of 800 W and the reaction time of 40 min Samples with perovskite-type crystal structure were obtained The samples consist of uniformly distributed internal particles and the particle size is less than 1 mu m,Microwave synthesis of La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3 cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s12598-010-0172-6
