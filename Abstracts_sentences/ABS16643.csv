1,16643,Resonant anomalous X-ray reflectivity (RAXR) is a powerful technique for measuring element-specific distribution profiles across surfaces and buried interfaces.,Resonant X-ray scattering studies of epitaxial complex oxide thin films,10.1107/S0021889812047620
2,16643,"Here, the RAXR technique is applied to characterize a complex oxide heterostructure, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta, on NdGaO3, and the effects of data sampling and model-dependent fitting procedures on the extracted elemental distribution profile are evaluated.",Resonant X-ray scattering studies of epitaxial complex oxide thin films,10.1107/S0021889812047620
3,16643,The strontium profile through a 3.5 nm-thick film at 973 K and at an oxygen partial pressure of 150 Torr (1 Torr = 133.32 Pa) was determined from the measured RAXR spectra.,Resonant X-ray scattering studies of epitaxial complex oxide thin films,10.1107/S0021889812047620
4,16643,"The results demonstrate that in situ RAXR measurements can provide key insights into temperature-and environment-dependent elemental segregation processes, relevant, for example, in assessing the cathode performance of solid oxide fuel cells.",Resonant X-ray scattering studies of epitaxial complex oxide thin films,10.1107/S0021889812047620
