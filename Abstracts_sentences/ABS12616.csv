1,12616,The performance of Sr(2)FeTi(0.75)Mb(0.25)O(6-delta) (SFTM) as a potential cathode material has been investigated in this study.,Investigation of cobalt-free perovskite Sr2FeTi0.75Mo0.25O6-δ as new cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.09.023
2,12616,"The SFTM material with a cubic perovskite structure, has a good chemical compatibility with the Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte at 1100 degrees C for 10 h. The electrical conductivity of the SFTM sample reaches a maximum value of 2.31 S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C. SFTM shows an average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of 13.6 x 10(-6)K(-1) in the temperature range of 30-1000 degrees C in air, which is close to that of the typical electrolyte material.",Investigation of cobalt-free perovskite Sr2FeTi0.75Mo0.25O6-δ as new cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.09.023
3,12616,The polarization resistance (R-p) of a SFTM cathode on a SDC electrolyte reaches a value of 0.14 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Peak power density of a single-cell with the SFTM cathode on a 300 mu m-thick SDC electrolyte reaches 394 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. These results indicate that SFTM is a potential cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells.,Investigation of cobalt-free perovskite Sr2FeTi0.75Mo0.25O6-δ as new cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.09.023
