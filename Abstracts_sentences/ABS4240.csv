1,4240,A Ru/CGO catalyst was investigated in combination with a Cu current collector for the direct electro-oxidation and internal reforming of propane in a solid oxide fuel cell.,Propane conversion over a Ru/CGO catalyst and its application in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10800-006-9245-5
2,4240,The electrochemical power densities for the direct oxidation were larger than in the internal reforming process at 750 degrees C.,Propane conversion over a Ru/CGO catalyst and its application in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10800-006-9245-5
3,4240,"The electrochemical performance in the presence of propane was significantly affected by the polarization resistance which was about three times larger than that obtained for the SOFC fed with hydrogen at 750 degrees C. However, out-of-cell steam reforming tests showed a C3H8 conversion to syngas approaching 90% at 800 degrees C. Thus, significant enhancements may be achieved by properly optimizing the anode structure.",Propane conversion over a Ru/CGO catalyst and its application in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10800-006-9245-5
4,4240,No formation of carbon deposits was observed both upon operation of the anode in the direct oxidation and internal reforming processes at 750 degrees C.,Propane conversion over a Ru/CGO catalyst and its application in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10800-006-9245-5
