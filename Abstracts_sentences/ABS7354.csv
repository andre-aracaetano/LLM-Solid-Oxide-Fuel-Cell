3,7354,A laboratory-sized tri-layer cell of NiO-BCZYZ//BCZYZ (similar to 21 mu m)/BSZF-BCZYZ (similar to 32 mu m) was operated from 550 to 700 degrees C with humidified hydrogen (similar to 3% H2O) as fuel and the static air as oxidant.,Ba0.5Sr0.5Zn0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ composite cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.05.065
4,7354,"The BCZYZ perovskite electrolyte synthesized by a modified Pechini process was completely dense after sintered at 1250 degrees C for 5 h, lower than that without Znic dopant about 150 degrees C. An open-circuit potential of 1.007 V, a maximum power density of 387 mWcm(-2), and a low polarization resistance of the electrodes of 0.11 Omega cm(2) were achieved at 700 degrees C.
