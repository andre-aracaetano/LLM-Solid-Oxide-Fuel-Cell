3,8552,Uniaxial die-pressed powder pellets were densified by air-sintering from 1400 degrees C to 1600 degrees C for 6 h. The results of X-ray diffraction indicated a pure cubic fluorite crystal structure with a theoretical density of 7.363 g cm(-3).,Ce0.80Sm0.10Ba0.05Er0.05O2-δ multi-doped ceria electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.10.075
