1,5608,"In order to verify the validity of the simulation and to investigate the gaseous diffusion from the outlet of the anode, anodic gas concentration measurements of a seal-less disk-type solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) were carried out using quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS).",Experimental investigation of anodic gaseous concentration of a practical seal-less solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.062
2,5608,Simultaneous gas sampling was conducted from the five sampling ports made at the anode separator.,Experimental investigation of anodic gaseous concentration of a practical seal-less solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.062
3,5608,The uniformity of the radial gas flow in the anode was confirmed by analyzing the gas from four sampling ports located at a concentric circle.,Experimental investigation of anodic gaseous concentration of a practical seal-less solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.062
4,5608,"H-2, H2O and N-2 concentration profiles were measured and simulated under various fuel utilization (U-f) conditions and changing the gas flow rate.",Experimental investigation of anodic gaseous concentration of a practical seal-less solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.062
5,5608,The diffusion of N-2 into the anode was found to become less with increasing Uf owing to the lesser diffusivity of N-2 in H2O than in H-2.,Experimental investigation of anodic gaseous concentration of a practical seal-less solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.062
6,5608,"From the simulation, the existence of the reverse current, i.e., electrolysis current, in the outlet region was predicted.",Experimental investigation of anodic gaseous concentration of a practical seal-less solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.062
