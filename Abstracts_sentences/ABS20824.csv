1,20824,"For an application of mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskite oxides, e.g., as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes, as high-temperature gas sensors or as oxygen-transport membrane (OTM) materials, the kinetics of oxygen transport is of fundamental importance.","Oxygen equilibration kinetics of mixed-conducting perovskites BSCF, LSCF, and PSCF at 900°C determined by electrical conductivity relaxation",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.004
2,20824,A common setup for the determination of the chemical diffusion coefficient D-delta and the surface exchange coefficient k(delta) is the electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) method where the conductivity response of an MIEC sample is measured after the ambient oxygen partial pressure pO(2) has been abruptly changed using different gas mixtures.,"Oxygen equilibration kinetics of mixed-conducting perovskites BSCF, LSCF, and PSCF at 900°C determined by electrical conductivity relaxation",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.004
3,20824,"In the present study, however, a closed tubular zirconia oxygen pump setup was used which facilitates precise pO(2) control in a closed sample space with a high resolution at temperatures above 700 degrees C in atmospheres ranging from pure oxygen continuously down to pO(2) = 10(-18) bar.","Oxygen equilibration kinetics of mixed-conducting perovskites BSCF, LSCF, and PSCF at 900°C determined by electrical conductivity relaxation",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.004
