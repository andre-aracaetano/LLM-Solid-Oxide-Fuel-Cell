1,20430,"A double columnar structure film consisting of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) and Sm0.2Ce0.8O3-delta (SDC) as an active cathode was prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on a thin La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8 Mg0.2O3-delta/SDC bi-layer film, and the effects of SSC/SDC ratio in double columnar layer on cathodic performance were investigated.",Nano strain induced double columnar oxide as highly active oxygen-dissociation electrode for Ni-Fe metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.074
2,20430,It was found that the cathodic overpotential as well as power density were strongly dependent on SSC-SDC ratio in double columnar layer.,Nano strain induced double columnar oxide as highly active oxygen-dissociation electrode for Ni-Fe metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.074
3,20430,"Almost the theoretical open circuit potential (1.10 V) and extremely high maximum power density higher than 3.0 and 0.33 W/cm(2) at 973 and 773 K respectively, were achieved on the cell using double columnar at SSC:SDC = 6:4 cathode, which is the optimized composition.",Nano strain induced double columnar oxide as highly active oxygen-dissociation electrode for Ni-Fe metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.074
4,20430,Increased cathodic performance of double columnar SSC-SDC cathode were assigned to the decreased activation and the concentration overpotential.,Nano strain induced double columnar oxide as highly active oxygen-dissociation electrode for Ni-Fe metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.074
5,20430,"From XRD and TEM analysis, tensile strain in SDC and compressed one in SSC were observed, which could be increased diffusivity of oxide ion in SDC part.",Nano strain induced double columnar oxide as highly active oxygen-dissociation electrode for Ni-Fe metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.074
6,20430,"On the other hand, Sr surface segregation in SSC was prevented by the double columnar structure from low energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy and this could be related to the compressed strain in SSC part of double columnar structure resulting in the increased surface activity to oxygen dissociation.",Nano strain induced double columnar oxide as highly active oxygen-dissociation electrode for Ni-Fe metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.074
