2,20995,The Nyquist plot of the EIS experimental data at 550 degrees C shows a single arc displaying typical 'normal' or 'pure' Gerischer shape.,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ nanofiber cathodes for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cell applications: A case study for the 'depressed' or 'fractal' Gerischer element,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.06.068
3,20995,"With increasing temperature (600-750 degrees C), this single arc gradually shrinks and deforms, showing a 'depressed' or 'fractal' Gerischer behavior.",Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ nanofiber cathodes for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cell applications: A case study for the 'depressed' or 'fractal' Gerischer element,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.06.068
4,20995,"Finally, for temperatures higher than 750 degrees C, this arc further shrinks, becoming practically a depressed semicircle at 950 degrees C. These results demonstrate that the depressed Gerischer behavior, whose physical significance has never been demonstrated on theoretical grounds, is not an intrinsic feature of the electrode, since it appears in a clear manner only at certain well defined temperatures, while it disappears at other operating temperatures.",Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ nanofiber cathodes for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cell applications: A case study for the 'depressed' or 'fractal' Gerischer element,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.06.068

7,20995,"The latter circuit allows to assess separately the impedance contribution of the electrode bulk, associated to the pure Gerischer element, and of the electrode/electrolyte interface, associated to the RQ element, providing a powerful tool in view of understanding where the resistances are concentrated, which is the first step for an optimization of the electrode structure.",Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ nanofiber cathodes for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cell applications: A case study for the 'depressed' or 'fractal' Gerischer element,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.06.068
8,20995,"In the LSCF electrospun cathodes investigated here, the higher resistance is associated to the bulk process, and it is proposed to be related to the high void degree (37.5%).",Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ nanofiber cathodes for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cell applications: A case study for the 'depressed' or 'fractal' Gerischer element,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.06.068
