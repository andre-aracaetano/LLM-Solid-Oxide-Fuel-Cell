5,1395,"It was, however, apparent that under the highly anodic environments experienced by the anode for SOFC applications, the material degraded and a loss in efficiency was noted.",METHANOL OXIDATION OVER DOPED-LACOO3 ELECTRODES IN A SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.63.41
6,1395,"It was therefore concluded that p-type oxides could only be used for systems such as electrochemical reactors, rather than in sold oxide fuel cell applications.",METHANOL OXIDATION OVER DOPED-LACOO3 ELECTRODES IN A SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.63.41
