5,13093,"The electrocatalytic activity of the SrTiO3 cone samples, With various amount of reduced titanium dioxide phases (Maoneli phases), was investigted for oxidation of H, at 700 degrees C. High temperature treatment at 1000 degrees C, between the measurements at 700 degrees C, showed that high content of Magneli phases leads to faster degradation of the activity.",Effects of Sr/Ti-ratio in SrTiO3-based SOFC anodes investigated by the use of cone-shaped electrodes,10.1016/j.electacta.2006.03.096
