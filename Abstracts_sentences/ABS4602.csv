1,4602,"In solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), chromium deposition and poisoning of metallic interconnect is one of the most important issues in the electrochemical activity and stability of the cathode for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).","An investigation of Cr vaporization from SUS430 metallic interconnect and deposition on (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233285
2,4602,"In this paper, the chromium evaporation characteristics, oxide scale growth, and deposition of chromium on the ORR on (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSM) cathode are studied at 700-800 degrees C for SUS430 alloy interconnect material in the intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.","An investigation of Cr vaporization from SUS430 metallic interconnect and deposition on (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233285
3,4602,"The chromium vaporization rate is measured using the transpiration technique and the surface morphologies, and cross-sections of oxide scales are examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX).","An investigation of Cr vaporization from SUS430 metallic interconnect and deposition on (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233285
4,4602,"The results indicate that chromium volatilization is correlated with the composition and morphology of the oxide scale, the Cr volatili-zation process presents two stages according to the structural evolution of the oxide scale.","An investigation of Cr vaporization from SUS430 metallic interconnect and deposition on (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233285
5,4602,"In addition, deposition and poisoning of Cr species released from metallic interconnect on the LSM cathode are studied and the for-mation of MnCr2O4 phase on the LSM backbone degrades the ORR electrochemical activity, causing the increase of overpotential of the cathode.","An investigation of Cr vaporization from SUS430 metallic interconnect and deposition on (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233285
