1,6082,Oxygen reduction and proton conduction originated from hydration are two key steps in the cathode process of protonic ceramic fuel cells.,A cobalt-free Pr6O11-BaCe0.2Fe0.8O3-8 composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells with promising oxygen reduction activity and hydration ability,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234233
2,6082,"In this work, Pr6O11 is impregnated into a cobalt-free BaCe0.2Fe0.8O3-8 cathode, resulting in an improved activity of lattice oxygen and a moderate enhancement of the electrical conductivity, both of which are beneficial for charge transfer, the rate-determining step of oxygen reduction process at the cathode.",A cobalt-free Pr6O11-BaCe0.2Fe0.8O3-8 composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells with promising oxygen reduction activity and hydration ability,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234233
3,6082,"The polarization resistance of bare BaCe0.2Fe0.8O3-8 cathode for oxygen reduction is 0.115 omega cm(2) at 700 C, which is reduced significantly to 0.039 omega cm(2) with the addition of 30 wt% Pr6O11.",A cobalt-free Pr6O11-BaCe0.2Fe0.8O3-8 composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells with promising oxygen reduction activity and hydration ability,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234233
4,6082,"Besides, the hydration ability of the cathode is also improved with Pr6O11, and thus the combination of proton and oxygen is facilitated.",A cobalt-free Pr6O11-BaCe0.2Fe0.8O3-8 composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells with promising oxygen reduction activity and hydration ability,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234233
5,6082,A single cell with 30 wt% Pr6O11-70 wt% BaCe0.2Fe0.8O3-8 composite cathode exhibits the highest maximum power density of 1406 mW cm( -2) at 700 C. The composite cathode also shows a good stability.,A cobalt-free Pr6O11-BaCe0.2Fe0.8O3-8 composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells with promising oxygen reduction activity and hydration ability,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234233
