1,16010,Sr(Ti1-xFex)O3-delta (STF) has recently been explored as an oxygen electrode for solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs).,High stability SrTi1-xFexO3-δ electrodes for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions,10.1039/c9ta07548h
2,16010,"Model thin film electrode studies show oxygen surface exchange rates that generally improve with increasing Fe content when x < 0.5, and are comparable to the best Co-containing perovskite electrode materials.",High stability SrTi1-xFexO3-δ electrodes for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions,10.1039/c9ta07548h
3,16010,"Recent results on porous electrodes with the specific composition Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7)O3-delta show excellent electrode performance and stability, but other compositions have not been tested.",High stability SrTi1-xFexO3-δ electrodes for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions,10.1039/c9ta07548h
4,16010,Here we report results for porous electrodes with a range of compositions from x = 0.5 to 0.9.,High stability SrTi1-xFexO3-δ electrodes for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions,10.1039/c9ta07548h
5,16010,"The polarization resistance decreases with increasing Fe content up to x = 0.7, but increases for further increases in x. This results from the interaction of two effects - the oxygen solid state diffusion coefficient increases with increasing x, but the electrode surface area and surface oxygen exchange rate decrease due to increased sinterability and Sr surface segregation for the Fe-rich compositions.",High stability SrTi1-xFexO3-δ electrodes for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions,10.1039/c9ta07548h
6,16010,"Symmetric cells showed no degradation during 1000 h life tests at 700 degrees C even at a current density of 1.5 A cm(-2), showing that all the STF electrode compositions worked stably in both fuel cell mode and electrolysis modes.",High stability SrTi1-xFexO3-δ electrodes for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions,10.1039/c9ta07548h
7,16010,"The excellent stability may be explained by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) results showing that the amount of surface segregated Sr did not change during the long-term testing, and by relatively low polarization resistances that help avoid electrode delamination.",High stability SrTi1-xFexO3-δ electrodes for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions,10.1039/c9ta07548h
