1,14287,"Gd2O3 doped CeO2 (GDC) was widely used in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) because of its high ionic conductivity at 500-700 degrees C. However, during the SOFC operation, Ce4+ was reduced to Ce3+ at the anode side of the battery, resulting in electronic leakage, which leaded to the degradation of SOFC battery performance.",Influence of Gd2O3 doping contents on conductivity of Ce1-xGdxO2-δ electrolyte,10.11868/j.issn.1001-4381.2019.000322
