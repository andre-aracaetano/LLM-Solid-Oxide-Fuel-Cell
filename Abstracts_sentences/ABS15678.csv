2,15678,These materials have a mixed electronic-ionic conductivity which increases with the growth of the Fe2O3 content.,Synthesis and Investigation of Novel Composite Materials Based on the CaO-Bi2O3-Fe2O3 System,10.1134/S1087659618060020
3,15678,"In the (CaO)(0.26)(Bi2O3)(0.74)-Fe2O3 section, a part of the oxygen-ionic component increases with an increase in the Fe2O3 content and, in contrast, the oxygen conductivity decreases in the (CaO)(0.2)(Bi2O3)(0.8)-BiFeO3 section.",Synthesis and Investigation of Novel Composite Materials Based on the CaO-Bi2O3-Fe2O3 System,10.1134/S1087659618060020
4,15678,"These materials are interesting in terms of their use as elements of electrochemical devices, for example, in solid oxide fuel cells, electrolyzers for obtaining extra pure gases (oxygen, hydrogen), and electrochemical oxygen sensors.",Synthesis and Investigation of Novel Composite Materials Based on the CaO-Bi2O3-Fe2O3 System,10.1134/S1087659618060020
