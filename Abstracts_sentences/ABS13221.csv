1,13221,Ni-CeO2 composites with CeO2 of different morphologies (nanorods and nanocubes) are prepared and used as the hydrogen electrode of reversible solid oxide cells (RSOCs).,The effect of CeO2 morphology on the electrochemical performance of the reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114513
2,13221,Ni-CeO2 nanorods have larger surface area and more surface oxygen than Ni-CeO2 nanocubes.,The effect of CeO2 morphology on the electrochemical performance of the reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114513
3,13221,"When the RSOCs are used as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), the maximum power densities (P-max) of the cells with Ni-CeO2 nanorods and Ni-CeO2 nanocubes as the anodes are 530.5 and 390.2 mW cm(-2), respectively, at 700 degrees C with H-2 as the fuel.",The effect of CeO2 morphology on the electrochemical performance of the reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114513
4,13221,The superficial diffusion of adsorbed II atom on Ni-CeO2 composites anode is the rate-determining step (RDS) for H-2 electrochemical oxidation reaction and the diffusion rate of the hydrogen atoms adsorbed on Ni-CeO2 nanorods are larger than that of hydrogen atoms adsorbed on Ni-CeO2 nanocubes.,The effect of CeO2 morphology on the electrochemical performance of the reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114513
5,13221,"Furthermore, when the RSOCs are used as solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), the electrolysis performances of the cell with Ni-CeO2 nanorods as the hydrogen electrode are better than those of the cell with Ni-CeO2 nanocubes as the hydrogen electrode at 700 degrees C under various H2O concentrations.",The effect of CeO2 morphology on the electrochemical performance of the reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114513
