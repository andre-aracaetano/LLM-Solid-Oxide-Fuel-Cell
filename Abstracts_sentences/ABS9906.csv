1,9906,Ongoing development of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology coincides with a rapid increase in legislation aiming to control the environmental impacts of products across their life cycle.,Impacts of environmental product legislation on solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.069
2,9906,A risk-based method is used to explore the potential future impacts of this body of legislation on the technology.,Impacts of environmental product legislation on solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.069
3,9906,Legislation controlling the use of hazardous materials is one area of significance.,Impacts of environmental product legislation on solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.069
4,9906,"Under the new European REACH Regulation some nickel compounds, used widely throughout general industry but also in the fabrication of anode structures, may fall under the classification of a substance of very high concern (SVHC) in future, which presents a risk of restrictions being placed on their continued use.",Impacts of environmental product legislation on solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.069
5,9906,"This risk must drive the development of alternative anode materials, or requires the SOFC industry to identify a socio-economic argument justifying exemption from any future restrictions.",Impacts of environmental product legislation on solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.069
6,9906,A legislative trend establishing recycling requirements for end-of-life products is also identified as having a potential future impact on the technology.,Impacts of environmental product legislation on solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.069
7,9906,"Recycling strategies for SOFC products must be considered, prior to commercialisation.",Impacts of environmental product legislation on solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.069
8,9906,"It is proposed that failure to meet these future environmental requirements may be detrimental to the perception of SOFC technology, the demand for which is substantially driven by the environmental benefits offered over incumbent power generation technologies.",Impacts of environmental product legislation on solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.069
