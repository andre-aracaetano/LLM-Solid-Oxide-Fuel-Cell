1,12326,Interconnect coatings are extremely important to ensure an optimal performance of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack.,Microstructural and Electrical Characterization of Plasma Sprayed Cu-Mn Oxide Spinels as Coating on Metallic Interconnects for Stacking Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400189
2,12326,Nowadays the most common material used to produce SOFC interconnects is a ferritic stainless steel (FSS) rich in chromium which is much less expensive than the previously used ceramic interconnects.,Microstructural and Electrical Characterization of Plasma Sprayed Cu-Mn Oxide Spinels as Coating on Metallic Interconnects for Stacking Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400189
3,12326,Nevertheless interconnects have to be coated in order to provide protection from the aggressive environment that surrounds them and reduce chromium species migration to the cell's cathode.,Microstructural and Electrical Characterization of Plasma Sprayed Cu-Mn Oxide Spinels as Coating on Metallic Interconnects for Stacking Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400189
4,12326,In this work three different coatings were applied to Crofer((R)),Microstructural and Electrical Characterization of Plasma Sprayed Cu-Mn Oxide Spinels as Coating on Metallic Interconnects for Stacking Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400189
5,12326,"22 H substrates viaatmospheric plasma spraying (APS): two different stoichiometries of copper manganese oxide (CuxMn3-xO4, where x=1.4 and 1.5) and one of cobalt manganese oxide (CoxMn3-xO4, where x=1.5), considered the state of the art coating for SOFC interconnects.",Microstructural and Electrical Characterization of Plasma Sprayed Cu-Mn Oxide Spinels as Coating on Metallic Interconnects for Stacking Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400189
