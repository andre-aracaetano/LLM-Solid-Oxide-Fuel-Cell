1,16377,The current trend in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) development is for a lowering of the operation temperature from similar to 1000 degrees C to temperatures as low as 600 degrees C.,Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
2,16377,This lowering of temperature is beneficial in a number of ways.,Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
3,16377,"It relaxes the stringent materials requirements for cell components, particularly, the interconnect, and for the balance of plant.",Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
4,16377,One adverse consequence of the lower temperatures is a slowing.,Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
5,16377,"Of the electrode kinetics, particularly, at the cathode (air electrode).",Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
6,16377,It is thus necessary to have a thorough understanding of the processes occuring at the cathode to aid material selection and optimisation for low operating temperatures.,Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
7,16377,"The majority of the cathode materials use at present, are based on mixed conducting, acceptor (A) doped, rare-earth (Ln) transition metal (T) perovskite oxides with the general formula. Ln(1x)A(x)TO(3+/-delta).",Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
8,16377,Examples of these materials include La(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3+/-delta) La(1-x)Sr(x)CoO(3+/-delta) etc.,Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
9,16377,"The performance of these electrodes can be linked to their microsturcture, and to the kinetics of oxygen exchange and diffusion.",Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
10,16377,In order to model the behaviour of such materials as cathodes.,Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
11,16377,We have undertaken a systematic study of the kinetics of the oxygen exchange process using the isotope exchange depth profiling method (IEDP) employing Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS).,Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
12,16377,"Oxygen self diffusion and surface exchange data are presented for a number of perovskite cathode compositions, in particular the effect of increasing the acceptor dopant level are explored together with the effect of changing the rare earth and transition metal cations.",Ceramic electrodes for SOFC's,
