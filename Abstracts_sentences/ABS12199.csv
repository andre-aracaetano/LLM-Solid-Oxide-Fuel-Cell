3,12199,"Compared to the cell performance of single- and double-layered perovskites, these triple-conducting composite oxides have better oxygen reduction capabilities and a robust structure showing a peak power density of 1.57 W cm(-2) and an ASR of 0.021 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C. No phase reactions or structural changes were found between the Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) and the SmBaCo2O5+delta (SBC) composites, as detected through in-situ high temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) techniques.",A highly efficient composite cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227812
4,12199,Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the interfacial electron transfers and redistributions between SSC and SBC were beneficial for electron-hole separation.,A highly efficient composite cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227812
5,12199,"Therefore, such bond destabilization inevitably increased the energy of the occupied pi* orbitals originating from the surface-peroxo species in the tensile-strained interface, enhancing the bulk and surface diffusivities of the oxide ions to improve oxygen reduction reactions.",A highly efficient composite cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227812
6,12199,This work provides a simple yet easily replicable method for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for use in PCFC applications.,A highly efficient composite cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227812
