2,9867,Different compounds (La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta) and synthesis methods (freeze-drying and citrate complexation) were evaluated.,Electrochemical performance of nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.067
3,9867,"These materials exhibited excellent performance (area-specific resistance values in the range of 0.05-0.20 Omega cm(2) for an operating temperature of 700 degrees C), which improved with decreasing grain size.",Electrochemical performance of nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.067
4,9867,"This performance can be attributed to the high specific surface area of these nanostructured cathodes, thus dramatically increasing the number of active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction.",Electrochemical performance of nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.067
5,9867,"Under these conditions, the electrochemical properties are mainly controlled by oxide ion diffusion through the MIEC cathode, which becomes faster with decreasing grain size.",Electrochemical performance of nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.067
