1,14021,"This paper presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of two different solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-based combined heat and power (CHP) systems with thermal energy storage, one based on a reversible solid oxide fuel cell (r-SOFC) and hydrogen storage, and the other on a natural gas-fed SOFC.",Comparative life cycle assessment of two different SOFC-based cogeneration systems with thermal energy storage integrated into a single-family house nanogrid,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116378
2,14021,"Both systems have been included alternately into the same single-family house nanogrid, that also includes a photovoltaic (PV) system for renewable energy production.",Comparative life cycle assessment of two different SOFC-based cogeneration systems with thermal energy storage integrated into a single-family house nanogrid,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116378
3,14021,"The hourly electrical and thermal demands over an entire year of the user are calculated by means of the commercial software TRNSYS 17, the simulation of the two CHP systems operation is performed using the commercial software HOMER PRO, and the life cycle assessment is performed by means of the software SimaPro 9 and Ecoinvent 3.3.",Comparative life cycle assessment of two different SOFC-based cogeneration systems with thermal energy storage integrated into a single-family house nanogrid,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116378
4,14021,"The main finding of this study is that, in the considered Italian scenario, the r-SOFC-based CHP system has, in general, a more adverse environmental impact than the natural gas-fed one.",Comparative life cycle assessment of two different SOFC-based cogeneration systems with thermal energy storage integrated into a single-family house nanogrid,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116378
5,14021,"This is essentially because the higher electricity production of the natural gas-fed SOFC, mainly due to its continuous operation, determines a higher self-consumption referred to the total alternating current (AC) load on a yearly basis.",Comparative life cycle assessment of two different SOFC-based cogeneration systems with thermal energy storage integrated into a single-family house nanogrid,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116378
6,14021,"On the other hand, the r-SOFC with H-2 storage shows a more adverse environmental impact, despite the higher power self-consumption from the PV system.",Comparative life cycle assessment of two different SOFC-based cogeneration systems with thermal energy storage integrated into a single-family house nanogrid,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116378
7,14021,"Indeed, relatively to the r-SOFC system, in the cold seasons large part of the electrical energy necessary to power the H-2 production and AC loads is taken from the Italian national grid, which has a relatively high share of electricity produced by fossil fuel thermal power plant.",Comparative life cycle assessment of two different SOFC-based cogeneration systems with thermal energy storage integrated into a single-family house nanogrid,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116378
8,14021,"Moreover, the effects of an increased renewable energy (solar) share in the country energy mix are also reported and discussed, and the results of a Monte Carlo analysis aimed at evaluating the effects of the uncertainty relative to the input parameters for the LCA analysis are presented as well.",Comparative life cycle assessment of two different SOFC-based cogeneration systems with thermal energy storage integrated into a single-family house nanogrid,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116378
