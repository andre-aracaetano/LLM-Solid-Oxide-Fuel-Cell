1,12662,Perovskite-type materials have been investigated extensively in the attempt to discover new electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) operating at low temperatures.,The Effect of Pr co-doping on the Densification and Electrical Properties of Sr-LaAlO3,10.1590/S1516-14392013005000087
2,12662,"These materials include LaAlO3-based perovskite, which, when adequately doped, presents high ionic conductivity.",The Effect of Pr co-doping on the Densification and Electrical Properties of Sr-LaAlO3,10.1590/S1516-14392013005000087
3,12662,"However, despite the high conductivity of doped LaAlO3, two characteristics limit its application as solid electrolyte: low sinterability and p-type electronic conductivity in oxidizing conditions.",The Effect of Pr co-doping on the Densification and Electrical Properties of Sr-LaAlO3,10.1590/S1516-14392013005000087
4,12662,The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of Pr co-doping on the densification and electrical conductivity of Sr-doped LaAlO3.,The Effect of Pr co-doping on the Densification and Electrical Properties of Sr-LaAlO3,10.1590/S1516-14392013005000087
5,12662,The addition of Pr eliminated the deficiencies mentioned above.,The Effect of Pr co-doping on the Densification and Electrical Properties of Sr-LaAlO3,10.1590/S1516-14392013005000087
6,12662,Pr in solid solution acts as a perfect sintering aid because promoted densification without forming secondary phase which should be detrimental for electrical conduction.,The Effect of Pr co-doping on the Densification and Electrical Properties of Sr-LaAlO3,10.1590/S1516-14392013005000087
7,12662,The addition of Pr also increased the bulk electrical conductivity measured in air atmosphere but had no effect at low oxygen partial pressure.,The Effect of Pr co-doping on the Densification and Electrical Properties of Sr-LaAlO3,10.1590/S1516-14392013005000087
8,12662,"However, the addition of Pr had a strong effect on the grain boundary, improving the ionic grain boundary electrical conductivity at air atmosphere which was attributed to the Pr influence on the space charge layer.",The Effect of Pr co-doping on the Densification and Electrical Properties of Sr-LaAlO3,10.1590/S1516-14392013005000087
