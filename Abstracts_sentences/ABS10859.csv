3,10859,"The experiment results show that CCO and YSZ are chemical compatible only up to 800 degrees C. By introducing a Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) interlayer to avoid the direct contact of CCO with YSZ, the area specific resistance (ASR) of CCO cathode is significantly decreased from 13.06 Omega cm(2) to 0.60 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees",Optimization of electrochemical performance of Ca3Co2O6 cathode on yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.090
4,10859,"C. Furthermore, the addition of frit can lower the sintering temperature of the cathode to similar to 800 degrees C, also resulting in a remarkable decreasing of the ASR to 3.87 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C.
