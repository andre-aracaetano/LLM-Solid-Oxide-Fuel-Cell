1,20819,"Fuel electrode-supported tubular protonic ceramic cells (FETPCCs) based on the BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.15Zn0.05O3-delta (BZCYZ) membrane electrolyte was fabricated through a two-step method, in which the polyporous electrode-support tube was prepared with a traditional slip casting technique in a plaster mold, and the BZCYZ membrane was produced by a dip-coating process on the outside surface of the electrode-support tube.",Performance of Fuel Electrode-Supported Tubular Protonic Ceramic Cells Prepared through Slip Casting and Dip-Coating Methods,10.3390/catal13010182
2,20819,The dense thin-film electrolyte of BZCYZ with a thickness of similar to 25 mu m was achieved by cofiring the fuel electrode support and electrolyte membrane at 1450 degrees C for 6 h. The electrochemical performances of the FETPCCs were tested under different solid oxide cell modes.,Performance of Fuel Electrode-Supported Tubular Protonic Ceramic Cells Prepared through Slip Casting and Dip-Coating Methods,10.3390/catal13010182
3,20819,"In protonic ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) mode, the peak power densities of the cell reached 151-191 mW center dot cm(-2) at 550-700 degrees C and exhibited relatively stable performance during continuous operation over 100 h at 650 degrees C. It was found that the major influence on the performance of tubular PCFC was the resistance and cathode current collectors.",Performance of Fuel Electrode-Supported Tubular Protonic Ceramic Cells Prepared through Slip Casting and Dip-Coating Methods,10.3390/catal13010182
4,20819,"Additionally, in protonic ceramic electrolysis cell (PCEC) mode, the current densities of 418-654 mA center dot cm(-2) were obtained at 600-700 degrees C with the applied voltage of 2.0 V when exposed to 20% CO2-80% H-2 and 3% H2O/air.",Performance of Fuel Electrode-Supported Tubular Protonic Ceramic Cells Prepared through Slip Casting and Dip-Coating Methods,10.3390/catal13010182
5,20819,"Using distribution of relaxation time analysis, the electrolytic rate-limiting step of the PCEC model was determined as the adsorption and dissociation of the gas on the electrode surface.",Performance of Fuel Electrode-Supported Tubular Protonic Ceramic Cells Prepared through Slip Casting and Dip-Coating Methods,10.3390/catal13010182
