1,12525,This paper discusses the production in one single synthesis step of a binary mixture of YSZ particles and NiO particles as precursor powder for the manufacture of SOFC anodes.,NiO/YSZ nanoparticles obtained by new sol-gel route,10.1016/j.cej.2008.02.006
2,12525,"Three parameters were varied, each over two levels: (i) the temperature of the calcination step involved in the production process, (ii) the proportions of the two organic precursors: sucrose and pectin and (iii) the proportions of YSZ and NiO. The particles, and the calcination process involved in their production, are analyzed by TGA, TEM, SEM, XRD and BET adsorption.",NiO/YSZ nanoparticles obtained by new sol-gel route,10.1016/j.cej.2008.02.006
3,12525,It is shown that the relative particle sizes are near-optimal for the production of SOFC anodes and that the particles consist either of pure cubic YSZ or pure cubic NiO.,NiO/YSZ nanoparticles obtained by new sol-gel route,10.1016/j.cej.2008.02.006
4,12525,The particle sizes indicated by the various analysis methods are consistent.,NiO/YSZ nanoparticles obtained by new sol-gel route,10.1016/j.cej.2008.02.006
5,12525,"The particle size and the degree of crystallinity of the particles increase with increasing calcination temperature, while it appears that the process is rather forgiving for changes in the sucrose:pectin ratio.",NiO/YSZ nanoparticles obtained by new sol-gel route,10.1016/j.cej.2008.02.006
6,12525,"SEM studies show that the powder produced already has good connectivity between the YSZ and the NiO particles, respectively, which is good for the functionality of the resulting anode.",NiO/YSZ nanoparticles obtained by new sol-gel route,10.1016/j.cej.2008.02.006
