2,14194,Anode-supported cells were subjected to electrochemical oxidation by oxide ions and chemical reduction by H(2) gas.,Current density dependence of changes in the microstructure of SOFC anodes during electrochemical oxidation,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.08.003
3,14194,Two anodes were electrochemically oxidized by the same quantity of electricity of 15 C using different current densities of 25 mA/cm(2) and 250 mA/cm(2).,Current density dependence of changes in the microstructure of SOFC anodes during electrochemical oxidation,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.08.003
4,14194,"When Ni particles were oxidized at 25 mA/cm(2), little morphological change occurred in the Ni particles, resulting in only a small change in the microstructure of the anode.",Current density dependence of changes in the microstructure of SOFC anodes during electrochemical oxidation,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.08.003
5,14194,"On the other hand, when Ni particles were oxidized at 250 mA/cm(2), the morphology of the particles changed to a more textured outer surface and the Ni particle seemed to divide into smaller ones.",Current density dependence of changes in the microstructure of SOFC anodes during electrochemical oxidation,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.08.003
6,14194,"Neither cell showed a decrease in open circuit voltage nor cracks in the electrolyte, resulting in that the microstructure changes observed in the tested cells were caused by electrochemical oxidation and subsequent reduction (redox cycle).",Current density dependence of changes in the microstructure of SOFC anodes during electrochemical oxidation,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.08.003
7,14194,"Furthermore, this suggests that the differences in the resulting microstructures of the Ni particles were caused by the differences in current density during electrochemical oxidation.",Current density dependence of changes in the microstructure of SOFC anodes during electrochemical oxidation,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.08.003
