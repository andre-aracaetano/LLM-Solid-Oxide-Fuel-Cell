1,14252,Simulated and commercial low-sulfur diesel fuels (S < 10 ppm) were studied in autothermal reforming (ATR) on Rh and Pt and bimetallic RhPt catalysts supported on ZrO2 With the aim of obtaining fuel gas suitable for solid oxide fuel cell applications.,Autothermal reforming of simulated and commercial diesel: The performance of zirconia-supported RhPt catalyst in the presence of sulfur,10.1016/j.apcatb.2008.04.007
2,14252,"In ATR of the simulated fuels, the catalysts deactivated markedly in the presence of H2S, whereas in ATR of simulated fuels in the presence of 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) and in ATR of commercial diesel the catalyst deactivated only slightly over several hours.",Autothermal reforming of simulated and commercial diesel: The performance of zirconia-supported RhPt catalyst in the presence of sulfur,10.1016/j.apcatb.2008.04.007

4,14252,"In ATR of commercial low-sulfur diesel, carbon formation increased with the Pt loading, whereas sulfur deposition on the catalyst was strongest on the monometallic Rh/ZrO2.",Autothermal reforming of simulated and commercial diesel: The performance of zirconia-supported RhPt catalyst in the presence of sulfur,10.1016/j.apcatb.2008.04.007
5,14252,"Furthermore, less carbon was deposited on the RhPt catalyst in the presence than absence of H2S, as sulfur blocked the catalyst active sites.",Autothermal reforming of simulated and commercial diesel: The performance of zirconia-supported RhPt catalyst in the presence of sulfur,10.1016/j.apcatb.2008.04.007
