2,9359,"A composition of GDC(0.5)YSZ(0.5) was found to form a single phase by solid solution reaction, but had a very porous microstructure compared to GDC and YSZ.",Sintering Behavior and Electrochemical Properties of (Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95)x(Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92)1-x(x=0-1) Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jno.2015.1806
3,9359,"Moreover, its electrical conductivity was also at a minimum, the conductivity being notably higher in both GDC and YSZ.",Sintering Behavior and Electrochemical Properties of (Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95)x(Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92)1-x(x=0-1) Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jno.2015.1806
4,9359,"This decrease in conductivity in GDC(0.5)YSZ(0.5) is considered to be caused by the lattice distortion that is induced by the lattice parameter difference between GDC and YSZ in solid solution, as well as the formation of the defects that retard oxygen ion migration.",Sintering Behavior and Electrochemical Properties of (Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95)x(Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92)1-x(x=0-1) Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jno.2015.1806
