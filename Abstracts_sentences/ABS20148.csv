2,20148,"powders with pure perovskite structure have been synthesized from mixtures of La2O3, SrCO3, and Co3O4, irradiated in a domestic microwave oven (DMO) with 2.4.5 GHz and 700-800 W output for no more than 25 min.",A novel route of synthesizing La1-xSrxCoO3 by microwave irradiation,10.1016/S0167-577X(00)00299-8
3,20148,"It is found that Co3O4 couples with microwave well and raises its temperature greatly within 3 min, while neither La2O3 nor SrCO3 absorbs microwave energy at the ordinary temperature.",A novel route of synthesizing La1-xSrxCoO3 by microwave irradiation,10.1016/S0167-577X(00)00299-8

6,20148,it appears that the pure phases of LSC cannot be obtained until 1100-1200 degreesC for 4 h. The lower temperature and shorter time with microwave irradiation might be ascribed to the activating and facilitating effect of microwave on solid phase diffusion.,A novel route of synthesizing La1-xSrxCoO3 by microwave irradiation,10.1016/S0167-577X(00)00299-8
