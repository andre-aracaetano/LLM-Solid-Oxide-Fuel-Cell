3,20956,"During 48-h cycles that involved heating the samples up to temperatures of either 750 or 800 degrees C, the oxidation kinetics of both coated and unmodified steel approximately obeyed the parabolic rate law.",Physicochemical properties of Mn1.45Co1.45Cu0.1O4 spinel coating deposited on the Crofer 22 H ferritic steel and exposed to high-temperature oxidation under thermal cycling conditions,10.1007/s10973-021-10884-2
4,20956,The unmodified steel was oxidized at a higher rate than the system consisting of the substrate and the coating.,Physicochemical properties of Mn1.45Co1.45Cu0.1O4 spinel coating deposited on the Crofer 22 H ferritic steel and exposed to high-temperature oxidation under thermal cycling conditions,10.1007/s10973-021-10884-2
5,20956,"In its bulk form, the spinel consisted entirely of the cubic phase and it exhibited high electrical conductivity.",Physicochemical properties of Mn1.45Co1.45Cu0.1O4 spinel coating deposited on the Crofer 22 H ferritic steel and exposed to high-temperature oxidation under thermal cycling conditions,10.1007/s10973-021-10884-2
6,20956,"The Mn1.45Co1.45Cu0.1O4 coating, on the other hand, was compact and consisted of two phases-the cubic and the tetragonal one-and it was characterized by good adhesion to the metallic substrate.",Physicochemical properties of Mn1.45Co1.45Cu0.1O4 spinel coating deposited on the Crofer 22 H ferritic steel and exposed to high-temperature oxidation under thermal cycling conditions,10.1007/s10973-021-10884-2
7,20956,"After cyclic oxidation studies conducted for the two investigated temperatures (750 or 800 degrees C), the coating was determined to provide a considerable improvement in the electrical properties of the Crofer 22 H ferritic steel, as demonstrated by the area-specific resistance values measured for the steel/coating system.",Physicochemical properties of Mn1.45Co1.45Cu0.1O4 spinel coating deposited on the Crofer 22 H ferritic steel and exposed to high-temperature oxidation under thermal cycling conditions,10.1007/s10973-021-10884-2
8,20956,The evaporation rate of chromium measured for these samples likewise indicates that the coating is capable of acting as an effective barrier against the formation of volatile compounds of chromium.,Physicochemical properties of Mn1.45Co1.45Cu0.1O4 spinel coating deposited on the Crofer 22 H ferritic steel and exposed to high-temperature oxidation under thermal cycling conditions,10.1007/s10973-021-10884-2
