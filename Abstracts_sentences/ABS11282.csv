1,11282,"The chemical reactivity of La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 and ZrO2-Y2O3 was studied in the range 1200-1500 degrees C. Interfaces between porous La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 and dense ZrO2-Y2O3 pellets, similar to an actual SOFC cathode/electrolyte interface, were prepared and heated at different temperatures for a couple of days.",SOFC CATHODE/ELECTROLYTE INTERFACE .1. REACTIVITY BETWEEN LA0.85SR0.15MNO3 AND ZRO2-Y2O3,10.1016/0167-2738(94)00299-8
2,11282,The growth of a La2Zr2O7 layer at the interface was noticed in all samples.,SOFC CATHODE/ELECTROLYTE INTERFACE .1. REACTIVITY BETWEEN LA0.85SR0.15MNO3 AND ZRO2-Y2O3,10.1016/0167-2738(94)00299-8
3,11282,Tn the temperature range between 1300-1500 degrees C the growth constants of the reaction layers were found to be higher over the literature data obtained on diffusion couples consisting of dense pellets of La0.85Sr0.15MnO3 and ZrO2-8 mol% Y2O3 in intimate contact.,SOFC CATHODE/ELECTROLYTE INTERFACE .1.

4,11282,The electrical properties of La2Zr2O7 were recently investigated by impedance spectroscopy at various temperatures.,SOFC CATHODE/ELECTROLYTE INTERFACE .1. REACTIVITY BETWEEN LA0.85SR0.15MNO3 AND ZRO2-Y2O3,10.1016/0167-2738(94)00299-8
5,11282,The La2Zr2O7 conductivity at 1000 degrees C was found to be significantly lower in comparison with the yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte.,SOFC CATHODE/ELECTROLYTE INTERFACE .1. REACTIVITY BETWEEN LA0.85SR0.15MNO3 AND ZRO2-Y2O3,10.1016/0167-2738(94)00299-8
6,11282,The effects on SOFC fabrication and long term operation are briefly discussed.,SOFC CATHODE/ELECTROLYTE INTERFACE .1. REACTIVITY BETWEEN LA0.85SR0.15MNO3 AND ZRO2-Y2O3,10.1016/0167-2738(94)00299-8
