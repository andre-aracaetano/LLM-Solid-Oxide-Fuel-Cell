1,7031,In 1998 Siemens AG (SAG) took over the tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) technology from Westinghouse.,"SOFC Power Plants, the Siemens-Westinghouse Approach",
2,7031,"This merger placed SAG under the responsibility of Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation (SWPC), and gave them the opportunity to concentrate on this technology as the most promising fuel cell option for the emerging distributed power market.","SOFC Power Plants, the Siemens-Westinghouse Approach",
3,7031,"A first full scale 100 kW demonstration plant in a district heating cycle, without integrated micro gas turbines, accumulated more than 15000 hours and is still working.","SOFC Power Plants, the Siemens-Westinghouse Approach",
4,7031,All the expectations with respect to the design parameters and the operation behavior have been met or even exceeded.,"SOFC Power Plants, the Siemens-Westinghouse Approach",
5,7031,The first 220 kW all electric cycle demonstration plant with integrated micro gas turbine has successfully passed the factory tests.,"SOFC Power Plants, the Siemens-Westinghouse Approach",
6,7031,Additional field units are under contract which together with the above two pioneering demonstration plants will accumulate all the necessary learning experience to design a standardized SOFC product.,"SOFC Power Plants, the Siemens-Westinghouse Approach",
7,7031,"In addition to the demonstration program, a research and development (R&D) program is being pursued.","SOFC Power Plants, the Siemens-Westinghouse Approach",
8,7031,"The outcome of both programs, the demonstration as well as the R&D, is expected to close the gap between the current high cost and the market price in order to enable substantial market penetration.","SOFC Power Plants, the Siemens-Westinghouse Approach",
