1,9968,"Among standard high-temperature cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells, La0.8Sr0.2MnO3- (LSM) displays the least reactivity with the oxide-ion conductor La2Mo2O9 (LMO), yet a reaction is observed at high processing temperatures, identified by using XRD and focused ion beam secondary-ion mass spectrometry (FIB-SIMS) after annealing at 1050 and 1150 degrees C. Additionally, Sr and Mn solutions were deposited and annealed on LMO pellets, as well as a Mo solution on a LSM pellet.",Cationic Intermixing and Reactivity at the La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3- Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte-Cathode Interface,10.1002/cssc.201600516
2,9968,From these studies several reaction products were identified by using XRD and located by using FIB-SIMS on the surface of pelletised samples.,Cationic Intermixing and Reactivity at the La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3- Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte-Cathode Interface,10.1002/cssc.201600516
3,9968,We used depth profiling to show that the reactivity extended up to approximate to 10m from the surface region.,Cationic Intermixing and Reactivity at the La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3- Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte-Cathode Interface,10.1002/cssc.201600516
4,9968,"If Sr was present, a SrMoO4-type scheelite phase was always observed as a reaction product, and if Mn was present, LaMnO3+ single crystals were observed on the surface of the LMO pellets.",Cationic Intermixing and Reactivity at the La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3- Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte-Cathode Interface,10.1002/cssc.201600516
5,9968,Additional phases such as La2MoO6 and La6MoO12 were also detected depending on the configuration and annealing temperature.,Cationic Intermixing and Reactivity at the La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3- Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte-Cathode Interface,10.1002/cssc.201600516
6,9968,Reaction mechanisms and detailed reaction formulae are proposed to explain these observations.,Cationic Intermixing and Reactivity at the La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3- Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte-Cathode Interface,10.1002/cssc.201600516
7,9968,"The strongest driving force for cationic diffusion appears to originate from Mo6+ and Mn3+ cations, rather than from Sr2+.",Cationic Intermixing and Reactivity at the La2Mo2O9/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3- Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrolyte-Cathode Interface,10.1002/cssc.201600516
