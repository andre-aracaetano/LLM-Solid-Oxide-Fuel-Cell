4,20630,"ceramic is a poor conductor, whereas Na0.5Bi0.49Ti0.98Mg0.02O2.965 and Na0.5Bi0.49Ti0.96Mg0.04O2.945 ceramics are excellent oxide-ion conductors at 500 degrees C.",Associating High Oxide-Ion Conductivity and Conduction Mechanisms with Local Atomic Environments in Na0.5Bi0.5-xTi1-yMgyO3-δ,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c04995
5,20630,"While the Rietveld refinements of powder X-ray diffraction data using the monoclinic R3c space group and the rhombohedral Ric space group showed reasonably similar quality of fits, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data could be fitted only with the monoclinic Cc structure at room temperature for all three ceramics.",Associating High Oxide-Ion Conductivity and Conduction Mechanisms with Local Atomic Environments in Na0.5Bi0.5-xTi1-yMgyO3-δ,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c04995
