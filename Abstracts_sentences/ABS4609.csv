2,4609,"Then, Ce0.8Er0.2O2-alpha powder was mixed with melted NaCl-KCl (1:1 mol ratio) at the weight ratio of 80%: 20% to obtain Ce0.8Er0.2O2-alpha-KCl-NaCl at 750 degrees C. Ce0.8Er0.2O2-alpha and Ce0.8Er0.2O2-alpha-KCl-NaCl were characterized by thermogravimetry analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC), Raman spectrometer, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM).",Preparation and electrochemical characterization of Er3+-doped ceria-chloride composite electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.256
3,4609,The log (sigma T) similar to 1000 T-1 plots and fuel cell performances of Ce0.8Er0.2O2-alpha and Ce0.8Er0.2O2-alpha-KCl-NaCl were tested at 400-700 degrees C.,Preparation and electrochemical characterization of Er3+-doped ceria-chloride composite electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.256
4,4609,The maximum output power density of Ce0.8Er0.2O2-alpha-KCl-NaCl was 187 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C which is six times greater than that of Ce0.8Er0.2O2-alpha.,Preparation and electrochemical characterization of Er3+-doped ceria-chloride composite electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.256
