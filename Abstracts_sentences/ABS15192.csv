3,15192,"The variation of the flow properties of both composite seals was measured using a wettability test, and an increase of the contact angle was observed when the volume fraction of additives was increased.",Comparison between micrometer- and nano-scale glass composites for sealing solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00804.x
4,15192,"The major factor found to decrease spreading of the glass composite was the additive particle size, where shape retention was observed for the nanometer (nm)-YSZ composites while spreading of the micrometer (pm)YSZ composites was observed under the same testing conditions.",Comparison between micrometer- and nano-scale glass composites for sealing solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00804.x

6,15192,"Long-time exposure at 800 degrees C caused a large reduction in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), which can be explained by increased formation of BaZrO3 and further change in glass composition.",Comparison between micrometer- and nano-scale glass composites for sealing solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00804.x
7,15192,"This change in CTE occurs rapidly for the nm-YSZ composites, which is not observed for the mu m-YSZ composites.",Comparison between micrometer- and nano-scale glass composites for sealing solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00804.x
