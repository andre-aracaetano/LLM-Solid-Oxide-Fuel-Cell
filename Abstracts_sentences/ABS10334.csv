3,10334,"In this study, freeze casting was used to fabricate tubular, anode-supported SOFCs with aligned and varying amounts of porosity by controlling the solids/water ratio in different casting slurries.",Controlling Porosity of Anode Support in Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Freeze Casting,10.1115/1.4046489
4,10334,"SOFCs were prepared with a Ni/yttria and scandia stabilized zirconia (ScYSZ) anode support (AS), an anode functional layer (AFL), a ScYSZ electrolyte, a lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM)/ScYSZ cathode interlayer (CIL), and an LSM cathode.",Controlling Porosity of Anode Support in Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Freeze Casting,10.1115/1.4046489
5,10334,"The permeability of the anode support was found to increase from 1.4 x 10(-2)to 1.8 x 10(-2)m(2)as porosity was increased from 57 to 64 vol%, while the total cell resistance decreased by 35% from 0.93 to 0.60 Ohm cm(2).",Controlling Porosity of Anode Support in Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Freeze Casting,10.1115/1.4046489
6,10334,"When evaluated with 30 vol% H(2)as the fuel at 800 degrees C, the decrease of concentration polarization enabled an increase in electrochemical performance by 42% from 0.35 to 0.50 W/cm(2)as the porosity in the anode support was increased.",Controlling Porosity of Anode Support in Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Freeze Casting,10.1115/1.4046489
