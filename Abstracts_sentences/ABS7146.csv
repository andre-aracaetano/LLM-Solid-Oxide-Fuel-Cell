1,7146,"The width of the electrochemically active zone in a mixed conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode, i.e. the spatial extension of the three-phase-boundary (3PB) region is numerically calculated for the case when oxide ion transport through the electrode bulk determines the reaction rate of the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction.",On the width of the electrochemically active region in mixed conducting solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)00944-2
2,7146,The current density distribution in the cathode exhibits a sharp maximum at the 3PB and a major fraction of the total current flows in narrow zones with a width of a few percent of the electrode particle size (e.g. in the case of 1.6 mum particle size: approximately 2/3 of the current flows in a zone with a width of 60 nm).,On the width of the electrochemically active region in mixed conducting solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/S0378-7753(01)00944-2
