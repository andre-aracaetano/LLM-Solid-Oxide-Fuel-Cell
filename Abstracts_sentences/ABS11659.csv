1,11659,"The formation of cermet materials via the addition of electrolyte ceramic to metal-based electrodes has become widely adopted in solid oxide fuel cell fabrication due to its benefits in maximizing triple-phase boundary densities, whilst mitigating bulk thermal expansion mismatch between electrode and electrolyte layers.",Understanding the thermo-mechanical behaviour of solid oxide fuel cell anodes using synchrotron X-ray diffraction,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.10.025
2,11659,"This work improves thermo-mechanical understanding via examination of nickel-based anode materials using synchrotron X-ray diffraction; two cermet materials are studied: Ni-YSZ and Ni-GDC, with comparison to a ceramic free Ni sample.",Understanding the thermo-mechanical behaviour of solid oxide fuel cell anodes using synchrotron X-ray diffraction,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.10.025
3,11659,"Findings conclude that although the ceramic addition has minor effects on the cubic Ni structure within isothermal environments, stress induced by the different thermal properties within the cermet materials results in a shifted Ni thermal expansion peak on passing the Curie point.",Understanding the thermo-mechanical behaviour of solid oxide fuel cell anodes using synchrotron X-ray diffraction,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.10.025
4,11659,"Moreover, extended cycling of the Ni-YSZ sample suggests that low-temperature operation (ca.",Understanding the thermo-mechanical behaviour of solid oxide fuel cell anodes using synchrotron X-ray diffraction,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.10.025
