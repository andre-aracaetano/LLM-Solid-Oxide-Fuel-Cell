1,12439,A low leakage rate sealant of 10 wt% ZrO2-added CaO-K2O-Na2O-BaO silicate glass for SOFC has been studied.,High gas tightness ZrO2-added silicate glass sealant with low thermal stress for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.088
2,12439,"The structure of the sealant is stable at high temperatures with leakage rates less than 10(-4) sccm.cm(-1), and no crystal except for ZrO2 is found in XRD analysis after heating at 800 degrees C for 100 h. ZrO2 is distributed in the glass matrix and plays a supporting role in avoiding over-softening at operating temperature.",High gas tightness ZrO2-added silicate glass sealant with low thermal stress for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.088
3,12439,Good compatibility in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres between the sealant and SUS430 interconnect was proved by SEM at 750 degrees C for 100 h. A fully coupled 3D Multiphysics button SOFC is constructed for mechanical analyses.,High gas tightness ZrO2-added silicate glass sealant with low thermal stress for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.088
4,12439,The results show that the increase of ZrO2 in the sealant will decrease the stress and displacement in the SOFC.,High gas tightness ZrO2-added silicate glass sealant with low thermal stress for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.088
5,12439,"Besides, the width of the sealant also affects the stress value and distribution.",High gas tightness ZrO2-added silicate glass sealant with low thermal stress for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.088
6,12439,The results show that GZ10 is a competitive sealing material compared with other ZrO2-added sealants.,High gas tightness ZrO2-added silicate glass sealant with low thermal stress for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.088
