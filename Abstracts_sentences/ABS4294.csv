1,4294,Y0.8Ca0.2BaCo4O7 (+) (delta) (YCBC4) was synthesized and investigated as a cathode for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,A promising cathode for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells: Y0.8Ca0.2BaCo4O7 + δ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.090
2,4294,Low thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) (similar to 9.9 x 10(-6) K-1) can provide good thermal expansion compatibility with the standard SOFC electrolyte materials.,A promising cathode for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells: Y0.8Ca0.2BaCo4O7 + δ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.090
3,4294,"Laboratory-sized quad-layer cells, consisting of NiO-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY)/NiO-BZCY/BZCY/YCBC4, were fabricated by a one-step dry-pressing/co-firing process and tested from 550 to 700 degrees C with humidified hydrogen (similar to 3% H2O) as the fuel and static air as the oxidant, respectively.",A promising cathode for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells: Y0.8Ca0.2BaCo4O7 + δ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.090
4,4294,An excellent power density of 472 mW cm(-2) and a low electrode polarization resistance of 0.121 Omega cm(2) were obtained at 700 degrees C. Preliminary results demonstrated that the YCBC4 can be a promising cathode material for proton-conducting IT-SOFCs.,A promising cathode for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells: Y0.8Ca0.2BaCo4O7 + δ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.090
