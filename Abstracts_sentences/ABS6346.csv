1,6346,One of the major problems arising with Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) electrolyte is conventional sintering which requires a very high temperature (> 1300 degrees C) to fully densify the electrolyte material.,Record-low sintering-temperature (600 °C) of solid-oxide fuel cell electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.02.184
2,6346,"In the present study, the sintering temperature of SOFC electrolyte is drastically decreased down to 600 degrees C. Combinational effects of particle size reduction, liquid-phase sintering mechanism and microwave sintering resulted in achieving full density in such a record-low sintering temperature.",Record-low sintering-temperature (600 °C) of solid-oxide fuel cell electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.02.184
3,6346,"Gadolinium doped Ceria (GDC) nano-particles are synthesized by co-precipitation method, Lithium (Li), as an additional dopant, is used as liquid-phase sintering aid.",Record-low sintering-temperature (600 °C) of solid-oxide fuel cell electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.02.184
4,6346,Microwave sintering of this electrolyte material resulted in decreasing the sintering temperature to 600 degrees C. Micrographs obtained from Scanning/Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM/TEM) clearly pointed a drastic growth in grain-size of Li-GDC sample (similar to 150 nm) than compared to GDC sample (< 30 nm) showing the significance of Li addition.,Record-low sintering-temperature (600 °C) of solid-oxide fuel cell electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.02.184
5,6346,The sintered Li-GDC samples displayed an ionic conductivity of similar to 1.00 x 10(-2),Record-low sintering-temperature (600 °C) of solid-oxide fuel cell electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.02.184
6,6346,S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C in air and from the conductivity plots the activation energy is found to be 0.53 eV. (C) 2016,Record-low sintering-temperature (600 °C) of solid-oxide fuel cell electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.02.184
