7,11966,"However, under steam reforming conditions with CH4/H(2)0 mixtures the behaviour of the Au-doped Ni-GDC anodes were far superior, exhibiting retention of good power density and dramatically improved resistance to deactivation by carbon deposition.",Microstructural engineering and use of efficient poison resistant Au-doped Ni-GDC ultrathin anodes in methane-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.020
8,11966,"Thus two distinct beneficial effects contributed to overall performance: persistence of Ce3+ in the working anodes could induce a strong metal-support interaction with Ni that enhanced the catalytic oxidation of methane, while formation of a Ni Au surface alloy that inhibited carbonisation and poisoning of the active nickel surface.",Microstructural engineering and use of efficient poison resistant Au-doped Ni-GDC ultrathin anodes in methane-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.020
