1,9350,A novel single phase BaCe0.5Bi0.5O3 (- delta) (BCB) was employed as a cathode material for a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,A novel single phase cathode material for a proton-conducting SOFC,10.1016/j.elecom.2009.01.012
2,9350,"The single cell, consisting of a BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3 - delta (BZCY7)-NiO anode substrate, a BZCY7 anode functional layer, a BZCY7 electrolyte membrane and a BCB cathode layer, was assembled and tested from 600 to 700 degrees C with humidified hydrogen (similar to 3% H2O) as the fuel and the static ir as the oxidant.",A novel single phase cathode material for a proton-conducting SOFC,10.1016/j.elecom.2009.01.012
