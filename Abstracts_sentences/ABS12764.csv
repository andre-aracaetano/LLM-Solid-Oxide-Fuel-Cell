1,12764,"By assigning target values (0.15 Omega cm(2)) for the performance of the individual components in a single SOFC cell it has been possible to propose a very simple model which relates experimentally accessible parameters, such as, oxygen surface exchange coefficients (k cm .",Survey of materials selection for ceramic fuel cells .2.

4,12764,"Characteristic lengths including a collection length (l(c)), and a maximum length (l(t)) for bulk diffusion of oxygen ions, have been defined and calculated for La0.8Sr0.2O3+x, La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x, Sm0.6Ca0.4CoO3-x. These characteristic lengths have been used to interpret the reported behaviour of the oxide electrocalalysts and to suggest modifications which could improve their performance.",Survey of materials selection for ceramic fuel cells .2.

5,12764,"Although a similar model has not yet been developed to interpret the behaviour of anodes, appropriate comments have been made about the selection and optimisation of anodes for intermediate temperature (500-750 degrees C) SOFC operation.",Survey of materials selection for ceramic fuel cells .2.
