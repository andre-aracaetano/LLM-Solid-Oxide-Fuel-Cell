1,16033,"The auto-thermal reforming (ATR) performance of diesel blended with biodiesel (e.g., B5, B10, B20, B40, and B80) was investigated and compared to pure diesel and biodiesel ATR in a single-tube reformer with ceramic monolith wash-coated rhodium/ceria-zirconia catalyst.",Bio-fuel reformation for solid oxide fuel cell applications. Part 3: Biodiesel-diesel blends,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.093
2,16033,"The initial operating condition of the ATR of all studied fuels was set as total moles of oxygen from air, water, and fuel per mole of carbon (O/C) = 1.47, moles of water to carbon (H2O/C) = 0.6, and gas hourly space velocity = 33,950 h(-1) at 1223 K reformer temperature, to achieve the same syngas (H-2 + CO) production rate.",Bio-fuel reformation for solid oxide fuel cell applications. Part 3: Biodiesel-diesel blends,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.093
3,16033,A direct photo-acoustic micro-soot meter was applied to quantify the dynamic evolution of carbon formation and a mass spectrometer was used to measure the gas composition of reformer effluents.,Bio-fuel reformation for solid oxide fuel cell applications.

4,16033,"The blends with more biodiesel content were found to have a lower syngas production rate and reforming efficiency, and require more air and higher reformer temperature to avoid carbon formation.",Bio-fuel reformation for solid oxide fuel cell applications. Part 3: Biodiesel-diesel blends,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.093
5,16033,"Strong correlations between ethylene and solid carbon concentration were observed in the reformation of all the fuels and blends, with more biodiesel content tending to have higher ethylene production.",Bio-fuel reformation for solid oxide fuel cell applications.
