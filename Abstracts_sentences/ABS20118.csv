1,20118,The phase diagram of LaFeO3 (010) surfaces is developed by ab initio thermodynamics.,Stoichiometry of the LaFeO3 (010) surface determined from first-principles and thermodynamic calculations,10.1103/PhysRevB.83.115418
2,20118,"The stabilities of LaO- and FeO2-terminated surfaces are investigated at temperatures representative of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating conditions [773, 1073, and 1223 K at p(O-2) approximate to 0.21 atm].",Stoichiometry of the LaFeO3 (010) surface determined from first-principles and thermodynamic calculations,10.1103/PhysRevB.83.115418
3,20118,"For LaO-type surfaces, it is predicted that the most stable surface structure is oxidized at all temperatures considered.",Stoichiometry of the LaFeO3 (010) surface determined from first-principles and thermodynamic calculations,10.1103/PhysRevB.83.115418
4,20118,"For FeO2-type surfaces, the most stable surface structure is predicted to change from oxidized (at 773 K) to stoichiometric (at 1073 and 1223 K).",Stoichiometry of the LaFeO3 (010) surface determined from first-principles and thermodynamic calculations,10.1103/PhysRevB.83.115418
5,20118,"Even though both LaO and FeO2 surfaces can be oxidized under SOFC operating conditions, the degree of oxidation is much greater for the LaO surface.",Stoichiometry of the LaFeO3 (010) surface determined from first-principles and thermodynamic calculations,10.1103/PhysRevB.83.115418
6,20118,"In addition, as reduced surfaces are predicted to be significantly more unstable than stoichiometric and oxidized terminations at these temperatures and oxygen partial pressures, surface oxygen vacancies are not predicted to form on either the LaO or the FeO2 terminations.",Stoichiometry of the LaFeO3 (010) surface determined from first-principles and thermodynamic calculations,10.1103/PhysRevB.83.115418
7,20118,"Moreover, at high temperatures [above similar to 1500 K at p(O-2) = 0.21 atm], only FeO2-type surfaces are predicted to be stable.",Stoichiometry of the LaFeO3 (010) surface determined from first-principles and thermodynamic calculations,10.1103/PhysRevB.83.115418
8,20118,"Importantly, the calculated transition temperatures where surface oxygen stoichiometries are predicted to change are in good agreement with the results of temperature-programmed desorption experiments.",Stoichiometry of the LaFeO3 (010) surface determined from first-principles and thermodynamic calculations,10.1103/PhysRevB.83.115418
