2,1883,"Dense BZCY electrolyte membranes were achieved when the co-sintering temperature was as low as 1300 degrees C, and a good adherence of anode to electrolyte membrane was obtained when the co-sintering temperature was up to 1350 degrees C. Meanwhile, perovskite oxide La0.6Ba0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-delta (LBFN) was synthesized and the LBFN-BZCY composite material was employed as a novel cobalt-free cathode, the single cell with a 17-mu m-thick BZCY electrolyte generated a maximum power density of 232 mW cm(-2) at 650 degrees C.
