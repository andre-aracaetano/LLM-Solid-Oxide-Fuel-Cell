1,13572,"Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes, both commercial and research, are used at 800-900 degrees C as solid oxide H2O electrolyzer cells (SOECs).",Electronic Conduction of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte in Solid Oxide Cells Operated in High Temperature Water Electrolysis,10.1149/1.3138701
2,13572,"When the operation is extended to current densities j corresponding to a steam-conversion rate above 100%, or when the steam supply is interrupted under constant current conditions, cell voltages saturate at similar to 1.9 V at 810 degrees C. A cell survives 64 h polarization at j=-0.34 A cm(-2) without any steam supply.",Electronic Conduction of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte in Solid Oxide Cells Operated in High Temperature Water Electrolysis,10.1149/1.3138701
3,13572,The mechanism limiting the cell voltage is attributed to electronic conduction in the YSZ electrolyte.,Electronic Conduction of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte in Solid Oxide Cells Operated in High Temperature Water Electrolysis,10.1149/1.3138701
4,13572,No indications are found for electrolyte decomposition.,Electronic Conduction of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte in Solid Oxide Cells Operated in High Temperature Water Electrolysis,10.1149/1.3138701
5,13572,"Because the saturation voltage exceeds typical operation voltages by several hundred millivolts, electrolyte conduction in the normal SOEC mode remains predominantly ionic.",Electronic Conduction of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte in Solid Oxide Cells Operated in High Temperature Water Electrolysis,10.1149/1.3138701
6,13572,The rise in the cell voltage to the value determined by electronic conduction occurs when steam transport in the hydrogen/steam electrode becomes limiting.,Electronic Conduction of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte in Solid Oxide Cells Operated in High Temperature Water Electrolysis,10.1149/1.3138701
7,13572,"As a consequence of H2O back-diffusion from the cell exhaust in the used unsealed test configuration, the rise occurs at nonzero current density under zero steam supply.",Electronic Conduction of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte in Solid Oxide Cells Operated in High Temperature Water Electrolysis,10.1149/1.3138701
8,13572,Impedance spectroscopic data are compared with and without steam supply and are qualitatively interpreted with an equivalent circuit model.,Electronic Conduction of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte in Solid Oxide Cells Operated in High Temperature Water Electrolysis,10.1149/1.3138701
