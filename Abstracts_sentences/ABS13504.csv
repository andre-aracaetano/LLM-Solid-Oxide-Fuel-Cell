1,13504,"The reversibility of redox-induced phase transformations and accompanying electrical conductivity and dimensional changes in perovskite-type SrVO3-delta, a parent material for a family of potential solid oxide fuel cell anode materials, were evaluated employing X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, dilatometry and electrical measurements.",Redox transitions in strontium vanadates: Electrical conductivity and dimensional changes,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.02.148
2,13504,"At 873-1273 K, the electrical conductivity of SrVO3-delta is metallic-like and 6-8 orders of magnitude higher compared to semiconducting V5+-based strontium pyrovanadate Sr2V2O7 and strontium orthovanadate Sr3V2O8 existing under oxidizing conditions.",Redox transitions in strontium vanadates: Electrical conductivity and dimensional changes,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.02.148

6,13504,"As Sr3V2O8 is relatively stable even under reducing conditions, the perovskite phase and its high level of electrical conductivity cannot be recovered completely in a reasonable time span at temperatures <= 1273 K. Dilatometric studies confirmed that SrVO3 <-> Sr2V2O7 redox transformation is accompanied with significant dimensional changes.",Redox transitions in strontium vanadates: Electrical conductivity and dimensional changes,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.02.148
