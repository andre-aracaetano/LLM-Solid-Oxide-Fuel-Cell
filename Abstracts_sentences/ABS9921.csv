2,9921,"The effects of SDC content on the performance and properties of the electrodes, including thermal expansion, DC conductivity, oxygen desorption, area specific resistance (ASR) and cathodic overpotential are evaluated.",Assessment of PrBaCo2O5+δ + Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composites prepared by physical mixing as electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.018
3,9921,The thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity of the electrode decreases with an increase in SDC content.,Assessment of PrBaCo2O5+δ + Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composites prepared by physical mixing as electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.018
4,9921,"However, the electrical conductivity of a composite electrode containing 50 wt% SDC reaches 150S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C. Among the various electrodes under investigation, an electrode containing 30 wt% SDC exhibits superior electrochemical performance.",Assessment of PrBaCo2O5+δ + Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composites prepared by physical mixing as electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.018
5,9921,"A peak power density of approximately 1150 and 573 mW cm(-2) is reached at 650 and 550 degrees C, respectively, for an anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte cell with the optimal composite electrode.",Assessment of PrBaCo2O5+δ + Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composites prepared by physical mixing as electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.018
6,9921,"The improved performance of a composite electrode containing 70 wt% PrBC and 30 wt% SDC is attributed to a reduction in the diffusion path of oxygen-ions within the electrode, which is a result of a three-dimensional oxygen-ion diffusion path in SDC and a one-dimensional diffusion path in PrBC.",Assessment of PrBaCo2O5+δ + Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composites prepared by physical mixing as electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.05.018
