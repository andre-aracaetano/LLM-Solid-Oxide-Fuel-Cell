1,2064,"A single-step infiltration method has been developed to incorporate the La0.85Sr0.15MnO3-delta (LSM) oxide phase into a pre-sintered, porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) network, forming an effective LSM-YSZ composite cathode.",LSM-infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1149/1.2206011
2,2064,"The LSM particles, with a size of similar to 30 to similar to 100 nm, deposit preferentially on the pore walls throughout the porous YSZ, forming a pathway for electron conduction, and creating a high density of active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction.",LSM-infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1149/1.2206011
3,2064,"The resulting composite cathode has been evaluated in a solid oxide fuel cell operating at 923 K, and demonstrated the effectiveness of the infiltration process.",LSM-infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1149/1.2206011
4,2064,"The single-step infiltration method enables the possibility of producing solid oxide fuel cell cathodes, based on pre-sintered porous YSZ networks, with other catalysts that are not compatible with the high temperature processing that co-firing may require.",LSM-infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1149/1.2206011
