1,21075,Waste-to-energy (WTE) conversion technologies for generating renewable energy and solving the environmental problems have an important role in the development of sustainable circular economy.,Process simulation development of a clean waste-to-energy conversion power plant: Thermodynamic and environmental assessment,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128156
2,21075,"This paper presents a novel high-efficiency WTE power plant using refuse-derived fuel (RDF) as feedstock by integrating torrefaction (T) pretreatment with plasma gasifier (PG), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and combined heat and power (CHP) system.",Process simulation development of a clean waste-to-energy conversion power plant: Thermodynamic and environmental assessment,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128156
3,21075,The combined impacts of torrefaction conditions (i.e. temperature and residence time) and steam-to-fuel (S/F) ratio on the energy and environmental performances of the proposed T-PG-SOFC-CHP power plant without CO2 capture (System I) is first evaluated.,Process simulation development of a clean waste-to-energy conversion power plant: Thermodynamic and environmental assessment,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128156
4,21075,Results show that torrefaction of RDF prior to plasma gasification provides better syngas quality and therefore the system electrical efficiency (SEE) and CHP efficiency (CHPE) of System I can be markedly boosted compared to that of untreated RDF.,Process simulation development of a clean waste-to-energy conversion power plant: Thermodynamic and environmental assessment,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128156
5,21075,"However, the integration of torrefaction unit shows a negative effect on the energy return on investment (EROI) due to high energy demands for torrefaction and plasma gasification.",Process simulation development of a clean waste-to-energy conversion power plant: Thermodynamic and environmental assessment,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128156
6,21075,"Overall, the values of CHPE of System I range from 47.25% to 55.39% when the torrefaction temperatures of 200 and 250 degrees C are adopted.",Process simulation development of a clean waste-to-energy conversion power plant: Thermodynamic and environmental assessment,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128156
7,21075,"In contrast, the torrefaction of RDF at 300 degrees C is not a recommended condition for operation in the T-PG-SOFC-CHP power plant because of noticeably negative energy and environmental impacts.",Process simulation development of a clean waste-to-energy conversion power plant: Thermodynamic and environmental assessment,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128156
8,21075,"Moreover, to prevent the risk of carbon deposition on the SOFC anode, a recirculation ratio (RR) of the anode off-gas of 30% is required.",Process simulation development of a clean waste-to-energy conversion power plant: Thermodynamic and environmental assessment,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128156
9,21075,"Finally, the introduction of oxy-fuel combustion technology into the T-PG-SOFC-CHP system for CO2 capture (System II) allows to achieve a zero direct CO2 emission WTE power plant.",Process simulation development of a clean waste-to-energy conversion power plant: Thermodynamic and environmental assessment,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128156
10,21075,"However, this results in an energy penalty of about 5.40-6.77% associated with the CO2 capture and compression process.",Process simulation development of a clean waste-to-energy conversion power plant: Thermodynamic and environmental assessment,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128156
