1,11980,Composite materials of YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) with various Ni-Fe alloys were synthesized and evaluated as the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode using a 200-mu m thick YSZ electrolyte as support and YSZ+ La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) as cathode.,Fe alloying effect on the performance of the Ni anode in hydrogen fuel,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.011
2,11980,"The single cell with the YSZ+Ni0.75Fe0.25 anode exhibited the highest performance among all the investigated cells, e.g. a peak power density of 403, 337,218 and 112 mW/cm(2) was achieved with H-2 fuel at 900, 850, 800 and 750 degrees C, respectively.",Fe alloying effect on the performance of the Ni anode in hydrogen fuel,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.011
3,11980,"The composite anode with the Ni0.75Fe0.25 alloy also had the lowest polarization resistance of 0.55 Omega.cm(2) at 800 degrees C among all the alloy compositions, indicating that this specific alloy offered a better anode composition than pure Ni.",Fe alloying effect on the performance of the Ni anode in hydrogen fuel,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.011
4,11980,The possible mechanism for the improved performance of Ni with the Fe alloying addition towards H-2 oxidation was discussed.,Fe alloying effect on the performance of the Ni anode in hydrogen fuel,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.12.011
