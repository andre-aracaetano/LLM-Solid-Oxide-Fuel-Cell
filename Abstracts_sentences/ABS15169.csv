1,15169,A synthesis and characterization of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes of nickel with 8%mol yttriurn stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) is presented.,In situ X-ray Rietveld analysis of Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes during NiO reduction in H2,10.1088/0022-3727/38/13/029
2,15169,Attention was focused on the kinetics and phase composition associated with the transformation of NiO-YSZ to Ni-YSZ.,In situ X-ray Rietveld analysis of Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes during NiO reduction in H2,10.1088/0022-3727/38/13/029
3,15169,The anodes were prepared with an alternative synthesis method that includes the use of nickel acetylacetonate as an inorganic precursor to obtain a highly porous material after sintering at 1400 degrees C and oxide reduction (NiO-YSZ -> Ni-YSZ) at 800 degrees C for 8 h in a tubular reactor furnace using 10% H-2/N-2.,In situ X-ray Rietveld analysis of Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes during NiO reduction in H2,10.1088/0022-3727/38/13/029
4,15169,The obtained material was compressed by unidirectional axial pressing into 1 cm-diameter discs with 15-66 wt% Ni and calcinated from room temperature to 800 degrees C. A heating rate of 1 degrees C min(-1) showed the best results to avoid any anode cracking.,In situ X-ray Rietveld analysis of Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes during NiO reduction in H2,10.1088/0022-3727/38/13/029
5,15169,"Their structural and chemical characterization during the isothermal reduction were carried out by in situ time-resolved X-ray diffraction, refined with the Rietveld method (which allowed knowing the kinetic process of the reduction), scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy.",In situ X-ray Rietveld analysis of Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes during NiO reduction in H2,10.1088/0022-3727/38/13/029
6,15169,"The results showed the formation of tetragonal YSZ 8%mol in the presence of nickel, a decrement in the unit cell volume of Ni and an increment of Ni in the Ni-YSZ anodes during the temperature reduction.",In situ X-ray Rietveld analysis of Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes during NiO reduction in H2,10.1088/0022-3727/38/13/029
7,15169,The analysis indicated that the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation is unable to provide a good fit to the kinetics of the phase transformation.,In situ X-ray Rietveld analysis of Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes during NiO reduction in H2,10.1088/0022-3727/38/13/029
8,15169,"Instead, an alternative equation is presented.",In situ X-ray Rietveld analysis of Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anodes during NiO reduction in H2,10.1088/0022-3727/38/13/029
