1,6108,"In this study, a system-level zero-dimensional model for planar solid oxide fuel cell- gas turbine (SOFC/GT) hybrid system has been studied to investigate the effect of diverse operating conditions such as operating pressure, air utilization factor (U-a), and fuel utilization factor (U-1) on the performance of a selected hybrid system.",Performance assessment of an electrolyte-supported and anode- supported planar solid oxide fuel cells hybrid system,
2,6108,"Moreover, the system's power production and performance were discussed in two various configurations: anode-supported model (ASM) and electrolyte-supported model (ESM).",Performance assessment of an electrolyte-supported and anode- supported planar solid oxide fuel cells hybrid system,
3,6108,This study's models were implemented in Matlab' to calculate the optimum operating parameters and determine the hybrid system's performance characteristics.,Performance assessment of an electrolyte-supported and anode- supported planar solid oxide fuel cells hybrid system,
4,6108,"According to the finding, a maximum of 717.8 kW power is produced at 7.7 bar pressure for the ASM.",Performance assessment of an electrolyte-supported and anode- supported planar solid oxide fuel cells hybrid system,
