1,7932,"In this study, the chemical states of a powder type and an impregnated type of the La0.4Sr0.6Ti0.8Mn0.2O3 +/- d (LSTM) oxide system were investigated along with its electrical conductivities in order to apply these materials as alternative anode materials for high temperature-operating Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (HT-SOFCs).",X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study of impregnated La0.4Sr0.6Ti0.8Mn0.2O3 ± d anode material for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115175
2,7932,"The Ni/8YSZ samples with LSTM impregnated into the pores created by partially removing nickel, Ni/8YSZ (Ni (R)/8YSZ), showed much higher electrical conductivity values than those of unimpregnated Ni/8YSZ (Ni (E)/8YSZ) samples under dry H-2 fuel condition.",X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study of impregnated La0.4Sr0.6Ti0.8Mn0.2O3 ± d anode material for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115175
3,7932,Reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ was observed when LSTM was reduced.,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study of impregnated La0.4Sr0.6Ti0.8Mn0.2O3 ± d anode material for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115175
4,7932,Additional reduction properties of Mn2+ from Mn3+ and satellite peaks were found when impregnated LSTM was coated onto a Ni/8YSZ substrate.,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study of impregnated La0.4Sr0.6Ti0.8Mn0.2O3 ± d anode material for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115175
5,7932,The reduction of the charge state of Ti contained in LSTM showed the same behavior as the reduction property of Mn.,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study of impregnated La0.4Sr0.6Ti0.8Mn0.2O3 ± d anode material for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115175
6,7932,"However, a satellite peak identified as metal Ti was only observed when impregnated LSTM was coated on a selectively Ni-removed Ni/8YSZ (Ni (R)/8YSZ) substrate.",X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study of impregnated La0.4Sr0.6Ti0.8Mn0.2O3 ± d anode material for high temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115175
