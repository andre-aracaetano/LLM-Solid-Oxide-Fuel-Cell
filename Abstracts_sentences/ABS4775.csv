1,4775,Symmetric solid oxide fuel cells have gained increasingly attention due to their charac-teristics of simple fabrication and low cost.,"Different alkaline earth metals doped Sm0.5A0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ (A=Ca, Sr and Ba) for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.12.117
2,4775,"Due to the same anode and cathode used, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) of the electrodes are very demanding.","Different alkaline earth metals doped Sm0.5A0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ (A=Ca, Sr and Ba) for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.12.117
3,4775,"In this work, Sm-0.5 x 0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-delta (X = Ca, Sr, Ba, SCFN, SSFN, SBFN) were synthesized, and the physico-chemical properties of three materials and their elec-trochemical performance as electrodes were systematically studied.","Different alkaline earth metals doped Sm0.5A0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ (A=Ca, Sr and Ba) for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.12.117
4,4775,They all maintain stable phase structures under oxidizing and reducing atmospheres below 750 degrees C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that metal nanoparticles was exsolved and oxygen vacancies were increased after the treatment in reducing atmosphere at 750 degrees C.,"Different alkaline earth metals doped Sm0.5A0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ (A=Ca, Sr and Ba) for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.12.117
5,4775,"For electrochemical performance test, the peak power densities of symmetrical cells with SCFN-GDC, SSFN-GDC and SBFN-GDC electrodes can reach 26.7, 186.78, and 138.8 mWcm(-2) at 750 degrees C, respectively.","Different alkaline earth metals doped Sm0.5A0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ (A=Ca, Sr and Ba) for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.12.117
6,4775,"Moreover, SSFN-GDC cell showed better long-term sta-bility than the other two.","Different alkaline earth metals doped Sm0.5A0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ (A=Ca, Sr and Ba) for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.12.117
