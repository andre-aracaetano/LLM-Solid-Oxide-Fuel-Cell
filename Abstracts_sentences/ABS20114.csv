1,20114,Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy.,OPTIMIZATION OF OPERATING CONDITIONS IN A LABORATORY SOFC TESTING DEVICE,10.17222/mit.2014.209
2,20114,"They are assembled from three solid components, which, in principle, differ in their thermal expansion coefficients.",OPTIMIZATION OF OPERATING CONDITIONS IN A LABORATORY SOFC TESTING DEVICE,10.17222/mit.2014.209
3,20114,These differences may cause residual stresses during an operation and consequently lead to physical damage of a cell.,OPTIMIZATION OF OPERATING CONDITIONS IN A LABORATORY SOFC TESTING DEVICE,10.17222/mit.2014.209
4,20114,"From this perspective, the reliability of an operating SOFC is seriously dependent on the thermal stress built inside the multi-layer structure.",OPTIMIZATION OF OPERATING CONDITIONS IN A LABORATORY SOFC TESTING DEVICE,10.17222/mit.2014.209
5,20114,"In this work, some operating conditions in the SOFCs based on an SDC electrolyte, an LSM cathode and a Ni-SDC anode were investigated both experimentally and theoretically.",OPTIMIZATION OF OPERATING CONDITIONS IN A LABORATORY SOFC TESTING DEVICE,10.17222/mit.2014.209
6,20114,"Within the theoretical analysis, the residual stresses and temperature profiles inside an operating cell were modelled with the finite-element method.",OPTIMIZATION OF OPERATING CONDITIONS IN A LABORATORY SOFC TESTING DEVICE,10.17222/mit.2014.209
7,20114,"The results of the mathematical modelling of the warm-up, steady-state or cool-down periods were used to optimize the cell geometry and the thickness of individual cell layers, and to determine the most appropriate operating cell conditions.",OPTIMIZATION OF OPERATING CONDITIONS IN A LABORATORY SOFC TESTING DEVICE,10.17222/mit.2014.209
8,20114,"In order to experimentally confirm some theoretical calculations, a new SOFC testing system was developed, which enabled relatively easy assembling and dismantling as well as quick changes in the operating conditions (temperature, atmospheres).",OPTIMIZATION OF OPERATING CONDITIONS IN A LABORATORY SOFC TESTING DEVICE,10.17222/mit.2014.209
9,20114,"Based on the modelling results, optimization of the operating conditions was proposed in order to reduce the thermal stresses built in the materials.",OPTIMIZATION OF OPERATING CONDITIONS IN A LABORATORY SOFC TESTING DEVICE,10.17222/mit.2014.209
