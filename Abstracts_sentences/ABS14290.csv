1,14290,A segmented-in series (SIS) SOFC consists of segmented unit cells connected in electrical series and shows improved stack efficiency over conventional SOFCs.,Design of a dual-layer ceramic interconnect based on perovskite oxides for segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.082
2,14290,"In this design, a thin interconnect film provides both electrical contact and sealing between the anode of one cell and the cathode of the next; thus, it should have high conductivity and chemical/structural stability in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres as well as impermeability to gases.",Design of a dual-layer ceramic interconnect based on perovskite oxides for segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.082
3,14290,"Here, we report a dual-layer interconnect film for SIS -SOFCs comprising perovskite-type oxides, Sr0.7La0.2TiO3 (exposed to a reducing atmosphere) and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (exposed to an oxidizing atmosphere).",Design of a dual-layer ceramic interconnect based on perovskite oxides for segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.082
4,14290,"The interconnect film is not only very dense but also highly conductive and stable under SOFC operating conditions; in particular, it shows an area-specific resistance of 19.6 m Omega cm(2) at 800 similar to degrees C, which is much lower than the generally accepted limit for SOFCs.",Design of a dual-layer ceramic interconnect based on perovskite oxides for segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.082
5,14290,"A flat-tubular SIS-SOFC fabricated using these interconnect films exhibits a power density as high as 340 mW cm(-2), which proves the feasibility of the dual-layer interconnect design.",Design of a dual-layer ceramic interconnect based on perovskite oxides for segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.082
