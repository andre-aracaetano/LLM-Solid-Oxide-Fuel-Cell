4,11120,"The resulting hybrid-catalyst-coated LSF electrode exhibits a very low polarization resistance of 0.017 omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C, about one order of magnitude lower than that of bare LSF (0.197 omega cm(2)).",Promotion of oxygen reduction and evolution by applying a nanoengineered hybrid catalyst on cobalt free electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1039/d0ta02979c
5,11120,"Furthermore, the Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) fuel-electrode-supported cell with this hybrid-catalyst-coated LSF electrode displays excellent performance in both fuel-cell and electrolysis operations, while it also offers good durability tracked over 1000 h of fuel-cell operation.",Promotion of oxygen reduction and evolution by applying a nanoengineered hybrid catalyst on cobalt free electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1039/d0ta02979c
6,11120,The unique catalytic activity of the hybrid-catalyst-coated LSF electrode is attributed to the combined effects of accelerating oxygen surface exchange kinetics by Pr6O11 and enhancing the available surface area by the nanoporous architecture of the catalyst coating.,Promotion of oxygen reduction and evolution by applying a nanoengineered hybrid catalyst on cobalt free electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1039/d0ta02979c
7,11120,"Moreover, combined with the modification of the Ni/YSZ electrode, stable electrolysis operation at 650 degrees C under -0.5 A cm(-2) with a voltage close to 1.3 V is achieved on a cell prepared without cobalt.",Promotion of oxygen reduction and evolution by applying a nanoengineered hybrid catalyst on cobalt free electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1039/d0ta02979c
8,11120,"This work not only opens the opportunity for applying cobalt-free oxygen electrodes in SOCs but also proposes a co-infiltration strategy to develop a highly active and robust catalyst coating by combined tuning of composition and morphology, which may also be applicable to other devices such as metal-air batteries and membrane reactors.",Promotion of oxygen reduction and evolution by applying a nanoengineered hybrid catalyst on cobalt free electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1039/d0ta02979c
