1,8956,"This study examines the performance of a metal-based solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) coupled with an integrated diesel fuel processor, with a focus on operating stability.","A diesel-driven, metal-based solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.100
2,8956,"The reformate is produced by an autothermal reformer (ATR), desulfurizer, and post-reformer using commercial diesel.","A diesel-driven, metal-based solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.100
3,8956,Diesel reformate possesses the characteristics of low fuel concentration and high steam quantity due to its fuel processing condition for stable operation.,"A diesel-driven, metal-based solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.100
4,8956,These characteristics lead to high oxygen partial pressure at the anode which causes the oxidation of the cell's metallic component.,"A diesel-driven, metal-based solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.100
5,8956,"Various approaches, such as thermodynamic calculation, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis, and the electrochemical performance of a single cell, are used to prove the oxidation phenomenon in this experiment.","A diesel-driven, metal-based solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.100
6,8956,"As a result, the key factors for stable operation are discovered, and a metal-based SOFC single stack with an area of 50-mm x 50-mm is successfully operated for 1000 h at a 4%/1000 h degradation rate under a modified condition of diesel reformate.","A diesel-driven, metal-based solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.100
7,8956,"To ensure the SOFC's stable operation using the reformate, it is recommended that the operating condition should be considered from a viewpoint combining fuel composition, oxygen partial pressure, and temperature.","A diesel-driven, metal-based solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.100
8,8956,The modified condition for the long-term operation of a metal-based SOFC using diesel reformate is also suggested in this paper.,"A diesel-driven, metal-based solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.100
