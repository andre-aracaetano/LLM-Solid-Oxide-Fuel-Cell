3,7786,"However, this is precluded because the conventional Ni-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (Ni-YSZ) anode for SOFC is inclined to cause carbon formation as well as to form inert and non-conductive S-containing species in biogas.",Grafting doped manganite into nickel anode enables efficient and durable energy conversions in biogas solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2016.07.001
4,7786,"To directly utilize the biogas in SOFC, a hybrid anode material, combining the slightly compromised merits of the conventional Ni-YSZ cermet and the alternative anode, i.e., PrBaMn2O5+delta perovskite oxide, is developed in this study.",Grafting doped manganite into nickel anode enables efficient and durable energy conversions in biogas solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2016.07.001
5,7786,"The PrBaMn2O5+delta dramatically resists the carbon formation and S adsorption on Ni surface and at the same time, it serves as the CO2-captor, oxygen source and the medium for O2- diffusion to accelerate both the carbon removal and S desorption processes.",Grafting doped manganite into nickel anode enables efficient and durable energy conversions in biogas solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2016.07.001
