3,16445,"High-purity, single-phase and slightly aggregated powders with a particle size smaller than 400 nm were obtained by using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as the surfactant and calcining at 1150 degrees C once.","Synthesis, sintering behavior and electrical properties of Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2) O3-δ and Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1)O3-δ proton conductors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.115
4,16445,The sintering behavior and ionic conductivity of the sintered BZCY and BZCYYb powders were studied and compared with each other.,"Synthesis, sintering behavior and electrical properties of Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2) O3-δ and Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1)O3-δ proton conductors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.115
5,16445,"The results indicated that the sintering behavior of BZCY was inhibited after introducing 10 mol% Yb, which was manifested as hindered grain growth, a delayed sintering process and an increase in densification temperature from 1400 degrees C to 1500 degrees C. Conductivity results showed that the conductivities of BZCY were determined to be 0.80 x 10(-2) Scm(-1), 0.97 x 10(-2) Scm(-1) and 1.21 x 10(-2)","Synthesis, sintering behavior and electrical properties of Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2) O3-δ and Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1)O3-δ proton conductors",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.06.115
