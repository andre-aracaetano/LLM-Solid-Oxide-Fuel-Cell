1,16632,"8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) ceramic is an oxide ion conductor at atmospheric pressure but shows the onset of p-type semiconduction, in addition to the preexisting oxide ion conduction, on application of a dc bias in the range 4-66 Vcm(-1 )and at temperatures in the range 150 degrees C-750 degrees C.",Induced p-type semiconductivity in yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.16492
2,16632,The p-type behavior is attributed to the location and hopping of holes on oxygen.,Induced p-type semiconductivity in yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.16492
3,16632,This contrasts with the commonly observed introduction of n-type conduction under reducing conditions and high fields.,Induced p-type semiconductivity in yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.16492
4,16632,The hole conductivity increases with both dc bias and pO(2).,Induced p-type semiconductivity in yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.16492
5,16632,Its occurrence may contribute to the early stages of flash phenomena in 8YSZ ceramics.,Induced p-type semiconductivity in yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.16492
