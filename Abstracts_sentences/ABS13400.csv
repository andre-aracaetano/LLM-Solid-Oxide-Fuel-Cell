2,13400,Particular focus was given to the thermodynamic activities of SrO in the cathodes and their relation to the reaction with rare earth doped ceria or YSZ.,Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations on degradations in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.12.150
3,13400,The possibility of Sr diffusion from the cathode through the rare earth doped ceria to the YSZ electrolyte to form SrZrO3 was analyzed in terms of the SrO activity.,Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations on degradations in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.12.150
4,13400,It has been found that the SrO activity at the cathode/ceria interfaces is important for the steepening of the chemical potential gradient of SrO inside the doped ceria and for the enhancement of the solubility of SrO in doped ceria.,Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations on degradations in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.12.150
5,13400,Two possible effects influencing the SrO activities have been examined; these are chemical reactions between perovskite cathodes and doped ceria and kinetic decomposition under the oxygen potential gradient.,Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations on degradations in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.12.150
6,13400,Effects of cathodic polarization have been also examined in terms of changes in chemical equilibria and change in oxygen potential gradients.,Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations on degradations in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.12.150
