5,12246,"With these insights, supported by thermodynamic calculations, we propose the following reaction model: The reverse current treatment reduces YSZ congruently with Ni, temporarily forming a Ni-Zr-Y alloy, and Y2O3 precipitates.",High-Resolution Studies on Nanoscaled Ni/YSZ Anodes,10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b00360
