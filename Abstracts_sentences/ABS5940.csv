1,5940,Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the embossing as a replication technique for structuring fuel channels in the anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
2,5940,"Design/methodology/approach - The anode laminate, which was exposed to embossing, consisted of eight layers of isostatic pressed Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia tapes (Ni-YSZ).",Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
3,5940,Preheating the mould and soaking the laminate in the plasticizer was applied before structuring of the channels to soften the laminate.,Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
4,5940,Compressing tests were carried out to investigate the embossing ability of the Ni-YSZ laminate and to find the optimal processing parameters.,Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
5,5940,"Embossing was carried out with a testing machine, and the samples were exposed to embossing forces in the range up 20 kN with a certain speed of compression and a dwell time.",Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
6,5940,"Findings - The embossing parameters (force of compression, speed of compression and dwell time) suitable for proper fuel channels formation were established.",Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
7,5940,"Shapes, profiles and dimensions of the embossed channels were analysed and compared to the micromachined channels.",Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
8,5940,"The model of the SOFC with embossed fuel channels was completed, and its current-voltage characteristic was measured.",Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
9,5940,Originality/value - Experiments proved that embossing can be the alternative method for patterning fuel microchannels in SOFCs.,Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
10,5940,Embossing simplifies the process of fuel channel formation and reduces the time of SOFC fabrication.,Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
11,5940,It is necessary to improve the geometry and quality of the mould formation to make the fuel channels deeper and of better surface finish.,Embossing in fuel cell fabrication,10.1108/MI-01-2015-0007
