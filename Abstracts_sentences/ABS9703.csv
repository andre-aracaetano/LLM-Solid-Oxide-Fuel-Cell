1,9703,Single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells with coplanar microelectrodes were operated in methane-air mixtures (R(mix) = 2) at 700 degrees C.,Miniaturization limits for single-chamber micro-solid oxide fuel cells with coplanar electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.05.034
2,9703,"The performance of cells with one pair of NiO-YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) anode and (La(0.8)Sr(0.2))(0.98)MnO(3)-YSZ cathode, arranged parallel on a YSZ electrolyte substrate, was found to be significantly dependent on the electrode width.",Miniaturization limits for single-chamber micro-solid oxide fuel cells with coplanar electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.05.034
3,9703,"For an interelectrode gap of similar to 250 mu m, cells with average electrode widths exceeding similar to 850 mu m could establisha stable open circuit voltage (OCV) of similar to 0.8 V, while those with widths less than similar to 550 mu m could not establish any OCV.",Miniaturization limits for single-chamber micro-solid oxide fuel cells with coplanar electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.05.034

5,9703,"This behavior suggests that a lower limit to electrode dimensions exists for cells with single electrode pairs, below which neither a stable difference in oxygen partial pressure, nor an OCV, can be established.",Miniaturization limits for single-chamber micro-solid oxide fuel cells with coplanar electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.05.034
6,9703,"Conversely, increasing the electrode width imposes a penalty in the form of an increase in the cell resistance.",Miniaturization limits for single-chamber micro-solid oxide fuel cells with coplanar electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.05.034
7,9703,"However, both size limits can be circumvented by employing multiple pairs of microscale electrodes in an interdigitated configuration.",Miniaturization limits for single-chamber micro-solid oxide fuel cells with coplanar electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.05.034
