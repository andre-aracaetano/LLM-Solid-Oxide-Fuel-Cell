1,19336,"High oxygen permeability of mixed conductive La0.65Ca0.35FeO3-delta (LCF) is applicable to pure oxygen gas generators and cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells, etc.; however, lower surface exchange reactions at temperatures below 800 degrees C reduce permeability.",Surface Exchange Reaction of Mixed Conductive La0.65Ca0.35FeO3-δ during Oxygen Evolution and Incorporation as Traced by Operando X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy,10.1021/acsami.2c10700
2,19336,"To understand the microscopic surface reaction mechanism, operando soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of an LCF film surface was conducted during the evolution and incorporation of oxygen.",Surface Exchange Reaction of Mixed Conductive La0.65Ca0.35FeO3-δ during Oxygen Evolution and Incorporation as Traced by Operando X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy,10.1021/acsami.2c10700
3,19336,"LCF film was prepared on yttria-stabilized zirconia and a current was applied throughout the film at similar to 600 degrees C.
