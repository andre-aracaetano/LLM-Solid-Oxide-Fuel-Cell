3,3741,"The XRD results showed that BSFN was chemically compatible with SDC after co-fired at 1100 degrees C for 5 h. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of BSFN-SDC, which showed a reasonably reduced value (16.08 x 10(-6) K-1), was effectively decreased due to Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) added.",Preparation and characterization of Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 compose cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.03.077
4,3741,A single cell of Ni-BZCY/Ni-BZCY/BZCY/ BSFN-SDC with a 25-mu m-thick BZCY electrolyte membrane exhibited excellent power densities as high as 361.8 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C with a low polarization resistance of 0.174 Omega cm(2).,Preparation and characterization of Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Ni0.1O3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 compose cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.03.077
