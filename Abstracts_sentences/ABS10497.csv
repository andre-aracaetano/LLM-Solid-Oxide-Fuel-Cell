2,10497,"The present work presents the results of a study of the synergistic effects of four contaminants of major concern-S, As, P, and Cl, at the ppm level and in combinations of two, three, or four kinds-on the performance of Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSM solid oxide fuel cells.",Effect of various coal gas contaminants on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells: Part III. Synergistic effects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.018
3,10497,"The results indicate that both cell performance and morphology differ significantly in cells exposed to a single contaminant, and that cell performance is not simply the additive influence of each contaminant.",Effect of various coal gas contaminants on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells: Part III. Synergistic effects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.018
4,10497,"Synergistic effects can be very destructive (accelerated degradation or even cell failure) when S is in the presence with As/P, but can also be beneficial (stabilization in power density variations over time or a slowed degradation rate) when Cl is present with other contaminants.",Effect of various coal gas contaminants on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells: Part III.
