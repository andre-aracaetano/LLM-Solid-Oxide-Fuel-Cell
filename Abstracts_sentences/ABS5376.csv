1,5376,Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) that display high oxide ion conductivity (sigma(o)) and electronic conductivity (sigma(e)) constitute an important family of electrocatalysts for a variety of applications including fuel cells and oxygen separation membranes.,A CO2-Tolerant Perovskite Oxide with High Oxide Ion and Electronic Conductivity,10.1002/adma.201905200
2,5376,Often MIECs exhibit sufficient sigma(e) but inadequate sigma(o).,A CO2-Tolerant Perovskite Oxide with High Oxide Ion and Electronic Conductivity,10.1002/adma.201905200
3,5376,It has been a long-standing challenge to develop MIECs with both high sigma(o) and stability under device operation conditions.,A CO2-Tolerant Perovskite Oxide with High Oxide Ion and Electronic Conductivity,10.1002/adma.201905200
4,5376,"For example, the well-known perovskite oxide Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) exhibits exceptional sigma(o) and electrocatalytic activity.",A CO2-Tolerant Perovskite Oxide with High Oxide Ion and Electronic Conductivity,10.1002/adma.201905200
5,5376,"The reactivity of BSCF with CO2, however, limits its use in practical applications.",A CO2-Tolerant Perovskite Oxide with High Oxide Ion and Electronic Conductivity,10.1002/adma.201905200
6,5376,"Here, the perovskite oxide Bi0.15Sr0.85Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BiSCF) is shown to exhibit not only exceptional bulk transport properties, with a sigma(o) among the highest for known MIECs, but also high CO2 tolerance.",A CO2-Tolerant Perovskite Oxide with High Oxide Ion and Electronic Conductivity,10.1002/adma.201905200
7,5376,"When used as an oxygen separation membrane, BiSCF displays high oxygen permeability comparable to that of BSCF and much higher stability under CO2.",A CO2-Tolerant Perovskite Oxide with High Oxide Ion and Electronic Conductivity,10.1002/adma.201905200
8,5376,The combination of high oxide transport properties and CO2 tolerance in a single-phase MIEC gives BiSCF a significant advantage over existing MIECs for practical applications.,A CO2-Tolerant Perovskite Oxide with High Oxide Ion and Electronic Conductivity,10.1002/adma.201905200
