1,11110,"The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of a series of composite cathodes consisting of a porous Gd0.20Ce0.80O2-delta (GDC) scaffold infiltrated with Sr-, Co-, and Y-nitrate solutions has been systematically investigated in this study.",Toward Stabilizing Co3O4 Nanoparticles as an Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyst for Intermediate-Temperature SOFCs,10.1149/2.0011710jes
2,11110,"The results show that such infiltrated cathodes if calcined at low temperatures such as 350 degrees C exhibit low polarization resistance (RP) in the temperature range of 450-700 degrees C, even though XRD analysis reveals that the calcined product is virtually a mixture of Co3O4 and SrCO3.",Toward Stabilizing Co3O4 Nanoparticles as an Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyst for Intermediate-Temperature SOFCs,10.1149/2.0011710jes
3,11110,"A further study by design-of-experiment suggests that the true ORR-active species is Co3O4, whereas SrCO3 serves as a sintering inhibitor to preserve the high surface area of Co3O4.",Toward Stabilizing Co3O4 Nanoparticles as an Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyst for Intermediate-Temperature SOFCs,10.1149/2.0011710jes
4,11110,The findings and understanding in this study present a new strategy for future development of active cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Toward Stabilizing Co3O4 Nanoparticles as an Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyst for Intermediate-Temperature SOFCs,10.1149/2.0011710jes
