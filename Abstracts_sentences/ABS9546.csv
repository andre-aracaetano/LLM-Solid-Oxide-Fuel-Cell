4,9546,"Sr0.98Fe0.8Ti0.2O3-delta (SFT0.2) exhibits high efficiency operating as both cathode and anode with polarization resistance values of 0.1 Omega cm(2) in air and 0.07 Omega cm(2) in humidified H-2 at 700 degrees C. An electrolyte supported cell with 300 mm thick La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta electrolyte and SFT0.2 symmetric electrodes shows maximum power densities of 700 and 140 mW cm(-2) at 800 and 600 degrees C, respectively.",Ti-doped SrFeO3 nanostructured electrodes for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ra23771h
