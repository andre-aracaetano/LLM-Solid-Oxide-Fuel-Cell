1,19199,"Quantitative electrochemical contributions of cell, air electrode contact, and hydrogen electrode contact in the solid-oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) stack are investigated with an H2O/H-2 ratio of 90/10 and at 750 degrees C. Ohmic resistances of cell, hydrogen electrode contact, and air electrode contact are 63.6%, 4.8%, and 30.9%, respectively, of those of the stack under OCV condition.",Quantitative electrochemical contributions of cells and stacked interfacial contacts in solid-oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.046
2,19199,"Moreover, their polarization resistances account for 93%, 2.6%, and 3.5% of those of the stack, respectively.",Quantitative electrochemical contributions of cells and stacked interfacial contacts in solid-oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.046
3,19199,"When the stack is operated at a constant electrolysis current density of 0.8 A cm(-2) for 384 h, voltage degradations of cell, hydrogen electrode contact, and air electrode contact are 71.5%, 8.9% and 19.6%, respectively, of the total voltage degradation of the stack.",Quantitative electrochemical contributions of cells and stacked interfacial contacts in solid-oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.046
4,19199,Variation in stack resistance is highly attributed to the increase in cell ohmic resistance caused by air-electrode delamination from the GDC (Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95).,Quantitative electrochemical contributions of cells and stacked interfacial contacts in solid-oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.046
5,19199,"However, the applied voltage of the stack is more sensitive to the cell polarization resistance caused by Ni-particle agglomeration in hydrogen electrode, which may be the major factor affecting SOEC stack degradation.",Quantitative electrochemical contributions of cells and stacked interfacial contacts in solid-oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.046
