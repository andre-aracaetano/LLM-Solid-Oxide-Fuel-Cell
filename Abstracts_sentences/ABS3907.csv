2,3907,"In this study, chromium (Cr) poisoning of anode supported cells (ASCs) coupled with various alloys was analyzed by the distribution of relaxation times (DRT).",Deconvolution of deterioration of anode-supported cells by chromium poisoning from alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels for balance of plant applications in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140933
3,3907,The performance deterioration of ASCs was mainly attributed to the increased polarization resistances of chemisorption of oxygen on the cathode and the oxygen diffusion and reaction in the cathode.,Deconvolution of deterioration of anode-supported cells by chromium poisoning from alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels for balance of plant applications in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140933
4,3907,"The superior performance of ASC coupled with AFA alloys was due to the formed continuous alumina layer which can vastly decrease the evaporated gaseous Cr species, thus alleviating the Cr poisoning on the cathode region.",Deconvolution of deterioration of anode-supported cells by chromium poisoning from alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels for balance of plant applications in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140933
