5,15599,The subsequent post-cell SEM micrograph revealed that agglomeration of the infiltrated SSC particles was possibly the cause for the performance deterioration.,Electrochemical stability of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated YSZ for solid oxide fuel cells/electrolysis cells,10.1039/c5fd00022j
6,15599,"Furthermore, the long-term stability of the cell was examined at 700 degrees C with a constant voltage of 1.3 V under steam electrolysis mode.",Electrochemical stability of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated YSZ for solid oxide fuel cells/electrolysis cells,10.1039/c5fd00022j
7,15599,"SEM associated with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was employed to characterize the post-test cell after the long-term electrolysis operation and it indicated that besides the agglomeration of SSC particles, the delamination of the SSC-YSZ oxygen electrode from the YSZ electrolyte, as well as segregation of cobalt-enriched particles (particularly cobalt oxides) at the interface, was probably responsible for the cell degradation under the steam electrolysis mode.",Electrochemical stability of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated YSZ for solid oxide fuel cells/electrolysis cells,10.1039/c5fd00022j
