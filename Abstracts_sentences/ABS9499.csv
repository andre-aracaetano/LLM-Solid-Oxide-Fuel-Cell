1,9499,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at a high temperature can be used to generate electricity and produce syngas from hydrocarbon fuels.,A stable chromite anode for SOFC with Ce/Ni exsolution for simultaneous electricity generation and CH4 reforming,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123739
2,9499,"In this work, the in-situ decoration of CeO2 and Ni nanoparticles on the surface of chromite anode has been explored; i.e., the exsolution of CeO2 from La0.75Ce0.05Ca0.2Cr0.9Ni0.1O3 (Ce-LCN) can be achieved in the oxygenation in air to boost the exsolution of Ni0 under the fuel condition.",A stable chromite anode for SOFC with Ce/Ni exsolution for simultaneous electricity generation and CH4 reforming,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123739
3,9499,The SOFC with a Ce-LCN anode showed higher performance and better stability under propane and H2 fuel than the one La0.8Ca0.2Cr0.9Ni0.1O3 (LCN) anode because of the formation of CeO2 and Ni0 nanoparticles.,A stable chromite anode for SOFC with Ce/Ni exsolution for simultaneous electricity generation and CH4 reforming,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123739
4,9499,"Setting in the dis-tribution of H2 in the existing natural gas pipeline, hydrogen-injection in CH4 (20% H2 in volume in CH4) was found for the first time to efficiently improve the coking resistance of the anode because the H2 was able to boost the transfer of oxygen from the anode to the direct internal reforming.",A stable chromite anode for SOFC with Ce/Ni exsolution for simultaneous electricity generation and CH4 reforming,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123739
5,9499,The conversion of CH4 was found to be around 85% and the selectivity for CO was close to unity.,A stable chromite anode for SOFC with Ce/Ni exsolution for simultaneous electricity generation and CH4 reforming,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123739
6,9499,This study provides a viable solution to the design of complex perovskite SOFC to produce electricity and syngas simultaneously from CH4.,A stable chromite anode for SOFC with Ce/Ni exsolution for simultaneous electricity generation and CH4 reforming,10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123739
