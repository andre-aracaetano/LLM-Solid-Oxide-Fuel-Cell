1,11569,Thin and dense bilayer electrolytes consisting of erbium stabilized bismuth oxide (ESB) and gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) were fabricated on tape-cast porous Ni-GDC anode-supports using a scalable and cost-effective colloidal deposition process.,Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95/Er0.4Bi1.6O3 bilayered electrolytes fabricated by a simple colloidal route using nano-sized Er0.4Bi1.6O3 powders for high performance low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.040
2,11569,Nano-sized ESB particles were successfully synthesized at temperatures as low as similar to 500 degrees C using wet chemical co-precipitation.,Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95/Er0.4Bi1.6O3 bilayered electrolytes fabricated by a simple colloidal route using nano-sized Er0.4Bi1.6O3 powders for high performance low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.040
3,11569,"Due to the high sinterability of this powder, dense ESB layers were obtained at a sintering temperature of 800 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis of a full button cell with an ESB/GDC bilayer sintered at 800 degrees C showed no visible interfacial diffusion between each layer.",Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95/Er0.4Bi1.6O3 bilayered electrolytes fabricated by a simple colloidal route using nano-sized Er0.4Bi1.6O3 powders for high performance low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.040
4,11569,"A systematic study on the sintering behavior of ESB revealed that at higher sintering temperatures, bismuth oxide can sublime or penetrate into the GDC sublayer.",Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95/Er0.4Bi1.6O3 bilayered electrolytes fabricated by a simple colloidal route using nano-sized Er0.4Bi1.6O3 powders for high performance low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.040
5,11569,The effect of both the ESB layer and the GDC layer thickness on increasing open circuit potential (OCP) was demonstrated.,Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95/Er0.4Bi1.6O3 bilayered electrolytes fabricated by a simple colloidal route using nano-sized Er0.4Bi1.6O3 powders for high performance low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.040
6,11569,The current-voltage measurement of the cell showed high power density (similar to 1.5 W cm(-2)) at 650 degrees C due to the increase in OCP and a significant reduction in area specific resistance when compared to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a single GDC layer.,Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95/Er0.4Bi1.6O3 bilayered electrolytes fabricated by a simple colloidal route using nano-sized Er0.4Bi1.6O3 powders for high performance low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.040
