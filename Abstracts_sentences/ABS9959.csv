1,9959,MnCo2O4 spinel was coated on the surface of SUS 430 alloy by using the sol-gel method.,OXIDATION KINETICS BEHAVIOR AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTY OF MnCO2O4 SPINEL AS A COATING MATERIAL FOR METALLIC INTERCONNECTS,
2,9959,The oxidation kinetics behavior and electrical property of coated SUS 430 alloy in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) cathode atmosphere were investigated.,OXIDATION KINETICS BEHAVIOR AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTY OF MnCO2O4 SPINEL AS A COATING MATERIAL FOR METALLIC INTERCONNECTS,
3,9959,"XRD, EDS and SEM were used to characterize the phase structure, surface and cross-section morphology, and composition of the surface oxides; the area specific resistance (ASR) of the surface oxides was measured by using the four-probe direct current technique.",OXIDATION KINETICS BEHAVIOR AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTY OF MnCO2O4 SPINEL AS A COATING MATERIAL FOR METALLIC INTERCONNECTS,
4,9959,"The result shows that a 2 pm thick oxide scale, mainly consisting of an inner layer of Mn-Cr spinel and an outer layer of doped Mn-Co spinel, was formed during cyclic oxidation at 750 degrees C in air for 1000 h. The growth of Cr2O3, and Fe2O3 was depressed.",OXIDATION KINETICS BEHAVIOR AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTY OF MnCO2O4 SPINEL AS A COATING MATERIAL FOR METALLIC INTERCONNECTS,
5,9959,"The oxidation kinetics obeys the parabolic law with two rate constants 3.74 x10(-15)g(2)(cm(4).s)(0 similar to 200 h) and 7.06x10(-15)g(2)/(cm(4).s) (200 similar to 1000 h), respectively, which is 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the SUS 430 alloy without coating.",OXIDATION KINETICS BEHAVIOR AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTY OF MnCO2O4 SPINEL AS A COATING MATERIAL FOR METALLIC INTERCONNECTS,
6,9959,The ASR is in the range of 5.21 similar to 22.65 m Omega.m(2) at 600-800 degrees C. MnCo2O4 coating was proved to be effective in enhancing the oxidation resistance and electrical property of SUS 430 alloy.,OXIDATION KINETICS BEHAVIOR AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTY OF MnCO2O4 SPINEL AS A COATING MATERIAL FOR METALLIC INTERCONNECTS,
