1,7063,"Perovskites are important materials in a number of important technological applications, including solid oxide fuel cells, catalysis, and giant magneto-resistance materials.","Substitution induced B-cation ordering in solid oxide fuel cell ceramics:: (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O3 (M = Mn, Cr)",10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.08.025
2,7063,"For many of these purposes, a mixture of B-cations can be used to tune the desired properties, e.g., oxygen reduction, ionic conductivity.","Substitution induced B-cation ordering in solid oxide fuel cell ceramics:: (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O3 (M = Mn, Cr)",10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.08.025
3,7063,"For a solid oxide fuel cell, two particular ceramic components are of critical importance and have been extensively studied, the cathode (La0.8Sr0.2)MnO3-x and the interconnect material (La0.8Sr0.2)CrO3.","Substitution induced B-cation ordering in solid oxide fuel cell ceramics:: (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O3 (M = Mn, Cr)",10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.08.025
4,7063,"In this study, we examined the mixed B-cation perovskites (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O-3 (M = Mn, Cr).","Substitution induced B-cation ordering in solid oxide fuel cell ceramics:: (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O3 (M = Mn, Cr)",10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.08.025
5,7063,"All materials were synthesized using the glycine-nitrate method, followed by air annealing.","Substitution induced B-cation ordering in solid oxide fuel cell ceramics:: (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O3 (M = Mn, Cr)",10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.08.025
6,7063,The structures were determined using powder neutron diffraction methods.,"Substitution induced B-cation ordering in solid oxide fuel cell ceramics:: (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O3 (M = Mn, Cr)",10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.08.025
7,7063,"Refinement of the data showed that even at this low concentration, the compounds have monoclinic symmetry (P2(1)/n) and that the nickel had a strong preference for the smaller of the two octahedral sites.","Substitution induced B-cation ordering in solid oxide fuel cell ceramics:: (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O3 (M = Mn, Cr)",10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.08.025
8,7063,This small amount of nickel substituted on the B-site resulted in a symmetry reduction when compared to the unsubstituted (LaSr)MnO3 or (LaSr)CrO3 materials.,"Substitution induced B-cation ordering in solid oxide fuel cell ceramics:: (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O3 (M = Mn, Cr)",10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.08.025
9,7063,"Although this structural type has been seen previously in heavily substituted perovskites, these materials show that even at this low level of substitution a segregation of the metals in a manner similar to the double perovskites A(2)BB'O6-x can be detected.","Substitution induced B-cation ordering in solid oxide fuel cell ceramics:: (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O3 (M = Mn, Cr)",10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.08.025
10,7063,This may have implications involving material stresses on cycling that may result as the temperature is raised or lowered through this crystallographic transition.,"Substitution induced B-cation ordering in solid oxide fuel cell ceramics:: (La0.8Sr0.2)(M0.9Ni0.1)O3 (M = Mn, Cr)",10.1016/j.materresbull.2007.08.025
