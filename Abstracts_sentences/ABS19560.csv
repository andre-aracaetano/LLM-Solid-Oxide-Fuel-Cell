1,19560,"Long-term electrochemical performance of polymeric precursor-derived films of LaCoO(3)doped with Ca2+(LCC), instead of the larger Sr(2+)which segregates at the electrode surface forming oxides/hydroxides, was investigated in the present study.","Correlation of Phase, Microstructure and Surface Chemistry Evolution to the Long-Term Performance Stability of (La, Ca)CoO3SOFC Electrodes",10.1149/1945-7111/abaceb
2,19560,It was determined that pre-calcination at 800 degrees C (LCC02-800) resulted in a higher electrochemical performance but a poorer long-term stability than those pre-calcined at 700 degrees C (LCC02-700) or 900 degrees C (LCC02-900).,"Correlation of Phase, Microstructure and Surface Chemistry Evolution to the Long-Term Performance Stability of (La, Ca)CoO3SOFC Electrodes",10.1149/1945-7111/abaceb
3,19560,"Increasing Ca(2+)content (LCC04-800) enhanced the initial electrochemical performance slightly, while causing a much poorer long-term stability.","Correlation of Phase, Microstructure and Surface Chemistry Evolution to the Long-Term Performance Stability of (La, Ca)CoO3SOFC Electrodes",10.1149/1945-7111/abaceb
4,19560,"Microstructural evolution analyses revealed that, although it had some impact on the initial and long-term performance of LCC electrodes, it was not the strongest influence.","Correlation of Phase, Microstructure and Surface Chemistry Evolution to the Long-Term Performance Stability of (La, Ca)CoO3SOFC Electrodes",10.1149/1945-7111/abaceb
5,19560,"It was determined via XPS analyses that formation of CaO and CaO + La(2)O(3)layers at the LCC02-800 and LCC04-800 surfaces, respectively, accompanied by a decrease in the relative amounts of adsorbed oxygen species (corresponding to surface oxygen vacancies) caused a faster performance degradation in these samples than those pre-calcined at 700 or 900 degrees C. Eventually, only the surface cation ratio of LCC02-700 became close to the theoretical one after long-term operation.","Correlation of Phase, Microstructure and Surface Chemistry Evolution to the Long-Term Performance Stability of (La, Ca)CoO3SOFC Electrodes",10.1149/1945-7111/abaceb
