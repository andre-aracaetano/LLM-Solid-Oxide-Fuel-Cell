2,10231,It is found that the low-efficiency results from the uneven distribution of Cu instead of the small loading.,On the limiting factor of impregnation methods for developing Cu/CeO2 anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-017-3876-9

7,10231,"The anode made by the sequential impregnation yields the best performance in CH4 at 700 A degrees C, 170 mW cm(-2), which represents an 18% enhancement over that of the simultaneous impregnation, or 340% over the Cu-only anode.",On the limiting factor of impregnation methods for developing Cu/CeO2 anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-017-3876-9
8,10231,"These findings demonstrate that it is of importance to optimize the Cu impregnation to yield a highly active anode, and the sequential impregnation method is a promising procedure to break the efficiency-limiting factor and produce a high-performance anode with minimized fabrication effort.",On the limiting factor of impregnation methods for developing Cu/CeO2 anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-017-3876-9
