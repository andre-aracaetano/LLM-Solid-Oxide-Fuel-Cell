1,7534,The results of the first principles spin-polarized DFT calculations of the atomic and electronic structure of a complex perovskite (Ba1-xSrx)(Co1-yFey)O3-delta (BSCF) used as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and gas separation membranes are presented and discussed.,First-principles modelling of complex perovskite (Ba1-xSrx)(Co1-yFey)O3-δ for solid oxide fuel cell and gas separation membrane applications,10.1039/c0ee00096e
2,7534,"The formation energies of oxygen vacancies are found to be considerably smaller than in other magnetic perovskites, e.g. (La,Sr)MnO3, which explains the experimentally observed strong deviation of this material from stoichiometry.",First-principles modelling of complex perovskite (Ba1-xSrx)(Co1-yFey)O3-δ for solid oxide fuel cell and gas separation membrane applications,10.1039/c0ee00096e
