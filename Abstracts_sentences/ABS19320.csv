5,19320,"Samples were sintered for 1 h at temperatures of 1250-1350 degrees C. All the cermet films were then reduced under a mixture of hydrogen (10%) and nitrogen (90%) at 800 degrees C for 2 h. The effect of Ni content and sinter temperature on the DC electrical conductivity were investigated, and the results showed a sharp change in conductivity at around 30 vol% Ni, corresponding to continuity/discontinuity of the Ni Ni contact network, and the conductivity increased as the sinter temperature increased from 1250 to 1350 degrees C. An acceptable electrical conductivity at 700 degrees C for these cermet films was obtained at >40 vol% Ni, consistent with behaviour reported for more conventional Ni-YSZ cermets.",Fabrication and characterization of Ni/ScSZ cermet anodes for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.151
