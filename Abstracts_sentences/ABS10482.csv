8,10482,"Addition of higher amounts of Sn (5%) reduces electrochemical performance of Ni/YSZ anodes in H-2 and also reduces the carbon gasification rates, leading to higher carbon accumulation.","Carbon tolerance, electrochemical performance and stability of solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/yttria stabilized zirconia anodes impregnated with Sn and operated with methane",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.062
9,10482,The Sn content in the anode decreases after operation at 1073 K for 30 h. Hence retaining Sn in the anode might be difficult in actual stack operations at high temperatures (1073 K) and long durations (> 40.000 h).,"Carbon tolerance, electrochemical performance and stability of solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/yttria stabilized zirconia anodes impregnated with Sn and operated with methane",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.062
