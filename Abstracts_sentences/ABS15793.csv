1,15793,Single-step inkjet printing infiltration with doped ceria Ce(0.9)Ye(0.1)O(1.95) (YDC) and cobalt oxide (CoxOy) precursor inks was performed in order to modify the properties of the doped ceria interlayer in commercial (50 x 50 x 0.5 mm(3) size) anode-supported SOFCs.,Inkjet Printing Infiltration of the Doped Ceria Interlayer in Commercial Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.3390/nano11113095
2,15793,The penetration of the inks throughout the La0.8Sr0.2Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta porous cathode to the Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 (GDC) interlayer was achieved by optimisation of the inks' rheology jetting parameters.,Inkjet Printing Infiltration of the Doped Ceria Interlayer in Commercial Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.3390/nano11113095
3,15793,The low-temperature calcination (750 & DEG;C) resulted in densification of the Gd-doped ceria porous interlayer as well as decoration of the cathode scaffold with nanoparticles (~20-50 nm in size).,Inkjet Printing Infiltration of the Doped Ceria Interlayer in Commercial Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.3390/nano11113095
4,15793,The I-V testing in pure hydrogen showed a maximum power density gain of ~20% at 700 & DEG;C and ~97% at 800 & DEG;C for the infiltrated cells.,Inkjet Printing Infiltration of the Doped Ceria Interlayer in Commercial Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.3390/nano11113095
5,15793,The latter effect was largely assigned to the improvement in the interfacial Ohmic resistance due to the densification of the interlayer.,Inkjet Printing Infiltration of the Doped Ceria Interlayer in Commercial Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.3390/nano11113095
6,15793,The EIS study of the polarisation losses of the reference and infiltrated cells revealed a reduction in the activation polarisations losses at 700 & DEG;C due to the nano-decoration of the La0.8Sr0.2Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta scaffold surface.,Inkjet Printing Infiltration of the Doped Ceria Interlayer in Commercial Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.3390/nano11113095
7,15793,"Such was not the case at 800 & DEG;C, where the drop in Ohmic losses was dominant.",Inkjet Printing Infiltration of the Doped Ceria Interlayer in Commercial Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.3390/nano11113095
8,15793,"This work demonstrated that single-step inkjet printing infiltration, a non-disruptive, low-cost technique, can produce significant and scalable performance enhancements in commercial anode-supported SOFCs.",Inkjet Printing Infiltration of the Doped Ceria Interlayer in Commercial Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.3390/nano11113095
