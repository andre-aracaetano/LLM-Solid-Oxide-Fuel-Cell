1,13488,"High Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images strongly suggest that Pd catalyst materials containing Sm2O3, but not CeO2, undergo the dissolution and re-precipitation of the oxide support as an semi-amorphous phase during the Pd impregnation step.",High resolution TEM investigation of CeO2/SM2O3 -: supported Pd catalysts for methanol reforming in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
2,13488,The Pd appears to be intimately associated with this semi-amorphous phase and is seen to emerge from it following reductive and thermal pretreatments to form identifiable Pd particles.,High resolution TEM investigation of CeO2/SM2O3 -: supported Pd catalysts for methanol reforming in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
3,13488,This behaviour can be used to understand the activity of this group of catalysts for methanol reforming.,High resolution TEM investigation of CeO2/SM2O3 -: supported Pd catalysts for methanol reforming in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
