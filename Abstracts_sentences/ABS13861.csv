1,13861,"The cell performance and temperature gradient of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with indirect internal reformer (IIR-SOFC) fuelled by natural gas, containing a typical catalytic packed-bed reformer, a catalytic coated wall reformer, a catalytic annular reformer, and a novel catalytic annular-coated wall reformer were investigated with an aim to determine the most efficient internal reformer system.",Modelling of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with different designs of indirect internal reformer,10.1016/S2095-4956(14)60143-1
2,13861,"Among the four reformer designs, IIR-SOFC containing an annular-coated wall reformer exhibited the highest performance in terms of cell power density (0.67 W.cm(-2)) and electrical efficiency (68%) with an acceptable temperature gradient and a moderate pressure drop across the reformer (3.53 x 10(-5) kPa).",Modelling of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with different designs of indirect internal reformer,10.1016/S2095-4956(14)60143-1
3,13861,"IIR-SOFC with an annular-coated wall reformer was then studied over a range of operating conditions: inlet fuel temperature, operating pressure, steam to carbon (S : C) ratio, gas flow pattern (co-flow and counter-flow pattern), and natural gas compositions.",Modelling of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with different designs of indirect internal reformer,10.1016/S2095-4956(14)60143-1
4,13861,The simulation results showed that the temperature gradient across the reformer could not be decreased using a lower fuel inlet temperature (1223 K-1173 K) and both the power density and electrical efficiency of the cell also decreased by lowering fuel inlet temperature.,Modelling of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with different designs of indirect internal reformer,10.1016/S2095-4956(14)60143-1
5,13861,Operating in higher pressure mode (1-10 bar) improved the temperature gradient and cell performance.,Modelling of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with different designs of indirect internal reformer,10.1016/S2095-4956(14)60143-1
6,13861,Increasing the S : C ratio from 2: 1 to 4: 1 could decrease the temperature drop across the reformer but also decrease the cell performance.,Modelling of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with different designs of indirect internal reformer,10.1016/S2095-4956(14)60143-1
7,13861,"The average temperature gradient was higher and smoother in IIR-SOFC under a co-flow pattern than that under a counter-flow pattern, leading to lower overpotential and higher cell performance.",Modelling of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with different designs of indirect internal reformer,10.1016/S2095-4956(14)60143-1
8,13861,Natural gas compositions significantly affected the cell performance and temperature gradient.,Modelling of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with different designs of indirect internal reformer,10.1016/S2095-4956(14)60143-1
9,13861,Natural gas containing lower methane content provided smoother temperature gradient in the system but showed lower power density and electrical efficiency.,Modelling of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with different designs of indirect internal reformer,10.1016/S2095-4956(14)60143-1
