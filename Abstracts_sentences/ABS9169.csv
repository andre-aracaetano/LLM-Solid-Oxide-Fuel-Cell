1,9169,A systematic optimization of several parameters significant in the fabrication of anode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell via extrusion and dip coating is presented in this study.,Experimental optimization of the fabrication parameters for anode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.060
2,9169,"Co-sintering temperature of anode-support and electrolyte, the vehicle type and solid powder content used in electrolyte dip-coating slurry, electrolyte submersion time, cathode sintering temperature, powder ratio in the cathode functional layer, submersion time for the cathode functional layer and, submersion time and coating number of the anode functional layer are studied in this respect and optimized in the given order according to the performance tests and microstructural analyses.",Experimental optimization of the fabrication parameters for anode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.060
3,9169,"The performance of the micro-tubular cell is significantly improved to 0.49 Wcm(-2) at 800 degrees C after the optimizations, while that of the base cell is only 0.136 Wcm(-2).",Experimental optimization of the fabrication parameters for anode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.060
4,9169,12-cell micro-tubular stack is also constructed with the optimized cells and the stack is tested.,Experimental optimization of the fabrication parameters for anode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.060
5,9169,Each cell in the stack is found to show very close performance to the single-cell performance and the stack with a maximum power of similar to 26 W at an operating temperature of 800 degrees C is therefore evaluated to be successful.,Experimental optimization of the fabrication parameters for anode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.060
