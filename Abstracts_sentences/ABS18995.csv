1,18995,Perovskites are used to promote the kinetics of oxygen electrocatalysis in solid oxide fuel cells and oxygen permeation membranes.,In Situ Studies of the Temperature-Dependent Surface Structure and Chemistry of Single-Crystalline (001)-Oriented La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-δ Perovskite Thin Films,10.1021/jz400250t
2,18995,Little is known about the surface structure and chemistry of perovskites at high temperatures and partial oxygen pressures.,In Situ Studies of the Temperature-Dependent Surface Structure and Chemistry of Single-Crystalline (001)-Oriented La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-δ Perovskite Thin Films,10.1021/jz400250t
3,18995,"Combining in situ X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), we report, for the first time, the evolution of the surface structure and chemistry of (001)-oriented perovskite La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta (LSC113) and (La0.5Sr0.5)(2)CoO4+delta (LSC214)-decorated LSC113 (LSC113/214) thin films as a function of temperature.",In Situ Studies of the Temperature-Dependent Surface Structure and Chemistry of Single-Crystalline (001)-Oriented La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-δ Perovskite Thin Films,10.1021/jz400250t
4,18995,"Heating the (001) oriented LSC113 surface leads to the formation of surface LSC214-like particles, which is further confirmed by ex situ Auger electron spectroscopy (AES).",In Situ Studies of the Temperature-Dependent Surface Structure and Chemistry of Single-Crystalline (001)-Oriented La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-δ Perovskite Thin Films,10.1021/jz400250t
5,18995,"In contrast, the LSC113/214 surface, with activities much higher than that of LSC113, is stable upon heating.",In Situ Studies of the Temperature-Dependent Surface Structure and Chemistry of Single-Crystalline (001)-Oriented La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-δ Perovskite Thin Films,10.1021/jz400250t
6,18995,"Combined in situ x RR and AMPS measurements support that Sr enrichment may occur at the LSC113 and LSC214 interface, which can be responsible for its markedly enhanced activities.",In Situ Studies of the Temperature-Dependent Surface Structure and Chemistry of Single-Crystalline (001)-Oriented La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-δ Perovskite Thin Films,10.1021/jz400250t
