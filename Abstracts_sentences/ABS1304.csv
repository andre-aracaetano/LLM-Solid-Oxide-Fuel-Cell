1,1304,"The delamination of oxygen electrode during the electrolysis mode operation, which is mainly attributed to interfacial stress arising from the inability of oxygen electrode to accommodate oxygen species transported by oxide ion conducting electrolyte at the three phase boundary (TPB), has been major concern in the development of reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC) systems.",La2NiO4+δ as oxygen electrode in reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.083
2,1304,"The use of lanthanum nickelate, La2NiO4+delta (LNO) as a RSOC oxygen electrode, because of its ability to accommodate excess oxygen species in interstitial positions, can be helpful in reliving such interfacial stresses and thus mitigating the problem of delamination.",La2NiO4+δ as oxygen electrode in reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.083
