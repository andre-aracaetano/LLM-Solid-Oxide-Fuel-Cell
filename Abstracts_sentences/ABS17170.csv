1,17170,"In this paper, the agglomeration effect of rare-earth oxide has been confirmed through that the thermal properties, viscosity, crystalline phase, and high temperature resistivity of the 35BaO-(15-x)CaO5Al2O3-10B2O3-35SiO2-xLa2O3 (x = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 mol%, BABSCLa) glass system were systematically investigated.",Strengthening functional properties and competitive crystallization behavior of La2O3-BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic for solid oxide fuel cells: Agglomeration effect of rare-earth oxide,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122933
2,17170,"With the increase of the La2O3/CaO molar ratio, the results of Raman and infrared spectra of the BABSCLa glass showed that the Q4, Q3, and Q2 units of [SiO4] decrease, while Q1 and Q0 units increased in the BABSCLa glass structure, because the La2O3 as the glass network modifier can create more non-bridging oxygen than the CaO. However, the agglomeration effect of La ions with the high field strength could adsorb the oxygen in glass to form the La-O-La (Si) bond, resulting that the glass transition temperature and softening temperature of the BABSCLa glass continued to increase with the addition of La2O3, and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of annealed glass decreased from 11.37 to 10.87 x 10-6K-1, respectively.",Strengthening functional properties and competitive crystallization behavior of La2O3-BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic for solid oxide fuel cells: Agglomeration effect of rare-earth oxide,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122933
3,17170,"Simultaneously, the main crystalline phase of the BABSCLa glass-ceramic gradually changed from the low crystallization activation energy BaSiO3 phase with 287 kJ/mol to Ba3La6(SiO4)6 phase with 454 kJ/mol duo to the agglomeration effect of La ions.",Strengthening functional properties and competitive crystallization behavior of La2O3-BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic for solid oxide fuel cells: Agglomeration effect of rare-earth oxide,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2024.122933
