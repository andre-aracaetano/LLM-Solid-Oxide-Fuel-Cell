1,4118,The profile of oxygen chemical potential in 20 mol% Sm-doped ceria Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) at 1273 K under the open-circuit conditions of solid oxide fuel cells was determined using Raman spectroscopy.,Oxygen chemical potential variation in ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells determined by Raman spectroscopy,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00403-3
2,4118,"SDC pellets were annealed in various atmospheres, and a peak intensity of a Raman band of SDC in the range 540-600 cm(-1), which has been assigned to a band that originates in the oxygen vacancies, increased with decreasing oxygen partial pressure [P(O-2)] upon annealing.",Oxygen chemical potential variation in ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells determined by Raman spectroscopy,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00403-3
