1,20055,The use of typical nickel (Ni)-based solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is largely limited due to declined electrolysis performance in CO2-lean atmosphere and coking in CO-rich atmosphere.,Ni-cermet with straight pore paths as cathode for solid oxide electrolysis cell enabling energy-efficient and coking-resistant conversion of CO2,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230787
2,20055,The present study is intended to investigate the electrochemical performance and coking behavior of the Ni cermet cathode in relation to its pore structure.,Ni-cermet with straight pore paths as cathode for solid oxide electrolysis cell enabling energy-efficient and coking-resistant conversion of CO2,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230787
3,20055,"In CO2-lean atmosphere (P-CO2 = 0.3 atm), the cell with the straight pore paths (Cell-1) shows significantly higher electrolysis current density than the one with the tortuous pore paths (Cell-2) (1.12 vs. 0.61 A cm(-2) under 1.5V at 750 degrees C).",Ni-cermet with straight pore paths as cathode for solid oxide electrolysis cell enabling energy-efficient and coking-resistant conversion of CO2,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230787
4,20055,Cell-1 also demonstrates better resistance to coking than Cell-2.,Ni-cermet with straight pore paths as cathode for solid oxide electrolysis cell enabling energy-efficient and coking-resistant conversion of CO2,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230787
5,20055,"The critical current density at which coking starts to occur is found to be between 1.0 and 1.5 A cm(-2) for Cell-1, whereas it is between 0.5 and 1.0 A cm(-2) for Cell-2.",Ni-cermet with straight pore paths as cathode for solid oxide electrolysis cell enabling energy-efficient and coking-resistant conversion of CO2,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230787
6,20055,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement in combination with distribution relaxation time (DRT) analysis reveals that the Ni-cermet cathode with the straight pore paths allow facile transport of CO2 to the electrochemical reaction sites mitigating the concentration polarization, and the produced CO can be removed rapidly from the reaction sites keeping its concentration below the coking threshold.",Ni-cermet with straight pore paths as cathode for solid oxide electrolysis cell enabling energy-efficient and coking-resistant conversion of CO2,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230787
