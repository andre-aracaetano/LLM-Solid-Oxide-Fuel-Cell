1,10788,"Highly reactive and nanocrystalline powders of LaCrO(3)based compositions, having the general formula La0.9Ca0.1Cr1-xMxO3-delta (0 <= x <= 0.1, and M=Al, Co, or Mg), suitable for solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications, have been synthesized using an auto-combustion technique with ammonium dichromate as the chromium source.",Influence of B site substituents on lanthanum calcium chromite nanocrystalline materials for a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01987.x
2,10788,"Owing to very fine crystallite size (ranging from 10 to 50 nm) and the high reactivity of the powders (surface area as high as 25 m(2)/g), the sintering temperature reduces drastically and a highly dense, uniform, and fine-grained microstructure is obtained.",Influence of B site substituents on lanthanum calcium chromite nanocrystalline materials for a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01987.x
3,10788,"A dramatic improvement in densification (nearly theoretical density) is observed for aluminum substitution, when sintered at as low a temperature as 1300 degrees C.",Influence of B site substituents on lanthanum calcium chromite nanocrystalline materials for a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01987.x
4,10788,The microstructure shows a uniform distribution of grains having an average grain size of similar to 0.5 mu m.,Influence of B site substituents on lanthanum calcium chromite nanocrystalline materials for a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01987.x
5,10788,"Depending on the substituent, the electrical conductivities of the sintered samples in air, at 1000 degrees C, were found to be in the range of 10-45 S/cm, and are more than that of the values required for SOFC application.",Influence of B site substituents on lanthanum calcium chromite nanocrystalline materials for a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01987.x
6,10788,"The thermal expansion coefficients, as obtained, are also comparable with the other SOFC cell components.",Influence of B site substituents on lanthanum calcium chromite nanocrystalline materials for a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01987.x
