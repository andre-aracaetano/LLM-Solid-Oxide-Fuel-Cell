3,9883,"Herein, to control the defect concentration on the Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (GDC) scaffold, the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode was engineered by a wet-chemical-based infiltration technique which constructed the conformal thin-film-like GDC interlayer (10 nm thickness) with smaller grain size than that of the GDC scaffold.",Modifying defect structures at interfaces for high-performance solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.03.009
