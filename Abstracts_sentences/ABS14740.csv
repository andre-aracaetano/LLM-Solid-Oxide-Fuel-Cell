1,14740,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are promising devices for electrical power generation from hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels.,CaO-SiO2-B2O3 Glass as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ceramics5040047
2,14740,"The paper reports our study of CaO-SiO2-B2O3 material with composition 36 mol.% SiO2, 26 mol.% B2O3, and 38 mol.% CaO as a high-temperature sealant for SOFCs with an operating temperature of 850 degrees C.",CaO-SiO2-B2O3 Glass as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ceramics5040047
3,14740,"The material was studied as an alternative to presently existing commercial glass and glass-ceramics sealants for SOFCs with operating temperature of 850 degrees C. Many of these sealants have limited adhesion to the surface of Crofer 22APU steel, commonly used in these SOFCs.",CaO-SiO2-B2O3 Glass as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ceramics5040047
4,14740,"The present study included X-ray diffraction, dilatometric, thermal, and microstructural analysis The study has shown that the softening point of the CaO-SiO2-B2O3 glass is around 900 degrees C, allowing sealing of the SOFCs with this glass at convenient temperature of 925 degrees C.",CaO-SiO2-B2O3 Glass as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ceramics5040047
5,14740,The CaO-SiO2-B2O3 glass sealant has shown excellent adhesion to the surface of Crofer 22APU steel; SEM images demonstrated evidences of chemical reaction and formation of strong interface on sealant-steel contact surface.,CaO-SiO2-B2O3 Glass as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ceramics5040047
6,14740,"Furthermore, the glass has shown a coefficient of thermal expansion about 8.4 x 10(-6)",CaO-SiO2-B2O3 Glass as a Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ceramics5040047
