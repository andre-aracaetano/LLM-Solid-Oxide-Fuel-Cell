1,11504,A mathematical model was developed to investigate the coupled transport and electrochemical reactions in a nickel-yttrial-stablizeci zirconia (Ni-YSZ) anode for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Micro-scale modeling of a functionally graded Ni-YSZ anode,10.1002/ceat.200600385
2,11504,The modeling results were consistent with experimental data from the literature.,Micro-scale modeling of a functionally graded Ni-YSZ anode,10.1002/ceat.200600385
3,11504,"Comparison between conventional non-graded (uniform random composites) and two types of functionally graded electrodes (FGE), namely particle size graded and porosity graded SOFC anodes were conducted to evaluate the potential of FGE for SOFC.",Micro-scale modeling of a functionally graded Ni-YSZ anode,10.1002/ceat.200600385
4,11504,Improved performance of both types of FGE was observed due to reduced mass transport resistance and increased volumetric reactive surface area close to the electrode-electrolyte interface.,Micro-scale modeling of a functionally graded Ni-YSZ anode,10.1002/ceat.200600385
5,11504,It was found that the particle size graded SOFC anode showed the best performance.,Micro-scale modeling of a functionally graded Ni-YSZ anode,10.1002/ceat.200600385
6,11504,This paper demonstrates that the SOFC performance could be enhanced by modifying the microstructures of the electrodes.,Micro-scale modeling of a functionally graded Ni-YSZ anode,10.1002/ceat.200600385
7,11504,The results presented in this paper provide a better understanding of the working mechanisms of SOFC electrodes and could serve as an important reference for design optimizations.,Micro-scale modeling of a functionally graded Ni-YSZ anode,10.1002/ceat.200600385
