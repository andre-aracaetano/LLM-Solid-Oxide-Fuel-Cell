1,12435,A new proton-conducting ethane fuel cell (PC-EFC) anode material comprised of double-layered perovskite (Pr0.4Sr0.6)(3)(Fe0.86Mo0.15)(2)O-7 (DLP-PSFM) with uniformly dispersed in situ exsolution of Co-Fe alloy nanoparticles was prepared by annealing cubic perovskite Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Mo0.1O3-delta in a 10% H-2/N-2 reducing atmosphere at 900 degrees C.,Double-Layered Perovskite Anode with in Situ Exsolution of a Co-Fe Alloy To Cogenerate Ethylene and Electricity in a Proton-Conducting Ethane Fuel Cell,10.1021/acscatal.5b02296
2,12435,The BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-delta electrolyte-supported PC-EFC single cell fabricated with the new DLP-PSFM anode material has achieved a maximal output power density of 496.2 mW cm(-2) in H-2 and 348.84 mW cm(-2) in C2H6 at 750 degrees C.,Double-Layered Perovskite Anode with in Situ Exsolution of a Co-Fe Alloy To Cogenerate Ethylene and Electricity in a Proton-Conducting Ethane Fuel Cell,10.1021/acscatal.5b02296
3,12435,"In the meantime, a high ethylene yield, increasing from 13.2% at 650 C to 41.5% at 750 degrees C with a remarkable ethylene selectivity over 91% and no CO2 emission, was achieved because of the considerably efficient catalysis of in situ Co-Fe alloy nanoparticles that were homogeneously distributed on the DLP-PSFM backbone.",Double-Layered Perovskite Anode with in Situ Exsolution of a Co-Fe Alloy To Cogenerate Ethylene and Electricity in a Proton-Conducting Ethane Fuel Cell,10.1021/acscatal.5b02296
