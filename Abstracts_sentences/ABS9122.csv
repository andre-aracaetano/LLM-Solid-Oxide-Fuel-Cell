6,9122,"The transition between the fuel cell mode for power generation and the electrolysis mode for energy storage through hydrogen production was set considering the available renewable energy, the power demand of community members and the energy sell-back price in order to increase the auto-consumed amount as well as to favour the electricity exchange within the renewable energy community.",Modelling and optimal management of renewable energy communities using reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120657
7,9122,"Since the reversible solid oxide cell is the key-point in such a system, SIMFC-SIMEC (SIMulation of Fuel Cells and Electrolysis Cells), a physically based 2D model, allowed an effective prediction of cell behaviour deriving the efficiency of electricity and hydrogen production from local physico-chemical feature and working parameter gradients on each stacked cell plane.",Modelling and optimal management of renewable energy communities using reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.120657
