1,18927,Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of YSZ electrolyte films onto porous NiO-YSZ composite substrates that had been pre-coated with graphite thin layers was carried out in the following two means for solid oxide fuel cell application: one was EPD based on electrophoretic filtration by which YSZ films were formed on the reverse sides without the graphite layers; the other was EPD on a graphite thin layer pre-coated on the substrates.,Electrophoretic deposition for fabrication of YSZ electrolyte film on non-conducting porous NiO-YSZ composite substrate for intermediate temperature SOFC,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2006.04.175
