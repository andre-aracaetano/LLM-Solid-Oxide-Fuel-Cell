2,15040,"As a proof-of-concept, a new high-entropy perovskite oxide of La0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Ba0.1Sr0.1Co0.2Fe0.6Ni0.1Cu0.1O3-delta (HEP) is successfully synthesized by a facile one-pot combustion method and proposed as a potential cathode for SOFC at intermediate temperatures.",A high-entropy perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.159633
3,15040,The high-entropy HEP formed a single phase of cubic perovskite structure and matched well with the adjacent electrolyte of Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (GDC).,A high-entropy perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.159633

5,15040,"The high-entropy cathode of HEP achieved a much lower polarization resistance of 0.3 Omega.cm(2) on YSZ electrolyte at 800 degrees C, which was only half of 0.6 Omega.cm(2) for conventional La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta (LSF) cathode under same conditions.",A high-entropy perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.159633
6,15040,"The YSZ-based SOFC with HEP cathode exhibited an outstanding output performance of 714.5 mW.cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, indicating that the high-entropy perovskite as a new-type SOFC cathode is promising.",A high-entropy perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.159633
