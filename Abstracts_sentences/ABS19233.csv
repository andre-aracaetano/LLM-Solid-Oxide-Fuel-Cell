1,19233,"The formation of dense thin films to obtain an intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) that uses Ba(Ce1-xZrx)(0.9)Y0.1O3-alpha (BCZYO, x 0, 0.3, 1) as the proton conductor was attempted on a dense Pd substrate at low sintering temperatures by the metalorganic deposition (MOD) method.","Fabrication of Ba(Ce, Zr)0.9Y0.1O3-α Thin Film on a Dense Pd Substrate by Ultraviolet Metalorganic Deposition",10.1115/1.4004505
2,19233,A BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-alpha (BCYO) thin film (thickness 0.8 mu m) was prepared by MOD and then annealed at 850 degrees C on a Pd substrate with low heat resistance.,"Fabrication of Ba(Ce, Zr)0.9Y0.1O3-α Thin Film on a Dense Pd Substrate by Ultraviolet Metalorganic Deposition",10.1115/1.4004505
3,19233,"However, there are problems such as the very low density of the BCYO film and the presence of a PdO interlayer between the film and the Pd substrate.","Fabrication of Ba(Ce, Zr)0.9Y0.1O3-α Thin Film on a Dense Pd Substrate by Ultraviolet Metalorganic Deposition",10.1115/1.4004505
4,19233,"The densification of the crystallized BCYO thin film, which is about 0.5-mu m thick, was improved by introducing a UV-assisted MOD process.","Fabrication of Ba(Ce, Zr)0.9Y0.1O3-α Thin Film on a Dense Pd Substrate by Ultraviolet Metalorganic Deposition",10.1115/1.4004505
5,19233,Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) eliminated the PdO interlayer.,"Fabrication of Ba(Ce, Zr)0.9Y0.1O3-α Thin Film on a Dense Pd Substrate by Ultraviolet Metalorganic Deposition",10.1115/1.4004505
6,19233,"In addition, the formation of dense thin films of BCZYO was achieved by the same UV-MOD (RTA) method.","Fabrication of Ba(Ce, Zr)0.9Y0.1O3-α Thin Film on a Dense Pd Substrate by Ultraviolet Metalorganic Deposition",10.1115/1.4004505
7,19233,"Therefore, the successful application of UV-MOD (RTA) to the formation of BCZYO thin films at low sintering temperatures was established.","Fabrication of Ba(Ce, Zr)0.9Y0.1O3-α Thin Film on a Dense Pd Substrate by Ultraviolet Metalorganic Deposition",10.1115/1.4004505
