1,16438,"In this paper, we report on synthesis of highly pure La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM9182) powder with high crystallinity by mechanically activated (MA) self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), in which the synergy effects of MA and SHS on final and intermediate products were mainly examined.",Mechanically activated self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ as an electrolyte for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.094
2,16438,"In the experiments, raw materials of La2O3, SrCO3, Ga2O3, Mg and NaClO4 were fractured and well mixed by planetary ball milling for different periods from 0 h to 24 h, then the bottom surface of the green compacts were electrically ignited for producing pure LSGM9182 through the propagation of sustainable exothermic reaction.",Mechanically activated self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ as an electrolyte for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.094
3,16438,"The final and intermediate products, shortly after MA treatment, were characterized by XRD, SEM, XRF and particle size analyzer.",Mechanically activated self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ as an electrolyte for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.094
4,16438,"During the planetary ball milling, the raw materials became gradually amorphous due to disordering of crystal structure.",Mechanically activated self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ as an electrolyte for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.094
5,16438,"Interestingly, the longer milling operation caused the larger particle size of the raw material because nanoparticles, generated by the milling, became easily massed together.",Mechanically activated self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ as an electrolyte for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.094
6,16438,"More significantly, the MA pretreatment improved a reactivity of the SHS to purify the product.",Mechanically activated self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ as an electrolyte for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.094
7,16438,"In particular, the combination of MA-SHS with ball milling of 24 h at 300 rpm gave the highest-grade LSGM9182 product of nano-sized primary particles.",Mechanically activated self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ as an electrolyte for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.094
8,16438,"The results appealed that the SHS after the MA treatment was quite effective for initiating, activating, sustaining and completing the solid-solid reaction synthesis of functional perovskite-type oxide with mild exothermic heat.",Mechanically activated self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ as an electrolyte for SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.094
