1,1315,Anode current collection points (ACCPs) were fabricated on the outside surface of a tubular anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Anode Current Collecting Efficiency of Tubular Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000053
2,1315,The ACCPs were distributed axially along the SOFC tube with the distance between every adjacent two ACCPs the same.,Anode Current Collecting Efficiency of Tubular Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000053
3,1315,The effect of collecting current with different number of ACCPs on the performance of the SOFC was studied.,Anode Current Collecting Efficiency of Tubular Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000053
4,1315,"It was found that with the same effective area, using more ACCPs to collect the current leads to better perfor-mance, while with a SOFC with a determined total surface area, there is an optimum number of ACCPs to be made and used considering the area occupied by the ACCPs themselves.",Anode Current Collecting Efficiency of Tubular Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000053
