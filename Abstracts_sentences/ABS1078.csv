1,1078,The GdBaFeNiO5+delta (GBFN) oxide is prepared by the citric-nitrate process and investigated as a novel cathode material for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,A novel cobalt-free layered perovskite-type GdBaFeNiO5+δ cathode material for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.046
2,1078,"The conductivities of GBFN reach a maximum of 112 S cm(-1) under argon, 161 S cm(-1) under air and 185 S cm(-1) under oxygen at 375 degrees C. An anode-supported BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-alpha (BZCY) electrolyte membrane is successfully fabricated by a simple, cost-effective spin coating process.",A novel cobalt-free layered perovskite-type GdBaFeNiO5+δ cathode material for proton-conducting intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.046
