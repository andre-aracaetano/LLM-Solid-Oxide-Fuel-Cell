4,2436,Her; we demonstrate for the first time the growth of epitaxial cathode materials on metal substrates (stainless steel) commercially supplied with epitaxial electrolyte layers (1.5 mu m (Y2O3)(0.)(15)(ZrO2)(0.)(85) (YSZ) + 50 nm CeO2).,Route to High-Performance Micro-solid Oxide Fuel Cells on Metallic Substrates,10.1021/acsami.0c15368
5,2436,"We create epitaxial mesoporous cathodes of (La0.60Sr0.40)(0.)95Co0.20Fe0.80O3 (LSCF) on the substrate by growing LSCF/MgO vertically aligned nanocomposite films by pulsed laser deposition, followed by selectively etching out the MgO. To enable valid comparison with the literature, the cathodes are also grown on single-crystal substrates, confirming state-of-the-art performance with an area specific resistance of 100 Omega cm(2) at 500 degrees C and activation energy down to 0.97 eV. The work marks an important step toward the commercialization of high-performance micro-solid oxide fuel cells for portable power applications.",Route to High-Performance Micro-solid Oxide Fuel Cells on Metallic Substrates,10.1021/acsami.0c15368
