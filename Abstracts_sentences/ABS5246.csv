2,5246,"Herein, a series Ruddlesden-Popper oxides, Sr3_xLaxFe2O7_delta (SLFx), are successfully synthesized and evaluated as potential cathode materials for SOFC.",Highly electrocatalytic activity Ruddlesden_Popper type electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.10.028
3,5246,"The oxygen desorption behavior, electrochemical activity and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics of the SLFx cathodes are systematically discussed.",Highly electrocatalytic activity Ruddlesden_Popper type electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.10.028
4,5246,"The Sr2.9La0.1Fe2O7_delta (SLF10) cathode exhibits highest oxygen vacancy concentration and excellent electrocatalytic performance, as evidenced by a low polarization resistance of 0.14 omega cm2 and high maximum power density of 0.77 W cm_ 2 at 700 degrees C. From electrochemical impedance spectra and distribution of relaxation times analysis, the oxygen adsorption/desorption process is the rate-limiting step toward ORR at the cathode interface.",Highly electrocatalytic activity Ruddlesden_Popper type electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.10.028
5,5246,"Furthermore, SLF10 shows considerable polarization overpotentials in both SOFC and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) modes, indicating that SLF10 is a promising bifunctional electrode for electrocatalytic oxygen reaction.",Highly electrocatalytic activity Ruddlesden_Popper type electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.10.028
