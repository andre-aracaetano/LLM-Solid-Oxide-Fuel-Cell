2,19220,"An YSZ layer is then deposited by dip coating as the electrolyte and subsequently, standard La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM)/YSZ composites were deposited by dip coating as oxygen electrodes.",Highly stable microtubular cells for portable solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.11.150
3,19220,"Microstructure of the anode support was optimized in order to achieve the maximum fuel utilization and as a consequence, a high performance of the cells.",Highly stable microtubular cells for portable solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.11.150
4,19220,"Experiments as a function of the fuel composition showed power densities above 500 mWcm(-2) at 800 degrees C at 0.7V, with high fuel utilization (similar to 75%).",Highly stable microtubular cells for portable solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.11.150
5,19220,Long-term durability studies were also performed for a period above 1000 hours.,Highly stable microtubular cells for portable solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.11.150
6,19220,"The experiment was conducted at 800 degrees C using pure humidified hydrogen at a fixed voltage of 0.8V. It was observed that the current density of the cell is significantly evolving during the initial period of about 100 hours, as a consequence of reconditioning of nickel particles at the anode support.",Highly stable microtubular cells for portable solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.11.150
7,19220,"Once the system is stabilized, no degradation was observed up to 1000 hours under operating conditions, obtaining current densities in the range of 400 mAcm(-2) at 0.8V and 800 degrees C.
