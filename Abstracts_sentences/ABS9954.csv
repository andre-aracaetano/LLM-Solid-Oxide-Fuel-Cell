1,9954,Interaction between (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.90)MnO3 (LSM) cathode and newly developed Ni-Mo-Cr metallic interconnect is investigated at 900 degrees C under operation conditions of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,"Interaction between (La, Sr)MnO3 cathode and Ni-Mo-Cr metallic interconnect with suppressed chromium vaporization for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.05.085
2,9954,The results show that chromium deposition on the LSM cathodes in the presence of Ni-Mo-Cr interconnect is remarkably reduced as compared to that in the presence of a conventional Fe-Cr metallic interconnect (RA446).,"Interaction between (La, Sr)MnO3 cathode and Ni-Mo-Cr metallic interconnect with suppressed chromium vaporization for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.05.085
3,9954,"In contact with the Ni-Mo-Cr interconnect the overpotential, eta, for the O-2 reduction reaction on LSM cathode decreased from 529 to Ill mV during the 1200 min current passage at 200 mA/cm(2).","Interaction between (La, Sr)MnO3 cathode and Ni-Mo-Cr metallic interconnect with suppressed chromium vaporization for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.05.085
4,9954,"In contrast, eta increased from 464 to 561 mV for the reaction in the presence of a RA446 interconnect.","Interaction between (La, Sr)MnO3 cathode and Ni-Mo-Cr metallic interconnect with suppressed chromium vaporization for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.05.085
5,9954,The decrease in eta clearly indicates that chromium poisoning effect of the Ni-Mo-Cr interconnect is also significantly suppressed as compared to that with conventional Fe-Cr interconnect materials.,"Interaction between (La, Sr)MnO3 cathode and Ni-Mo-Cr metallic interconnect with suppressed chromium vaporization for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.05.085
6,9954,The suppressed Cr deposition and poisoning effects observed on the LSM cathodes demonstrate promising potential of the Ni-Mo-Cr alloy as new interconnect materials with significant suppressed chromium vaporization and deposition for SOFCs.,"Interaction between (La, Sr)MnO3 cathode and Ni-Mo-Cr metallic interconnect with suppressed chromium vaporization for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.05.085
