4,14658,"After heat treatment at 800 degrees C for 100 h, the LSCM/Crofer22H sample contains SrCrO3, a compound with good conductivity; the area specific resistance (ASR) for the LSCM/Crofer22H interconnect is approximately 17-40 m Omega cm(2).",Effect of La0.1Sr0.9Co0.5Mn0.5O3-δ protective coating layer on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.017
5,14658,"We found that the amount of (Mn0.98Fe0.02)(Mn0.02Fe0.48Cr1.5)O-4, Cr3O4, and (Fe,Cr)(2)O-3 oxides form in LSCF/LSCM/Crofer22H is significantly less than that in LSCF/Crofer22H. LSCF conductivity after heating at 800 degrees C for 100 h, is notably higher when in contact with LSCM/Crofer22H than it is when in contact with Crofer22H. These results demonstrate that the LSCM protective coating prevents LSCF cathode poisoning by Cr evaporated from the Corfer22H interconnects.",Effect of La0.1Sr0.9Co0.5Mn0.5O3-δ protective coating layer on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.017
