1,14693,"These last past years, a major interest has been devoted to decrease the working temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) down to about 700 degrees C. Apatite materials (La10-xSrxSi6O27-x/2) are attractive candidates for solid electrolytes, with a high ionic conductivity at these intermediate temperatures.","Sintering kinetics and oxide ion conduction in Sr-doped apatite-type lanthanum silicates, La9Sr1Si6O26.5",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.10.009
2,14693,"An apatite powder (x = 1) with a 0.75 mu m mean particle size, produced by solid state reaction, was tape cast to obtain green sheets with a thickness of about 260 mu m. On one hand, the densification mechanism of the apatite ceramic during the intermediate solid state sintering has been approached.","Sintering kinetics and oxide ion conduction in Sr-doped apatite-type lanthanum silicates, La9Sr1Si6O26.5",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.10.009
3,14693,"It appeared from the kinetical tests performed under isothermal conditions between 1250 and 1550 degrees C, that densification could be controlled by the diffusion at grain boundaries of the rare-earth element, La, with an activation energy of 470 kJ/mol.","Sintering kinetics and oxide ion conduction in Sr-doped apatite-type lanthanum silicates, La9Sr1Si6O26.5",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.10.009
4,14693,"On the other hand, conductivity measurements were performed on apatite samples sintered at 1400 and 1500 degrees C.","Sintering kinetics and oxide ion conduction in Sr-doped apatite-type lanthanum silicates, La9Sr1Si6O26.5",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.10.009
