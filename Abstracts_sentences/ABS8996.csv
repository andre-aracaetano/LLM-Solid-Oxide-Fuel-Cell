1,8996,One of Bitcoin's most significant problems is its seemingly insatiable use of electricity.,Economic viability of bitcoin mining using a renewable-based SOFC power system to supply the electrical power demand,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117843
2,8996,"In the present research, along with providing the required power for Bitcoin (BTC) mining, a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system fed either by natural gas or biogas as a renewable source of energy is used to supply the electricity demand.",Economic viability of bitcoin mining using a renewable-based SOFC power system to supply the electrical power demand,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117843
3,8996,Thermodynamic modeling for the fuel cell system is applied to determine the required biogas or natural gas.,Economic viability of bitcoin mining using a renewable-based SOFC power system to supply the electrical power demand,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117843
4,8996,"For the proposed cases (grid-based, natural gas-fed SOFC and biogas fed SOFC), various scenarios depending on the Bitcoin price and mining difficulty are proposed.",Economic viability of bitcoin mining using a renewable-based SOFC power system to supply the electrical power demand,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117843
5,8996,"Also, the economic viability for each scenario in several countries is investigated and compared.",Economic viability of bitcoin mining using a renewable-based SOFC power system to supply the electrical power demand,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117843
6,8996,"Results indicate more profitability for grid-based mining in Bitcoin prices up to $20,000, but as the Bitcoin price increases SOFC based mining operations achieve reasonable profitability.",Economic viability of bitcoin mining using a renewable-based SOFC power system to supply the electrical power demand,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117843
7,8996,"It is shown that Iran, Russia, and China with cumulative cash flows of $87,300, $77,200 and $70,500 respectively, are the best countries to mine BTC using grid electricity while Iran, Canada and Russia are the best countries using a natural gas-fed SOFC system.",Economic viability of bitcoin mining using a renewable-based SOFC power system to supply the electrical power demand,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117843
8,8996,"While the profitability of SOFC-based mining is lower than grid-based mining, the latter method compensates with better sustainability and lower environmental costs.",Economic viability of bitcoin mining using a renewable-based SOFC power system to supply the electrical power demand,10.1016/j.energy.2020.117843
