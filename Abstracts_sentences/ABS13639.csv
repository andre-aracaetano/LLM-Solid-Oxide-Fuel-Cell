1,13639,The high fuel efficiency of lean-burn engines is associated with high temperature and excess oxygen during combustion and thus is associated with high-concentration NOx emission.,Simultaneous NOx and Hydrocarbon Emissions Control for Lean-Burn Engines Using Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell at Open Circuit,10.1021/es2033058
2,13639,This work reveals that very high concentration of NOx in the exhaust can be reduced and hydrocarbons (HCs) can be simultaneously oxidized using a low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Simultaneous NOx and Hydrocarbon Emissions Control for Lean-Burn Engines Using Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell at Open Circuit,10.1021/es2033058
3,13639,"An SOFC unit is constructed with Ni-YSZ as the anode, YSZ as the electrolyte, and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (ISC)-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 as the cathode, with or without adding vanadium to LSC.",Simultaneous NOx and Hydrocarbon Emissions Control for Lean-Burn Engines Using Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell at Open Circuit,10.1021/es2033058
4,13639,"SOFC operation at 4.50 degrees C and open circuit can effectively treat NOx over the cathode at a very high concentration in the simulated exhaust, Higher NOx concentration up to 5000 ppm can result in a larger NOx to N-2 rate.",Simultaneous NOx and Hydrocarbon Emissions Control for Lean-Burn Engines Using Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell at Open Circuit,10.1021/es2033058
5,13639,"Moreover, a higher oxygen concentration promotes NO conversion.",Simultaneous NOx and Hydrocarbon Emissions Control for Lean-Burn Engines Using Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell at Open Circuit,10.1021/es2033058
6,13639,Complete oxidation of HCs can be achieved by adding silver to the LSC current collecting layer.,Simultaneous NOx and Hydrocarbon Emissions Control for Lean-Burn Engines Using Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell at Open Circuit,10.1021/es2033058
7,13639,"The SOFC-based emissions control system can treat NOx and HCs simultaneously, and can be operated without consuming the anode fuel (a reductant) at near the engine exhaust temperature to eliminate the need for reductant refilling and extra heating.",Simultaneous NOx and Hydrocarbon Emissions Control for Lean-Burn Engines Using Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell at Open Circuit,10.1021/es2033058
