1,8337,This work analyzes different models to describe internal methane reforming in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,On the effect of methane internal reforming modelling in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.024
2,8337,Two approaches have been generally used for it: equilibrium and kinetics.,On the effect of methane internal reforming modelling in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.024
3,8337,In the first case-equilibrium-methane reforming is considered to be fast enough to reach equilibrium.,On the effect of methane internal reforming modelling in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.024
4,8337,"Contrarily, kinetics-based theories assume that the reforming reaction is very slow and does not reach equilibrium.",On the effect of methane internal reforming modelling in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.024
5,8337,"in this case, a reforming rate equation is needed.",On the effect of methane internal reforming modelling in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.024
6,8337,"Four cases are considered: one equilibrium model, two kinetics models and a mixed model.",On the effect of methane internal reforming modelling in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.024
7,8337,Results show that methane reforming does not follow a unique pattern along the anodic duct and a local detailed analysis is demanded.,On the effect of methane internal reforming modelling in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.024
8,8337,"Furthermore, a mixed model must be used for multidimensional SOFC modelling, although equilibrium is globally satisfactory and, therefore, it is appropriate for 0-D models.",On the effect of methane internal reforming modelling in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.024
