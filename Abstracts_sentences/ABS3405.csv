1,3405,"Purpose - The paper aims to present the innovative design of a planar multilayered high temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), which is easy to manufacture, and features high resistance to rapid temperature changes.",Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
2,3405,"Temperature resistance was accomplished thanks to easy to heat, thin flat ceramic structure of the cell and elimination of metallic interconnections.",Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
3,3405,Design/methodology/approach - The ceramic fuel cell consists of the anode core made of six to eight layers of nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia tapes (Ni/YSZ) isostatically pressed into a laminate.,Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
4,3405,Two networks of fuel distribution microchannels are engraved on both sides of the anode laminate.,Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
5,3405,The microchannels are subsequently covered with a thin layer of the functional anode tape made of Ni/YSZ and a solid electrolyte tape made of YSZ.,Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
6,3405,Findings - The single planar double-sided ceramic SOFC of dimensions 19 x 60 x 1.2 mm(3) provides 3.2 Watts of electric power.,Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
7,3405,The prototype of the battery which consists of four SOFCs provides an output power of > 12 W. Tests show that the stack is resistant to the rapid temperature change.,Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
8,3405,"If inserted into a chamber preheated to 800 degrees C, the stack provides the full power within 5 minutes.",Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
9,3405,Multiple cycling does not destroy the stack.,Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
10,3405,Originality/value - This anode-supported fuel cell structure is provided with thin anode functional layers suspended on a large number of fine beams.,Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
11,3405,"The whole anode structure is made with the same ceramic material, so the mechanical stress is minimized during the cell operation.",Stack of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1108/MI-12-2013-0081
