1,10338,Uniform submicron La2NiO4+delta (sm-LNO) powders have been synthesized by a facile polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-assisted hydrothermal route.,Preparation of La2NiO4+δ powders as a cathode material for SOFC via a PVP-assisted hydrothermal route,10.1007/s10008-014-2667-9
2,10338,"In the presence of PVP, sm-LNO of pure phase has been obtained by calcination at the relatively low temperature of 900 A degrees C for 8 h. Compared micron-sized LNO (m-LNO) particles obtained at 1,000 A degrees C by hydrothermal synthesis route without PVP assisted, the sm-LNO-PVP displays regularly shaped and well-distributed particles in the range of 0.3-0.5 mu m.",Preparation of La2NiO4+δ powders as a cathode material for SOFC via a PVP-assisted hydrothermal route,10.1007/s10008-014-2667-9
3,10338,The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that the sm-LNO sample is submicronic and that the m-LNO sample shows agglomerates with a broad size distribution.,Preparation of La2NiO4+δ powders as a cathode material for SOFC via a PVP-assisted hydrothermal route,10.1007/s10008-014-2667-9
4,10338,The electrochemical performance of m-LNO and sm-LNO-PVP has been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.,Preparation of La2NiO4+δ powders as a cathode material for SOFC via a PVP-assisted hydrothermal route,10.1007/s10008-014-2667-9
5,10338,"The polarization resistance of the sm-LNO-PVP cathode reaches a value of 0.40 Omega cm(2) at 750 A degrees C, which is lower than that of m-LNO (0.62 Omega cm(2)).",Preparation of La2NiO4+δ powders as a cathode material for SOFC via a PVP-assisted hydrothermal route,10.1007/s10008-014-2667-9
6,10338,"This result indicates that a fine electrode microstructure with submicron particles can help to increase the active sites, accelerate oxygen diffusion, and reduce polarization resistance.",Preparation of La2NiO4+δ powders as a cathode material for SOFC via a PVP-assisted hydrothermal route,10.1007/s10008-014-2667-9
7,10338,An anode-supported single cell with sm-LNO cathode has been fabricated and tested over a temperature range from 650 to 800 A degrees C.,Preparation of La2NiO4+δ powders as a cathode material for SOFC via a PVP-assisted hydrothermal route,10.1007/s10008-014-2667-9
8,10338,The maximum power density of the cell has achieved 834 mW cm(-2) at 750 A degrees C.,Preparation of La2NiO4+δ powders as a cathode material for SOFC via a PVP-assisted hydrothermal route,10.1007/s10008-014-2667-9
9,10338,These results therefore show that this PVP-assisted hydrothermal method is an effective approach to construct submicron-structured cathode and enhance the performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell.,Preparation of La2NiO4+δ powders as a cathode material for SOFC via a PVP-assisted hydrothermal route,10.1007/s10008-014-2667-9
