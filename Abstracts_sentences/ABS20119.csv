1,20119,"An SOFC-anode material, Sr2MgMoO6-delta, is investigated for both isovalent and aliovalent substitution effects at its redox-active cation site.",Isovalent and aliovalent substitution effects on redox chemistry of Sr2MgMoO6-δ SOFC-anode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.037
2,20119,"Isovalent W-VI-for-Mo-VI substitution has little effect on crystal and redox chemistry of the phase, whereas aliovalent Nb-V-for-Mo-VI substitution lowers the degree of cation order and, rather importantly, creates oxygen vacancies in the lattice.",Isovalent and aliovalent substitution effects on redox chemistry of Sr2MgMoO6-δ SOFC-anode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.037
3,20119,"The increased oxygen-vacancy concentration should be a positive factor regarding the SOFC-anode performance, but a disadvantage is that electrical conductivity is slightly depressed in Sr2Mg(Mo,Nb)O6-delta with increasing Nb content.",Isovalent and aliovalent substitution effects on redox chemistry of Sr2MgMoO6-δ SOFC-anode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.037

5,20119,"Sr2Mg(Mo,W)O6-delta and Sr2Mg(Mo,Nb)O6-delta, are found stable (up to 1000 degrees C or higher) in both reductive (5% H-2/Ar) and oxidative (air) atmospheres, the range of oxygen-content variation upon such redox-cycling getting narrower with increasing substitution level.",Isovalent and aliovalent substitution effects on redox chemistry of Sr2MgMoO6-δ SOFC-anode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.037
6,20119,"XANES data at the L edges of Mo, W and Nb reveal that in Sr2Mg(Mo,W)O6-delta both Mo and W show variable oxidation states whereas in Sr2Mg(Mo,Nb)O6-delta Nb is more redox-active than Mo.
