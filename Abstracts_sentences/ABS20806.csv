5,20806,"The results show that the parameters can give a qualitatively correct phase ordering of zirconia, where the tetragonal phase is more stable than the cubic phase at a lower temperature.","Development of Density-Functional Tight-Binding Parameters for the Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Zirconia, Yttria, and Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia",10.1021/acsomega.1c02411
6,20806,"The lattice parameters are only slightly overestimated by 0.05-0.1 A (2% error), still within the typical accuracy of first-principles methods.","Development of Density-Functional Tight-Binding Parameters for the Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Zirconia, Yttria, and Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia",10.1021/acsomega.1c02411
7,20806,"Additionally, the MD results confirm that zirconia and yttria phases are stable against transformations under standard conditions.","Development of Density-Functional Tight-Binding Parameters for the Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Zirconia, Yttria, and Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia",10.1021/acsomega.1c02411
8,20806,"The parameterization also predicts that vibrational spectra are within the range of 100-1000 cm(-1) for zirconia and 100-800 cm(-1) for yttria, which is in good agreement with predictions both from full quantum mechanics and a recently developed classical force field.","Development of Density-Functional Tight-Binding Parameters for the Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Zirconia, Yttria, and Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia",10.1021/acsomega.1c02411
9,20806,"To further demonstrate the advantage of the developed DFTB parameters in terms of computational resources, we conducted DFTB/MD simulations of the YSZ4 and YS12 models containing approximately 750 atoms.","Development of Density-Functional Tight-Binding Parameters for the Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Zirconia, Yttria, and Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia",10.1021/acsomega.1c02411
