4,16690,This fact increases significantly the access to active sites for the oxygen reduction.,Nanotubes of rare earth cobalt oxides for cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.049
5,16690,"We investigated the influence of the diameter of the precursor nanotubes on the polarization resistance of the LSCO cathodes on CeO(2)-10mol.% Sm(2)O(3) (SDC) electrolytes under air atmosphere, evaluated in symmetrical [LSCO/SDC/LSCO] cells.",Nanotubes of rare earth cobalt oxides for cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.049
6,16690,Our results indicate an optimized performance when the diameter of precursor nanotubes is sufficiently small to become dense nanorods after cathode sintering.,Nanotubes of rare earth cobalt oxides for cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.049
7,16690,We present a phenomenological model that successfully explains the behavior observed and considers that a small starting diameter acts as a barrier that prevents grains growth.,Nanotubes of rare earth cobalt oxides for cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.049
8,16690,"This is directly related with the lack of contact points between nanotubes in the precursor, which are the only path for the growth of ceramic grains.",Nanotubes of rare earth cobalt oxides for cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.049
9,16690,We also observed that a conventional sintering process (of 1 h at 1000 degrees C with heating and cooling rates of 10 degrees C min(-1)) has to be preferred against a fast firing one (1 or 2 min at 1100 degrees C with heating and cooling rates of 100 degrees C min(-1)) in order to reach a higher performance.,Nanotubes of rare earth cobalt oxides for cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.049
10,16690,"However, a good adhesion of the cathode can be achieved with both methods.",Nanotubes of rare earth cobalt oxides for cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.049
11,16690,Our results suggest that oxygen vacancy diffusion is enhanced while decreasing LSCO particle size.,Nanotubes of rare earth cobalt oxides for cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.049
12,16690,This indicates that the high performance of our nanostructured cathodes is not only related with the increase of the number of active sites for oxygen reduction but also to the fact that the nanotubes are formed by nanoparticles.,Nanotubes of rare earth cobalt oxides for cathodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.049
