3,18384,"Although the latter can be minimized by using dopant Cations with radii which match those of Zr(4+) (as in the case of Sc(3+)), the former appears as an intrinsic characteristic of the fluorite lattice that cannot be avoided and that is shown to be responsible for the occurrence of a maximum in the conductivity at dopant concentrations between 8 and 13%.","Structural Disorder in Doped Zirconias, Part II: Vacancy Ordering Effects and the Conductivity Maximum.",10.1021/cm102809t
4,18384,The weakness of the Sc-vacancy interactions in Sc(2)O(3)-dope zirconia confirms that this material is likely to present the highest conductivity achievable in zirconias.,"Structural Disorder in Doped Zirconias, Part II: Vacancy Ordering Effects and the Conductivity Maximum.",10.1021/cm102809t
