1,14190,The utilization of gas-atomized Co-Mn based alloy precursor is a promising approach to lowering the sintering temperature of the spinel contact layer and enhancing its performance.,Conductive spinels derived from Co-Mn based alloy precursor for SOFC cathode-side contact application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.153
2,14190,"In this study, simulated interconnect/contact/cathode cells are employed to investigate the effects of different metallic precursors (i.e., three Co-Mn based alloy powders and a mixture of Co + MnO2 powders) on the microstructure and performance of the reactively-sintered MnCo2O4-based contact layer.",Conductive spinels derived from Co-Mn based alloy precursor for SOFC cathode-side contact application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.153
3,14190,"While excellent overall electrical performance is observed for all the cells with the four contact precursors during 1000-h testing at 800 degrees C in air, the cell with the Ce-doped alloy contact precursor shows the lowest cell area specific resistance (ASR) and ASR degradation rate.",Conductive spinels derived from Co-Mn based alloy precursor for SOFC cathode-side contact application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.153
4,14190,Cross-sectional observation of the tested cells is conducted to assess the compatibility of the contact layer with adjacent components as well as its effectiveness in reducing the Cr2O3 scale growth and blocking Cr migration from the interconnect to the cathode.,Conductive spinels derived from Co-Mn based alloy precursor for SOFC cathode-side contact application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.153
