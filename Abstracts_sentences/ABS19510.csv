1,19510,The stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta impregnated Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (LSCF-YSZ) cathodes was investigated under the condition of open circuit or current polarization at 750 degrees C in air.,Performance stability of impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 cathodes of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.12.073
2,19510,The electrochemical measurement and the microstructure characteristic show that the flattening of LSCF particles has great contribution to the increase of resistance of LSCF-YSZ cathodes after 500 h heat treatment at 750 degrees C. Microstructure coarsening and the damage of well-connected porous structure are main reasons of the performance degradation for LSCF-YSZ cathodes testing at 200 mA cm(-2) and 750 degrees C in air.,Performance stability of impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 cathodes of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.12.073
