5,10354,The Ag atom migration along the MnO2 surface is similar to 0.5 eV which could lead to a fast clustering of adsorbates at moderate temperatures whereas the adhesion energy of silver monolayer is relatively low which could indicate its mechanical instability.,First principles modeling of Ag adsorption on the LaMnO3 (001) surfaces,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.09.039
