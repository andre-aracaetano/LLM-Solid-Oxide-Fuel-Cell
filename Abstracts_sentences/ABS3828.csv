3,3828,The cell with a LSCF-0.25 wt% TiO2 cathode exhibited a current density that was 1.6 times larger than that with a pure LSCF cathode at 0.7 V and 600 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectra showed the accelerated incorporation of oxygen anions into the YSZ electrolyte with the TiO2-modified LSCF cathode.,TiO2-modified La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1872-2067(14)60235-7
4,3828,The improvement was attributed to the suppressed formation of a non-conductive SrZrO3 layer at the cathode/electrolyte interface.,TiO2-modified La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1872-2067(14)60235-7
