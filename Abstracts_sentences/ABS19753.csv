1,19753,Chemical adsorption of CO2 in composite cathodes at high temperatures plays a significant role in the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into fuels in efficient solid oxide electrolysers.,Remarkable chemical adsorption of manganese-doped titanate for direct carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1039/c4ta00344f
2,19753,"In this work, the active Mn with multi-oxidation states is introduced into the B-site lattice of the redox-stable (La, Sr)TiO3+delta to create oxygen vacancies both in the bulk and on the surface.",Remarkable chemical adsorption of manganese-doped titanate for direct carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1039/c4ta00344f
3,19753,The ionic conductivities of the Mn-doped titanate are remarkably enhanced by 1-2 orders of magnitude at intermediate temperatures in reducing or oxidizing atmospheres.,Remarkable chemical adsorption of manganese-doped titanate for direct carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1039/c4ta00344f
4,19753,The chemical adsorption of CO2 is accordingly enhanced by approximately 1 order of magnitude for the Mn-doped titanate and the onset temperature of strong chemical desorption is consequently extended to as high as approximately 800 degrees C of the common operation temperature of solid oxide carbon dioxide electrolysers.,Remarkable chemical adsorption of manganese-doped titanate for direct carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1039/c4ta00344f
5,19753,"First principles calculations reveal that oxygen vacancy defect sites created by Mn dopants substantially contribute to the chemical adsorption of CO2 and the strong bonding of the oxide ions in CO2 to the nearest cations on the (La, Sr)O- or (Ti, Mn)O-2-terminated facets not only activates CO2 molecules but also considerably increases the desorption temperature.",Remarkable chemical adsorption of manganese-doped titanate for direct carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1039/c4ta00344f
6,19753,The highest current efficiencies of approximately 100% are obtained with the Mn-doped titanate cathodes for the direct electrolysis of CO2 in oxide ion-conducting solid oxide electrolysers.,Remarkable chemical adsorption of manganese-doped titanate for direct carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1039/c4ta00344f
