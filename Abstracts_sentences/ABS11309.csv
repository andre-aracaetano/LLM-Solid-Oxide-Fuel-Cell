6,11309,"Besides the investigation of silicon and sulfur contamination, the present work focused on chromium from high-temperature alloys used in Balance-of-Plant (BoP) components in direct contact with the airflow.",Air side contamination in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack testing,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.058
7,11309,"Concentrations of volatile Cr-species under SOFC testing conditions were compared to Cr-accumulation on the tested cell as well as to Cr-evaporation rates from BoP alloys, which were individually characterized regarding oxidation behavior.",Air side contamination in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack testing,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.058
8,11309,"Evaporated Cr quantities were found to saturate the air with Cr-vapors at the cathode air-inlet, as confirmed by the in-situ measurement of volatile species in the hot airflow, and correlate well to accumulated Cr in the cell after long term testing.",Air side contamination in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack testing,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.058
