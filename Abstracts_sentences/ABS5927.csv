2,5927,The phase instability will restrict their high temperature applications such as cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Overcoming phase instability of RBaCo2O5+δ (R = Y and Ho) by Sr substitution for application as cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.09.001
3,5927,"However, appropriate amount of Sr substitution (>= 60% for R = Y and >= 70% for R = Ho) for Ba successfully stabilized the R(Ba1-xSrx)Co2O5+delta phase at elevated temperatures.",Overcoming phase instability of RBaCo2O5+δ (R = Y and Ho) by Sr substitution for application as cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.09.001
4,5927,"This can be explained to be due to the decrease in oxygen vacancies in the R-O layer, decrease in R-O bond length, and consequent improvement in structural integrity.",Overcoming phase instability of RBaCo2O5+δ (R = Y and Ho) by Sr substitution for application as cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.09.001
5,5927,"In addition, the Sr substitution (x = 0.6-1.0) for Ba provided added benefit with respect to the chemical stability against Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC) electrolyte, which is a critical requirement for the cathodes in SOFC.",Overcoming phase instability of RBaCo2O5+δ (R = Y and Ho) by Sr substitution for application as cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.09.001
