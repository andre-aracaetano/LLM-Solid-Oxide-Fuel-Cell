2,16394,As the Ga content increases the symmetry of the unit cell varies from tetragonal for the samples with x=0 and 0.3 to orthorhombic for the x=0.8 sample.,Effects of Ga substitution on the high temperature properties of the n=3 Ruddlesden Popper system LaSr3Fe1.5-x/2Co1.5-x/2GaxO10-δ (0≤x≤0.8),10.1016/j.ssi.2010.05.056
3,16394,"Due to the fixed Ga+3 oxidation state, the substitution of Ga for Fe and Co increases the oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples at room temperature while it decreases the variation of the oxygen content with temperature.",Effects of Ga substitution on the high temperature properties of the n=3 Ruddlesden Popper system LaSr3Fe1.5-x/2Co1.5-x/2GaxO10-δ (0≤x≤0.8),10.1016/j.ssi.2010.05.056
4,16394,The total expansion coefficient of the LaSr3Fe1.5-x/2 Co1.5-x/2GaxO10-delta specimen in the temperature range 80 <= T <= 900 degrees C decreases with increasing Ga content due to the suppression of the chemical expansion at high temperature.,Effects of Ga substitution on the high temperature properties of the n=3 Ruddlesden Popper system LaSr3Fe1.5-x/2Co1.5-x/2GaxO10-δ (0≤x≤0.8),10.1016/j.ssi.2010.05.056
