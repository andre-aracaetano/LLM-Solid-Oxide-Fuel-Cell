1,1481,"The activation energy for the removal of surface carbon formed by methane decomposition following high-temperature reforming, from a nickel/zirconia solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode has been calculated using two methods based on temperature-programmed oxidation.",Calculation of the metal-carbon bond strength of surface carbon deposited on solid oxide fuel cell nickel/zirconia fuel reforming anodes,10.1023/A:1019053204825
2,1481,It is found that the re is a fairly good agreement between the two methods.,Calculation of the metal-carbon bond strength of surface carbon deposited on solid oxide fuel cell nickel/zirconia fuel reforming anodes,10.1023/A:1019053204825
3,1481,"In addition, it was observed that the addition of small quantities of lithium to the anode resulted in a significant lowering of the activation energy for surface carbon removal by about 50 kJ mol(-1).",Calculation of the metal-carbon bond strength of surface carbon deposited on solid oxide fuel cell nickel/zirconia fuel reforming anodes,10.1023/A:1019053204825
