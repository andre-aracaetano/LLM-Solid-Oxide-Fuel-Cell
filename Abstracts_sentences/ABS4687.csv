1,4687,Conditioning biogas to achieve natural gas quality for direct feeding into the supply network is frequently discussed as an alternative to local energy production with cogeneration of biogas in block heat power plants.,Ideal application of biogas in Germany under the aspect of climate protection,
2,4687,"Although the degree of efficiency in direct gas feeding is essentially better (71.3 % secondary energy out of primary energy) than in local cogeneration (45.7-57.8 % secondary energy out of primary energy), the greenhouse gas emission reduction potential of local cogeneration in Germany (254-350 g CO2/kWh(biogas)) is much higher than that of direct gas feeding (187-228 9 CO2/kWh(biogas)).",Ideal application of biogas in Germany under the aspect of climate protection,
3,4687,"The reason for this is that in Germany natural gas, which is substituted through direct gas feeding, is primarily used for heating purposes.",Ideal application of biogas in Germany under the aspect of climate protection,
4,4687,"Since natural gas has the lowest emissions of all fossil fuels, and as heating installations generate lower emissions per kilowatt hour than power generation, using biogas for direct gas feeding is not the best available solution as regards climate protection in the German context.",Ideal application of biogas in Germany under the aspect of climate protection,
5,4687,"Because of a higher emission factor for the production of electricity, its substitution with local power plants is privileged.",Ideal application of biogas in Germany under the aspect of climate protection,
6,4687,In particular this is true if waste heat arising from cogeneration can be used locally.,Ideal application of biogas in Germany under the aspect of climate protection,
7,4687,"By contrast with direct gas feeding, the application of innovative and efficient technologies like molten carbonate or solid oxide fuel cells can generate essential improvements of emission reductions in biogas plants.",Ideal application of biogas in Germany under the aspect of climate protection,
8,4687,"Thanks to higher efficiency factors for the production of electricity, the greenhouse gas reduction capacity of these fuel cells is much better compared with block heat and power plants, which represent the state-of-the-art.",Ideal application of biogas in Germany under the aspect of climate protection,
9,4687,"Even if no waste heat can be used at the location of the biogas plant, the application of fuel cells is still much better than direct gas feeding or block heat and power plants.",Ideal application of biogas in Germany under the aspect of climate protection,
10,4687,For this reason the use of fuel cells in German biogas plants should be promoted.,Ideal application of biogas in Germany under the aspect of climate protection,
