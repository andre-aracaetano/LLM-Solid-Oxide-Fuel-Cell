1,13637,"Spinel oxides with the general formula of (Mn,B)(3)O-4 (B = Co, Fe) were used as barrier materials between the cathode and the metallic interconnect to reduce the rate of cathode degradation by Cr poisoning.","The effect of doping (Mn,B)3O4 materials as protective layers in different metallic interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.109
2,13637,"The effect of doping at the B position was investigated terms of microstructure and electrical conductivity to determine its behaviour and effectiveness as a protective layer in contact with three metallic materials (Crofer 22 APU, SS430 and Conicro 4023 W 188).","The effect of doping (Mn,B)3O4 materials as protective layers in different metallic interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.109
3,13637,The analysis showed that the use of these materials considerably decreased the reactivity and diffusion of Cr between the cathode and the metallic interconnects.,"The effect of doping (Mn,B)3O4 materials as protective layers in different metallic interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.109
4,13637,The protective layer doped with Fe at the B position exhibited the least amount of reactivity with the interconnector and cathode materials.,"The effect of doping (Mn,B)3O4 materials as protective layers in different metallic interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.109
5,13637,The worst results were observed for SS430 cells coated with a protective layer perhaps due to their low Cr content.,"The effect of doping (Mn,B)3O4 materials as protective layers in different metallic interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.109
6,13637,The Crofer 22 APU and Conicro 4023 W 188 samples exhibited very similar conductivity results in the presence of the MnCo1.9Fe0.104 protective coating.,"The effect of doping (Mn,B)3O4 materials as protective layers in different metallic interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.109
7,13637,"As a result, these two material combinations are a promising option for use as bipolar plates in SOFC.","The effect of doping (Mn,B)3O4 materials as protective layers in different metallic interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.109
