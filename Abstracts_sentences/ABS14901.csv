1,14901,"A four-layer solid oxide fuel cell stack with planar anode-supported cells was operated galvanostatically at 700 degrees C and 0.5Acm(-2) for nearly 35,000 h. One of the four planes started to degrade more rapidly after 28,000 h and finally more progressively after 33,000 h. The stack was then shut down and a post-test analysis was carefully performed.","Post-test characterization of a solid oxide fuel cell stack operated for more than 30,000 hours: The cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.025
