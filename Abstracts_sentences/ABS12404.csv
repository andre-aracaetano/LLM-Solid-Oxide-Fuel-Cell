1,12404,Pr0.6Sr0.4FeO3 (PSF) and Pr0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Cu0.2O3 (PSFCu) perovskite materials were prepared by glycine nitrate method as a cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC).,Enhanced performance of nanocrystalline Cu-doped Pr0.6Sr0.4FeO3 as cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssc.2012.12.003
2,12404,The prepared PSF and PSFCu materials exhibited typical orthorhombic structure and highly porous morphology with high surface area (43-55 m(2)/g).,Enhanced performance of nanocrystalline Cu-doped Pr0.6Sr0.4FeO3 as cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssc.2012.12.003
3,12404,"Upon the 20% Cu doping on the B-site of the PSF, the electrical conductivity increased from 247 S cm(-1) (PSF cathode) to 298 S cm(-1) and polarization resistance of symmetry cell decreased from 0.21 Omega cm(2) (PSF cathode) to 0.14 Omega cm(2) as compared to PSF cathode (0.21 Omega cm(2)) at 850 degrees C. Cu doping in B-site of the perovskite generates the oxide ion vacancies which lead the high effective charge carriers, resulting in the enhanced electrochemical performance of PSFCu cathode.",Enhanced performance of nanocrystalline Cu-doped Pr0.6Sr0.4FeO3 as cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssc.2012.12.003
