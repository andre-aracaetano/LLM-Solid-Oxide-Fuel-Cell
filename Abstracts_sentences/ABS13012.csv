2,13012,These La1.7Ca0.3NixCu1-xO4-delta oxides have been evaluated as potential cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) with Ni-YSZ cermet supported type cells.,Hierarchically nanoporous La1.7Ca0.3CuO4-δ and La1.7Ca0.3NixCu1-xO4-δ (0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) as potential cathode materials for IT-SOFCs,10.1039/c5ta00983a
3,13012,"It was found that La1.7Ca0.3CuO4-delta cathode exhibits the maximum power density at high temperature (e.g., 1.5 W cm(-2) at 850 degrees C), while La1.7Ca0.3Ni0.75Cu0.25O4-delta cathode shows the highest power density at intermediate temperature (e.g. 0.71 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C) using humidified H-2 and air as the fuel and oxidant, respectively.",Hierarchically nanoporous La1.7Ca0.3CuO4-δ and La1.7Ca0.3NixCu1-xO4-δ (0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) as potential cathode materials for IT-SOFCs,10.1039/c5ta00983a
4,13012,"The electrochemical performance of single cells with La1.7Ca0.3Ni0.75Cu0.25O4-delta cathode materials with different morphologies demonstrated better performance in the intermediate temperature range when using the cathode prepared by the citrate-modified EISA method, which has a bigger grain size, but with higher surface area and pore volumes.",Hierarchically nanoporous La1.7Ca0.3CuO4-δ and La1.7Ca0.3NixCu1-xO4-δ (0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) as potential cathode materials for IT-SOFCs,10.1039/c5ta00983a
