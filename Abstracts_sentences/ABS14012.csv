3,14012,"In this work, the chemical compatibility between AMEOs and NiO-YSZ anode as well as their possible consequences were systematically investigated from both experimental and theoretical perspectives.",Temperature-dependent chemical incompatibility between NiO-YSZ anode and alkaline earth metal oxides: Implications for surface decoration of SOFC anode,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172150
4,14012,XRD analyses reveal that the chemical compatibility of AEMOs with NiO-YSZ is temperature-dependent.,Temperature-dependent chemical incompatibility between NiO-YSZ anode and alkaline earth metal oxides: Implications for surface decoration of SOFC anode,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172150
5,14012,The formation of alkaline earth metal (AEM) zirconates is detrimental to the oxygen ionic conductivity while the formation of AEMO-NiO solid solution suppresses the catalytic activity and electrical conductivity of Ni-YSZ anodes.,Temperature-dependent chemical incompatibility between NiO-YSZ anode and alkaline earth metal oxides: Implications for surface decoration of SOFC anode,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172150
6,14012,"The Ca, Sr and Ba enrichment in YSZ are observed, indicating the higher affinity of YSZ to AEMOs than that of NiO. Two potential strategies to preferentially deposit AEMO on Ni particles without chemical interaction are proposed.",Temperature-dependent chemical incompatibility between NiO-YSZ anode and alkaline earth metal oxides: Implications for surface decoration of SOFC anode,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.172150
