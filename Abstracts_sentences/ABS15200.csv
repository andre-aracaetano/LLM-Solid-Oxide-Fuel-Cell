3,15200,A special attention has been paid to take into account both (i) the heterogeneity of oxidation and (ii) the cermet visco-plasticity in operation.,Ni-8YSZ cermet re-oxidation of anode supported solid oxide fuel cell: From kinetics measurements to mechanical damage prediction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.019
4,15200,"Data required for the simulations - i.e. the oxidation kinetics rates, the cermet expansions and Young's modulus - were determined at T = 600, 700 and 800 degrees C. It has been found that the activation energy related to the kinetics of re-oxidation encounters a modification at high temperature (700-750 degrees C).",Ni-8YSZ cermet re-oxidation of anode supported solid oxide fuel cell: From kinetics measurements to mechanical damage prediction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.019
5,15200,This modification has been ascribed to a transition from a homogeneous oxidation process to a heterogeneous one.,Ni-8YSZ cermet re-oxidation of anode supported solid oxide fuel cell: From kinetics measurements to mechanical damage prediction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.019
6,15200,Local X-ray measurements have confirmed that an oxidation gradient in the cermet arises at T = 800 degrees C. Mechanical analysis has shown that the presence of an oxidised front at T = 800 degrees C: strongly impacts the cell 'redox' tolerance.,Ni-8YSZ cermet re-oxidation of anode supported solid oxide fuel cell: From kinetics measurements to mechanical damage prediction,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.019
