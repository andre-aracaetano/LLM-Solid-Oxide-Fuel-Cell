3,20856,The solubility of rare-earth cations in the strontium sublattice of perovskite-type SrTiO3 is found to decrease with reducing ionic radius leading to a segregation of secondary pyrochlore-type Ln(2)Ti(2)O(7) phase in the case of smaller rare-earth cations (Ln = Dy-Yb).,Electrical conductivity and thermal expansion of Ln-substituted SrTiO3 for solid oxide cell electrodes and interconnects: The effect of rare-earth cation size,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228531
4,20856,"The results of electrical, dilatometric and thermogravimetric studies suggest that the size of donor Ln(3+) cation and cation stoichiometry have no evident impact on the electrical conductivity or thermal expansion behavior as long as the content of Ln(3+) is within the solubility limits.",Electrical conductivity and thermal expansion of Ln-substituted SrTiO3 for solid oxide cell electrodes and interconnects: The effect of rare-earth cation size,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228531
5,20856,"All reduced donor-doped titanate ceramics (except Yb-doped) show a similar level of electrical conductivity, 100-155 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C, determined by the content of Ln(3+) in the strontium sublattice, and moderate thermal expansion coefficients, 11.9-12.1 ppm K-1 at 25-1100 degrees C, compatible with that of conventional solid electrolytes.",Electrical conductivity and thermal expansion of Ln-substituted SrTiO3 for solid oxide cell electrodes and interconnects: The effect of rare-earth cation size,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228531
