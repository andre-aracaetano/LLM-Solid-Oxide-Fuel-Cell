1,20665,Suspension direct current plasma spraying allows achieving finely structured coatings whose thickness is between few tens and few hundreds of micrometres.,Suspension and solution plasma spraying of finely structured layers: potential application to SOFCs,10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S19
2,20665,Drops (200-300 mu m in diameter) or liquid jets are mechanically injected in the plasma jet.,Suspension and solution plasma spraying of finely structured layers: potential application to SOFCs,10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S19
3,20665,With radial injection they are rapidly (a few mu s) fragmented into droplets (a few mu m in diameter).,Suspension and solution plasma spraying of finely structured layers: potential application to SOFCs,10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S19
4,20665,The latter are vaporized (in a few mu s) and the solid particles contained in suspension droplets are accelerated and melted by the plasma jet.,Suspension and solution plasma spraying of finely structured layers: potential application to SOFCs,10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S19
5,20665,"As in conventional plasma spraying (CPS), much smaller splats (with diameters between 0.2 and 3 mu m and thicknesses between 30 and 200 nm) are arranged in layers up to form the coating.",Suspension and solution plasma spraying of finely structured layers: potential application to SOFCs,10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S19
6,20665,The low inertia of particles requires spray distances between 40 and 60 mm which induces plasma heat fluxes up to 22MW m(-2) participating in coating densification.,Suspension and solution plasma spraying of finely structured layers: potential application to SOFCs,10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S19
7,20665,"Even more than in CPS, the plasma jet fluctuations, particularly for plasmas containing di-atomic gases, perturb drops penetration and fragmentation.",Suspension and solution plasma spraying of finely structured layers: potential application to SOFCs,10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S19
8,20665,"It has been chosen to illustrate difficulties and possibilities of this new method, through the spraying of the three layers of an element of solid oxide fuel cells.",Suspension and solution plasma spraying of finely structured layers: potential application to SOFCs,10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S19
9,20665,"Indeed, it requires a dense stabilized zirconia electrolyte, if possible thin (15-20 mu s) with two porous electrodes: cathode made of perovskite prone to decomposing upon spraying and anode made of two materials (nickel and zirconia) with very different melting points.",Suspension and solution plasma spraying of finely structured layers: potential application to SOFCs,10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S19
10,20665,"These components were obtained by spraying ethanol suspensions, with, first, LaMnO3 perovskite particles doped with 10 mol% of MnO2 and 3 mu m in mean diameter sprayed with pure argon to limit their decomposition and achieve porous coatings, second, Yttria (13 wt%) stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with two different particle size distributions and morphologies for which plasma compositions were adapted, producing in both cases 15 mu m thick and fully dense coatings, third, porous Raneigh nickel by co-spraying the YSZ suspension and solution of nickel nitrate.",Suspension and solution plasma spraying of finely structured layers: potential application to SOFCs,10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S19
