4,20273,"In particular, for the electrodes with initial composition 50 vol % Fe0.67Ni0.33O & x445;-50 vol % Zr0.85Y0.15O1.93 the anode overpotential equals 20-30 mV at a current density of 50-80 mA/cm(2) in 10% H-2-Ar-H2O at relatively low temperatures (873-923 K).","Electrochemical Behavior of (Fe,Ni)Ox-Based Anodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells in Methane-Containing Atmospheres",10.1134/S102319352002007X
5,20273,"Increasing current leads to further activation, presumably due to a partial oxidation of metallic particles located at the anode surface.","Electrochemical Behavior of (Fe,Ni)Ox-Based Anodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells in Methane-Containing Atmospheres",10.1134/S102319352002007X
6,20273,"However, the microstructure degradation of the anode layers still represents a significant problem for their utilization.","Electrochemical Behavior of (Fe,Ni)Ox-Based Anodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells in Methane-Containing Atmospheres",10.1134/S102319352002007X
7,20273,"Testing of the electrocatalytic activity of the anodes fabricated from Ni, Zr0.83Sc0.17O1.92 (ScSZ) and Ce0.9Gd0.1 O2 - delta (GDC) revealed a high activity toward catalytic partial methane oxidation with the subsequent electrochemical oxidation of the conversion products, as well as formation of carbonaceous deposits at the nickel surface.","Electrochemical Behavior of (Fe,Ni)Ox-Based Anodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells in Methane-Containing Atmospheres",10.1134/S102319352002007X
8,20273,The methane conversion degree on Ni-anode comes to 60-90% and decreases with time and on cooling.,"Electrochemical Behavior of (Fe,Ni)Ox-Based Anodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells in Methane-Containing Atmospheres",10.1134/S102319352002007X
9,20273,"The doping of nickel oxide with iron lowers the conversion degree and promotes the carbon poisoning, supposedly, because of the lowering of the anodic current density resulting from the worsening of the electrochemical activity.","Electrochemical Behavior of (Fe,Ni)Ox-Based Anodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells in Methane-Containing Atmospheres",10.1134/S102319352002007X
