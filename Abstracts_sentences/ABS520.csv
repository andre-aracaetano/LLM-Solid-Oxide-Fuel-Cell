1,520,Direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells were used to produce electricity and syngas.,Electrochemical partial oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of anode reforming activity,10.1007/s10562-007-9313-4
2,520,"During initial operation at 750 degrees C, the cells produced 0.9 W/cm(2) and approximate to 90% methane conversion to syngas at a rate of 30 sccm/cm(2).",Electrochemical partial oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of anode reforming activity,10.1007/s10562-007-9313-4
3,520,"However, the methane conversion decreased continuously over the first 30-40 h of operation, even though the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) electrical performance was stable.",Electrochemical partial oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of anode reforming activity,10.1007/s10562-007-9313-4
4,520,An additional catalyst layer on the anode yielded more stable methane conversion to syngas.,Electrochemical partial oxidation of methane in solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of anode reforming activity,10.1007/s10562-007-9313-4
