4,20950,"For Nd2Ni1-xCuxO4+ with x0.15, crystal structure was tetragonal and no phase transition was detected below 750 degrees C. For Pr2Ni1-xCuxO4+ with x=0.0 and 0.1, phase transition was observed by DSC, showing similar dependence of phase transition temperature and H on Cu content and P(O-2) with that of Nd2Ni1-xCuxO4+. was not detected in TG curve of Pr2Ni0.9Cu0.1O4+, which could be attributed to too small .","Thermal analysis of structural phase transition behavior of Ln2Ni1-xCuxO4+ (Ln=Nd, Pr) under various oxygen partial pressures",10.1007/s10973-018-7621-0
