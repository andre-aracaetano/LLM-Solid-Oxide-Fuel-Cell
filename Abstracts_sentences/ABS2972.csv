1,2972,"Porous, ferritic steel was produced by blending, pressing and sintering Fe, Cr, Mo and NaCl powders During sintering NaCl evaporated to form 40-58% interconnected open porosities, while the metal powders densified and interdiffused to create a nearly dense Fe-26Cr-1Mo matrix (E-Brite, developed for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects).",Processing and mechanical properties of porous Fe-26Cr-1Mo for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.actamat.2010.07.030
2,2972,The foam compressive properties at ambient temperature were in good agreement with the Gibson-Ashby scaling laws for stillness and strength and demonstrate high mechanical energy absorption.,Processing and mechanical properties of porous Fe-26Cr-1Mo for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.actamat.2010.07.030
3,2972,"The foam compressive creep response at 850 degrees C under an argon atmosphere followed the same power law stress dependence as the bulk material, suggesting similar deformation mechanisms in each case Creep data under argon were compared with a variational composite model and a simple unit cell model taking into account thicker nodes connecting slender struts (C) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.",Processing and mechanical properties of porous Fe-26Cr-1Mo for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.actamat.2010.07.030
