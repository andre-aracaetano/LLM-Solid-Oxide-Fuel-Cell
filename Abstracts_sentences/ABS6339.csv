2,6339,"(NBT) is a well-known lead-free perovskite that exhibits ferroelectricity below 300 degrees C. NBT and certain other ferroelectrics, e.g., Bi4Ti3O12, show oxide ionic conductivity on the order of 10-2 S cm-1 at elevated temperatures of 650 degrees C.",Probing Oxide Ion Conductivity in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BiFeO3-BaTiO3-Based Ferroelectric Materials,10.1021/acsaem.3c00594
3,6339,The origin of ionic conductivity in these ferroelectric oxides has been explained in terms of bismuth deficiency and oxygen vacancy in the perovskite.,Probing Oxide Ion Conductivity in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BiFeO3-BaTiO3-Based Ferroelectric Materials,10.1021/acsaem.3c00594
4,6339,There is a quest for materials as electrolytes with higher ionic conductivity and at temperatures below 650 degrees C. NBT-based ferroelectrics have been proposed to be one such candidate for low-temperature ionic conductors as electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Probing Oxide Ion Conductivity in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BiFeO3-BaTiO3-Based Ferroelectric Materials,10.1021/acsaem.3c00594
5,6339,"In this work, we have explored Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BaTiO3-BiFeO3 and studied the effect of composition on the conductivity behavior using impedance and modulus spectroscopy.",Probing Oxide Ion Conductivity in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BiFeO3-BaTiO3-Based Ferroelectric Materials,10.1021/acsaem.3c00594
6,6339,We explain the nature of conductivity using the dependence of impedance on the partial pressure of oxygen.,Probing Oxide Ion Conductivity in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BiFeO3-BaTiO3-Based Ferroelectric Materials,10.1021/acsaem.3c00594
7,6339,"At a low BaTiO3 content, the composition Na0.45Bi0.49Ba0.05Fe0.05Mg0.019Ti0.931O3-delta (NBBTF-C) forms with a rhombohedral structure and shows an ionic conductivity of similar to 1.02 x 10-3 S cm-1 at 600 degrees C, which is similar to that of NBT.",Probing Oxide Ion Conductivity in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-BiFeO3-BaTiO3-Based Ferroelectric Materials,10.1021/acsaem.3c00594
