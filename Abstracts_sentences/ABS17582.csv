1,17582,"A dynamic-temperature operation strategy Is proposed for SOFC systems, in which the cell temperature varies rapidly to match the SOFC stack power output to a dynamic load requirement.",Dynamic-temperature operation of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.05.094
2,17582,"It is anticipated that this operation strategy may have benefits for system efficiency, size, and cost for applications with dynamic power load.",Dynamic-temperature operation of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.05.094
3,17582,"Metal-supported SOFCs (MS-SOFCs) are operated continuously at 0.7 V while the temperature is varied rapidly between 675 and 800 degrees C or 670 and 720 degrees C. During the initial thermal excursion, the current density increases from 0.82 to 1.95 A cm(-2) in 6.6 min for 675-800 degrees C, and from 1.0 to 1.63 A cm(-2) in 5.4 min for 670-720 degrees C. Cells are subjected to continuous dynamic temperature operation for more than 100 cycles.",Dynamic-temperature operation of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.05.094
