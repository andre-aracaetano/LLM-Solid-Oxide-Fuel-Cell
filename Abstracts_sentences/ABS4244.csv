1,4244,"In this study, we investigated the long-term stability of Nd2NiO4 solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes to evaluate their chromium poisoning tolerance.",Chromium Poisoning of Neodymium Nickelate (Nd2NiO4) Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.4191/kcers.2019.56.2.07
2,4244,"Symmetrical cells consisting of Nd2NiO4 electrodes and a yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte were fabricated and the cell potential and polarization resistance were measured at 850 degrees C in the presence of gaseous chromium species for 800 h. Up to 500 h of operation, the cell potential remained constant at 500 mA/cm(2).",Chromium Poisoning of Neodymium Nickelate (Nd2NiO4) Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.4191/kcers.2019.56.2.07
3,4244,"However, it increased slightly over the operation duration of 550-800 h.",Chromium Poisoning of Neodymium Nickelate (Nd2NiO4) Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.4191/kcers.2019.56.2.07
4,4244,No appreciable increase was observed in the polarization resistance of the Nd2NiO4 cathode during the entire operation of 800 h. Physicochemical examinations revealed that the gaseous chromium species did not form chromium-related contamination not only in the Nd2NiO4 cathode but also at the cathode/electrolyte interface.,Chromium Poisoning of Neodymium Nickelate (Nd2NiO4) Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.4191/kcers.2019.56.2.07
5,4244,"The results demonstrated that Nd2NiO4 is resistant to chromium poisoning, and hence is a potential alternative to standard perovskite cathodes.",Chromium Poisoning of Neodymium Nickelate (Nd2NiO4) Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.4191/kcers.2019.56.2.07
