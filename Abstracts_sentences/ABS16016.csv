1,16016,The effect of Zr-doping on the novel SOFC cathode YMnO3 and its O-2-Reduction Reaction (ORR) was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a function of temperature (500 < T < 800 degrees C) and the oxygen partial pressure (10(-4) < pO(2) < 1 atm).,Study of the oxygen reduction reaction on pure and Zr-doped YMnO3+δ SOFC electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137332

3,16016,"High frequency contribution, only observed at 600 degrees C for both electrodes, was attributed to oxygen ion transfer trough the electrode/electrolyte interface.",Study of the oxygen reduction reaction on pure and Zr-doped YMnO3+δ SOFC electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137332
4,16016,"In both electrodes, the Intermediate frequency contribution was described by a Gerischer impedance, related to a co-limiting process between oxygen ion diffusion and a surface process.",Study of the oxygen reduction reaction on pure and Zr-doped YMnO3+δ SOFC electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137332
5,16016,"However, whereas the EIS characteristics for YMnO3 can be explained by a surface process controlled by the electron transfer from oxide to O-adsorbed, it seems related for Y0.9Zr0.1MnO3 to the probability of finding a second free-surface site near to a diatomic intermediated for the O-2 dissociation.",Study of the oxygen reduction reaction on pure and Zr-doped YMnO3+δ SOFC electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137332
6,16016,These differences are in agreement with the improvement of the electrical properties when YMnO3 is doped with Zr.,Study of the oxygen reduction reaction on pure and Zr-doped YMnO3+δ SOFC electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137332
7,16016,"The low frequency contribution became important as pO(2) decreased and temperature increased, and its characteristics would indicate a secondary surface process, co-limited with O-2 gas diffusion for Y0.9Zr0.1MnO3 porous electrode.",Study of the oxygen reduction reaction on pure and Zr-doped YMnO3+δ SOFC electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.137332
