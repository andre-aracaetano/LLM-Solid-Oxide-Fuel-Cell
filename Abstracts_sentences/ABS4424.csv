1,4424,"This paper compares two dynamic, one-dimensional models of a planar anode-supported intermediate temperature (IT) direct internal reforming (DIR) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC): one where the flow properties (pressure, gas stream densities, heat capacities, thermal conductivities, and viscosity) and gas velocities are taken as constant throughout the system, based on inlet conditions, and one where this assumption is removed to focus on the effect of considering the variation of local flow properties on the prediction of the fuel cell performance.","Comparison of two IT DIR-SOFC models: Impact of variable thermodynamic, physical, and flow properties.

2,4424,"The refined model consists of mass, energy, and momentum balances, and of an electrochemical model that relates the fuel and air gas compositions and temperatures to voltage, current density, and other relevant fuel cell variables.","Comparison of two IT DIR-SOFC models: Impact of variable thermodynamic, physical, and flow properties.

4,4424,"For a co-flow SOFC operating on a 10% pre-reformed methane fuel mixture, with 75% fuel utilisation, inlet fuel and air temperatures of 1023 K, average current density of 5000 A m(-2), and an air ratio of 8.5, the results show that, although the error incurred in the prediction of the flow properties in the first model is significant, there is good agreement between both models in terms of the overall cell performance: the maximum difference in the local temperature values is about 7K and the cell efficiency differs by less than 1%.","Comparison of two IT DIR-SOFC models: Impact of variable thermodynamic, physical, and flow properties.

5,4424,"However, the discrepancies between the two models increase, especially in the fuel channel, when higher current density values are assigned to the cell.","Comparison of two IT DIR-SOFC models: Impact of variable thermodynamic, physical, and flow properties.
