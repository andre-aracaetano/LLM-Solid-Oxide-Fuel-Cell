2,11346,"Across all fields of electrochemistry, this equation is deployed in diverse mathematical forms whose mutual interrelation is infrequently expressed and often unclear.","The Butler-Volmer equation in electrochemical theory: Origins, value, and practical application",10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114145
3,11346,"The plurality of forms of the Butler-Volmer equation sometimes engenders misunderstanding in the literature, such as misuse of terminology or inappropriate mathematical expression of the kinetic equations.","The Butler-Volmer equation in electrochemical theory: Origins, value, and practical application",10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114145
4,11346,"We express the basis of the Butler-Volmer equation as an empirical expression for a two-way activated redox process, and illustrate the constraints that limit interpretation of this empirical expression in a more physically specific manner, especially excluding many electrocatalytic processes not equating to a simple one-electron transfer.","The Butler-Volmer equation in electrochemical theory: Origins, value, and practical application",10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114145
5,11346,"Preferences towards different parametric expressions of the Butler-Volmer equation between the fields of electroanalytical chemistry and electrochemical engineering are correlated to both the different types of electrochemical system commonly encountered in these fields, and their different scientific motivations.","The Butler-Volmer equation in electrochemical theory: Origins, value, and practical application",10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114145
6,11346,"We further discuss briefly the scope of recent experimental efforts towards affirming the Butler-Volmer equation, considering the sensitivity (or relative lack thereof) of common experimental techniques to its component parameters.","The Butler-Volmer equation in electrochemical theory: Origins, value, and practical application",10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114145
