3,5962,"It was investigated that a glass-ceramic based on the SiO2-CaO-B2O3-Al2O3 system as sealant material applied for ITSOFC operated at 850degreesC. After heat treatment at 850degreesC for 2h, the glass ceramic maintained its shape, bonded with 8YSZ electrolyte and Ni-Cr bipolar producing a good gas-tight seal, and its thermal expansion coefficient of 8.9x10(-6)/degreesC was close to 8YSZ.",SiO2-CaO-B2O3-Al2O3 glass ceramics as sealant for planar intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
4,5962,"After 100h, no decrease in pressure caused by H-2 or O-2 leaking was observed, its micrograph showed a good connection with clear interface and the thickness of the diffusive layer of elements was less than 5similar to10mum.",SiO2-CaO-B2O3-Al2O3 glass ceramics as sealant for planar intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,
