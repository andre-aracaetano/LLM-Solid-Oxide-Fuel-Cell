1,12540,Thin-electrolyte anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (YSZ/NiO-YSZ) were fabricated for intermediate-temperature operation using electrophoretic deposition (EPD).,Effect of Processing Conditions on Curvature of Anode/Electrolyte SOFC Half-Cells Fabricated by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.1115/1.2971044
2,12540,"During cosintering, the half-cells were observed to warp-an undesirable characteristic-due to mismatch in the sintering rates.",Effect of Processing Conditions on Curvature of Anode/Electrolyte SOFC Half-Cells Fabricated by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.1115/1.2971044
3,12540,"The influence of the temperature for anode presintering-a key processing step-on the curvature of the half-cells induced by sintering was investigated over 700-1400 degrees C. It was found that the maximum curvature occurred for an anode presintered at 900 degrees C, while the minimum was observed at 1200 degrees C. Anode presintering temperature was also found to affect the rate of electrophoretic deposition.",Effect of Processing Conditions on Curvature of Anode/Electrolyte SOFC Half-Cells Fabricated by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.1115/1.2971044
4,12540,"At low presintering temperatures, the rate of EPD increased due to the enhancement in substrate (anode) electronic conductivity as a result of an increased percolating network of NiO. Further increases in presintering temperature, however, resulted in a decrease in the EPD rate due to the formation of a surface layer with poor electronic conductivity as a result of NiO diffusion from the NiO-YSZ anode to the sintering crucible.",Effect of Processing Conditions on Curvature of Anode/Electrolyte SOFC Half-Cells Fabricated by Electrophoretic Deposition,10.1115/1.2971044
