3,10186,"To achieve a ready-to-use LT-SOFC system, we modified a compact compressive sealing architecture implemented with a stacked disc spring, and a rapid thermal cycling with cold start-up was realized using a lamp heater.",Advancing towards ready-to-use solid oxide fuel cells: 5 minute cold start-up with high-power performance,10.1039/d2ta09092a
4,10186,This LT-SOFC system reached target temperatures within 5 min of start-up and immediately exhibited an open-circuit potential of 1.124 V and a maximum power density of 1.123 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C. We evaluated this system with harsh thermal cycling (25-500 or 600 degrees C) for 3000 min and confirmed its degradation behavior in perovskite phase separation and interfacial delamination.,Advancing towards ready-to-use solid oxide fuel cells: 5 minute cold start-up with high-power performance,10.1039/d2ta09092a
