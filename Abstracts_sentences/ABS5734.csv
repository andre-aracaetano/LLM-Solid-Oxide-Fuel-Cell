1,5734,The performance of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) is largely restricted by the slow oxygen reactions on the oxygen electrode.,Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.2Ni0.1O3-δ-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Composite Oxygen Electrode for Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c02148
2,5734,"Herein, an active composite oxygen electrode Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.2Ni0.1O3-delta-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BSCFN-BZCYYb) with various mass ratios (6:4, 7:3, 8:2, and 9:1) is electrochemically investigated on fuel electrode-supported PCECs.",Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.2Ni0.1O3-δ-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Composite Oxygen Electrode for Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c02148
3,5734,"BSCFN powder, with rich oxygen vacancies, shows a good chemical compatibility with BZCYYb electrolyte, as confirmed by the analyses of thermal gravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction patterns.",Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.2Ni0.1O3-δ-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Composite Oxygen Electrode for Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c02148
4,5734,It is indicated that composite electrode with a ratio of 8:2 shows the best performance.,Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.2Ni0.1O3-δ-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Composite Oxygen Electrode for Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c02148
5,5734,"For example, a peak power density (P-max) of 1.14 W cm(-2), an electrode polarization resistance (R-p) of 0.062 Omega cm(2), and a reasonable durability test of 24 h at -0.5A cm(-2) are delivered at 750 degrees C for the fuel cells with BSCFN-BZCYYb electrode with the ratio of 8:2.",Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.2Ni0.1O3-δ-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Composite Oxygen Electrode for Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c02148
6,5734,"In addition, a stable operation (similar to 50 h) of cell with BSCFN-BZCYYb electrode (8:2 mass ratio) in dual modes of electrolysis and fuel cell (2 h for each mode) at +/- 0.5 A cm(-2) is obtained, demonstrating a good reversibility.",Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.2Ni0.1O3-δ-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ Composite Oxygen Electrode for Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c02148
