1,2673,A cobalt-free perovskite-type Ba0.5Sr0.5Al0.1Fe0.9O3-delta (BSAF) is developed and electrochemically studied as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode.,Pervoskite-type Ba0.5Sr0.5Al0.1Fe0.9O3-δ as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode,10.1088/1674-0068/25/05/605-608
2,2673,"The structures, electrical conductivity, and electrode polarizations in symmetrical cell based on mixed ion conducting electrolyte were investigated, respectively.",Pervoskite-type Ba0.5Sr0.5Al0.1Fe0.9O3-δ as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode,10.1088/1674-0068/25/05/605-608
3,2673,The temperature dependence of conductivity of BSAF in air shows a typical semiconductor behavior with positive temperature coefficient up to 450 degrees C where the conductivity reaches 14.0 S/cm while above this temperature the negative temperature coefficient dominates the total conductivity.,Pervoskite-type Ba0.5Sr0.5Al0.1Fe0.9O3-δ as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode,10.1088/1674-0068/25/05/605-608
4,2673,Electrochemical characterizations show desirable polarization resistance of BSAF cathode in a symmetric cell based on mixed ion conducting electrolyte at 650-700 degrees C. A single SOFC with BSAF cathode shows OCV of 1.0 V and maximum output of 420 mW/cm(2) at 700 degrees C with humidified hydrogen fuel and static air oxidant.,Pervoskite-type Ba0.5Sr0.5Al0.1Fe0.9O3-δ as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode,10.1088/1674-0068/25/05/605-608
