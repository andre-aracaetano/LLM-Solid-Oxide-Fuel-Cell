2,18795,"In this work, the factors influencing the performance and degradation of flat-tube solid oxide electrolytic cell stack (SOEC stack) for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis under an intermittent pulsed current are investigated by inserting a voltage lead inside the SOEC stack to monitor the variations in the cell and stack voltages during the electrolysis process.",Degradation of flat-tube solid oxide electrolytic stack for co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2 under pulsed current,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233372
3,18795,"The results show that after 64 pulsed electrolysis cycles (900 h), the average voltage degradation rate is about 0.018%/cycle at 50-250 mA/cm2, and the useful life is expected to reach more than 1100 cycles (10,000 h).",Degradation of flat-tube solid oxide electrolytic stack for co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2 under pulsed current,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233372
4,18795,"The microstructural analysis shows that a SrCrO4 barrier layer is formed on the contact surface between the metal interconnect and the current collecting layer of the cell, which in-creases the interface resistance of the metal interconnect and the cell, resulting in the degradation of the elec-trolytic performance.",Degradation of flat-tube solid oxide electrolytic stack for co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2 under pulsed current,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233372
