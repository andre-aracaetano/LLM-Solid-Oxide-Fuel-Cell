1,12002,The chromium (Cr) evaporation behavior of several different types of iron (Fe)-based AFA alloys and benchmark Cr2O3-forming Fe-based 310 and Ni-based 625 alloys was investigated for 500 h exposures at 800 degrees C to 900 degrees C in air with 10% H2O.,Chromium evaporation and oxidation characteristics of alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels for balance of plant applications in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.002
2,12002,The Cr evaporation rates from alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) alloys were similar to 5 to 35 times lower than that of the Cr2O3-forming alloys depending on alloy and temperature.,Chromium evaporation and oxidation characteristics of alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels for balance of plant applications in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.002
3,12002,"The Cr evaporation behavior was correlated with extensive characterization of the chemistry and microstructure of the oxide scales, which also revealed a degree of quartz tube Si contamination during the test.",Chromium evaporation and oxidation characteristics of alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels for balance of plant applications in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.002
