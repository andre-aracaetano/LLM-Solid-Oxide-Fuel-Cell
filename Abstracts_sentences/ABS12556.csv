1,12556,"The perovskite type manganite systems, Ln(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3) (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd; 0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.5) were studied as the electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) from the view point of applications to the co-firing process of the electrolyte and electrode at a higher temperature.","Ln1-xSrxMnO3 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm and Gd) as the cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00440-8
2,12556,"The reactivity tests with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) showed that the formation of the pyrochlore Ln(2)Zr(2)O(7) was suppressed for the perovskites having smaller lanthanoids than La, especially for the Pr1-xSrxMnO3 and Nd1-xSrxMnO3 systems.","Ln1-xSrxMnO3 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm and Gd) as the cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00440-8
3,12556,"No reaction product appeared between the Ln(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3) perovskite and YSZ even at a high annealing temperature of 1400 degrees C when the lanthanoid elements were Pr, Nd and Sm and the Sr content was around 30% (x = 0.3).","Ln1-xSrxMnO3 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm and Gd) as the cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00440-8
4,12556,The adjustment of the thermal expansion rate of Ln(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3) to YSZ needed more Sr substitution with an increase of the atomic number of lanthanoids.,"Ln1-xSrxMnO3 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm and Gd) as the cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00440-8
5,12556,"The Sr contents, x, showing comparable values with 8m/o YSZ were around x = 0.1-0.2 in La1-xSrxMnO3, 0.3 in Pr1-xSrxMnO3 and Nd1-xSrxMnO3 and more than 0.4 in Sm1-xSrxMnO3 and Gd1-xSrxMnO3.","Ln1-xSrxMnO3 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm and Gd) as the cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00440-8
6,12556,"The electrical conductivity, which may strongly relate with the polarization of electrode reaction, showed about 200 S/cm at 1000 degrees C for all Ln(0.7)Sr(0.3)MnO(3) systems.","Ln1-xSrxMnO3 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm and Gd) as the cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00440-8

8,12556,"From the viewpoint of the electrode activity, high electrical conductivity, low reactivity and good compatibility with YSZ, Pr0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and Nd0.7Sr0.3MnO3 are considered to be the most suitable electrode materials for the co-firing process.","Ln1-xSrxMnO3 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm and Gd) as the cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00440-8
