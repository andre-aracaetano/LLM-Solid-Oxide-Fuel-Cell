1,1359,The need for green energy sources without or with low emissions in addition to improve the using efficiency of current fossil fuels in the marine field makes it important to replace or improve current fossil-fuelled engines.,STEAM AND SOFC BASED REFORMING OPTIONS OF PEM FUEL CELLS FOR MARINE APPLICATIONS,
2,1359,The replacement process should work on narrowing the gap between the most scientific innovative clean energy technologies and the concepts of feasibility and cost-effective solutions.,STEAM AND SOFC BASED REFORMING OPTIONS OF PEM FUEL CELLS FOR MARINE APPLICATIONS,
3,1359,Early expectations of very low emissions and relatively high efficiencies have been met in marine power plants using fuel cell.,STEAM AND SOFC BASED REFORMING OPTIONS OF PEM FUEL CELLS FOR MARINE APPLICATIONS,
4,1359,"In this study, steam and SOFC based reforming options of natural gas for PEM fuel cells are proposed as an attractive option to limit the environmental impact of the marine sector.",STEAM AND SOFC BASED REFORMING OPTIONS OF PEM FUEL CELLS FOR MARINE APPLICATIONS,
5,1359,The benefits of these two different reforming options can be assessed using computer predictions incorporating chemical flow sheeting software.,STEAM AND SOFC BASED REFORMING OPTIONS OF PEM FUEL CELLS FOR MARINE APPLICATIONS,
6,1359,It is found that a high overall efficiency approaching 60% may be achieved using SOFC based reforming systems which are significantly better than a reformed PEM system or an SOFC only system.,STEAM AND SOFC BASED REFORMING OPTIONS OF PEM FUEL CELLS FOR MARINE APPLICATIONS,
