1,11870,We demonstrate an electrochemical technique for the large scale synthesis of high quality few layer graphene sheets (FLGS) directly from graphite using oxalic acid (a weak acid) as the electrolyte.,An electrochemical method for the synthesis of few layer graphene sheets for high temperature applications,10.1039/c3cc48055k
2,11870,One of the interesting observations is that the FLGS are stable at least up to 800 degrees C and hence have potential application in solid oxide fuel cells as a gas diffusion layer.,An electrochemical method for the synthesis of few layer graphene sheets for high temperature applications,10.1039/c3cc48055k
