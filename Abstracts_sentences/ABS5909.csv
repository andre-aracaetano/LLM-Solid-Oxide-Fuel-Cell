1,5909,"A series of four compounds (LaMnO3, La0.70Sr0.30MnO3-delta, La0.80Sr0.20FeO3-delta and La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.50Mn0.50O3-delta of interest as electrode materials in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells have been prepared using a carbonate co-precipitation route in aqueous medium.",Co-precipitation synthesis of SOFC electrode materials,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.063
2,5909,"LaMnO3, La0.70Sr0.30MnO3-delta, and La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.50Mn0.50O3-delta have been obtained as a pure phase, while La0.80Sr0.20FeO3-delta retained an impurity phase; fine microstructures with sub-micron sized particles can be obtained in all cases at the proper calcinations temperature, except for LaMnO3.",Co-precipitation synthesis of SOFC electrode materials,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.063
3,5909,The precipitation yield of the single metal ions have been experimentally determined in the mother liquors and in the final powders; the results have been evaluated also in comparison with expected yields calculated from thermodynamics of the precipitation process using the software Medusa.,Co-precipitation synthesis of SOFC electrode materials,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.063
4,5909,pH higher than 7.5 are suggested to avoid ion losses for all cations.,Co-precipitation synthesis of SOFC electrode materials,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.063
