1,5447,An AISI 430 stainless steel was coated by Mn-Co spinel using a slurry method.,Oxidation and volatilisation behaviour of a type 430 stainless steel coated by Mn-Co oxide by slurry method with pre-oxidation for SOFC interconnect application,10.1016/j.corsci.2021.109506
2,5447,"Pre-oxidation before the coating helped reduce the oxidation rate of the coated steel at 800 degrees C in O-2-5%H2O, relating to the formation of the continuous chromia layer which inhibited the outward diffusion of iron to the coating layer.",Oxidation and volatilisation behaviour of a type 430 stainless steel coated by Mn-Co oxide by slurry method with pre-oxidation for SOFC interconnect application,10.1016/j.corsci.2021.109506

4,5447,The combined molecular and Knudsen diffusion of the volatile species through the coating layer was suggested to explain the reduced volatilisation rate of the coated sample with pre-oxidation.,Oxidation and volatilisation behaviour of a type 430 stainless steel coated by Mn-Co oxide by slurry method with pre-oxidation for SOFC interconnect application,10.1016/j.corsci.2021.109506
