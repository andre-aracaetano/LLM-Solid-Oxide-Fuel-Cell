1,9886,"The zero emissions coal alliance (ZECA) have proposed a highly efficient integrated coal hydrogasification power producing scheme, where carbon is removed from product gas through a cyclic CaO-CaCO3 process and electricity is produced with solid oxide fuel cells.",Design and optimization of carbon-free power generation based on coal hydrogasification integrated with SOFC,10.1016/j.fuel.2008.08.005
2,9886,In recent years a lot of research effort has been put towards the realisation of the ZECA cycle.,Design and optimization of carbon-free power generation based on coal hydrogasification integrated with SOFC,10.1016/j.fuel.2008.08.005
3,9886,"This paper has two purposes: (a) to present optimal solutions to the technical challenges of the envisaged cycle, i.e. achieving the required product gas recycling to the gasifier with steam ejector, heat transfer to the calcination process via heat pipes, and required gas cleaning with appropriate sorbents and (b) to re-evaluate the cycle's performance and operating regime adopting these solutions.",Design and optimization of carbon-free power generation based on coal hydrogasification integrated with SOFC,10.1016/j.fuel.2008.08.005
4,9886,The complete power plant was designed in detail using ASPENPLUS (TM) simulation software and results include all critical operation parameters in order to achieve optimal integration.,Design and optimization of carbon-free power generation based on coal hydrogasification integrated with SOFC,10.1016/j.fuel.2008.08.005
