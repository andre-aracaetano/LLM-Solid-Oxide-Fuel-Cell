1,14398,"Orthorhombic perovskites Y1-xCaxFe1-yCoyO3-delta (0.1 <= x <= 0.2, 0.1 <= y <= 0.2 and x = 0.1, y = 0.3) were synthesized in air by the citrate route at 1150-1300 degrees C. High-temperature X-ray powder diffraction (HT XRPD) data for Y0.9Ca0.1Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta at 25-800 degrees C showed no phase transition with calculated thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of 11.9 ppm K-1.","Synthesis, thermal expansion and high-temperature electrical conductivity of Co-doped (Y,Ca)FeO3-δ with orthorhombic perovskite structure",10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.02.006
2,14398,"High-temperature electrical conductivity measurements revealed almost composition independent conductivity values of 22-27 S/cm at 900 degrees C. No chemical interaction of Y0.8Ca0.2Fe0.9Co0.1O3-delta with (Zr,Y)O2-x, (YSZ) or (Ce,Gd)O2-x(GDC) was observed up to 1000 degrees C and 1100 C, respectively.","Synthesis, thermal expansion and high-temperature electrical conductivity of Co-doped (Y,Ca)FeO3-δ with orthorhombic perovskite structure",10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.02.006
