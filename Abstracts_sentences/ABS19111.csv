1,19111,"Despite the superior bulk protonic conductivity combined with chemical stability in the temperature region in which intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) are operated, the use of polycrystalline ceramics of yttrium-doped barium zirconates (BZY) as a solid electrolyte is still largely limited mainly because the grain boundaries in these materials substantially increase the internal resistance.",On the origin of the blocking effect of grain-boundaries on proton transport in yttrium-doped barium zirconates,10.1039/c0jm03353g
2,19111,Hence the demand for better understanding of the origin of such high grain-boundary resistance in BZY has grown rapidly.,On the origin of the blocking effect of grain-boundaries on proton transport in yttrium-doped barium zirconates,10.1039/c0jm03353g
3,19111,It has long been speculated that the grain-boundary resistance may be attributed to the space charges formed at the grain boundaries.,On the origin of the blocking effect of grain-boundaries on proton transport in yttrium-doped barium zirconates,10.1039/c0jm03353g
4,19111,Here we present the results of our investigation on the space-charge effects on the grain-boundary conduction in BZY.,On the origin of the blocking effect of grain-boundaries on proton transport in yttrium-doped barium zirconates,10.1039/c0jm03353g
5,19111,We identify the width of the grain boundary as an independent parameter which allows for an unambiguous verification of the space-charge effects in BZY.,On the origin of the blocking effect of grain-boundaries on proton transport in yttrium-doped barium zirconates,10.1039/c0jm03353g
6,19111,"By quantitatively comparing the values of the widths experimentally determined not only for the 5, 8, and 20 mol% doped BZY samples we prepared but also for various other BZYs previously reported with those calculated based on a space-charge model, we have successfully verified that the grain-boundary conduction in these materials is indeed governed by the space charges.",On the origin of the blocking effect of grain-boundaries on proton transport in yttrium-doped barium zirconates,10.1039/c0jm03353g
