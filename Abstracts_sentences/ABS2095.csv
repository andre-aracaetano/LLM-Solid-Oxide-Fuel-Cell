1,2095,One of the major drawbacks of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is the longtime stability.,Manufacturing and microstructure of porous metal supports for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1179/0032589915Z.000000000237
2,2095,"In order to have mechanical stability, the cell can be supported by a so-called porous metal support.",Manufacturing and microstructure of porous metal supports for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1179/0032589915Z.000000000237
3,2095,These metal supports are usually manufactured by tape casting.,Manufacturing and microstructure of porous metal supports for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1179/0032589915Z.000000000237
4,2095,"This work, in contrast, is focused on processing these supports by different powder metallurgical techniques such as the press- and sinter route, gravity sintering or metal injection moulding.",Manufacturing and microstructure of porous metal supports for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1179/0032589915Z.000000000237
5,2095,For some samples a shrinkage of 15% could be obtained as defined by the shrinkage of the ceramic functional layers (in case of desired co-sintering an interval of 15-20% is preferable).,Manufacturing and microstructure of porous metal supports for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1179/0032589915Z.000000000237
6,2095,"The most promising manufacturing routes were found to be gravity sintering (about 50% porosity) and MIM (20-28% porosity): in both cases the pores are homogeneously distributed, and only slight agglomeration of pores can be seen.",Manufacturing and microstructure of porous metal supports for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1179/0032589915Z.000000000237
