4,1874,BSFP with a cubic structure presents excellent chemical compatibility with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) electrolyte after sintering at 1100 ?C. Impedance analysis reveals its polarization resistance (Rp) is as low as 0.18 0 cm2 at 700 ?C. Further kinetics study suggests the lowfrequency process is the rate-limiting step of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).,A cobalt-free bismuth ferrite-based cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2021.106978
