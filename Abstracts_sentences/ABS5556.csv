1,5556,Micro-tubular SOFCs (Solid Oxide Fuel Cells) with internal conduction layer were fabricated by controlling the shrinkage of the inner anode layer to avoid the delamination or breakage of the cell during sintering.,Design and fabrication of micro close end tubular SOFC with internal conduction layer,10.2109/jcersj2.15254
2,5556,"In order to fabricate these cells, pre-sintering of anode tubes were examined in a temperature range of 1000-1350 degrees C. Micro close end tubular cells were successfully prepared by using this pre-sintering at 1100 degrees C. The micro-tubular cells with close end show good tolerance to repeating thermal cycles due to their unique shape.",Design and fabrication of micro close end tubular SOFC with internal conduction layer,10.2109/jcersj2.15254
3,5556,"Because of one end connection, the polarization of them was larger than the common tubular cells with two end connection and needed to be improved, which was solved by the application of internal porous conduction layer.",Design and fabrication of micro close end tubular SOFC with internal conduction layer,10.2109/jcersj2.15254
4,5556,"As demonstrated by this work, maximum power density of 0.6W/cm(2) at 600 degrees C was obtained after application of a thin nickel conductive layer, which was as thin as 20 mu m.
