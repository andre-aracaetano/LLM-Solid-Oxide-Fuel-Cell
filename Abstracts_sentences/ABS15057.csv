1,15057,"In order to make clear the relationship between the microstructure of the porous oxide layer and electrochemical properties of air electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells, air/porous oxide/yttria stabilized zirconia, complex-impedance and cathodic polarization were measured on the air/La0.6Ca0.4MnO3/YSZ electrodes at 900-1000-degrees-C with the porous La0.6Ca0.4MnO3 layers of different morphology prepared by different method and different firing temperatures.",REACTION-KINETICS AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS AIR ELECTRODE LA0.6CA0.4MNO3/YSZ,10.1149/1.2085891
2,15057,"From the SEM images of the cross section of the interface, the length of the air/La0.6Ca0.4MnO3/YSZ triple-phase boundary and the area of the closely contacted La0.6Ca0.4MnO3-particles/YSZ interface were estimated.",REACTION-KINETICS AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS AIR ELECTRODE LA0.6CA0.4MNO3/YSZ,10.1149/1.2085891
3,15057,"It was shown that the reaction rate was essentially proportional to the length of the triple-phase boundary, while the electrode capacitance was largely proportional to the closely contacted area.",REACTION-KINETICS AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS AIR ELECTRODE LA0.6CA0.4MNO3/YSZ,10.1149/1.2085891
4,15057,"Although the reaction rate depended on the electrode morphology, the kinetics of the rate-determining reaction for small overpotential was found to be essentially the same irrespective of the different morphology of the oxide layer.",REACTION-KINETICS AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS AIR ELECTRODE LA0.6CA0.4MNO3/YSZ,10.1149/1.2085891
5,15057,The electrode interface conductivity at 1000-degrees-C for a unit length of the triple-phase boundary was calculated to be (3.4 +/- 0.8) x 10(-4),REACTION-KINETICS AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS AIR ELECTRODE LA0.6CA0.4MNO3/YSZ,10.1149/1.2085891
