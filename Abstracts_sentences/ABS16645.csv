5,16645,"The highest ionic conductivity was observed in Bi3.9La0.1V2O11 and Bi3.8Gd0.2V2O11 samples in the range of 10(-3)-10(-4) S/cm for 700-500 degrees C. These results were supported by impedance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).","Structural, thermal and conductive properties of Bi4-xMxV2O11 (M = La, Gd; 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) compounds",10.1016/j.cap.2009.03.025
