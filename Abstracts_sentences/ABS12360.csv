1,12360,"The mixed ionic-electronic conductivity under dilute hydrogen, the stability and the catalytic activity under propane:air type mixtures of a series of LAMOX oxide-ion conductors have been studied.",Tests for the Use of La2Mo2O9-based Oxides as Multipurpose SOFC Core Materials,10.1002/fuce.200900099
2,12360,"The effect of exposure to dilute hydrogen on the conductivity of the beta-La-2(Mo2-yWy)09 series at 600 degrees C depends on tungsten content: almost negligible for the highest (y = 1.4), it is important for La2Mo2O9 (y = 0).",Tests for the Use of La2Mo2O9-based Oxides as Multipurpose SOFC Core Materials,10.1002/fuce.200900099
3,12360,"In propane:air, all tested LAMOX electrolytes are stable at 600-700 degrees C, but get reduced when water vapour is present.",Tests for the Use of La2Mo2O9-based Oxides as Multipurpose SOFC Core Materials,10.1002/fuce.200900099
4,12360,"La2Mo2O9 is the best oxidation catalyst of the series, with an activity comparable to that of nickel.",Tests for the Use of La2Mo2O9-based Oxides as Multipurpose SOFC Core Materials,10.1002/fuce.200900099

6,12360,"These results suggest that depending on composition, La-2(Mo2-yWy)O-9 compounds could be either electrolytes in single-chamber SOFC and dual-chamber micro-SOFC (y = 1.4) or anode materials in dual-chamber SOFC (low y) or oxidation catalysts in SOFCs operating with propane (y = 0).",Tests for the Use of La2Mo2O9-based Oxides as Multipurpose SOFC Core Materials,10.1002/fuce.200900099
