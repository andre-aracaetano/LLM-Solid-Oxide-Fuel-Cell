1,11902,"The amorphous LaMoO material was investigated as a sulfur-tolerant anode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which was obtained by reducing the ionic conductor La(2)Mo(2)O(9) in the SOFC anodic atmosphere.",Amorphous ceramic material as sulfur-tolerant anode for SOFC,10.1149/1.2965522
2,11902,The performance of the amorphous anode was assessed using the electrolyte-supported cells with a 300 mu m thick La(0.8)Sr(0.2)Ga(0.83)Mg(0.17)O(3-delta) disk as the electrolyte and SrCo(0.8)Fe(0.2)O(3-delta) as the cathode.,Amorphous ceramic material as sulfur-tolerant anode for SOFC,10.1149/1.2965522
3,11902,"A single cell with the LaMoO anode achieved a maximum power density of 1.49 and 0.86 W/cm(2) in dry H(2) at 900 and 800 degrees C, respectively.",Amorphous ceramic material as sulfur-tolerant anode for SOFC,10.1149/1.2965522
4,11902,"Essentially, no decay in cell performance was observed over 100 h in both pure H(2) and H(2) containing 20 ppm H(2)S, indicating that the amorphous material is a potential sulfur-tolerant anode.",Amorphous ceramic material as sulfur-tolerant anode for SOFC,10.1149/1.2965522
5,11902,The degradation of the LaMoO anode in a higher concentration of H(2)S was likely due to its chemical reaction with H(2)S. (C) 2008 The Electrochemical Society.,Amorphous ceramic material as sulfur-tolerant anode for SOFC,10.1149/1.2965522
