2,20454,LSCF shows different stability against CO2 and H2O at high and low temperature.,High- and low- temperature behaviors of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode operating under CO2/H2O-containing atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.089
3,20454,LSCF has excellent electrochemical performance and high stability against the corrosion of CO2 and H2O at 750 degrees C due to weak reactivity of LSCF with CO2.,High- and low- temperature behaviors of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode operating under CO2/H2O-containing atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.089
4,20454,"LSCF shows a serious degradation at 600 degrees C under operation with O-2-CO2(2.83%)-H2O(2.64%), which is ascribed to the impeded oxygen activation and oxygen surface diffusion by surface carbonates and SrCO3 phases on LSCF surface.",High- and low- temperature behaviors of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode operating under CO2/H2O-containing atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.089
5,20454,"Under CO2(5%)-H2O(2.81%)-He, LSCF reacts with CO2 to yield SrCO3 phases in 400-680 degrees C, and H2O aggravates the chemical reaction between CO2 and LSCF.",High- and low- temperature behaviors of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode operating under CO2/H2O-containing atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.089
6,20454,"Taking into account of SrCO3 phase formation on LSCF, LSCF cathode is stable under operation with O-2-CO2(2.83%)-H2O(2.64%) in 680-800 degrees C, whereas it is unstable below 680 degrees C. LSCF can be subject to degradation caused by CO2 and H2O in air during long-term operation below 680 degrees",High- and low- temperature behaviors of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode operating under CO2/H2O-containing atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.089
