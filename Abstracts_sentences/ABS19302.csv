3,19302,"Specifically, the addition of Dy and Y co-doped Bi2O3-$ oxide (DBY) with a conductivity of 0.34 S cm-1 at 700 degrees C, which is almost 9 and 20 times higher than conventional SDC and YSZ oxides, has found to substantially reduce the electrode sintering temperature and enhance the transport ability of ion and electron at the inter-face.",Improved La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-d oxygen electrode activity by introducing high oxygen ion conductor oxide for solid oxide steam electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.08.316
4,19302,"As a result, the interface polarization resistance of the LSM/DBY composite electrode is as low as 0.096 U cm2 at 700 degrees C. Finally, a solid oxide cell equipped with an LSM/DBY electrode attains a high power density of 1.78 Wcm-2 in fuel cell mode at 800 degrees C and 3%H2O-H2, as well as a current density of-1.58 Acm-2 in electrolysis mode under 1.50 V and 50% H2O-H2 condition.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.",Improved La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-d oxygen electrode activity by introducing high oxygen ion conductor oxide for solid oxide steam electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.08.316
