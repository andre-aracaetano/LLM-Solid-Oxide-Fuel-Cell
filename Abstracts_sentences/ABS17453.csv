3,17453,"The evaluation of single-cell performance, with 8YSZ electrolyte and LSM cathode and this anode material, operating in H-2 and methane fuels, in comparison with a similar single-cell using Cu-ceria-based anode allows to conclude that the substitution of copper (20 at.%) by cobalt in the anode composition enhances the single cell performance as well as reduces the carbon deposit formation on the anode after running on hydrocarbon fuels (methane).",Effect of cobalt incorporation in copper-ceria based anodes for hydrocarbon utilisation in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.053
