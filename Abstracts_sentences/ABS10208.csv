1,10208,"BaSn0.5Y0.5-xInxO2.75 (x=0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) proton conductors were synthesized by a gel polymerization method, and the effect of indium content on the sinterability, microstructural and electrical properties were investigated.",Effect of indium content on the properties of BaSn0.5Y0.5-xInxO2.75 proton conductor,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.136
2,10208,"The results show that the indium doping to BaSn0.5Y0.5-xInxO2.75 can reduce the sintering temperature (1450 degrees C) to obtain dense pellets, and the relative densities and grain size of samples slightly increase with increasing indium content.",Effect of indium content on the properties of BaSn0.5Y0.5-xInxO2.75 proton conductor,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.136
3,10208,"The indium doped BaSn0.5Y0.5-xInxO2.75 leads to the decrease of lattice volume, which hampers the proton diffusion, and thus causes the decrease of the conductivity of BaSn0.5Y0.5-xInxO2.75 with increasing indium content.",Effect of indium content on the properties of BaSn0.5Y0.5-xInxO2.75 proton conductor,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.136
