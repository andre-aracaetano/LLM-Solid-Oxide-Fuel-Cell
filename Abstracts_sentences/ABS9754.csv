1,9754,Precursors of thin films were deposited on alumina substrates at temperature of 250 degrees C using spray pyrolysis technique and BICUVOX phase obtained after annealing at 650 degrees C. Thermal decomposition behavior of BICUVOX precursor was studied using TGA-DTA technique.,Temperature dependent conductivity and dielectric properties of Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 solid electrolyte thin films,10.1016/j.mseb.2006.10.011
2,9754,"It reveals that formation of oxide phase takes place beyond 630 degrees C. X-ray diffraction and SEM techniques were employed for structural and surface morphological characterizations, respectively.",Temperature dependent conductivity and dielectric properties of Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 solid electrolyte thin films,10.1016/j.mseb.2006.10.011
