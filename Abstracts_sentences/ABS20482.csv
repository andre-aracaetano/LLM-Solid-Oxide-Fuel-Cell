4,20482,We report a particularly high oxygenstorage capacity (OSC) for x & GE; 0.25 and showthat the oxygen extracted from these mixed oxides is of a differentorigin than that extracted from CeO2.,Exploring the Redox Properties of Ce1-x U x O2±δ (x ≤ 0.5) Oxides for Energy Applications,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01035
5,20482,"While in ceria, oxygenis extracted from the tetrahedral sites, leading to the formationof oxygen vacancies, the extracted oxygen in Ce1-x U x O2 & PLUSMN;& delta; (x & GE; 0.25) is essentially excess oxygenin the fluorite lattice (which spontaneously penetrates the oxideunder ambient or oxidative conditions).",Exploring the Redox Properties of Ce1-x U x O2±δ (x ≤ 0.5) Oxides for Energy Applications,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01035
6,20482,"This property, which is clearlyrelated to the change in the valency of the U cations, is apparentlyresponsible for the higher OSC and the lower activation energy foroxygen extraction from the mixed oxides compared to ceria.",Exploring the Redox Properties of Ce1-x U x O2±δ (x ≤ 0.5) Oxides for Energy Applications,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01035
7,20482,"The mixedoxide powders are shown to be structurally stable, retaining theirfluorite structure following reduction under Ar-5%H-2 or oxidation in air until 1000 & DEG;C. The presented results providenew insights into the Ce-U-O system which may be exploitedfor future technical applications, as a catalyst for thermochemicalwater splitting, or as a solid electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells.",Exploring the Redox Properties of Ce1-x U x O2±δ (x ≤ 0.5) Oxides for Energy Applications,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01035
