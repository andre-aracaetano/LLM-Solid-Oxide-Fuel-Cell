6,6821,Crystallite size of the deposited material was found to be in the range of 7-9 nm.,Synthesis and characterization of spray deposited PdO-NiO-SDC composite anode material for potential application in IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.12.134
7,6821,"The deposited film showed high oxygen ion conductivity, 3.94 x 10(-1) S cm(-1) at 350 degrees C. Due to their nano-crystalline, porous and composite nature the spray deposited PdO-NiO-SDC films may have high three phase boundary area and hence can be considered as an anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.",Synthesis and characterization of spray deposited PdO-NiO-SDC composite anode material for potential application in IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.12.134
