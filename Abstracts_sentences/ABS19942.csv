1,19942,Ceria-based catalysts have been assessed for internal methane reforming at low temperature (400-600 C) in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),Screening of ceria-based catalysts for internal methane reforming in low temperature SOFC,10.1016/j.cattod.2010.02.062
2,19942,A combinatorial library of 15 metal (Cu Pt Ni) supported ceria was prepared using wet impregnation method The ceria-based oxides are undoped or doped with metal transition (Zr) or by rare earth (Gd or Pr),Screening of ceria-based catalysts for internal methane reforming in low temperature SOFC,10.1016/j.cattod.2010.02.062
3,19942,The effect of the metal the dopant and the surface area on the catalytic performances was investigated in high-throughput manner using a 16-parallel reactor The catalysts were assessed in two different conditions (i) in CH4 rich condition and (ii) in model reformate condition Catalytic performances are very metal depending In dry conditions Cu-based catalysts do not produce H-2 whereas NI-catalysts are very active despite low carbon balance,Screening of ceria-based catalysts for internal methane reforming in low temperature SOFC,10.1016/j.cattod.2010.02.062
4,19942,However when water and CO2 are added in the feed the nature of the ceria plays an important role in the catalytic performances At low temperature (T < 550 C) most of Ni/ceria catalysts are not active under reformate conditions at low temperature while Pt catalysts appear more robust with respect to the conditions From unsteady state parallel studies we suggest that surface hydroxyl on ceria are the active species (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved,Screening of ceria-based catalysts for internal methane reforming in low temperature SOFC,10.1016/j.cattod.2010.02.062
