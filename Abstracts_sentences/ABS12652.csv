1,12652,"Several combinations of glass-ceramic and steel compositions with excellent chemical and physical properties have been tested in the past in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks, but there have also been some combinations exhibiting pronounced chemical interactions causing severe stack degradation.",A comparative study between resistance measurements in model experiments and solid oxide fuel cell stack performance tests,10.1115/1.2393301
2,12652,"Parallel to the examination of these degradation and short-circuiting phenomena in stack tests, recently less complex model experiments have been developed to study the interaction of glass-ceramic sealants and interconnect steels.",A comparative study between resistance measurements in model experiments and solid oxide fuel cell stack performance tests,10.1115/1.2393301
3,12652,The sealants and steels were tested in the model experiments at operation temperature using a dual air/hydrogen atmosphere similar to stack conditions.,A comparative study between resistance measurements in model experiments and solid oxide fuel cell stack performance tests,10.1115/1.2393301
4,12652,The present work compares electrochemical performance under constant current load of SOFC stack tests with the resistance changes in model experiments.,A comparative study between resistance measurements in model experiments and solid oxide fuel cell stack performance tests,10.1115/1.2393301
5,12652,"In addition, microstructural results of post-operation inspection of various sealant-steel combinations are presented.",A comparative study between resistance measurements in model experiments and solid oxide fuel cell stack performance tests,10.1115/1.2393301
6,12652,"The model experiments have shown that under the chosen experimental conditions, distinct changes of the specific resistance of the specimens correlate well with the changes of the electrochemical performance of SOFC stacks, indicating that this method can be considered as an excellent comparative method to provide useful information on the physical and chemical interactions between glass-ceramic sealants and ferritic steels.",A comparative study between resistance measurements in model experiments and solid oxide fuel cell stack performance tests,10.1115/1.2393301
