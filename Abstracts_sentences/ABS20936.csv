3,20936,"However, CsBi2Ti2NbO10-delta undergoes a phase transition around 800 K, which may make it unsuitable for practical applications.",Dion-Jacobson-type oxide-ion conductor CsLa2Ti2NbO10-δ without phase transitions,10.1039/d0ta06135b
4,20936,"In this study, we present a Dion-Jacobson-type oxide-ion conductor CsLa2Ti2NbO10-delta that does not show phase transitions in the temperature range from 297 K to 1073 K. CsR2Ti2NbO10-delta (R = La, Pr, Nd and Sm) oxides were synthesized.",Dion-Jacobson-type oxide-ion conductor CsLa2Ti2NbO10-δ without phase transitions,10.1039/d0ta06135b

6,20936,"sigma(tot) of CsLa2Ti2NbO10-delta is almost constant from 10(-22) to 1 atm oxygen partial pressure at 873 K, supporting oxide-ion conduction.",Dion-Jacobson-type oxide-ion conductor CsLa2Ti2NbO10-δ without phase transitions,10.1039/d0ta06135b
7,20936,Proton conductivity was not observed between 673 K and 1273 K because the sigma(tot) measured in dry air agreed well with that measured in wet air at the same temperature.,Dion-Jacobson-type oxide-ion conductor CsLa2Ti2NbO10-δ without phase transitions,10.1039/d0ta06135b
8,20936,"Electromotive force measurements by an oxygen concentration cell show an oxide-ion transport number of 0.99 in CsLa2Ti2NbO10-delta at 873 K, which indicates that the major charge carrier in CsLa2Ti2NbO10-delta is the oxide ion.",Dion-Jacobson-type oxide-ion conductor CsLa2Ti2NbO10-δ without phase transitions,10.1039/d0ta06135b
9,20936,"The electrical properties were examined by an AC impedance method, showing a bulk ionic conductivity of 1.01 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 1276 K with an activation energy of 0.932(2) eV. Neutron-diffraction and synchrotron X-ray diffraction data were processed using Rietveld refinements and revealed no phase transitions from 297 K to 1073 K in CsLa2Ti2NbO10-delta.",Dion-Jacobson-type oxide-ion conductor CsLa2Ti2NbO10-δ without phase transitions,10.1039/d0ta06135b
10,20936,"Bond-valence-based energy landscapes of a test oxide ion in CsLa2Ti2NbO10-delta strongly suggest that oxide ions diffuse along the edges of the octahedra in perovskite-like slabs, leading to two-dimensional (2D) oxide-ion diffusion.",Dion-Jacobson-type oxide-ion conductor CsLa2Ti2NbO10-δ without phase transitions,10.1039/d0ta06135b
11,20936,"We attribute the oxide-ion conduction in CsLa2Ti2NbO10-delta to the existence of oxygen vacancies, anisotropic thermal motions of oxygen atoms, and the 2D oxide-ion conducting slab.",Dion-Jacobson-type oxide-ion conductor CsLa2Ti2NbO10-δ without phase transitions,10.1039/d0ta06135b
