1,20095,"A full understanding of the structural glass variations and of the nucleation and growth of crystalline phases in glass-ceramics (GCs) induced by compositional changes is highly relevant for applications such as sealants for solid oxide fuel cells, bio- and dental materials, and photonics.",Influence of Strontium Oxide on Structural Transformations in Diopside-Based Glass-Ceramics Assessed by Diverse Structural Tools,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b02475
2,20095,"Systematic substitution of Ca with Sr in diopside (Di-CaMgSi2O6) has a significant impact on the crystalline-phase assemblage after heat treating at 850 degrees C for 500 h. A high percentage of Di crystallized from Sr-free glass; however, with increasing Sr content the tendency toward crystallization decreased, and Sr-akermanite (Sr-Ak) was preferentially crystallized.",Influence of Strontium Oxide on Structural Transformations in Diopside-Based Glass-Ceramics Assessed by Diverse Structural Tools,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b02475
3,20095,"In this study, the structural transformations in the Di-based-GC system upon the substitution of calcium with strontium have been examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Si-29 and Al-27 magic angle spinning (MAS)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Raman spectroscopies.",Influence of Strontium Oxide on Structural Transformations in Diopside-Based Glass-Ceramics Assessed by Diverse Structural Tools,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b02475

7,20095,"Measured mean quadrupolar coupling constant values augment with increasing Sr content, indicating an increase in order in the glassy phase, which is manifested by a strong preference of Mg2+ for nonbridging oxygens (NBO), resulting in the formation MgO4 tetrahedra.",Influence of Strontium Oxide on Structural Transformations in Diopside-Based Glass-Ceramics Assessed by Diverse Structural Tools,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b02475
8,20095,"At higher Sr substitution levels (>50%), the decrease in Mg2+ coordination from six to four is evident from the decrease in average Mg-O bond lengths and the systematic variation in intensity of characteristic Mg-O Raman vibrational bands.",Influence of Strontium Oxide on Structural Transformations in Diopside-Based Glass-Ceramics Assessed by Diverse Structural Tools,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b02475
