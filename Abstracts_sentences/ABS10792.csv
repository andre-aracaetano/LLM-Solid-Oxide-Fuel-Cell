1,10792,The activity and coking characteristics of a nickel/yttrium stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) anode in a YSZ electrolyte/LSM cathode fuel cell have been investigated by steady state H-2 as well as pulse CH4 and D2O/CH4 reactions.,Pulse CH4/D2O reaction on a Ni/YSZ anode in SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.008
2,10792,"Pulse CH4 reaction produced H-2, CO and carbon deposits (i.e., coke); pulse D2O/CH4 reaction led to the formation of H-2, HD, D-2 and CO under the open circuit condition where O2- was not able to diffuse across the YSZ membrane.",Pulse CH4/D2O reaction on a Ni/YSZ anode in SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.008
3,10792,"Closing the circuit allowed O2- to diffuse across the YSZ membrane from the lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM) cathode to the Ni/YSZ anode, leading to oxidation of HD/D-2 for electric power generation at 750 and 850 degrees C.",Pulse CH4/D2O reaction on a Ni/YSZ anode in SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.008
4,10792,"The observed preferential electrochemical oxidation of HD/D-2, over H, suggests that (i) the reaction of D2O/CH4 (i.e., reforming of CH4 with D2O) occurs at the sites in the vicinity of the three phase boundary (i.e., the Ni-YSZ interface) where the electrochemical oxidation of HD/D2 takes place; (ii) the production of H2 from the dissociation of CH4 occurs on the Ni surface sites which is far from the three phase boundary.",Pulse CH4/D2O reaction on a Ni/YSZ anode in SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.008
5,10792,Build-up of coke has a more significant inhibition effect on the electrochemical oxidation reaction for electric power generation than the CH4 dissociation reaction on the Ni/YSZ anode at 750 and 850 degrees C. Coking could be attributed to the inability of O2- to diffuse on the Ni surface to initiate electrochemical oxidation.,Pulse CH4/D2O reaction on a Ni/YSZ anode in SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.008
