1,13946,"The in situ formation of a heterostructure delivers superior electrochemical properties as compared to the mechanical mixing, which shows great promise for developing new electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",In Situ Formation of Ba3CoNb2O9/Ba5Nb4O15 Heterostructure in Electrolytes for Enhancing Proton Conductivity and SOFC Performance,10.1021/acsami.3c07990
2,13946,"Herein, in an SOFC constructed by the Ba5Nb4O15 electrolyte and Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-delta anode, an in situ formation of Ba3CoNb2O9/Ba5Nb4O15 heterostructure is designed by Co-ion diffusion from the anode to the electrolyte during cell operation, resulting in improved ion conductivity and fuel cell performance.",In Situ Formation of Ba3CoNb2O9/Ba5Nb4O15 Heterostructure in Electrolytes for Enhancing Proton Conductivity and SOFC Performance,10.1021/acsami.3c07990
3,13946,"An abnormal phenomenon is observed that the SOFC based on the Ba3CoNb2O9/Ba5Nb4O15 electrolyte delivered a peak power density of 703 mW/cm(2) at 510 degrees C, which is higher than that at 550 degrees C. Characterization in terms of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction verifies that the operating temperature affected the Co doping concentrations, leading to different conducting behaviors of the heterostructure.",In Situ Formation of Ba3CoNb2O9/Ba5Nb4O15 Heterostructure in Electrolytes for Enhancing Proton Conductivity and SOFC Performance,10.1021/acsami.3c07990
4,13946,"Furthermore, it is found that the heterojunction of Ba3CoNb2O9 and Ba5Nb4O15 can restrict the electron migration to avoid current leakage of the cell and simultaneously enhance the proton conductivity.",In Situ Formation of Ba3CoNb2O9/Ba5Nb4O15 Heterostructure in Electrolytes for Enhancing Proton Conductivity and SOFC Performance,10.1021/acsami.3c07990
5,13946,These findings manifest the developed in situ Ba3CoNb2O9/Ba5Nb4O15 heterostructure as a promising electrolyte for SOFCs.,In Situ Formation of Ba3CoNb2O9/Ba5Nb4O15 Heterostructure in Electrolytes for Enhancing Proton Conductivity and SOFC Performance,10.1021/acsami.3c07990
