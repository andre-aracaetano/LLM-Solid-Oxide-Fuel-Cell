1,21128,"The sulfur poisoning and performance recovery of the state-of-the-art SOFC cathodes (La-0.Sr-80(0).(20))(0).95MnO3 +/-delta (LSM) and (La-0.Sr-60(0).(40))(0).Co-95(0).Fe-20(0).O-80(3-delta) (LSCF), have been studied.",Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
2,21128,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements of LSCF|GDC and LSM|YSZ half-cells are carried out in alternating atmospheres of air and SO2-air at 700 degrees C for hundreds of hours.,Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
3,21128,"In the presence of SO2, the electrochemical performance of both the cells decays with ohmic and non-ohmic losses, owing to the absorption and chemical interaction of SO2 with the electrodes.",Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
4,21128,"In LSCF, the SrO segregated on the surface tends to absorb and react with SO2, forming SrSO4 followed by the exsolution of Co-Fe.",Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
5,21128,"As for LSM, SO2 is absorbed onto the Sr-rich areas of LSM, including the active reaction sites near the TPBs, leading to Sr exsolution and SrSO4 formation, leaving a Sr-deficient LSM.",Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
6,21128,"During the subsequent exposure to air, the performance of the sulfur-contaminated LSM is almost restored.",Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
7,21128,"The LSM particles, exposed to alternating atmospheres of air and SO2-air during the electrochemical tests, show a relatively clean surface with sparsely distributed SrSO4 particles, indicating a high stability against sulfur poisoning.",Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
8,21128,"It is suggested that the loosely adsorbed SO2 at the TPBs is readily swept away by the SO2-free air flow, recovering its ORR activity, whereas the Sr-deficient LSM due to Sr-exsolution stays modified, contributing to the incomplete performance restoration.",Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
9,21128,"Unlike the case of LSM, the performance of the sulfur-poisoned LSCF partially recovers during the subsequent exposure to air.",Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
10,21128,"Correspondingly, the LSCF particles have a modified morphology covered with numerous nanoparticles, mostly SrSO4, showing the irreversible aspect of the sulfur poisoning.",Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
11,21128,"The morphology modification is not concentrated near the electrode/electrolyte interface but over the entire cathode, indicating that the degree of recovery from sulfur poisoning is closely related to the presence of SrO and chemical activity of Sr in the electrodes at the solid-gas interface.",Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
12,21128,These results also show the potential application of LSM for a sulfur sensor available in high-temperature harsh conditions.,Sulfur Poisoning and Performance Recovery of SOFC Air Electrodes,10.3389/fenrg.2021.643431
