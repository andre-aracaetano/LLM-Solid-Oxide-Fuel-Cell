3,21045,This high-pressure phase is isomorphous with cubic zirconia (fluorite-type) with space group Fm (3) over barm and unit-cell parameters a = 4.8830(5)angstrom and V = 116.43(4)angstrom(3).,"Crystal structure and compressibility of a high-pressure Ti-rich oxide, (Ti0.50Zr0.26Mg0.14Cr0.10)O1.81, isomorphous with cubic zirconia",10.1016/j.jpcs.2009.07.017
4,21045,"Like stabilized cubic zirconia, the structure of (Ti0.50Zr0.26Mg0.14Cr0.10)O-1.81 is also relaxed, with all O atoms displaced from the (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) position along < 100 > by 0.319 angstrom and all cations from the (0, 0, 0) position along < 111 > by 0.203 angstrom.","Crystal structure and compressibility of a high-pressure Ti-rich oxide, (Ti0.50Zr0.26Mg0.14Cr0.10)O1.81, isomorphous with cubic zirconia",10.1016/j.jpcs.2009.07.017

6,21045,"Fitting the high-pressure data (V vs. P) to a third-order Birch-Murnaghan EOS yields K-0 = 164(4) GPa, K' = 4.3(7), and V-0 = 116.38(3)angstrom(3).","Crystal structure and compressibility of a high-pressure Ti-rich oxide, (Ti0.50Zr0.26Mg0.14Cr0.10)O1.81, isomorphous with cubic zirconia",10.1016/j.jpcs.2009.07.017
7,21045,The bulk modulus of (Ti0.50Zr0.26Mg0.14Cr0.10)O-1.81 is significantly lower than that (202 GPa) determined experimentally for cubic TiO2 or that (similar to 210 GPa) estimated for cubic ZrO2.,"Crystal structure and compressibility of a high-pressure Ti-rich oxide, (Ti0.50Zr0.26Mg0.14Cr0.10)O1.81, isomorphous with cubic zirconia",10.1016/j.jpcs.2009.07.017
8,21045,"This study demonstrates that cubic TiO2 may also be obtained by introducing various dopants, similar to the way cubic zirconia is stabilized below 2370 degrees","Crystal structure and compressibility of a high-pressure Ti-rich oxide, (Ti0.50Zr0.26Mg0.14Cr0.10)O1.81, isomorphous with cubic zirconia",10.1016/j.jpcs.2009.07.017
