1,15201,"We have measured the electrical power density of a single cell of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 as an electrolyte at an operating temperature of 800 degrees C. A moistened mixture of 10% hydrogen in argon, constituted the fuel gas; air was the oxidant gas.","Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xMx)O3-δ (M = Co, Ni) for use in a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte",10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.038
2,15201,"We selected (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-x)O3-delta (M=Co, Ni) (x=0-0.3) and Ni as cathode and anode materials.","Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xMx)O3-δ (M = Co, Ni) for use in a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte",10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.038
3,15201,The power density was dependent on the amount of the transition metal doped into the cathode; the use of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn0.9Co0.1)O3-delta as a cathode material enabled us to reach a 2 maximum power density of 0.61 W/cm.,"Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xMx)O3-δ (M = Co, Ni) for use in a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte",10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.038
4,15201,We also investigated the diffusion of the constituent elements around the interface between the cathode and the electrolyte by X-ray diffraction and X-ray energy dispersive analysis (EDX).,"Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xMx)O3-δ (M = Co, Ni) for use in a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte",10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.038
5,15201,"We found that the constituent elements Mn, Co, Ni and In diffused to the opposite phase.","Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xMx)O3-δ (M = Co, Ni) for use in a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte",10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.038
6,15201,We suggest that this cation diffusion would change the electrical conductivity of the cathode and electrolyte around the interface and would affect the cathodic reaction.,"Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xMx)O3-δ (M = Co, Ni) for use in a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte",10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.038
7,15201,The interface resistance between the (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte and the (La0.6Sr0.4) (Mn1-xMx)O3-delta (M=Co and Ni) (x=0-0.3) cathode was characterized by the direct current two-probe method.,"Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xMx)O3-δ (M = Co, Ni) for use in a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte",10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.038
8,15201,"It showed minimum values at x=0.1(Co) and x=0.2(Ni), suggesting that the interface properties might strongly affect the power generation of the SOFC.","Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xMx)O3-δ (M = Co, Ni) for use in a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte",10.1016/j.ssi.2006.02.038
