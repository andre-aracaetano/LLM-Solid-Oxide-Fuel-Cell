2,7548,"The molar ratio of Ni to Fe was 9/1, 8/2, 7/3, and 5/5, respectively, and the weight percentage of Ni-Fe in the electrode was 75%.",High performance Ni-Fe-lanthanum gallate composite anodes for dimethyl ether fuel cells,10.1149/1.2211827
3,7548,"The increase in the amount of Fe improved the sintering of the electrode, which led to a change in the microstructure of the electrode and electrode/electrolyte interface dramatically.",High performance Ni-Fe-lanthanum gallate composite anodes for dimethyl ether fuel cells,10.1149/1.2211827
4,7548,"The electrodes showed good activity and stability for DME oxidation without obvious coke deposition, which could be a kind of novel anode for DME SOFCs based on lanthanum gallate electrolytes.",High performance Ni-Fe-lanthanum gallate composite anodes for dimethyl ether fuel cells,10.1149/1.2211827
