5,18076,"The SEM and EDS results indicate that ZnO-doping can induce Si enrichment on the surfaces of samples (i.e. reducing the content of Si at grain boundaries), which may explain the improvements occurs in the grain boundary conductions.","Effect of zinc oxide doping on the grain boundary conductivity of Ce0.8Ln0.2O1.9 ceramics (Ln = Y, Sm, Gd)",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.032
