4,4289,"Compared with traditional full 3D model, the simplified model based on wall-function method shows similar accuracy but uses only about one third mesh elements and spends less than a half of solution time.",Wall-function method used to simplify the solid oxide fuel cell model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230396
5,4289,Numerical results show that there are two important advantages for the wall-function method: 1) it allows a coarse mesh which can significantly reduce the computational storage and time; 2) it allows the introduction of other information in wall-functions and uses denser points in thickness direction which can considerably improve the accuracy of model.,Wall-function method used to simplify the solid oxide fuel cell model,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230396
