1,10067,"Metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with the structure of Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) infiltrated porous 430L anode, YSZ electrolyte and in-situ sintered (Bi2O3)(0.7)(Er2O3)(0.3)-Ag (ESB-Ag) cathode was fabricated and a high power density of 1.3 W cm(-2) was obtained at 750 degrees C. Cell performance was enhanced by the Ni-SDC infiltrated porous 430L anode applied here.",Enhanced Performance and Stability of Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with (Bi2O3)0.7(Er2O3)0.3-Ag Composite Cathode,10.1149/2.0131501jes
2,10067,Replacing the cell electrolyte by SSZ with higher oxide ionic conductivity than that of the YSZ resulted in an improved power density of 1.55 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and the improvement was more obvious at the low temperature.,Enhanced Performance and Stability of Metal-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with (Bi2O3)0.7(Er2O3)0.3-Ag Composite Cathode,10.1149/2.0131501jes
