1,17222,"A SOFC cathode related perovskite material, (La(0.7)Sr(0.3))(0.9)MnO(3), has been investigated by simultaneous thermogravimetry - mass spectrometry from room temperature to 1770 K. Water, carbon dioxide and oxygen were detected by mass spectrometry.",Simultaneous Thermogravimetry - Mass Spectrometry for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode: (La0.7Sr0.3)0.9MnO3,10.1007/BF02376020
2,17222,"Water and carbon dioxide evolution can be interpreted by assuming that prior to the thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry measurement about 0.5 % of the lanthanum component had reacted with carbon dioxide and water to form La(2)(CO(3))(3)*8H(2)O, which dehydrated and decomposed via La(2)O(2)CO(3) into La(2)O(3) and evolving H(2)O and CO(2) during the present experiment.",Simultaneous Thermogravimetry - Mass Spectrometry for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode: (La0.7Sr0.3)0.9MnO3,10.1007/BF02376020
3,17222,"The observation that the lanthanum strontium manganite emitted oxygen in two stages can be ascribed to the two different oxygen sites in the perovskite lattice, that is, the oxygen excess and deficient regions.",Simultaneous Thermogravimetry - Mass Spectrometry for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode: (La0.7Sr0.3)0.9MnO3,10.1007/BF02376020
