2,2518,"The porous structures, as shown in the Figure, contain large pores (0.8-1.5 mum) for rapid gas transport and small pores (approximate to2.5 and 35 nm) for fast electrochemical reactions that require large surface areas.",Dual-scale porous electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells from polymer foams,10.1002/adma.200400466
3,2518,"Thus, these electrode materials are ideally suited for electrochemical and catalytic applications, such as for solid oxide fuel cells.",Dual-scale porous electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells from polymer foams,10.1002/adma.200400466
