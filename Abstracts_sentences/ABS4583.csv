2,4583,"The recently developed asymptotic homogenization procedure is applied in order to express the overall thermoelastic constants of the first order equivalent continuum in terms of microfluctuations functions, and these functions are obtained by the solution of the corresponding recursive cell problems.",Overall thermomechanical properties of layered materials for energy devices applications,10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.07.048
3,4583,"The effects of thermal stresses on periodic multi-layered thermoelastic composite reproducing the characteristics of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC-like) are studied assuming periodic body forces and heat sources, and the solution derived by means of the asymptotic homogenization approach is compared with the results obtained by finite elements analysis of the associate heterogeneous material.",Overall thermomechanical properties of layered materials for energy devices applications,10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.07.048
