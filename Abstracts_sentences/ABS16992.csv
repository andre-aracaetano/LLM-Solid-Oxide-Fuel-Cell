1,16992,"Solid solutions in the Gd-2(Ti1-yMoy)(2)O-7 pyrochlore system, with y = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7, have been investigated as potential candidates for the anode material of solid-oxide fuel cells, The electrical conductivity, stability range, and optimal synthesis conditions of the pyrochlore phase have been explored by electrical, coulometric titration, and X-ray diffractometry techniques.",Phase stability acid electrical conductivity in Gd2Ti2O7Gd2Mo2O7 solid solutions,
2,16992,"As the molybdenum content increases, the maximum conductivity increases to a value of 70 S/cm for y = 0.7 at 1000 degrees C, whereas the stability range in the oxygen partial pressure (p(O2)) decreases to just over two orders of magnitude in p(O2) in the temperature range of 600 degrees-1000 degrees C. A decomposition reaction that leads to decreased conductivity in oxidizing atmospheres is proposed.",Phase stability acid electrical conductivity in Gd2Ti2O7Gd2Mo2O7 solid solutions,
