1,10708,"The samples of Sm2-xCexCuO4 (SCC, x=0.0 similar to 0.25) as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) were prepared by the glycine-nitrate process and characterized by XRD and SEM.",Synthesis and performance of Sm2-xCexCuO4 cathode materials for IT-SOFC,
2,10708,The results showed that SCC had no reaction with electrolyte Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.9 (CGO) at 1000 degrees C in air.,Synthesis and performance of Sm2-xCexCuO4 cathode materials for IT-SOFC,
3,10708,SEM results indicated that the electrode formed good contact with CGO electrolyte after sintering at 1 000 degrees C for 2 h. AC impedance spectroscopy and DC polarization measurements showed that the polarization resistance decreased with the doping of cerium in the lattice.,Synthesis and performance of Sm2-xCexCuO4 cathode materials for IT-SOFC,
4,10708,The optimum value of Sm1.8Ce0.2CuO4 resulted in 0.37 ohm center dot cm(2) area specific resistance (ASR) at 750 degrees C in air.,Synthesis and performance of Sm2-xCexCuO4 cathode materials for IT-SOFC,
5,10708,The charge transfer process was the rate-limiting step of the electrode reactions as indicated by the oxygen partial pressure measurement.,Synthesis and performance of Sm2-xCexCuO4 cathode materials for IT-SOFC,
