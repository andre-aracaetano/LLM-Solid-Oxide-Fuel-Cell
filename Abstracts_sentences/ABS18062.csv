1,18062,Protective coatings are needed for metallic interconnects used in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks to prevent excessive high-temperature oxidation and evaporation of chromium species.,Development and Application of HVOF Sprayed Spinel Protective Coating for SOFC Interconnects,10.1007/s11666-012-9880-9
2,18062,These phenomena affect the lifetime of the stacks by increasing the area-specific resistance (ASR) and poisoning of the cathode.,Development and Application of HVOF Sprayed Spinel Protective Coating for SOFC Interconnects,10.1007/s11666-012-9880-9
3,18062,Protective MnCo2O4 and MnCo1.8Fe0.2O4 coatings were applied on ferritic steel interconnect material (Crofer 22 APU) by high velocity oxy fuel spraying.,Development and Application of HVOF Sprayed Spinel Protective Coating for SOFC Interconnects,10.1007/s11666-012-9880-9
4,18062,The substrate-coating systems were tested in long-term exposure tests to investigate their high-temperature oxidation behavior.,Development and Application of HVOF Sprayed Spinel Protective Coating for SOFC Interconnects,10.1007/s11666-012-9880-9
5,18062,"Additionally, the ASRs were measured at 700 degrees C for 1000 h. Finally, a real coated interconnect was used in a SOFC single-cell stack for 6000 h. Post-mortem analysis was carried out with scanning electron microscopy.",Development and Application of HVOF Sprayed Spinel Protective Coating for SOFC Interconnects,10.1007/s11666-012-9880-9
6,18062,"The deposited coatings reduced significantly the oxidation of the metal, exhibited low and stable ASR and reduced effectively the migration of chromium.",Development and Application of HVOF Sprayed Spinel Protective Coating for SOFC Interconnects,10.1007/s11666-012-9880-9
