1,16342,"This study examined sulfur tolerant materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating on H2S and H2S containing fuels, focusing on the stability and electrochemical performance of perovskite-type materials in a H2S atmosphere under SOFC operating conditions (P = 1 atm, T > 800 degrees C).",Sulfur-tolerant materials for the hydrogen sulfide SOFC,10.1149/1.1788613
2,16342,"Preliminary results indicate anodes of the general form LaxSryVO3-delta are stable and active toward the electrochemical oxidation of H2S. In particular, an SOFC using La0.7Sr0.3VO3 as the anode has shown good performance at H2S levels of 10%, over 5000 times greater than the H2S tolerance level of contemporary Ni-based systems.",Sulfur-tolerant materials for the hydrogen sulfide SOFC,10.1149/1.1788613
3,16342,The results are promising due to the drastic improvement in sulfur tolerance compared to the current generation of SOFC anode materials.,Sulfur-tolerant materials for the hydrogen sulfide SOFC,10.1149/1.1788613
