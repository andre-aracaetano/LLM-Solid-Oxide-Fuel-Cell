1,9721,Bismuth-based oxides exhibit outstanding oxygen ionic conductivity and fast oxygen surface kinetics and have shown great potential as a highly active component for electrode materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,In Situ Formation of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 Protective Layer at Cobaltite Cathode/Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte Interface under Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operation Conditions,10.1021/acsami.8b14026
2,9721,"Herein, a Nb-doped La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-delta (LSCFNb) electrode with 40% (ESB) composite electrode was successfully fabricated by decoration method and directly assembled on barrier-layer-free yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte cells, achieving a peak power density of 1.32 W cm(-2) and excellent stability at 750 degrees C and 250 mA cm(-2) for 100 h. ESB decoration also significantly reduces the activation energy from 214 kJ mol(-1) for the O-2 reduction on pristine LSCFNb electrode to 98 kJ molt.",In Situ Formation of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 Protective Layer at Cobaltite Cathode/Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte Interface under Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operation Conditions,10.1021/acsami.8b14026
3,9721,"Further microstructural analysis reveals that there is a redistribution and migration of the ESB phase in the ESB-LSCFNb composite toward the YSZ electrolyte under the influence of cathodic polarization, forming a thin ESB layer at the cathode/YSZ electrolyte interface.",In Situ Formation of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 Protective Layer at Cobaltite Cathode/Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte Interface under Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operation Conditions,10.1021/acsami.8b14026
4,9721,"The in situ formed ESB layer not only prevents the direct contact and subsequent reaction between segregated SrO and YSZ electrolytes, but also remarkably promotes the oxygen migration/diffusion at the interface for O-2 reduction reaction, resulting in a remarkable increase in power output and a decrease in activation energy.",In Situ Formation of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 Protective Layer at Cobaltite Cathode/Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte Interface under Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operation Conditions,10.1021/acsami.8b14026
5,9721,The present study clearly demonstrated the in situ formation of a highly functional and active ESB protective layer at LSCFNb cobaltite cathode and YSZ electrolyte interface via ESB-decorated LSCFNb composite cathode under SOFC operation conditions.,In Situ Formation of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 Protective Layer at Cobaltite Cathode/Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte Interface under Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operation Conditions,10.1021/acsami.8b14026
