1,17974,"The oxygen tracer diffusion and surface exchange coefficients of Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3-delta (SCM), measured by the O-18/O-16 isotopic exchange depth profile method with time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometric analysis at 973-1123 K, are substantially higher than those of (La,Sr)MnO3-delta.","Oxygen exchange, thermochemical expansion and cathodic behavior of perovskite-like Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3-δ",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.013
2,17974,"Testing of model solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with SCM cathodes, ceria-based protective interlayers and Ni-containing cermet anodes demonstrated a relatively good and stable performance.","Oxygen exchange, thermochemical expansion and cathodic behavior of perovskite-like Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3-δ",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.013
3,17974,"For 0.5 mm thick solid electrolyte membranes made of ZrO2- 10 mol% Sc2O3- 1 mol% Y2O3 and doped lanthanum gallate, the maximum power density at 1073 K was approximately 170 and 230 mW/cm(2), respectively, without microstructural optimization and surface modification of the electrodes.","Oxygen exchange, thermochemical expansion and cathodic behavior of perovskite-like Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3-δ",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.11.013
