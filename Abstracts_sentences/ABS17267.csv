1,17267,"In this study, we used quantum mechanics (QM) to investigate steam reforming of methane on Ni-alloy catalyst surfaces and to examine the effect of anode material modifications on the catalytic processes in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).","First-Principles Modeling of Ni4M (M = Co, Fe, and Mn) Alloys as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst for Methane Reforming",10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b06847
2,17267,"The conventional Ni anode suffers from coking, coarsening, and sulfur poisoning because of the decomposition of hydrocarbon fuels, Ni particle agglomeration at high operating temperature, and impurities contained in fuels.","First-Principles Modeling of Ni4M (M = Co, Fe, and Mn) Alloys as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst for Methane Reforming",10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b06847
3,17267,"Ni-electrode surface modification, such as alloying Ni with other metals (e.g., Fe and Cu), is probably the most practical and promising way of developing SOFC anodes tolerant to coking and sulfur poisoning.","First-Principles Modeling of Ni4M (M = Co, Fe, and Mn) Alloys as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst for Methane Reforming",10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b06847

5,17267,"We have performed QM calculations of segregation energy for various surface structures of five-layer Ni4M slabs (M = Co, Fe, and Mn) and found that Ni atoms show segregation preference for the surface layer and the most favorable Ni4M surface structure has two M atoms in the 2nd layer and one M atom in the 3rd and in the 4th layer (the numbering starts from the bottom layer).","First-Principles Modeling of Ni4M (M = Co, Fe, and Mn) Alloys as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst for Methane Reforming",10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b06847
6,17267,"This structure was used for our further QM calculations of binding energies for CHx, C, and H. We find that the Ni4M(111) surfaces bind CHx species weaker (by 110 kcal/mol) than pure Ni, and the binding energy of C is always similar to 10 kcal/mol lower for the Ni4M alloys compared to pure Ni.","First-Principles Modeling of Ni4M (M = Co, Fe, and Mn) Alloys as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst for Methane Reforming",10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b06847
