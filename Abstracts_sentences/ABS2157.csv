2,2157,This work studies multilinear-model predictive control of a tubular SOFC.,Multilinear-Model Predictive Control of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1021/ie301107r
3,2157,The objective is to control the fuel cell outlet voltage over a wide range of operating conditions by manipulating inlet fuel pressure (flow rate).,Multilinear-Model Predictive Control of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1021/ie301107r
4,2157,A first-principles model of an ammonia fed-tubular solid oxide fuel cell is used for the controller design.,Multilinear-Model Predictive Control of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1021/ie301107r
5,2157,"The model accounts for diffusion, inherent impedance, transport (momentum, heat and mass transfer), electrochemical reactions, activation and concentration polarizations, and the ammonia decomposition reaction.",Multilinear-Model Predictive Control of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1021/ie301107r
6,2157,The servo and regulatory performances of the multimodel predictive controller (MMPC) are compared with those of a single-model predictive controller (SMPC) and a proportional-integral (PI) controller.,Multilinear-Model Predictive Control of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1021/ie301107r
7,2157,"For small load changes, the MMPC, SMPC, and PI controller all provide zero offset, and the MMPC yields the best closed-loop performance.",Multilinear-Model Predictive Control of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1021/ie301107r
8,2157,"However, for large load changes, the SMPC and PI controller fail to provide zero offset; under these two controllers the closed-loop system with the large load changes is unstable.",Multilinear-Model Predictive Control of a Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1021/ie301107r
