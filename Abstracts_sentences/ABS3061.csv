1,3061,Cobalt - free perovskite oxide La0.5Ba0.5Fe0.95Mo0.05O3-delta (LBFMo) was investigated as the electrode of symmetric solid oxide fuel cell (S - SOFC) based on 300 - um - thick La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte.,A novel cobalt-free La0.5Ba0.5Fe0.95Mo0.05O3-δ electrode for symmetric solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.04.050
2,3061,The electrochemical performance of the S - SOFC with LBFMo vertical bar LSGM vertical bar LBFMo configuration was evaluated using ambient air as oxidant and H-2 as fuel.,A novel cobalt-free La0.5Ba0.5Fe0.95Mo0.05O3-δ electrode for symmetric solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.04.050
3,3061,"The maximum power density (P-max) of the S - SOFC achieves as high as 0.96 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C; meanwhile, the total polarization resistance (R-pt) of the S - SOFC (including the contributions of both cathode and anode) is only similar to 0.12 Omega cm(2) .",A novel cobalt-free La0.5Ba0.5Fe0.95Mo0.05O3-δ electrode for symmetric solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.04.050
