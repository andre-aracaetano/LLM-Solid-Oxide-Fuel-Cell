2,243,"The source of uncontrollability is the equation for pressure of the water vapor that is only affected by the fuel cell current, which in fact is a disturbance in this system and cannot be controlled by the given model inputs: inlet molar flow rates of hydrogen and oxygen.",On controllability and system constraints of the linear models of proton exchange membrane and solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.034

4,243,"However, due to their simplicity, they can be used in hybrid configurations with other energy producing devices such as photovoltaic (solar) cells, wind turbine, micro gas turbine, battery (ultra capacitor) to demonstrate some other phenomena, but not for control purposes unless the hybrid models formed in such hybrid configurations are controllable.",On controllability and system constraints of the linear models of proton exchange membrane and solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.034
