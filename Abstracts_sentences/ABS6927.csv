2,6927,"Attention was focused on the effect of citric acid on the phase structure, surface energy and coking resistance of Ni0.75Fe0.25 catalyst for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Development of nickel-iron bimetallic catalytic layer for solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of citric acid,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.263
3,6927,"The FeNi3 phase can be observed in all reduced catalysts, while the grain size of catalysts increases with increasing CA content.",Development of nickel-iron bimetallic catalytic layer for solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of citric acid,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.263
4,6927,The O-2-TPO profiles and Raman spectra reveal that the CA1.5 catalyst has the best coking resistance among all catalysts.,Development of nickel-iron bimetallic catalytic layer for solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of citric acid,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.263
5,6927,"In addition, the cell with the CA1.5 catalyst layer has a maximum peak power density 271 mW cm(-2), when operating at 650 degrees C in methane.",Development of nickel-iron bimetallic catalytic layer for solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of citric acid,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.263
6,6927,"Moreover, the voltage of cell with the CA1.5 catalyst layer still remains 74% of the initial value, after operating in methane for 9 h under a current density of 600 mA cm(-2) at 650 degrees C, which is much more stable than that of the CA-free catalyst layer (53%).",Development of nickel-iron bimetallic catalytic layer for solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of citric acid,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.263
