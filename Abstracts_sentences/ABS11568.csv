3,11568,"A Ni-YSZ anode-supported YSZ electrolyte cell with an in situ assembled LSCF electrode exhibits a peak power density of 1.72 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C. However, the cell performance degrades significantly at 500 mAcm(-2) and 750 degrees C.",Polarization-Induced Interface and Sr Segregation of in Situ Assembled La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Electrodes on Y2O3-ZrO2 Electrolyte of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.6b11665
