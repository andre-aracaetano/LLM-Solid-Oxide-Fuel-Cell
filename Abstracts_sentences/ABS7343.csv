2,7343,Technical University of Denmark (DTU) Energy Conversion's research into planar metal supported cells (MSCs) has produced an advanced cell design with high performance and mechanical robustness.,Advances in Metal Supported Cells in the METSOFC EU Consortium,10.1002/fuce.201200185
3,7343,"At low operation temperatures (650 degrees C), these cells have shown low Area-specific resistances (ASRs): 0.35cm(2) in cell tests (16cm(2) active area) and under 0.3cm(2) in button cells (0.5cm(2) active area).",Advances in Metal Supported Cells in the METSOFC EU Consortium,10.1002/fuce.201200185
4,7343,"Further success was attained with even larger cell areas of 12x12cm(2) squares, which facilitated integration into small stacks at Topsoe Fuel Cell having powers approaching 1/2kW. Development of MSC stacks showed that the MSCs could achieve similar or better performance, compared to most standard industrial anode supported ceramic cells.",Advances in Metal Supported Cells in the METSOFC EU Consortium,10.1002/fuce.201200185
