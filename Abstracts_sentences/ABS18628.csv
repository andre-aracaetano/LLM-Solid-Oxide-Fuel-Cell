1,18628,"A key consideration for the successful operation of hybrid energy systems will be the environmental stability of materials used for their construction, particularly when experiencing service environments containing water vapor at high temperatures.",Environmental stability of additively manufactured siliconized silicon carbide for applications in hybrid energy systems,10.1111/jace.19256
2,18628,"Here, we report results from the characterization of siliconized silicon carbide (Si-SiC) prepared via binder jet additive manufacturing and reactive silicon melt infiltration after being exposed to environments representative of those in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes, and to exhaust gases inside a microturbine operating on natural gas.",Environmental stability of additively manufactured siliconized silicon carbide for applications in hybrid energy systems,10.1111/jace.19256
3,18628,"In both cases, it was found that oxide scales formed on the surface and that these scales were dense, continuous, and well-bonded to the substrates, although there was evidence of transverse and longitudinal cracking most likely as a result of mismatches in the thermal expansion of the scale and the substrate.",Environmental stability of additively manufactured siliconized silicon carbide for applications in hybrid energy systems,10.1111/jace.19256
4,18628,"Measured values of the thickness of the oxide scale were compared to those predicted by parabolic oxidation kinetics of silicon, but the potential effects of silica volatilization induced by water vapor, and silica reduction when exposed to hydrogen are discussed.",Environmental stability of additively manufactured siliconized silicon carbide for applications in hybrid energy systems,10.1111/jace.19256
5,18628,The overall results showed that the oxide scale is expected to be protective under the conditions of hybrid power generation systems.,Environmental stability of additively manufactured siliconized silicon carbide for applications in hybrid energy systems,10.1111/jace.19256
