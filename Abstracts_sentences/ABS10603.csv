1,10603,Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-sigma (BSCF) as the new cathode material of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (ITSOFC) has been synthesized by co-precipitation method.,Investigation on synthesis of the new cathode material Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-σ by co-precipitation method,
2,10603,The dependents of crystalline structure and particle size of BSCF powders on the calcination temperature were investigated.,Investigation on synthesis of the new cathode material Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-σ by co-precipitation method,
3,10603,"From XRD, DSC and SEM, it has been shown that the cubic perovskite structure has been formed after calcined a 900 degrees C for 2 h, but its crystalline is not complete and it still contains a little unknown phase.",Investigation on synthesis of the new cathode material Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-σ by co-precipitation method,
4,10603,"With calcining temperature increasing, the unknown phase disappears, and BSCF turns into uniform cubic perovskite structure after calcining at 1200 degrees C for 2 h. The particle size of BSCF is about 2 mu m similar to 3 gm.",Investigation on synthesis of the new cathode material Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-σ by co-precipitation method,
5,10603,"There is not other phase in the mixture (1: 1) of BSCF and Ce0.8SM0.2O1.9 (SDC) after calcining at 1000 degrees C for 24 h, so it-demonstrates that BSCF possesses good chemical stability with SDC.",Investigation on synthesis of the new cathode material Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-σ by co-precipitation method,
