1,582,"A novel system based on the indirect oxy-combustion of coal in a liquid Sb anode solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has been used to produce electricity for over 48 h. Pulverized anthracite was fed to the liquidantimony-anode of the fuel cell, and a peak power density of 47 mW cm(-2) was reached at 1023 K and 35 mW cm(-2) at 973 K.",Oxy-combustion of coal in liquid-antimony-anode solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.proci.2018.08.056
