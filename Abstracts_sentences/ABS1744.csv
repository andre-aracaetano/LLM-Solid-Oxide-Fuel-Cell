1,1744,This work focuses on the heterogeneous reactions taking place in a tubular anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) when the designated fuel is biogas from anaerobic digestion directly feeding the fuel cell.,Direct reforming of biogas on Ni-based SOFC anodes: Modelling of heterogeneous reactions and validation with experiments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.020
2,1744,Operational maps of the fuel cell running on direct reforming of biogas were first obtained.,Direct reforming of biogas on Ni-based SOFC anodes: Modelling of heterogeneous reactions and validation with experiments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.020
3,1744,Hence a mathematical model incorporating the kinetics of reforming reactions on Ni catalyst was used to predict the gas composition profile along the fuel channel.,Direct reforming of biogas on Ni-based SOFC anodes: Modelling of heterogeneous reactions and validation with experiments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.020
4,1744,The model was validated against experimental data based on polarization curves.,Direct reforming of biogas on Ni-based SOFC anodes: Modelling of heterogeneous reactions and validation with experiments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.020
5,1744,"Also, the anode off-gas composition was collected and analyzed through a gas chromatograph.",Direct reforming of biogas on Ni-based SOFC anodes: Modelling of heterogeneous reactions and validation with experiments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.020
6,1744,"Finally, the model has been used to predict and analyze the gas composition change along the anode channel to evaluate effectiveness of the direct steam reforming when varying cell temperature, inlet fuel composition and the type of reforming process.",Direct reforming of biogas on Ni-based SOFC anodes: Modelling of heterogeneous reactions and validation with experiments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.020
7,1744,The simulations results confirmed that thermodynamic-equilibrium conditions are not fully achieved inside the anode channel.,Direct reforming of biogas on Ni-based SOFC anodes: Modelling of heterogeneous reactions and validation with experiments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.020
8,1744,It also outlines that a direct biogas utilization in an anode-supported SOFC is able to provide good performance and to ensure a good conversion of the methane even though when the cell temperature is far from the nominal value.,Direct reforming of biogas on Ni-based SOFC anodes: Modelling of heterogeneous reactions and validation with experiments,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.020
