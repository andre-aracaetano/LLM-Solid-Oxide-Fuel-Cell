5,8543,"Various types of monolithic SOFC unit cells were prepared; one consisting of a NiO-YSZ anode, NiO/YSZ-YSZ anode functional layer, and LSM-GDC cathode had a current density of 0.37 A/cm(2) at 0.7 V at 800 degrees C. Optimized monolithic SOFC consisting of NiO/YSZ-YSZ anode and YSZ electrolyte and LSW/GDC cathode had a greatly improved current density of 0.84 A/cm(2).",Development of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by tape-casting and single-step co-firing of monolithic laminates,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.11.122
