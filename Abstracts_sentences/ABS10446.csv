1,10446,A robust and versatile sample preparation technique for the fabrication of cylindrical pillars for imaging by X-ray nano-computed tomography (nano-CT) is presented.,Laser-preparation of geometrically optimised samples for X-ray nano-CT,10.1111/jmi.12577
2,10446,"The procedure employs simple, cost-effective laser micro-machining coupled with focused-ion beam (FIB) milling, when required, to yield mechanically robust samples at the micrometre length-scale to match the field-of-view (FOV) for nano-CT imaging.",Laser-preparation of geometrically optimised samples for X-ray nano-CT,10.1111/jmi.12577
3,10446,"A variety of energy and geological materials are exhibited as case studies, demonstrating the procedure can be applied to a variety of materials to provide geometrically optimised samples whose size and shape are tailored to the attenuation coefficients of the constituent phases.",Laser-preparation of geometrically optimised samples for X-ray nano-CT,10.1111/jmi.12577
4,10446,The procedure can be implemented for the bespoke preparation of pillars for both lab-and synchrotron-based X-ray nano-CT investigations of a wide range of samples.,Laser-preparation of geometrically optimised samples for X-ray nano-CT,10.1111/jmi.12577
