1,7491,This study presents the results of investigations on performance and durability of an ammonia-supplied MK352 solid oxide fuel cell stack with electrolyte supported cells and chromium based interconnects.,Towards a wastewater energy recovery system: The utilization of humidified ammonia by a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227608
2,7491,"The performance evaluation revealed no significant differences between ammonia and equivalent hydrogen/nitrogen gases as fuel, which was a result of the excellent ammonia conversion rates up to 99.99%.",Towards a wastewater energy recovery system: The utilization of humidified ammonia by a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227608
3,7491,"When using high ammonia flow rates, temperature measurements inside the stack revealed a temperature drop due to the endothermic ammonia decomposition of up to 18.8 K, which proceeded preferentially at the fuel inlet region.",Towards a wastewater energy recovery system: The utilization of humidified ammonia by a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227608
4,7491,"An 1000 h durability test with humidified ammonia in 80% fuel utilization condition was performed, which resulted in a stack performance degradation rate of about 1.1%/1000",Towards a wastewater energy recovery system: The utilization of humidified ammonia by a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227608
5,7491,"h. Tests with hydrogen/nitrogen fueled reference stacks revealed similar degradation rates during the initial 1000 h. Post-mortem analyses by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed no significant micro-structural deterioration of the functional layers of the anode, but nitriding effects on the nickel contact meshes and chromium nitrides were found in the material structure of the interconnects.",Towards a wastewater energy recovery system: The utilization of humidified ammonia by a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227608
6,7491,"Also, an oxide layer was found between interconnect and contact meshes at the anode, which appears to be the main cause of the performance degradation.",Towards a wastewater energy recovery system: The utilization of humidified ammonia by a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227608
