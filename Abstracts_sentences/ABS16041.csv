1,16041,"The perovskite compounds La0.33Sr0.67Cr1-x-yFexRuyO3-delta (LSCrFeRu, x = 0.62, 0.57, and 0.47; y = 0.05, 0.14, and 0.2, respectively) were synthesized and assessed as a new type of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode in composite with Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-beta (GDC) in La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-epsilon/La0.4Ce0.6O2 bilayer electrolyte-supported cells.","Decreasing the Polarization Resistance of (La,Sr)CrO3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes by Combined Fe and Ru Substitution",10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00622
2,16041,"By comparing anode polarization resistance R-P,R-A values for the LSCrFeRu compounds to the either exclusively Fe- or Ru-substituted (La,Sr)CrO3-delta perovskites, the present results demonstrate that the two substituent cations work synergistically to provide further reduction in R-P,R-A from 0.290 Omega.cm(2) for La0.33Sr0.67Cr0.33Fe0.67O3-delta (LSCrFe) and 0.235 Omega.cm(2) for La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.8Ru0.2O3-delta (LSCrRu) to 0.195 Omega.cm(2) for LSCrFeRu (all measured in humidified hydrogen at 800 degrees C).","Decreasing the Polarization Resistance of (La,Sr)CrO3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes by Combined Fe and Ru Substitution",10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00622
3,16041,These impedance results also strongly suggest that hydrogen dissociative adsorption was the rate-limiting step in the hydrogen oxidation reaction sequence for LSCrFe anodes at some of the pH(2) and temperatures measured.,"Decreasing the Polarization Resistance of (La,Sr)CrO3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes by Combined Fe and Ru Substitution",10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00622
4,16041,"However, the formation of Ru nanoparticles on LSCrFeRu and LSCrRu surfaces, observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, appears to promote hydrogen dissociation.","Decreasing the Polarization Resistance of (La,Sr)CrO3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes by Combined Fe and Ru Substitution",10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00622
5,16041,"Substituting even small amounts of Ru into (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-delta perovskites is thus sufficient to make hydrogen electrochemical oxidation the rate-limiting step, resulting in anodes with significantly reduced R-P,R-A.","Decreasing the Polarization Resistance of (La,Sr)CrO3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes by Combined Fe and Ru Substitution",10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00622
