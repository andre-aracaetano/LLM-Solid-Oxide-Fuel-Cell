1,19936,"Ruddlesden-Popper type compounds have the general formula, A(n+1)M(n)O(3n+1 +/- x) (typically A is a rare earth, alkaline earth, M is a transition metal), and are constructed of perovskite-type layers separated by rock salt type blocks.",Synthesis and characterisation of Sr4Fe3-xCrxO10-δ: Stabilisation of n=3 Ruddlesden-Popper phases through Cr doping,10.1016/j.jssc.2020.121372
2,19936,"While n = 1, 2 phases are typically straightforward to prepare, the synthesis of higher order (n > 2) systems is difficult.",Synthesis and characterisation of Sr4Fe3-xCrxO10-δ: Stabilisation of n=3 Ruddlesden-Popper phases through Cr doping,10.1016/j.jssc.2020.121372
3,19936,"In this paper we show that chromate (CrO42-) doping can be exploited to stabilise new n = 3 Ruddlesden-Popper systems, Sr4Fe3-xCrxO10-delta: without chromate doping, a mixture of the n = 2 phase Sr(3)Fe(2)O(7-x )and perovskite-type SrFeO3-x is obtained.",Synthesis and characterisation of Sr4Fe3-xCrxO10-δ: Stabilisation of n=3 Ruddlesden-Popper phases through Cr doping,10.1016/j.jssc.2020.121372
4,19936,"This can be explained by the stabilisation of the central perovskite building block by chromate incorporation, similar to prior work on sulfate and carbonate doping in this system.",Synthesis and characterisation of Sr4Fe3-xCrxO10-δ: Stabilisation of n=3 Ruddlesden-Popper phases through Cr doping,10.1016/j.jssc.2020.121372
5,19936,"The structure, and Fe/Cr oxidation states were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy supporting the incorporation of Cr as CrO42-.",Synthesis and characterisation of Sr4Fe3-xCrxO10-δ: Stabilisation of n=3 Ruddlesden-Popper phases through Cr doping,10.1016/j.jssc.2020.121372
6,19936,"In order to examine the potential of these new systems for use as a SOFC cathode material, conductivity studies were carried out, which showed semiconducting behaviour with slightly higher conductivities than the sulfate doped counterparts.",Synthesis and characterisation of Sr4Fe3-xCrxO10-δ: Stabilisation of n=3 Ruddlesden-Popper phases through Cr doping,10.1016/j.jssc.2020.121372
