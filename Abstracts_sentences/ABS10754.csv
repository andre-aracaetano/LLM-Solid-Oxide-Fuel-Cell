1,10754,The microstructural stability at elevated temperatures and the mechanical properties of 8 mol% yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) has been investigated.,Room and high temperature failure mechanisms in solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00080-1
2,10754,The YSZ was supplied by two manufacturers as 150 mu m thick sheet suitable for the electrolyte in a planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Room and high temperature failure mechanisms in solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00080-1
3,10754,"The two materials had the cubic structure and this crystal structure was maintained up to 1100 degrees C, which was the highest temperature investigated.",Room and high temperature failure mechanisms in solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00080-1
4,10754,"However, there were differences, albeit small in most cases, in composition, density, grain size and surface finish between the products from the two manufacturers.",Room and high temperature failure mechanisms in solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00080-1
5,10754,"Although the compositional and structural variations resulted in some differences in mechanical performance, the general trends shown by both materials were similar.",Room and high temperature failure mechanisms in solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00080-1
6,10754,"The strength, as determined by biaxial flexure, fell by 23-30% on increasing the test temperature from room temperature (RT) to the SOFC operating temperature of 950 degrees C and there was evidence for changes in crack initiation and propagation mechanisms at the higher temperature.",Room and high temperature failure mechanisms in solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00080-1
7,10754,"The loading rate dependence of the RT strength yielded a low value for the stress exponent n in the standard lifetime equation, which indicated that sub-critical crack growth (sccg) was sensitive to applied stress.",Room and high temperature failure mechanisms in solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00080-1
8,10754,Constant load tests at 950-1000 degrees C illustrated the sensitivity of sccg to stress and revealed that creep was also operative in this temperature range.,Room and high temperature failure mechanisms in solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00080-1
9,10754,It was concluded that the creep probably occurred by a grain boundary diffusion mechanism.,Room and high temperature failure mechanisms in solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes,10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00080-1
