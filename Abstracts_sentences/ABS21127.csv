5,21127,"For instance, the costs of electricity production (COE) may decrease from 82 (sic)(2008)/MWh at present to 50 (sic)(2008)/MWh in 2050, if solid oxide fuel cells become commercially available (with a constant coal price of 2.25 (sic)(2008)/GJ).",Future technological and economic performance of IGCC and FT production facilities with and without CO2 capture: Combining component based learning curve and bottom-up analysis,10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.01.002
6,21127,"This cost decrease can only be realized if installed IGCC capacity increase to over 600 GW(e) and installed CCS capacity to over 3000 GW(e), equivalent.",Future technological and economic performance of IGCC and FT production facilities with and without CO2 capture: Combining component based learning curve and bottom-up analysis,10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.01.002

10,21127,"Currently, coal-based FT-liquids are already competitive at an oil price of 77 (sic)(2008)/bbl for FT-liquids without CCS and of 83 (sic)(2008)/bbl with CCS, resulting in CO2 capture costs of only 11 (sic)(2008)/t CO2.",Future technological and economic performance of IGCC and FT production facilities with and without CO2 capture: Combining component based learning curve and bottom-up analysis,10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.01.002
11,21127,"By 2050, production costs of FT-liquids could drop to 9.3 (sic)(2008)/GJ for FT-liquids without CCS and to 10 (sic)(2008)/GJ for FT-liquids with CCS.",Future technological and economic performance of IGCC and FT production facilities with and without CO2 capture: Combining component based learning curve and bottom-up analysis,10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.01.002
