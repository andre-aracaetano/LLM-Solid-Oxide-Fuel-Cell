2,8334,"Samples of the glass-ceramic seal material were aged for 5, 50, and 100 h to obtain different degrees of crystallinity.",Creep properties of solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic seal G18,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.038
3,8334,Instrumented nanoindentation was performed on the samples with different aging times at different temperatures to investigate the strain rate sensitivity during inelastic deformation.,Creep properties of solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic seal G18,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.038
4,8334,The temperature dependent behavior is important since SOFCs operate at high temperatures (800-1000 degrees C).,Creep properties of solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic seal G18,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.038
5,8334,"Results show that the samples with higher crystallinity were more resistant to creep, and the creep compliance tended to decrease with increasing temperature, especially with further aged samples.",Creep properties of solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic seal G18,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.038
