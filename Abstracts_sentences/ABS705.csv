1,705,dense and crack-free nanoscaled Sm-doped CeO2 (SDC) thin film as a buffer layer for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells has been successfully deposited onto the polycrystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte by pulsed laser deposition (PLD).,Nanoscaled Sm-doped CeO2 buffer layers for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2013.08.017
2,705,SEM and XRD results reveal that the dense and crack-free buffer layer effectively prevents the formation of the insulating layer between the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) cathode and the YSZ electrolyte.,Nanoscaled Sm-doped CeO2 buffer layers for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2013.08.017
3,705,"The fuel cell with the as-deposited buffer layer exhibits high peak power density (e.g., 2016 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C) and low resistance.",Nanoscaled Sm-doped CeO2 buffer layers for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2013.08.017
4,705,"In contrast, at 700 degrees C the fuel cell with an optimized SDC layer prepared by spray deposition or the fuel cell without interlayer have lower peak power densities, 1132 mW cm(-2) and 60 mW cm(-2) respectively, and higher resistances.",Nanoscaled Sm-doped CeO2 buffer layers for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2013.08.017
5,705,"The significant enhancement in peak power densities with the adoption of the SDC buffer layer by PLD is likely due to the combination of three factors: the lack of solid-state reaction between BSCF and YSZ, the thinner thickness in comparison to the SDC layer by spray deposition, as well as the improvement of the charge-transfer process.",Nanoscaled Sm-doped CeO2 buffer layers for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2013.08.017
