1,15077,"To directly use a CO2-CH4 gas mixture for power and CO co-production by proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs), a layer of in situ reduced La0.6Sr0.2Cr0.85Ni0.15O3-delta (LSCrN@Ni) is fabricated on a Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) anode-supported H-SOFC (H-DASC) for on-cell CO2 dry reforming of CH4 (DRC).",Power and carbon monoxide co-production by a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell with La0.6Sr0.2Cr0.85Ni0.15O3-δ for on-cell dry reforming of CH4 by CO2,10.1039/d0ta03458d
2,15077,"For demonstrating the effectiveness of LSCrN@Ni, a cell without adding the LSCrN@Ni catalyst (H-CASC) is also studied comparatively.",Power and carbon monoxide co-production by a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell with La0.6Sr0.2Cr0.85Ni0.15O3-δ for on-cell dry reforming of CH4 by CO2,10.1039/d0ta03458d
3,15077,"Fueled with H-2, both H-CASC and H-DASC show similar stable performance with a maximum power density ranging from 0.360 to 0.816 W cm(-2) at temperatures between 550 and 700 degrees C. When CO2-CH4 is used as the fuel, the performance and stability of H-CASC decreases considerably with a maximum power density of 0.287 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C and a sharp drop in cell voltage from the initial 0.49 to 0.10 V within 20 h at 0.6 A cm(-2).",Power and carbon monoxide co-production by a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell with La0.6Sr0.2Cr0.85Ni0.15O3-δ for on-cell dry reforming of CH4 by CO2,10.1039/d0ta03458d
4,15077,"In contrast, H-DASC demonstrates a maximum power density of 0.605 W cm(-2) and a stable cell voltage above 0.65 V for 65 h.",Power and carbon monoxide co-production by a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell with La0.6Sr0.2Cr0.85Ni0.15O3-δ for on-cell dry reforming of CH4 by CO2,10.1039/d0ta03458d
5,15077,This is attributed to highly efficient on-cell DRC by LSCrN@Ni.,Power and carbon monoxide co-production by a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell with La0.6Sr0.2Cr0.85Ni0.15O3-δ for on-cell dry reforming of CH4 by CO2,10.1039/d0ta03458d
