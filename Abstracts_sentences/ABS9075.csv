2,9075,Reducing the thickness of the electrolyte and the adoption of acceptor-doped ceria as an electrolyte material are important to minimize the Ohmic resistance at low temperature.,Acceptor-doped ceria deposited on a porous Ni film as a possible micro-SOFC electrolyte,10.1007/s10832-013-9824-x
3,9075,Acceptor-doped ceria thin-films are often deposited on nano-porous metal substrates to reduce cracking of the thin electrolyte.,Acceptor-doped ceria deposited on a porous Ni film as a possible micro-SOFC electrolyte,10.1007/s10832-013-9824-x
4,9075,"However, due to the difficulty of depositing a pore-free electrolyte on a porous medium, the cells often show the low open circuit voltages (OCVs).",Acceptor-doped ceria deposited on a porous Ni film as a possible micro-SOFC electrolyte,10.1007/s10832-013-9824-x
5,9075,"In this study, we have deposited similar to 1 mu m-thick Gd-doped ceria on a nano-porous nickel film to assess whether a thin-film, metal-supported GDC can be deposited as a pore-free layer and would thus be suitable as an electrolyte of micro-SOFCs.",Acceptor-doped ceria deposited on a porous Ni film as a possible micro-SOFC electrolyte,10.1007/s10832-013-9824-x
6,9075,The Ni-supported GDC cell showed an OCV of similar to 0.92 V at 450 A degrees C under a hydrogen/air gradient.,Acceptor-doped ceria deposited on a porous Ni film as a possible micro-SOFC electrolyte,10.1007/s10832-013-9824-x
7,9075,"The high OCV verifies that the thin-electrolyte layer, deposited on porous Ni using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, is dense enough to prevent gas leakage as also observed in its microstructure.",Acceptor-doped ceria deposited on a porous Ni film as a possible micro-SOFC electrolyte,10.1007/s10832-013-9824-x
