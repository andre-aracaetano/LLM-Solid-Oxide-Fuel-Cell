1,13500,Conductivity measurements indicate that lanthanum nickel ferrite (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3) is a potential cathode current collector material in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Interaction of (La1-xSrx)1-yMnO3-Zr1-zYzO2-d cathodes and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 current collecting layers for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.04.023
2,13500,"However it is known that lanthanum nickel ferrite reacts with zirconia, commonly employed in SOFCs, to form lanthanum zirconate at typical manufacturing temperatures.",Interaction of (La1-xSrx)1-yMnO3-Zr1-zYzO2-d cathodes and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 current collecting layers for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.04.023
3,13500,"The reaction product, which has a low electrical conductivity, may therefore compromise the use of lanthanum nickel ferrite as a cathode current collector in SOFCs that employ a lanthanum strontium manganite-zirconia composite cathode, such as the Rolls-Royce Integrated Planar (IP)-SOFC.",Interaction of (La1-xSrx)1-yMnO3-Zr1-zYzO2-d cathodes and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 current collecting layers for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.04.023
4,13500,"Thus the interaction of lanthanum nickel ferrite with lanthanum strontium manganite ((La0.85Sr0.15)(0.90)MnO3) and 3 mol% yttria-stabilised zirconia has been investigated by powder X-ray diffraction, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy.",Interaction of (La1-xSrx)1-yMnO3-Zr1-zYzO2-d cathodes and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 current collecting layers for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.04.023
5,13500,"While no interfacial lanthanum, zirconate product was detected, it was found that interdiffusion of manganese and nickel occurred between the perovskite phases of the cathode and current collector layers.",Interaction of (La1-xSrx)1-yMnO3-Zr1-zYzO2-d cathodes and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 current collecting layers for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.04.023
6,13500,Results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggest that the interaction has a strong detrimental effect on cathode performance in the long-term.,Interaction of (La1-xSrx)1-yMnO3-Zr1-zYzO2-d cathodes and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 current collecting layers for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.04.023
