1,19875,"In solid oxide electrolyzers, the transport of species to and from the electrochemical reaction sites plays an important role in governing their performance and efficiency.","Influence of the competing effects between reaction, diffusion, and advection on the performance of solid oxide electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229675
2,19875,"The competing effects between diffusive, advective, and reactive transport on such metrics, however, are seldom considered in their design and analysis.","Influence of the competing effects between reaction, diffusion, and advection on the performance of solid oxide electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229675
3,19875,"Additionally, these devices possess a wide range of design specifications and operating conditions, therefore making it difficult to draw meaningful comparisons between the results presented in different studies.","Influence of the competing effects between reaction, diffusion, and advection on the performance of solid oxide electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229675
4,19875,"Here, we introduce a comprehensive approach for the design, evaluation, and comparison of solid oxide electrolyzers.","Influence of the competing effects between reaction, diffusion, and advection on the performance of solid oxide electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229675
5,19875,A scaling analysis of the transport phenomena is undertaken to develop dimensionless ratios that characterize the delivery and removal of species at the electrochemical reaction sites.,"Influence of the competing effects between reaction, diffusion, and advection on the performance of solid oxide electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229675
6,19875,"These dimensionless ratios elucidate when certain transport mechanisms are inconsequential to the performance of solid oxide electrolyzers, and reveal how concentrations gradients and overpotentials scale with parameters such as flow velocity, reaction rates, and geometry.","Influence of the competing effects between reaction, diffusion, and advection on the performance of solid oxide electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229675
7,19875,"This analysis offers designers and researchers an effective approach to identify rate-limiting mechanisms that inhibit the performance of solid oxide electrolyzers, and allows for direct comparisons to be made between cells of varying geometry, operating conditions, reactant and product species, and catalytic materials.","Influence of the competing effects between reaction, diffusion, and advection on the performance of solid oxide electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229675
