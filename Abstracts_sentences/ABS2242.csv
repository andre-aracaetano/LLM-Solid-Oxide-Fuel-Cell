1,2242,"Here, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) utilizing high performance La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x (LSCF)-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95-x (GDC) nano-composite cathodes (NCCs) on commercially-available [GDC diffusion barrier divide (Y2O3)(0.08)(ZrO2)(0.92) (YSZ) electrolyte divide Ni-YSZ anode functional layer divide Ni-YSZ gas transport layer] supports had the same 550 degrees C-650 degrees C current-voltage behavior as identical SOFCs utilizing commercial La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSC) cathodes, despite differences in open-circuit cathode polarization resistance (R-P).",Updating the Notion that Poor Cathode Performance Typically Dominates Overall Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Response,10.1149/1945-7111/abed21
2,2242,Nickel anode infiltration also produced a similar to 25% SOFC peak power density improvement in these cells.,Updating the Notion that Poor Cathode Performance Typically Dominates Overall Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Response,10.1149/1945-7111/abed21
3,2242,"These results, combined with literature data showing that either the cathode R-P, anode R-P, or ohmic losses within the cell can limit state-of-the-art SOFC performance (depending on the exact compositions, microstructures, testing conditions etc.), suggest that it is time to retire the old adage that poor cathode performance typically limits overall SOFC performance.",Updating the Notion that Poor Cathode Performance Typically Dominates Overall Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Response,10.1149/1945-7111/abed21
