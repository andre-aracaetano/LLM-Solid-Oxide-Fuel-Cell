3,19619,"There are various routes to the production of hydrogen, one being via the electrolysis of water.",A techno-economic appraisal of hydrogen generation and the case for solid oxide electrolyser cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.075
4,19619,"Water electrolysers are already operational within industry on a small-scale, accounting for 4% of world hydrogen production.",A techno-economic appraisal of hydrogen generation and the case for solid oxide electrolyser cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.075
5,19619,These electrolysers operate at low temperatures and require electrical power input that has been shown to be costly due to the limited efficiency of the electrolysis process.,A techno-economic appraisal of hydrogen generation and the case for solid oxide electrolyser cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.075
6,19619,"However, the use of high temperature solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOECs) has the potential to generate hydrogen with a higher electrical efficiency which may allow electrolysis to become cost competitive with steam methane reforming (SMR), depending on where the heat and electrical power to service the SOEC comes from.",A techno-economic appraisal of hydrogen generation and the case for solid oxide electrolyser cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.075
