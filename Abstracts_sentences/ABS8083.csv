2,8083,"However, the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of air electrodes at lower temperatures is the main reason for constraining their supply of power.",Enhanced ORR Activity of A-Site-Deficient SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ti0.1O3-? as a Bifunctional Air Electrode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00545
3,8083,"In this work, an A-site-deficient perovskite Sr0.95Co0.8Nb0.1Ti0.1O3-o (S0.95CNT) has been developed as a bifunctional air electrode for both oxygen-ion-conducting SOFCs (O-SOFCs) and proton-conducting SOFCs (H-SOFCs).",Enhanced ORR Activity of A-Site-Deficient SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ti0.1O3-? as a Bifunctional Air Electrode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00545
4,8083,"The generation of 5% A-site deficiency in SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ti0.1O3-o (S1CNT) could increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies, thus facilitating the ORR kinetics for intermediate and low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ILT-SOFCs).",Enhanced ORR Activity of A-Site-Deficient SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ti0.1O3-? as a Bifunctional Air Electrode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00545
5,8083,"The S0.95CNT air electrode delivers excellent area specific resistances (ASRs) at 500 degrees C, with values of only 0.13 and 1.08 omega cm2 for S0.95CNT on the Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) and BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-o (BZCYYb) electrolytes, respectively, and remarkable peak power densities (PPDs) at 600 degrees C for O-SOFCs and H-SOFCs of 1369 and 569 mW cm-2, respectively, both about 18% higher than that of S1CNT with no deficiency.",Enhanced ORR Activity of A-Site-Deficient SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ti0.1O3-? as a Bifunctional Air Electrode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00545
6,8083,"Overall, this work supplies a simple and effective way to improve the ORR kinetics of S1CNT as the bifunctional air electrode for ILT-SOFCs.",Enhanced ORR Activity of A-Site-Deficient SrCo0.8Nb0.1Ti0.1O3-? as a Bifunctional Air Electrode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00545
