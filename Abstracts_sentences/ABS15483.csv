1,15483,YSZ electrolyte coatings were prepared by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) at a high deposition rate of up to 1 mm/min.,Electron beam physical vapor deposition of YSZ electrolyte coatings for SOFCs,10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.05.271
2,15483,The YSZ coating consisted of a single cubic phase and no phase transformation occurred after annealing treatment at 1000 degrees C. A typical columnar structure was observed in this coating by SEM and feather-like characteristics appeared in every columnar grain.,Electron beam physical vapor deposition of YSZ electrolyte coatings for SOFCs,10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.05.271
3,15483,In columnar grain boundaries there were many micron-sized gaps and pores.,Electron beam physical vapor deposition of YSZ electrolyte coatings for SOFCs,10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.05.271
4,15483,"In TEM image, many white lines were found, originating from the alignment of nanopores existing within feather-like columnar grains.",Electron beam physical vapor deposition of YSZ electrolyte coatings for SOFCs,10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.05.271
5,15483,The element distribution along the cross-section of the coating was homogeneous except Zr with a slight gradient.,Electron beam physical vapor deposition of YSZ electrolyte coatings for SOFCs,10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.05.271
6,15483,The coating exhibited a characteristic anisotropic behavior in electrical conductivity.,Electron beam physical vapor deposition of YSZ electrolyte coatings for SOFCs,10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.05.271
7,15483,In the direction perpendicular to coating surface the electrical conductivity was remarkably higher than that in the direction parallel to coating surface.,Electron beam physical vapor deposition of YSZ electrolyte coatings for SOFCs,10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.05.271
8,15483,This mainly attributed to the typical columnar structure for EB-PVD coating and the existence of many grain boundaries along the direction parallel to coating surface.,Electron beam physical vapor deposition of YSZ electrolyte coatings for SOFCs,10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.05.271
9,15483,"For as-deposited coating, the gas permeability coefficient of 9.78 x 10 (5) cm(4) N (1) s (1) was obtained and this value was close to the critical value of YSZ electrolyte layer required for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operation.",Electron beam physical vapor deposition of YSZ electrolyte coatings for SOFCs,10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.05.271
