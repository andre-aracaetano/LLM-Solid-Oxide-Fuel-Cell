1,5905,The microwave sintering method is found to have advantages over the conventional thermal treatment method for preparing BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta powder.,Fabrication of high-performance proton-conducting electrolytes from microwave prepared ultrafine powders for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.11.051
2,5905,"Comparing with the conventional thermal treatment, the microwave sintering method allows the solid material to be self-heated, enabling the formation of pure phase BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta powder at a relatively low temperature (900 degrees C) with a short dwell time of 1 h, while the same pure phase can only be formed at 1000 degrees C in an electric furnace.",Fabrication of high-performance proton-conducting electrolytes from microwave prepared ultrafine powders for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.11.051
3,5905,"Importantly, the grain size for the microwave prepared BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta powder is much smaller than that of the conventionally thermal treated BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta powder.",Fabrication of high-performance proton-conducting electrolytes from microwave prepared ultrafine powders for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.11.051
4,5905,The small powder grain size is found to be beneficial for the densification and grain growth of the resultant electrolyte membrane during the electrolyte sintering procedure.,Fabrication of high-performance proton-conducting electrolytes from microwave prepared ultrafine powders for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.11.051
5,5905,A fuel cell fabricated using this electrolyte membrane with a conductivity of 7 x 10(-3)S cm(-1) delivers a power output of 791 mW cm(2) at 700 degrees C.,Fabrication of high-performance proton-conducting electrolytes from microwave prepared ultrafine powders for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.11.051
