1,19419,"Aiming at lowering contact resistance between SOFC components, we produced an Air-Side Electrical Connector (ASEC) which deforms easily under compressive load at high temperature.",Reduction of electrical contact resistance between components of solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.111.222
2,19419,"The ASEC was prepared by soaking a cloth of a carbon fiber with a (La0.85Sr0.15)(0.85)MnO3 (LSM) slurry and firing at 1200degreesC. The porous ASEC was then pressed at a temperature of 1500degreesC. It deformed easily, and its thickness changed to be 38%, 46%, and 58% of the pre-deformed one under a stress of 98 kPa, 49 kPa, and 20 kPa, respectively.",Reduction of electrical contact resistance between components of solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.111.222
3,19419,"Dense LSM bulks or (La0.75Ca0.30)Cr0.95O3 (LCC) bulks were bonded with the ASEC as an intermediate material at 1500degreesC. The contact resistances at 1000degreesC in air between the LSM and the ASEC, and between the LCC and the ASEC were 1.1 mOmega cm(2) and 4.2 mOmega cm(2), respectively, at the bonding condition of 98 kPa.",Reduction of electrical contact resistance between components of solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.111.222
4,19419,The difference was attributed to the formation of a new perovskite phase which has high electrical resistance at the interface between the LCC and the ASEC.,Reduction of electrical contact resistance between components of solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.111.222
5,19419,"However, the estimated I-R drop at the contact of LSM/LCC under the cell current density of 0.3 A cm(-2) was 4 mV, an efficiently low value for practical use.",Reduction of electrical contact resistance between components of solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj.111.222
