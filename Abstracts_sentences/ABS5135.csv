1,5135,Ceramic anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were prepared by aqueous impregnation of nitrate salts to produce composites with 45 wt % La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 (LSCM ) in a 65% porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) scaffold.,Engineering composite oxide SOFC anodes for efficient oxidation of methane,10.1149/1.2817809
2,5135,Scanning electron micrographs indicate that the LSCM coats the YSZ pores following calcination at 1473 K. Composites produced in this manner exhibit conductivities at 1073 K of approximately 1 S/cm in air and 0.1 S/cm in humidified H-2.,Engineering composite oxide SOFC anodes for efficient oxidation of methane,10.1149/1.2817809
3,5135,"A SOFC with a composite anode composed of 45 wt % LSCM, 0.5 wt % Pd, and 5 wt % ceria exhibited maximum power densities at 1073 K of 1.1 and 0.71 W cm(-2) in humidified (3% H2O) H-2 and methane, respectively.",Engineering composite oxide SOFC anodes for efficient oxidation of methane,10.1149/1.2817809
