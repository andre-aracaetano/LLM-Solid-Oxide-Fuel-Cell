1,18049,The tracer diffusion coefficient (D*) and the surface exchange coefficient (k*) provide vital information for materials used in high temperature electrochemical devices (e.g. solid oxide fuel cells or oxygen permeation membranes).,Diffusion and conductivity properties of cerium niobate,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.03.044
2,18049,"These values were established for the high temperature tetragonal scheelite structured CeNbO4+delta (Monoclinic fergusonite at room temperature), which is of interest due to its wide range of oxygen stoichiometries varying from stoichiometric CeNbO4 to CeNbO4.33.",Diffusion and conductivity properties of cerium niobate,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.03.044
3,18049,Measurements of D* and k* were performed by the isotopic exchange/line scan technique with SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) used to determine 180 stable isotope depth distribution.,Diffusion and conductivity properties of cerium niobate,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.03.044
