4,12335,The resistance corresponding to the reaction around the three-phase boundaries of the anode/electrolyte interface increases with decreasing temperature from 1000 to 800 degreesC in the Ni-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) anode of the TFP cell.,Electrochemical characteristics of tubular flat-plate-SOFCs fabricated by co-firing cathode substrate and electrolyte,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00346-4
5,12335,"From ac impedance measurements made at various oxygen partial pressures P-O2, we found that under high P-O2 (log P-O2 > -0.77) surface diffusion of adsorbed oxygen atoms was the dominant step, but under low P-O2 (log P-O2 < -0.77) the diffusion of oxygen gas was the rate-determining step in the cathode reaction in this TFP cell.",Electrochemical characteristics of tubular flat-plate-SOFCs fabricated by co-firing cathode substrate and electrolyte,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00346-4
