1,12024,The application of heterogeneous catalysis has an important role to play in the successful commercial development of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology.,Internal reforming of hydrocarbon fuels in tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.004
2,12024,"In this paper, we present an SOFC that combines a catalyst layer with a conventional anode, allowing internal reforming via partial oxidation (POX) of fuels such as methane, propane, butane, biomass gas, etc., without coking and yielding stable power output.",Internal reforming of hydrocarbon fuels in tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.004
3,12024,The catalyst layer is fabricated on the anode simply by catalyst support coating and reforming catalyst impregnation.,Internal reforming of hydrocarbon fuels in tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.004
4,12024,The composition and microstructure of catalyst support layer as well as the catalyst composition was easily tailored to meet the demand of in situ reforming.,Internal reforming of hydrocarbon fuels in tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.004
5,12024,"The usage of catalyst layer as an integrated part of the traditional SOFC will provide a simple low-cost power-generating system at substantially higher fuel efficiency and faster startups, and may accelerate the application of SOFCs through the direct use of hydrocarbon fuels.",Internal reforming of hydrocarbon fuels in tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.004
