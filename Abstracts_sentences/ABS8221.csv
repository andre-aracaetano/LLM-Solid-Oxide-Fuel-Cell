1,8221,The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of variable parameters on the performance of a unitized regenerative solid oxide fuel cell (URSOFC) using a two-dimensional axisymmetric simulation model.,Investigating parametric effects on performance of a high-temperature URSOFC,10.1002/er.3275
2,8221,This model was validated using the performance curves of an in-house button-type URSOFC.,Investigating parametric effects on performance of a high-temperature URSOFC,10.1002/er.3275
3,8221,"The parameters studied include the operating temperature and the porosity, tortuosity, and grain diameter of the electrodes while the URSOFC is operated in the solid oxide fuel cell mode and the solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) mode.",Investigating parametric effects on performance of a high-temperature URSOFC,10.1002/er.3275
4,8221,"The predicted results show that the temperature and the electrode porosity have a beneficial effect on the performance of the URSOFC because of an enhancement of the electrochemical reactions and the species mass transfer, respectively.",Investigating parametric effects on performance of a high-temperature URSOFC,10.1002/er.3275
5,8221,"However, when the URSOFC is operated in the SOEC mode, the cell performance decreases as the electrode porosity increases.",Investigating parametric effects on performance of a high-temperature URSOFC,10.1002/er.3275
6,8221,This indicates that the decreasing reaction active sites as a result of the higher porosity have a dominant effect on the performance in the SOEC mode.,Investigating parametric effects on performance of a high-temperature URSOFC,10.1002/er.3275
7,8221,The cell performance also decreases as the tortuosity and grain diameter of the electrodes increase.,Investigating parametric effects on performance of a high-temperature URSOFC,10.1002/er.3275
8,8221,"In addition, the effect of the electrode grain diameter on the cell performance is predicted to be insignificant for the URSOFC operated in the SOEC mode.",Investigating parametric effects on performance of a high-temperature URSOFC,10.1002/er.3275
9,8221,The results of investigations presented in this paper can assist in the optimal design and management of a URSOFC.,Investigating parametric effects on performance of a high-temperature URSOFC,10.1002/er.3275
