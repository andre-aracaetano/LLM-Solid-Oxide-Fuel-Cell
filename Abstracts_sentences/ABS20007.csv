1,20007,"Composite cathodes of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) and Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) are fabricated by impregnating the porous YSZ scaffold pre-formed on YSZ electrolyte substrate with a solution containing La, Sr, Co and Fe in desired composition.",Performance degradation of impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3+Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 composite cathodes of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.151
2,20007,The performance stability of the cathodes is evaluated in air at 750 degrees C for up to 120 h by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy under the condition of open circuit.,Performance degradation of impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3+Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 composite cathodes of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.151
3,20007,"An insignificant small amount of resistive phase SrZrO3 is formed at 800 degrees C during cathode preparation; however, its volume is not further increased at 750 degrees C for 120 h, as indicated by the XRD results.",Performance degradation of impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3+Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 composite cathodes of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.151
4,20007,"The cathode polarization resistance (R-p) increases from 0.17 to 0.30 Omega cm(2) after the 120 h test mainly due to the increase of the low frequency polarization resistance (R-p2), which characterizes the low frequency processes in the reaction of oxygen reduction.",Performance degradation of impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3+Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 composite cathodes of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.151
5,20007,The morphology change of the well connected LSCF particles to dispersive and flattened configuration accounts for the increase of the R-p2 and in turn the degradation of cathode performance.,Performance degradation of impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3+Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 composite cathodes of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.11.151
