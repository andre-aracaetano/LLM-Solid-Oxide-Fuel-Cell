1,20825,"Ce0.8Sm0 15R0.05O2-delta (R = Sm, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) specimens were successfully prepared using a solid-state reaction, and they were used in an intermediate temperate solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) electrolyte.","The microstructures and property analysis of aliovalent cations (Sm3+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) co-doped ceria-base electrolytes after an aging treatment",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.063
2,20825,This study focused on the effects of co-doping and an aging treatment for the conductivities and microstructures of CeO2-based ceramics and also analyzed the variation of the conductivity in the reducing atmosphere.,"The microstructures and property analysis of aliovalent cations (Sm3+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) co-doped ceria-base electrolytes after an aging treatment",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.063
3,20825,The study showed that the conductivities of the CeO2-based materials have a higher conductivity at 500-800 degrees C by the co-doping aliovalent cations Sm and R. The conductivity increased with the increasing oxygen vacancies that were induced from charge.,"The microstructures and property analysis of aliovalent cations (Sm3+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) co-doped ceria-base electrolytes after an aging treatment",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.063
