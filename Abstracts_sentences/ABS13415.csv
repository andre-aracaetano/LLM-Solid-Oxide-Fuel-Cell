1,13415,Several tungsten bronzes were investigated for use in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes.,SOFC anodes based on infiltration of tungsten bronzes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.059
2,13415,"Composite anodes were prepared by infiltration of the precursor salts into a porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) scaffold to produce 40-wt% composites with bronze compositions of Na0.8NbyW1-yO3-delta (y = 0, 0.3, 0.7, and 1), K0.5WO3-delta, Cs0.2WO3-delta, and Rb0.2WO3-delta.",SOFC anodes based on infiltration of tungsten bronzes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.059
3,13415,XRD data showed that the bronze structures were formed following reduction in humidified H-2 at 873 K but that the bronzes were partially reduced to metallic W above 1073 K. Composite conductivities as high as 130 S/cm were observed at 973 K for the Na0.8WO3-delta-YSZ composite but substitution of Nb significantly decreased the conductivity without increasing the temperature at which tungsten was reduced.,SOFC anodes based on infiltration of tungsten bronzes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.059
4,13415,The impedance of Na0.8WO3-delta-YSZ anodes in humidified H-2 at 973 K was greater than 1.0 Omega cm(2) but this decreased to approximately 0.3 Omega cm(2) upon the addition of 1-wt% Pd for catalytic purposes.,SOFC anodes based on infiltration of tungsten bronzes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.059
5,13415,The possible use of anodes based on tungsten bronzes is discussed.,SOFC anodes based on infiltration of tungsten bronzes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.059
