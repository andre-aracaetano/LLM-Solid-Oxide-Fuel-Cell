2,3397,The proposed methods are then used to investigate the possible thermal runaway induced by the performance mismatch between the employed stacks.,Dynamic Modeling of a Parallel-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack System,10.3390/en13020501
3,3397,A challenge in this modeling study is to achieve the same output voltage but different output current for each employed stack.,Dynamic Modeling of a Parallel-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack System,10.3390/en13020501
4,3397,"Conventional fuel-cell models cannot be used, because they employ fuel flow rates and stack currents as the input variables.",Dynamic Modeling of a Parallel-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack System,10.3390/en13020501
5,3397,These two variables are unknown in the parallel-connected stack systems.,Dynamic Modeling of a Parallel-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack System,10.3390/en13020501
6,3397,The proposed method solves the aforementioned problems by integrating the fuel supply dynamics with the conventional stack models and then arranging them in a multiple-feedback-loop configuration for conducting simulations.,Dynamic Modeling of a Parallel-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack System,10.3390/en13020501
7,3397,The simulation results indicate that the proposed methods can model the transient response of the parallel-connected stack system.,Dynamic Modeling of a Parallel-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack System,10.3390/en13020501
8,3397,"Moreover, for the dynamics of the power distribution, there exists an unstable positive feedback loop between employed stacks when the stack temperatures are low, and a stable negative feedback loop when the stack temperatures are high.",Dynamic Modeling of a Parallel-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack System,10.3390/en13020501
9,3397,A thermal runaway could be initiated when the dynamics of the stack temperature is slower than that of the current distribution.,Dynamic Modeling of a Parallel-Connected Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack System,10.3390/en13020501
