1,13917,"The crystal chemistry and oxygen conductivity of vanadium-doped apatites of nominal composition [La(8)AE(2)][Ge6-xVx]O26+x/2 (AE = Ca, Sr, Ba; 0 <= x <= 1.5) were studied to establish their potential as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolytes.",Synthesis and characterisation of vanadium doped alkaline earth lanthanum germanate oxyapatite electrolyte,10.1039/c1jm13752b
2,13917,"Single-phase products obtained for x <= 0.5 were found, using a combination of powder synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction, to be P6(3)/m apatites.",Synthesis and characterisation of vanadium doped alkaline earth lanthanum germanate oxyapatite electrolyte,10.1039/c1jm13752b
3,13917,"The ionic conductivities extracted by complex impedance spectroscopy showed that small vanadium amendments enhanced oxygen mobility at intermediate temperatures (500-700 degrees C) by more than one order of magnitude, as the incorporation of V5+ through displacement of Ge4+ is charge balanced with interstitial O2- that improves ionic conduction.",Synthesis and characterisation of vanadium doped alkaline earth lanthanum germanate oxyapatite electrolyte,10.1039/c1jm13752b
4,13917,The most promising composition was La7.88Ca2Ge5.35V0.65O26.15 that delivered sigma = 3.44 x 10(-4),Synthesis and characterisation of vanadium doped alkaline earth lanthanum germanate oxyapatite electrolyte,10.1039/c1jm13752b

7,13917,"Crystal chemistry systematics demonstrate that the Ca-apatite was superior because the relatively small framework expanded the tunnel through reduced (La/AE)O-6 metaprism twisting (phi), ensuring the P6(3)/m symmetry was adopted, which favours the passage of O2- with lower activation energy.",Synthesis and characterisation of vanadium doped alkaline earth lanthanum germanate oxyapatite electrolyte,10.1039/c1jm13752b
