1,17889,Electrolysis of steam and co-electrolysis of steam and carbon dioxide was studied in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) stacks composed of Ni/YSZ electrode supported SOECs.,Durable SOC stacks for production of hydrogen and synthesis gas by high temperature electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.130
2,17889,The results of this study show that long-term electrolysis is feasible without notable degradation in these SOEC stacks.,Durable SOC stacks for production of hydrogen and synthesis gas by high temperature electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.130
3,17889,"The degradation of the electrolysis cells was found to be influenced by the adsorption of impurities from the applied inlet gases, whereas the application of chromium containing interconnect plates and glass sealings do not seem to influence the durability when operated at 850 C. Cleaning the inlet gases to the Ni/YSZ electrode resulted in operation without long-term degradation, and may therefore be a solution for operating these Ni/YSZ based SOEC stacks without degradation.",Durable SOC stacks for production of hydrogen and synthesis gas by high temperature electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.130
