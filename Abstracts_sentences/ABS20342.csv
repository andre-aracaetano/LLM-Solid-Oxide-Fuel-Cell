1,20342,The application of doped lanthanum nickelate type perovskites as Solid Oxide Cell (SOC) materials has proven to be an area of significant study in recent years.,Lanthanum nickelates and their application in Solid Oxide Cells - The LaNi1-xFexO3 system and other ABO3-type nickelates,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115799
2,20342,"These materials, in particular LaNi1-xFexO3, have gained interest due to their apparent resilience to certain degradation effects.",Lanthanum nickelates and their application in Solid Oxide Cells - The LaNi1-xFexO3 system and other ABO3-type nickelates,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115799
3,20342,"There is, therefore, a suggestion in the academic literature that these materials may find application as oxygen electrode materials for future generations of SOC, with lower degradation rates and longer life-times.",Lanthanum nickelates and their application in Solid Oxide Cells - The LaNi1-xFexO3 system and other ABO3-type nickelates,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115799
4,20342,"However, most of the discussion surrounding these materials does not consider the relative performance of such cells with respect to the state-of-the-art.",Lanthanum nickelates and their application in Solid Oxide Cells - The LaNi1-xFexO3 system and other ABO3-type nickelates,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115799
5,20342,Several commentators have suggested that the popular La-nickelates are not feasible as replacements for current materials.,Lanthanum nickelates and their application in Solid Oxide Cells - The LaNi1-xFexO3 system and other ABO3-type nickelates,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115799
6,20342,"Clearly, a material with stable but inferior performance is unlikely to offer a realistic alternative to the current crop of cell materials.",Lanthanum nickelates and their application in Solid Oxide Cells - The LaNi1-xFexO3 system and other ABO3-type nickelates,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115799
7,20342,"However, to contradict this, there have also been numerous studies observing how cell performance may be improved via an appropriate tailoring of the electrode architecture.",Lanthanum nickelates and their application in Solid Oxide Cells - The LaNi1-xFexO3 system and other ABO3-type nickelates,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115799
8,20342,"Here, a consideration on the wide body of literature on ABO(3)-type lanthanum nickelates is provided.",Lanthanum nickelates and their application in Solid Oxide Cells - The LaNi1-xFexO3 system and other ABO3-type nickelates,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115799
9,20342,This includes an assessment of studies at the fundamental level and with reference to their application in SOC technology.,Lanthanum nickelates and their application in Solid Oxide Cells - The LaNi1-xFexO3 system and other ABO3-type nickelates,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115799
10,20342,"Primarily, this is with reference to LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 where the literature is most substantial.",Lanthanum nickelates and their application in Solid Oxide Cells - The LaNi1-xFexO3 system and other ABO3-type nickelates,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115799
