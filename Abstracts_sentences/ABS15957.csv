4,15957,It is found that reducing the CO2 ratio in co-electrolysis from 60% to 30% increases CH3OH production by 64% and doubles electricity efficiency due to the increased H-2 supply to methanol synthesis section.,Dynamic-cycle simulation of power-to-methanol-to-power system with reversible solid oxide cells: Multi-physics and techno-economic analysis,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117573
5,15957,"While in the fuel cell, reducing methanol supply rate from 500 to 200 SCCM increases power generation capacity by 110% with longer generating duration, and the electricity efficiency is improved from 30% to 61%.",Dynamic-cycle simulation of power-to-methanol-to-power system with reversible solid oxide cells: Multi-physics and techno-economic analysis,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117573
6,15957,"Besides, the optimized PMPS presents a round-trip efficiency of 78%, along with high conversion rates of carbon (97%) and hydrogen (84%), significantly exceeding that of the Power-to-Hydrogen-to-Power System (PHPS, the round-trip efficiency of 45%) under similar cell's inputs.",Dynamic-cycle simulation of power-to-methanol-to-power system with reversible solid oxide cells: Multi-physics and techno-economic analysis,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117573
7,15957,"Furthermore, our techno-economic analysis shows that the levelized fuel cost (0.49$ t(-1) CH3OH) and levelized generating capacity cost (0.22 $/kWh) of PMPS are about 10% (4.8$ t(-1) H-2) and 74% of the PHPS, mainly due to the 16% lower capital expenditure of PMPS.",Dynamic-cycle simulation of power-to-methanol-to-power system with reversible solid oxide cells: Multi-physics and techno-economic analysis,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117573
