1,5621,"We have calculated the electrical conductivity of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode contact material La1-xSrxCoO3-delta at 900 K. Experimental trends in conductivity against x, and against delta for fixed x, are correctly reproduced for x less than or similar to 0.8.",Defect Chemistry and Electrical Conductivity of Sm-Doped La1-xSrxCoO3-δ for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b02608
2,5621,"Furthermore, we have studied the chemistry of neutral and charged intrinsic and extrinsic defects (dopants) in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 and have calculated the conductivity of the doped systems.",Defect Chemistry and Electrical Conductivity of Sm-Doped La1-xSrxCoO3-δ for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b02608
3,5621,"In particular, we find that doping with Sm on the La site should enhance the conductivity, a prediction that is subsequently confirmed by electrical conductivity measurements.",Defect Chemistry and Electrical Conductivity of Sm-Doped La1-xSrxCoO3-δ for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b02608
