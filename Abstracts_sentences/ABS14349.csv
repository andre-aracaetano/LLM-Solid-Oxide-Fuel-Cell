6,14349,In order to determine which reactions were responsible for much of the observed kinetics a sensitivity analysis based on the rate of production (ROP) principle was performed.,Investigations on gas-phase reactions of ethane under SOFC conditions: An experimental and modeling study,10.1016/j.fuel.2010.10.001
7,14349,"The results from the sensitivity analysis show that there are only six elementary reactions whose rates significantly affect the consumption or formation of the four species of interest, i.e. H(2), CH(4), C(2)H(4) and C(2)H(6).",Investigations on gas-phase reactions of ethane under SOFC conditions: An experimental and modeling study,10.1016/j.fuel.2010.10.001
