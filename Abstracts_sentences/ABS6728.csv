1,6728,"In SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) systems operating at high temperatures, temperature fluctuation induces a thermal stress in the electrodes and electrolyte ceramics; therefore, the cell temperature distribution is recommended to be kept as constant as possible.",Thermal stress management of a solid oxide fuel cell using neural network predictive control,10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.031
2,6728,"In the present work, a mathematical model based on first principles is presented to avert such temperature fluctuations.",Thermal stress management of a solid oxide fuel cell using neural network predictive control,10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.031
3,6728,"The fuel cell running on ammonia is divided into five subsystems and factors such as mass/energy/momentum transfer, diffusion through porous media, electrochemical reactions, and polarization losses inside the subsystems are presented.",Thermal stress management of a solid oxide fuel cell using neural network predictive control,10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.031
4,6728,Dynamic cell-tube temperature responses of the cell to step changes in conditions of the feed streams is investigated.,Thermal stress management of a solid oxide fuel cell using neural network predictive control,10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.031
5,6728,The results of simulation indicate that the transient response of the SOFC is mainly influenced by the temperature dynamics.,Thermal stress management of a solid oxide fuel cell using neural network predictive control,10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.031
6,6728,It is also shown that the inlet stream temperatures are associated with the highest long term start-up time (467 s) among other parameters in terms of step changes.,Thermal stress management of a solid oxide fuel cell using neural network predictive control,10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.031
7,6728,In contrast the step change in fuel velocity has the lowest influence on the start-up time (about 190 s from initial steady state to the new steady state) among other parameters.,Thermal stress management of a solid oxide fuel cell using neural network predictive control,10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.031
8,6728,A NNPC (neural network predictive controller) is then implemented for thermal stress management by controlling the cell tube temperature to avoid performance degradation by manipulating the temperature of the inlet air stream.,Thermal stress management of a solid oxide fuel cell using neural network predictive control,10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.031
9,6728,The regulatory performance of the NNPC is compared with a PI (proportional-integral) controller.,Thermal stress management of a solid oxide fuel cell using neural network predictive control,10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.031
10,6728,The performance of the control system confirms that NNPC is a non-linear-model-based strategy which can assure less oscillating control responses with shorter settling times in comparison to the PI controller.,Thermal stress management of a solid oxide fuel cell using neural network predictive control,10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.031
