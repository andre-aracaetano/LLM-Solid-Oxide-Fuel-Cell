1,6511,Toho Gas R&D efforts and achievements regarding solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) from rare earth doped zirconia to 1 kW SOFC system are described in this article.,From rare earth doped zirconia to 1 kW solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.177
2,6511,"In this research, the use of Sc-2-O-3-ZrO2 (scandia stabilized zirconia, ScSZ), which has the highest oxide ion conductivity among the zirconia systems, was investigated as an electrolyte for SOFCs.",From rare earth doped zirconia to 1 kW solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.177
3,6511,"To improve the performance and mechanical reliability of SOFC cells and stacks, tetragonal phase ScSZ ceramic sheets were developed as electrolytes for SOFCs.",From rare earth doped zirconia to 1 kW solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.177
4,6511,"They have flexibility, high-strength and twice the conductivity of a Y2O3-ZrO2 (Yttria stabilized zirconia, YSZ) system.",From rare earth doped zirconia to 1 kW solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.177
5,6511,"Because of this electrolyte, the SOFC operating temperature was reduced to 1073 K. Also, to validate the performance of this cell, the first Japanese-made 1 kW SOFC system was fabricated, and its carefully designed internal manifold type 68-cell stack produced an output of over 1 kW (DC) at 1073 K under thermal self-sustaining conditions.",From rare earth doped zirconia to 1 kW solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.177
