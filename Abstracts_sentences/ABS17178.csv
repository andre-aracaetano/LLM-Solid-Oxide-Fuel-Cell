1,17178,Inhibition of cubic-rhombohedral phase transformation and low-temperature sintering at 1000degreesC were achieved for 10-Mol%-Sc2O3-doped cubic-ZrO2 by the presence of 1 mol% Bi2O3.,Suppression of rhombohedral-phase appearance and low-temperature sintering of scandia-doped cubic-zirconia,
2,17178,The powders of 1-mol%-Bi2O3-10-mol%-Sc2O3-doped ZrO2 were prepared using a hydrolysis and homogeneous precipitation technique.,Suppression of rhombohedral-phase appearance and low-temperature sintering of scandia-doped cubic-zirconia,
3,17178,"No trace of rhombohedral-ZrO2 phase could be detected, even after sintering at 1000degrees-1400degreesC. The average grain size of the ZrO2 sintered at 1200degreesC was >2 mum because of grain growth in the presence of Bi3+.",Suppression of rhombohedral-phase appearance and low-temperature sintering of scandia-doped cubic-zirconia,
4,17178,"Cubic, stabilized Bi-Sc-doped ZrO2 sintered at 1200degreesC had sufficient conductivity at 1000degreesC (0.33 S/cm) to be used as an electrolyte for a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and at 800degreesC (0.12 S/cm) for an intermediate-temperature SOFC.",Suppression of rhombohedral-phase appearance and low-temperature sintering of scandia-doped cubic-zirconia,
