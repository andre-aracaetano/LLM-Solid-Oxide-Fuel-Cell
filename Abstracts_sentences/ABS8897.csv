1,8897,This paper describes the potential of solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method for preparing Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2 (CMF) as the anode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Solution combustion synthesis of Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2 for anode of SOFC using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.007
2,8897,"The stability, crystallinity, morphology, and surface area of the products were depended on the fuel ratio used in SCS as investigated by TGA, XRD, SEM, and BET, which correspondingly influenced their electrochemical properties.",Solution combustion synthesis of Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2 for anode of SOFC using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.007
3,8897,"The SCS-derived products were directly used for preparing anodes by sintering the screen-printed powders on the electrolyte membrane, and were evaluated from power generation performance, which were compared with the conventional solid-state-reaction (SSR) sample.",Solution combustion synthesis of Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2 for anode of SOFC using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.007
4,8897,"Significantly, under configuration of the cell of CMF/La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.15Co0.05O3/Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 using humidified hydrogen gas as a fuel and O-2 as an oxidizing agent, the maximum power densities obtained were 1.23 W/cm(2) at 1000 degrees C for the SCS product (CMF1) obtained at phi = 0.5.",Solution combustion synthesis of Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2 for anode of SOFC using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.007
5,8897,This value was higher than 1.09 W/cm(2) for the SSR-derived sample under the same evaluation conditions.,Solution combustion synthesis of Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2 for anode of SOFC using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.007
6,8897,"The results appealed benefits of SCS method for preparing CMF as the anode material with high power generation performance for SOFC, due to its large surface area and nanosized grains, in which fuel ratio was a key parameter for its synthesis.",Solution combustion synthesis of Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2 for anode of SOFC using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.007
