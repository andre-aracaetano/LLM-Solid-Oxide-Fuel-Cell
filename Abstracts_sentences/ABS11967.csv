6,11967,The button cells were tested from 700 degrees C to 800 degrees C on various fuels including syngas and n-butane/H2O mixtures at steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratios of 1.0 and 1.5.,Impact of Cofiring Ceria in Ni/YSZ SOFC Anodes for Operation With Syngas and n-Butane,10.1115/1.4006823
7,11967,Electrochemical testing revealed that CeO2 addition provided stable performance at 800 degrees C without compromising power densities-up to 0.6 W/cm(2) on syngas and 0.35 W/cm(2) on direct butane feeds.,Impact of Cofiring Ceria in Ni/YSZ SOFC Anodes for Operation With Syngas and n-Butane,10.1115/1.4006823

9,11967,Testing with syngas at different H-2 and CO partial pressures indicated that high power densities can be maintained along an anode channel for up to 50% fuel conversion.,Impact of Cofiring Ceria in Ni/YSZ SOFC Anodes for Operation With Syngas and n-Butane,10.1115/1.4006823
10,11967,The results indicate that cofiring CeO2 in Ni/YSZ anode support layers presents a viable option for stable SOFC operation on either prereformed or internally reformed light-hydrocarbon fuel feeds.,Impact of Cofiring Ceria in Ni/YSZ SOFC Anodes for Operation With Syngas and n-Butane,10.1115/1.4006823
