1,9311,Near-infrared (NIR) imaging is used in conjunction with near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) to study chemical and electrochemical redox processes on a ceria-based solid oxide electrochemical cell (SOC).,Operando Tracking of Electrochemical Activity in Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells by using Near-Infrared Imaging,10.1002/celc.201500150
2,9311,Electrochemical water electrolysis tests conducted in ambient operating conditions on standard SOCs show that NIR imaging can be used to spatially resolve the electrochemically active regions associated with an accumulation of Ce3+.,Operando Tracking of Electrochemical Activity in Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells by using Near-Infrared Imaging,10.1002/celc.201500150
3,9311,These effective emissivity changes are attributed to changes in optical properties (e.g. the index of refraction) of ceria that occur upon reduction.,Operando Tracking of Electrochemical Activity in Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells by using Near-Infrared Imaging,10.1002/celc.201500150
4,9311,"These data correlate strongly with APXPS measurements, simultaneously supporting the model (near ambient conditions and single-sided cell setup required by APXPS experiments) and the ability to elucidate mechanistic details on an operating SOC using an inexpensive, convenient NIR imaging technique.",Operando Tracking of Electrochemical Activity in Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells by using Near-Infrared Imaging,10.1002/celc.201500150
