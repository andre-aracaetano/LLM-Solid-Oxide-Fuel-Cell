2,17598,Bader charge and frequency analyses were carried out to identify the oxidation state of adsorbed oxygen species.,Computational Investigation of O2 Reduction and Diffusion on 25% Sr-Doped LaMnO3 Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/la200193a
3,17598,DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) results show that the fast O-2 adsorption/reduction process via superoxide and peroxide intermediates is energetically favorable on the Mn site rather than on the Sr site.,Computational Investigation of O2 Reduction and Diffusion on 25% Sr-Doped LaMnO3 Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/la200193a
4,17598,"Furthermore, the higher adsorption energies on the Mn site of the (110) surface compared to those on the (100) surface imply that the former is more efficient for O-2 reduction.",Computational Investigation of O2 Reduction and Diffusion on 25% Sr-Doped LaMnO3 Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/la200193a
5,17598,"Significantly, we predict that oxygen vacancies enhance O-2 reduction kinetics and that the O-ion migration through the bulk is dominant over that on cathode.",Computational Investigation of O2 Reduction and Diffusion on 25% Sr-Doped LaMnO3 Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/la200193a
