1,1296,This article describes the initial analysis underlying the design of a core module consisting of a 1 to 3 kW solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack and a radiant air preheater (RAP) module.,A radiation-based approach to planar solid oxide fuel cell modules,10.1361/105994906X117323
2,1296,The design and testing of three SOFC stack/RAP modules was part of a California Energy Commission-sponsored project with the Gas Technology Institute.,A radiation-based approach to planar solid oxide fuel cell modules,10.1361/105994906X117323
3,1296,The objective of the design was to improve the thermal management of an SOFC system through radiant heat transfer from the stack walls to adjacent air preheater panels.,A radiation-based approach to planar solid oxide fuel cell modules,10.1361/105994906X117323
4,1296,The testing of this and subsequent modules has suggested that use of the radiation-based approach significantly improved the in management of stack-generated heat.,A radiation-based approach to planar solid oxide fuel cell modules,10.1361/105994906X117323
