2,15326,"Fundamental issues are first considered on metal dense electrode (Pt/Au) and oxide electrolyte (YSZ/GDC) systems; the so-called three phase boundary (TPB) mechanism is dominant for YSZ systems, whereas for the GDC systems, a new proton/water mechanism is dominant; protons play an important role in a such way that the cathodic reaction of protons to form water vapors takes place at TPBs, while evaporated water vapors are transported on the GDC surface; oxide ions are transported to the anode and protons are circulated to the TPBs of the cathode; another effect of water vapors is to enhance oxygen isotope exchange reactions over a whole area of surface and a resulting flow of O-18 inside GDC masks the charge transfer process in the SIMS analyses.",Thermodynamic and SIMS analyses on the role of proton/water in oxygen reduction process and related degradations in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.05.016
