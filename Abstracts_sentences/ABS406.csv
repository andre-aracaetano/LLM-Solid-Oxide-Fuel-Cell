2,406,This issue is more prominent in high temperature systems such as molten carbonate and solid oxide fuel cell which operate above 600 degrees C.,CORROSION BEHAVIOUR OF HIGH TEMPERATURE FUEL CELLS: ISSUES FOR MATERIALS SELECTION,
3,406,The cathode side and anode side corrosion issues have been addressed by many groups but components like current collectors have not.,CORROSION BEHAVIOUR OF HIGH TEMPERATURE FUEL CELLS: ISSUES FOR MATERIALS SELECTION,
4,406,In this framework materials selection is a key issue.,CORROSION BEHAVIOUR OF HIGH TEMPERATURE FUEL CELLS: ISSUES FOR MATERIALS SELECTION,
5,406,Comparing different experiments it can be concluded that the choice of stainless steel (SS) is good choice.,CORROSION BEHAVIOUR OF HIGH TEMPERATURE FUEL CELLS: ISSUES FOR MATERIALS SELECTION,
6,406,"In particular, SS316L is good choice but long term test show high degradation of the components.",CORROSION BEHAVIOUR OF HIGH TEMPERATURE FUEL CELLS: ISSUES FOR MATERIALS SELECTION,
7,406,This degradation is mainly due to migration (diffusion) of elements in oxide layer and in base material.,CORROSION BEHAVIOUR OF HIGH TEMPERATURE FUEL CELLS: ISSUES FOR MATERIALS SELECTION,
