1,21073,"This paper reports for the first time the attempted synthesis of SrO- and MgO-doped LaGaO3 (La1-xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-0.5(x+y), LSGM) perovskite by an aqueous 'regenerative' solution route.",Innovative processing of dense LSGM electrolytes for IT-SOFC's,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.107
2,21073,This novel technique enabled recycling of the undesired product and subsequently yielded product with much better phase purity and density than that obtained from the solid-state route.,Innovative processing of dense LSGM electrolytes for IT-SOFC's,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.107
3,21073,La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.85Mg0.15O2.825 (LSGM-2015) and LaGaO3 were prepared using both the regenerative sol-gel (RSG) and conventional solid-state route at 1400 degrees C. Series of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 (LSGM-2017) pellets were also prepared by the RSG method at different sintering temperature (1200-1500 degrees C) and time.,Innovative processing of dense LSGM electrolytes for IT-SOFC's,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.107
4,21073,The effect of conventional and microwave sintering of samples obtained from both solid-state and regenerative route was also investigated.,Innovative processing of dense LSGM electrolytes for IT-SOFC's,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.107
5,21073,Microwave heating was carried out using SiC as a microwave susceptor.,Innovative processing of dense LSGM electrolytes for IT-SOFC's,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.107
6,21073,"The LSGM pellets prepared by using different synthetic methods were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and pellet density was determined by pycnometry.",Innovative processing of dense LSGM electrolytes for IT-SOFC's,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.107
7,21073,"The LSGM-2015 prepared by RSG route exhibited conductivity sigma(t) = 0.066 and 0.029 S cm(-1) at 800 and 700 degrees C, respectively, and activation energy ;of the bulk, grain-boundary, and total are E-b = 0.97 eV, Eg(b) =",Innovative processing of dense LSGM electrolytes for IT-SOFC's,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.107

9,21073,The sintering temperature severely affected the grain size (< 0.1-10 mu m) and also the grain-boundary resistance (3-175 k Omega).,Innovative processing of dense LSGM electrolytes for IT-SOFC's,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.107
10,21073,The unique aspect of this RSG technique is that the final product can be recycled which makes the process cost effective and time saving compared to the solid-state ceramic technique and this technique would allow optimization of processing parameters in a cost effective and time saving manner for obtaining well sintered LSGM as an electrolyte for IT-SOFC's.,Innovative processing of dense LSGM electrolytes for IT-SOFC's,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.107
