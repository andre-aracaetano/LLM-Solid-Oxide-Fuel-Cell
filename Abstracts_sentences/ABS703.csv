1,703,"Coal samples with 3 wt.% ash were chosen as a prospective solid fuel for direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells operating within a temperature range of 600-850 degrees C. Based upon X-ray and infrared spectroscopy analysis, it was found that the main inorganic impurities in this coal were dolomites.",On the utilization of coal samples in direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.09.034
2,703,"The chemical analysis of ash content in the coal, before and after 3 M HNO3 treatment, indicated that the applied purification procedure allowed a considerable decrease in the ash down to 0.4 wt.% in the coal samples.",On the utilization of coal samples in direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.09.034
3,703,The physicochemical properties of raw and modified coal samples were investigated by analytical and physicochemical methods in order to evaluate its potential use as a solid fuel for a direct carbon fuel cell with a solid oxide electrolyte (DC-SOFC).,On the utilization of coal samples in direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.09.034
4,703,The tests indicated that DC-SOFCs fed with this type of processed fossil coal were characterized by stable operation with reasonable current and power densities.,On the utilization of coal samples in direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.09.034
