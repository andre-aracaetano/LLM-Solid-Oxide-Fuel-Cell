1,6698,"Single-chamber fuel cells (SCFC) are ones in which the fuel and oxidizer are premixed, and selective electrode catalysts are used to generate the oxygen partial pressure gradient that in a conventional dual-chamber design is produced by physical separation of the fuel and oxidizer streams.",Recent advances in single-chamber fuel-cells: Experiment and modeling,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.05.008
2,6698,"SCFCs have been shown capable of generating power densities above 700 mW/cm(2) with appropriate catalysts, making them potentially useful in many applications where the simplicity of a single gas chamber and absence of seals offsets the expected lower efficiency of SCFCs compared to dual-chamber SOFCs.",Recent advances in single-chamber fuel-cells: Experiment and modeling,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.05.008
3,6698,"SCFC performance is found to depend sensitively on cell microstructure, geometry, and flow conditions, making experimental optimization tedious.",Recent advances in single-chamber fuel-cells: Experiment and modeling,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.05.008
4,6698,"In this paper, we describe recent work focused on developing a quantitative understanding the physical processes responsible for SCFC performance, and the development of an experimentally-validated, physically-based numerical model to allow more rational design and optimization of SCFCs.",Recent advances in single-chamber fuel-cells: Experiment and modeling,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.05.008
5,6698,"The use of the model to explore the effects of fuel/oxidizer ratio, anode thickness, and flow configuration is discussed.",Recent advances in single-chamber fuel-cells: Experiment and modeling,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.05.008
