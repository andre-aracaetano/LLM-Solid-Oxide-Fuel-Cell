1,5129,"Metallic Co with CeO2, La2O3, and Y2O3 reactive element oxides is prepared on Fe-17Cr alloys by electroplating for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications, followed by cyclic oxidation in air at 750 ?",Metallic Co with Reactive Element Oxide Composite Coatings for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnect Applications,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02279
2,5129,"for 500 h. All three thermally converted Co3O4 spinel with reactive element oxide composite coatings significantly enhance the substrate alloy high-temperature oxidation resistance, and no further migration of chromium is detected in the coating region.",Metallic Co with Reactive Element Oxide Composite Coatings for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnect Applications,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02279
3,5129,"Among the three coatings, the Co/CeO2 coating has the best performance after oxidation for 500 h as a result of the slowest oxidation constant rate [8.787 x 10(-16) (100-500 h)] and the lowest area specific resistance (12 mO cm(2) at 750 ?).",Metallic Co with Reactive Element Oxide Composite Coatings for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnect Applications,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02279
