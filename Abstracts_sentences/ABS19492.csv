1,19492,A completely sealed high temperature carbon-air battery is proposed and prepared using a tubular oxygen-ion-conducting yttrium stabilized zirconia electrolyte with anode inside and cathode outside.,A completely sealed high temperature carbon-air battery with carbon dioxide absorber,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230448
2,19492,"CaO and carbon powders, with a molar ratio of 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, are respectively loaded in the anode chamber, in two ways: One is mixing CaO and C together (mixing mode) and the other is loading them one by one (separating mode).",A completely sealed high temperature carbon-air battery with carbon dioxide absorber,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230448
3,19492,The electrochemical output performance and discharging time of the batteries increase with decreasing CaO/C ratio.,A completely sealed high temperature carbon-air battery with carbon dioxide absorber,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230448
4,19492,Thermodynamic calculation results show that the pressure of the anode chamber of a battery increases with more carbon oxidized.,A completely sealed high temperature carbon-air battery with carbon dioxide absorber,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230448
5,19492,"CO2 produced through the electrochemical oxidation of carbon can be absorbed by CaO to produce CaCO3, resulting in relieve of pressure.",A completely sealed high temperature carbon-air battery with carbon dioxide absorber,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230448
6,19492,"However, insufficient CO2 for maintaining the operation of battery is also caused by CaO.",A completely sealed high temperature carbon-air battery with carbon dioxide absorber,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230448
7,19492,"This evidence may be mitigated by loading C and CaO separately to avoid im-mediate reaction between CO2 and CaO. A carbon-air battery with 0.25 g carbon powder separately loaded with CaO in a CaO/C ratio of 0.5 discharges at 200 mA for 6.9 h, giving a practical specific energy density of 1300 Wh kg(-1), considering the mass of both C and CaO.",A completely sealed high temperature carbon-air battery with carbon dioxide absorber,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230448
