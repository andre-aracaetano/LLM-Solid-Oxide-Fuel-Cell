1,7601,A low-cost manufacturing procedure has been developed for the fabrication of planar anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell including only two thermal treatments.,"Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Aqueous Reverse Sequential Tape-Casting of the Anode, Electrolyte, and Barrier Layer",10.1002/ente.202300020
2,7601,This method is also environmental friendly because slurries are water based and use nontoxic additives.,"Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Aqueous Reverse Sequential Tape-Casting of the Anode, Electrolyte, and Barrier Layer",10.1002/ente.202300020
3,7601,"Slurries are formulated by optimizing the powder quantity, by minimizing the organic compounds while controlling their stabilities and their rheological properties.","Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Aqueous Reverse Sequential Tape-Casting of the Anode, Electrolyte, and Barrier Layer",10.1002/ente.202300020
4,7601,Flexible multilayer green tapes have been produced by using the reverse sequential tape-casting method.,"Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Aqueous Reverse Sequential Tape-Casting of the Anode, Electrolyte, and Barrier Layer",10.1002/ente.202300020
5,7601,"After a cosintering thermal treatment under loads, planar anodic half-cells have been produced allowing the deposition of a La2NiO4+& delta; cathode by screen printing.","Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Aqueous Reverse Sequential Tape-Casting of the Anode, Electrolyte, and Barrier Layer",10.1002/ente.202300020
6,7601,"After the final consolidation thermal treatment, the cell presents a 30 & mu;m-thick porous cathode, a 530 & mu;m-thick NiO-YSZ porous anode, and a 80 & mu;m-thick dense electrolyte with a gradient of composition: 10GDC on the cathode side to prevent the apparition of the La2Zr2O7 insulating phase and 8YSZ on the anode side to avoid the reduction of 10GDC with the fuel gas.","Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Aqueous Reverse Sequential Tape-Casting of the Anode, Electrolyte, and Barrier Layer",10.1002/ente.202300020
7,7601,Power densities present promising performances (319 mW cm(-)(2) at 830 & DEG;C) given that electrolyte thickness and electrochemical system measurement may be improved.,"Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Aqueous Reverse Sequential Tape-Casting of the Anode, Electrolyte, and Barrier Layer",10.1002/ente.202300020
