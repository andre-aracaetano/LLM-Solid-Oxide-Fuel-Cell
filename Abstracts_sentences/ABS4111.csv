1,4111,"In order to directly use methane without a reforming process, NiO-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (NiO-SDC) nanocomposite anode are successfully synthesized via a one-pot, surfactant-assisted co-assembly approach for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells.",A robust NiO-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.06.042
2,4111,Both NiO with cubic phase and SDC with fluorite phase are obtained at 550 degrees C. Both NiO nanoparticles and SDC nanoparticles are highly monodispersed in size with nearly spherical shapes.,A robust NiO-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.06.042
3,4111,"Based on the as-synthesized NiO-SDC, two kinds of single cells with different micro/macro-porous structure are successfully fabricated.",A robust NiO-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.06.042
4,4111,"As a result, the cell performance was improved by 40%-45% with the new double-pore NiO-SDC anode relative to the cell performance with the conventional NiO-SDC anode due to a wider triple-phase-boundary (TPB) area.",A robust NiO-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.06.042
5,4111,"In addition, no significant degradation of the cell performance was observed after 60 h, which means an increasing of long term stability.",A robust NiO-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.06.042
6,4111,"Therefore, the as-synthesized NiO-SDC nanocomposite is a promising anode for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells.",A robust NiO-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 anode for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.materresbull.2015.06.042
