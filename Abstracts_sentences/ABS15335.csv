1,15335,Nano-structured and nano-porous mixed ionic and electronic conducting Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.5Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) cathodes with an average grain size -500 nm and porosity <= 30% were processed from sol-gel method using metal organic precursors and calcined at 950 degrees C for 5 h followed bysintering at 1000 degrees C for 3 h. Crystallization of the powder was analyzed by X-ray diffraction and found to be dependent on calcination temperature.,Development of Nano-Structured and Nano-Porous BSCF Cathode for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Application,10.1080/0371750X.2018.1452633
2,15335,The calcined powder was compacted into circular discs and sintered between 1000 degrees and 1100 degrees C to achieve the desired porosity.,Development of Nano-Structured and Nano-Porous BSCF Cathode for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Application,10.1080/0371750X.2018.1452633

4,15335,BSCF powder was made into paste and screen printed on Ce0.5Gd0.2O2-delta (GDC) electrolyte to form a symmetric cell.,Development of Nano-Structured and Nano-Porous BSCF Cathode for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Application,10.1080/0371750X.2018.1452633
5,15335,Thickness of the BSCF cathode film is around 4 mu m. Area specific polarization resistance was measured in a broad range of temperature (300 degrees-700 degrees C) at the frequency range from 10 MHz to 0.1 Hz.,Development of Nano-Structured and Nano-Porous BSCF Cathode for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Application,10.1080/0371750X.2018.1452633
6,15335,Impedance measurements show that area-specific resistance for the symmetric cell with BSCF cathode is 1.74 Omega-cm(2) at 600 degrees,Development of Nano-Structured and Nano-Porous BSCF Cathode for Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Application,10.1080/0371750X.2018.1452633
