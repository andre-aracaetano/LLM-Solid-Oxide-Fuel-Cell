1,5355,A cobalt-free cubic perovskite oxide Sm0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-delta (SSFCu) was investigated as a novel cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Investigation of cobalt-free cathode material Sm0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.04.021
2,5355,The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of SSFCu was close to that of Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9(SDC) electrolyte and the electrical conductivity of SSFCu sample reached 72-82 S cm(-1) in the commonly operated temperatures of IT-SOFCs (400-600 degrees C).,Investigation of cobalt-free cathode material Sm0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.04.021
3,5355,Symmetrical electrochemical cell with the configuration of SSFCu/SDC/SSFCu was applied for the impedance study and area specific resistance (ASR) of SSFCu cathode material was as low as 0.085 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Laboratory-sized tri-layer cells of NiO-SDC/SDC/SSFCu were operated from 450 to 700 degrees C with humidified hydrogen (similar to 3% H2O) as fuel and the static air as oxidant.,Investigation of cobalt-free cathode material Sm0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.04.021
