1,11814,One of the key problems of SOFCs is their slow start-up and cycling performance which is due to the thermal shock problems of zirconia electrolyte and its associated electrode and interconnect materials.,Cycling of three solid oxide fuel cell types,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.029
2,11814,Typical start-up times range from 2 to 6 h. Faster cycles can cause degradation in performance and in material integrity.,Cycling of three solid oxide fuel cell types,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.029
3,11814,"The purpose of this paper is to study the transient performance of SOFCs under various (e.g. thermal and/or current load) cycling conditions, typifying start-up and shut-down as well as variable working conditions of the systems, in order to understand the degradation mechanisms.",Cycling of three solid oxide fuel cell types,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.029
4,11814,Three types of SOFC have been compared; the planar stack with metal interconnects represented by the Forschungszentrum Julich (FZJ) configuration; the Rolls Royce Fuel Cell Systems Ltd. (RRFCS) integrated planar tube; and the Adelan pure tube.,Cycling of three solid oxide fuel cell types,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.029
5,11814,The objective was to cycle in temperature from ambient to the operating condition several times to check if degradation was occurring.,Cycling of three solid oxide fuel cell types,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.029
6,11814,"To obtain thermally shock resistant systems, cell dimensions had to be reduced to the millimeter scale.",Cycling of three solid oxide fuel cell types,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.029
