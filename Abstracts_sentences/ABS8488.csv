1,8488,A new model for predicting the thermal and electrical performance of solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cogeneration devices for residential buildings has been developed and demonstrated.,A model for simulating the thermal and electrical production of small-scale solid-oxide fuel cell cogeneration systems within building simulation programs,10.1080/10789669.2006.10391199
2,8488,This is a system-level model that considers the thermodynamic performance of all components that consume energy and produce the thermal and electrical output of the SOFC-cogeneration device.,A model for simulating the thermal and electrical production of small-scale solid-oxide fuel cell cogeneration systems within building simulation programs,10.1080/10789669.2006.10391199
3,8488,The model relies heavily upon empirical information that can be acquired from the testing of coherent systems or components and is designed for operation at a time resolution that is in the order of minutes.,A model for simulating the thermal and electrical production of small-scale solid-oxide fuel cell cogeneration systems within building simulation programs,10.1080/10789669.2006.10391199
4,8488,"Hence, it is appropriate for use in whole-building simulation programs, where it can be applied to assess the energy and greenhouse gas emission benefits of this nascent technology.",A model for simulating the thermal and electrical production of small-scale solid-oxide fuel cell cogeneration systems within building simulation programs,10.1080/10789669.2006.10391199
