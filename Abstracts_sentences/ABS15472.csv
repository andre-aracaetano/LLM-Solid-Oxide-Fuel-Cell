1,15472,"Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) cathodes operating in ambient atmospheric conditions inevitably encounter CO2 contamination, leading to sustained performance deterioration.","Mechanistic Study on the Corrosion of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Cathodes Induced by CO2",10.3390/molecules28227490
2,15472,"In this investigation, we examined the impact of CO2 on three variants of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-delta cathodes and employed the distribution of relaxation times method to distinguish distinct electrochemical processes based on impedance spectra analysis.","Mechanistic Study on the Corrosion of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Cathodes Induced by CO2",10.3390/molecules28227490
3,15472,"We meticulously analyzed and discussed the corrosion resistance of these (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-delta cathodes under high CO2 concentrations, relying on the experimental data.","Mechanistic Study on the Corrosion of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Cathodes Induced by CO2",10.3390/molecules28227490
4,15472,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results revealed that La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF-6428), La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF-4628), and La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-delta (LSCFN-46271) cathodes exhibited persistent degradation when exposed to CO2 at temperatures of 650 degrees C or 800 degrees C during the durability-testing period.","Mechanistic Study on the Corrosion of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Cathodes Induced by CO2",10.3390/molecules28227490
5,15472,"An increase in electrode polarization resistance was observed upon CO2 introduction to the electrode, but electrode performance recovered upon returning to a pure air environment.","Mechanistic Study on the Corrosion of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Cathodes Induced by CO2",10.3390/molecules28227490
6,15472,"Furthermore, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses confirmed that CO2 did not cause permanent damage to the (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-delta cathodes.","Mechanistic Study on the Corrosion of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Cathodes Induced by CO2",10.3390/molecules28227490
7,15472,"These findings indicate that the (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-delta cathodes exhibit excellent resistance to CO2-induced corrosion.","Mechanistic Study on the Corrosion of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Cathodes Induced by CO2",10.3390/molecules28227490
