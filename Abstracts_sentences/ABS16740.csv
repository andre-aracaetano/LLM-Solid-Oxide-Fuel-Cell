5,16740,Substitution of a proper amount of Co into the layered perovskite can thus optimize cathode and anode performance simultaneously.,In Situ Growth of Nanoparticles in Layered Perovskite La0.8Sr1.2Fe0.9Co0.1O4-δ as an Active and Stable Electrode for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00071
6,16740,"For example, the polarization resistances (R-p) of LSFC electrode at 800 degrees C are 0.29 and 1.14 Omega cm(2) in air and in 5% H-2/N-2 respectively, which are much smaller compared with the R-p of Co-free La0.8Sr1.2FeO4 +/-delta.",In Situ Growth of Nanoparticles in Layered Perovskite La0.8Sr1.2Fe0.9Co0.1O4-δ as an Active and Stable Electrode for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00071
7,16740,The lower polarization resistance for LSFC in air can be mainly attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity through the partial substitution of iron by cobalt in La0.8Sr1.2FeO4 +/-delta.,In Situ Growth of Nanoparticles in Layered Perovskite La0.8Sr1.2Fe0.9Co0.1O4-δ as an Active and Stable Electrode for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00071
8,16740,"Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic activity of H-2 greatly improved, because of the formation of exsolved homogeneous Co nanoparticles on the surface of LSFC, which appears to promote hydrogen oxidation reaction.",In Situ Growth of Nanoparticles in Layered Perovskite La0.8Sr1.2Fe0.9Co0.1O4-δ as an Active and Stable Electrode for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00071
9,16740,Lower polarization resistance of 0.21 Omega cm(2) in air and 0.93 Omega cm(2) in 5% H-2/N-2 at 800 degrees C could be obtained further by examining an LSFC-Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (CGO) composite as an electrode for IT-SSOFCs.,In Situ Growth of Nanoparticles in Layered Perovskite La0.8Sr1.2Fe0.9Co0.1O4-δ as an Active and Stable Electrode for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00071
