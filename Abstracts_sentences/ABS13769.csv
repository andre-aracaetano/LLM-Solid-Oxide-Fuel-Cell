4,13769,"Three-electrode measurements are performed, allowing ac impedance measurement between two interdigitated gold electrodes while at the same time driving dc current between one of the gold electrodes and a silver counter electrode.",Novel method for determining the triple phase boundary width,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.026
5,13769,"Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements are performed at 300 degrees C. IS results demonstrate two main features a large low-frequency (LF) arc and a smaller high-frequency (HF) arc, which actually consists of two overlapping arcs.",Novel method for determining the triple phase boundary width,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.026
6,13769,The results suggest that the HF arc reflects mainly the surface impedance between the opposing TPBs and that the TPB width is much less than 8 mu m and estimated to be at most 1 mu m. The TPB width increases under high anodic polarization.,Novel method for determining the triple phase boundary width,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.026
