1,14766,High-temperature (>600 degrees C) reactive vaporization of Cr from chromia and stainless steels in oxidizing environments is an industrially relevant phenomenon that has been and will continue to be studied extensively for decades.,Methods to Quantify Reactive Chromium Vaporization from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1149/2.0041409jes
2,14766,"Recently, many experimental techniques have been developed to measure Cr vaporization from stainless steel interconnect (IC) components within solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems.",Methods to Quantify Reactive Chromium Vaporization from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1149/2.0041409jes
3,14766,"Many of these techniques are based on an experimental method known as the transpiration method, which is used to generate Cr vapors and subsequently collect them for quantitative analysis.",Methods to Quantify Reactive Chromium Vaporization from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1149/2.0041409jes
4,14766,"However, vapor collection and analysis methods differ significantly between investigators within the community, as does the array of alloys (with and without protective surface coatings), temperatures, flow rates, and water vapor pressures used in experimentation.",Methods to Quantify Reactive Chromium Vaporization from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1149/2.0041409jes
5,14766,"Therefore, the purpose of the present work is to provide an overview of experimental techniques used to quantify reactive Cr vaporization, and to compare data reported in literature on Cr vaporization from Cr2O3 and chromium containing alloys in oxidizing environments.",Methods to Quantify Reactive Chromium Vaporization from Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1149/2.0041409jes
