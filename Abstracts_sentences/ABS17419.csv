1,17419,"Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) thin films (similar to 1.9 mu m) were deposited on SiO2, Alloy 600 (Fe-Ni-Cr), and A1203 substrates, using e-beam evaporation technique.",Investigation of microstructure and electrical properties of Sm doped ceria thin films,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.11.007
2,17419,"The deposition rate was 0.2 nm/s =1.6 nm/s, and substrate temperature during the formation of thin films was kept 323 K, 423 K, 573 K, 723 K and 873 K. SEM analysis reveals that grain size increases at 323 K, 423 K, and 573 K substrate temperatures and decreases at 723 K and 873 K temperatures.",Investigation of microstructure and electrical properties of Sm doped ceria thin films,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.11.007
