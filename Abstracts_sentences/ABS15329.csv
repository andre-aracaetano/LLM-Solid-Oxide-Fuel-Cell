1,15329,"In this paper a small-scale combined heat, hydrogen and power (CHHP) system, in which ammonia is used as a fuel for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) to produce 100 kg/day of hydrogen (for refueling up to 20-30 fuel cell vehicles) as well as electricity for electric vehicles fast charging and heat for local use, is proposed.","Design and performance assessment of a combined heat, hydrogen and power (CHHP) system based on ammonia-fueled SOFC",10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.138
2,15329,"The study is carried out by means of experimental and numerical analysis; in particular, the behaviour of a single solid oxide cell fed by ammonia is investigated through experimental tests, while the design and the performance assessment of the proposed CHHP plant configurations are predicted by means of a thermo-electrochemical model, properly developed.","Design and performance assessment of a combined heat, hydrogen and power (CHHP) system based on ammonia-fueled SOFC",10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.138
3,15329,"The employed methodology and procedure are based on the SOFC power unit sizing approach that is performed through two different design concepts: (a) the minimum SOFC power unit size that allows to produce hydrogen and electricity for self-sustaining the electric power demand of the system; (b) the minimum SOFC power unit size that allows to produce hydrogen, to satisfy the system electric power demand and to supply electricity for EVs fast charging.","Design and performance assessment of a combined heat, hydrogen and power (CHHP) system based on ammonia-fueled SOFC",10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.138
4,15329,"Results in terms of performance (referred to the high heating values of input and output fuels) highlight that low values of electrical efficiency (14% for Concept_2) and thermal efficiency (<= 15% for Concept_l and Concept_2) are achieved, due to the high conversion of ammonia in hydrogen (the hydrogen production efficiencies are 70% and 42%, respectively), while the trigeneration efficiencies are high (81% and 71%).","Design and performance assessment of a combined heat, hydrogen and power (CHHP) system based on ammonia-fueled SOFC",10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.138
