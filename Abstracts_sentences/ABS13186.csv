2,13186,"In this work, Ruddlesden-Popper-structured La2NiO4+delta (LNO) nanoparticles are introduced onto the surface of (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.995)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode and the electrode performance is examined by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the temperature range of 550-750 degrees C. Impedance spectra analysis shows that an 81% reduction in polarization resistance can be achieved by infiltration of LNO nanoparticles.",Electrochemical characterization of La2NiO4-infiltrated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ by analysis of distribution of relaxation times,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136520
