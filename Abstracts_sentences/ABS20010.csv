1,20010,"The thermal decomposition and phase formation behaviors of lanthanum strontium cobalt oxide, La0.6S0.4CoO3-delta (LSC) material prepared by sot-gel method assisted with different chemical agent namely dispersing agent, polymerizing agent and surface-active agent or surfactant were systematically characterized through thermogravimetric (TG) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.",Influence of Different Chemical Agents on the Thermal Decomposition and Phase Formation of La0.6S0.4CoO3-δ Material Prepared through Sol-Gel Method,10.17576/jsm-2020-4912-31
2,20010,"Thermal decomposition of unwanted organic and inorganic compounds in the precursor powder of LSC material completed at temperature below than 1000 degrees C for the precursor powder prepared using dispersing and polymerizing agents, and at temperature above than 1000 degrees C for the precursor powder prepared using surfactant.",Influence of Different Chemical Agents on the Thermal Decomposition and Phase Formation of La0.6S0.4CoO3-δ Material Prepared through Sol-Gel Method,10.17576/jsm-2020-4912-31
3,20010,The thermal decomposition behavior was influenced by the (hying temperature of the prepared precursor powder and molecular weight of the chemical agent.,Influence of Different Chemical Agents on the Thermal Decomposition and Phase Formation of La0.6S0.4CoO3-δ Material Prepared through Sol-Gel Method,10.17576/jsm-2020-4912-31
4,20010,"Formation of single LSC perovskite phase was confirmed in the precursor powder prepared using dispersant, namely activated carbon and polymerizing agent, namely ethylene glycol after the precursor powder was calcined at 900 degrees C. Conversely, single LSC perovskite phase did not completely form in the precursor powder prepared using surfactant (polyethylene glycol, Triton-X-100, Brij-97 dan Tween-80) even after it was calcined at a higher temperature which is 1100 degrees C. Unsuitable surfactant concentration, molar ratio of surfactant to metal cation and precursor material solution pH value might contribute to the results.",Influence of Different Chemical Agents on the Thermal Decomposition and Phase Formation of La0.6S0.4CoO3-δ Material Prepared through Sol-Gel Method,10.17576/jsm-2020-4912-31
