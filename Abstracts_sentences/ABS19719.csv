1,19719,The performance of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with Cu-ceria yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes in n-butane at 973 K has been studied as a function of fuel conversion.,A study of direct-conversion SOFC with n-butane at higher fuel utilization,10.1149/1.1574807
2,19719,"In order to simulate the local anode environment at high fuel utilization, n-butane was oxidized with O-2 in a separate reactor before sending the fuel to a small 0.45 cm(2) cell.",A study of direct-conversion SOFC with n-butane at higher fuel utilization,10.1149/1.1574807
3,19719,"When n-butane oxidation was carried out over a ceria catalyst at 973 K, the main oxidation products were CO2 and H2O.",A study of direct-conversion SOFC with n-butane at higher fuel utilization,10.1149/1.1574807
4,19719,"By comparing the performance of the cell in the partially oxidized fuel to the performance of the cell in n-butane diluted in He, it was demonstrated that CO2 and H2O have only minimal effect on cell performance other than to dilute the fuel.",A study of direct-conversion SOFC with n-butane at higher fuel utilization,10.1149/1.1574807
5,19719,This dilution of the fuel results in a significant decrease in performance at higher fuel conversions.,A study of direct-conversion SOFC with n-butane at higher fuel utilization,10.1149/1.1574807
6,19719,"When n-butane oxidation was carried out over a Pd-ceria catalyst, significant amounts of H-2 were generated by steam reforming of hydrocarbons with the steam generated by hydrocarbon oxidation.",A study of direct-conversion SOFC with n-butane at higher fuel utilization,10.1149/1.1574807
7,19719,"As a result, the maximum power density generated by the cell increased with fuel conversions up to 30% and remained very high at fuel conversions up to at least 70%.",A study of direct-conversion SOFC with n-butane at higher fuel utilization,10.1149/1.1574807
8,19719,"Based on these results, it is suggested that the inclusion of a steam-reforming catalyst within the anode compartment of direct-conversion SOFC should improve their performance at high fuel utilization.",A study of direct-conversion SOFC with n-butane at higher fuel utilization,10.1149/1.1574807
