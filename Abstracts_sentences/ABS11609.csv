1,11609,"To protect solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) from chromium poisoning and improve metallic interconnect stability, manganese cobaltite spinel protection layers with a nominal composition of Mn1.5Co1.5O4 were thermally grown on Crofer22 APU, a ferritic stainless steel.",Thermal growth and performance of manganese cobaltite spinel protection layers on ferritic stainless steel SOFC interconnects,10.1149/1.1990462
2,11609,"Thermal, electrical, and electrochemical investigations indicated that the spinel protection layers not only significantly decreased the contact area specific resistance (ASR) between a LSF cathode and the stainless steel interconnect, but also inhibited the subscale growth on the stainless steel by acting as a barrier to the inward diffusion of oxygen.",Thermal growth and performance of manganese cobaltite spinel protection layers on ferritic stainless steel SOFC interconnects,10.1149/1.1990462
3,11609,"A long-term thermal cycling test demonstrated excellent structural and thermomechanical stability of these spinel protection layers, which also acted as a barrier to outward chromium cation diffusion to the interconnect surface.",Thermal growth and performance of manganese cobaltite spinel protection layers on ferritic stainless steel SOFC interconnects,10.1149/1.1990462
