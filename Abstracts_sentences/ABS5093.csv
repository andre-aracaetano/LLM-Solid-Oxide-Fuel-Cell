1,5093,A layered perovskite oxide Y0.8Ca0.2BaCoFeO5+delta (YCBCF) was synthesized as a novel cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) by citric acid-nitrates self-propagating combustion method.,Layered perovskite oxide Y0.8Ca0.2BaCoFeO5+δ as a novel cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1002-0721(14)60450-6
2,5093,"The phase and microstructure of YCBCF were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively.",Layered perovskite oxide Y0.8Ca0.2BaCoFeO5+δ as a novel cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1002-0721(14)60450-6
3,5093,"The average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of YCBCF was 14.6x10(-6) K-1, which was close to other materials of SOFC at the range of RT-1000 degrees C. An open-circuit potential of 0.75 V and a maximum output power density of 426 mW/cm(2) were obtained at 650 degrees C in a Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC)-based anode-supported SOFC by using humidified (similar to 3% H2O) hydrogen as fuel and static air as oxidant.",Layered perovskite oxide Y0.8Ca0.2BaCoFeO5+δ as a novel cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1002-0721(14)60450-6
4,5093,The results indicated that the YCBCF was a promising cathode candidate for IT-SOFCs.,Layered perovskite oxide Y0.8Ca0.2BaCoFeO5+δ as a novel cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1002-0721(14)60450-6
