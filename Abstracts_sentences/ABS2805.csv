2,2805,"A standard NiO/8YSZ cermet anode, 8 mol % YSZ electrolyte, and a lanthanum strontium manganite cathode were used for the solid oxide fuel cell unit cell.",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell manufactured by a tape casting process,10.1115/1.2885401
3,2805,A pressurized cofiring technique allows the creation of a thin layer of dense electrolyte about 10 mu m without warpage.,Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell manufactured by a tape casting process,10.1115/1.2885401
4,2805,The open circuit voltage of the unit cell indicated negligible fuel leakage through the electrolyte film due to the dense and crack-free electrolyte layer.,Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell manufactured by a tape casting process,10.1115/1.2885401
5,2805,"An electrochemical test of the unit cell showed a maximum power density up to 0.173 W/cm(2) at 900 degrees C. Approximated electrochemical properties, e.g., activation energy, Ohmic resistance, and exchange current density, indicated that the cell performance was significantly influenced by the electrode properties of the unit cell.",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell manufactured by a tape casting process,10.1115/1.2885401
