2,12751,"However, the complex microstructure of these infiltrated nanocatalysts creates challenges in quantifying their role in anode performance improvements.",Quantifying Percolated Triple Phase Boundary Density and Its Effects on Anodic Polarization in Ni-Infiltrated Ni/YSZ SOFC Anodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ac3599
3,12751,"In this research, scanning electron microscopy of fractured cross-sections of a Ni-nanocatalyst infiltrated anodic symmetric cell along with three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of the same anode have been used to quantify the changes in percolated TPB densities due to infiltration.",Quantifying Percolated Triple Phase Boundary Density and Its Effects on Anodic Polarization in Ni-Infiltrated Ni/YSZ SOFC Anodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ac3599
4,12751,This change in percolated TPB density has been compared to the improvement in anode activation polarization resistance measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).,Quantifying Percolated Triple Phase Boundary Density and Its Effects on Anodic Polarization in Ni-Infiltrated Ni/YSZ SOFC Anodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ac3599
5,12751,It was found that increased TPB densities only partially accounted for the measured performance improvement.,Quantifying Percolated Triple Phase Boundary Density and Its Effects on Anodic Polarization in Ni-Infiltrated Ni/YSZ SOFC Anodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ac3599
6,12751,"Distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analyses showed that a reduction in the time constants of the catalytic processes in the anode also play a role, suggesting that the added nanoscale percolated TPB boundaries are more electrochemically active as compared to the cermet TPB boundaries.",Quantifying Percolated Triple Phase Boundary Density and Its Effects on Anodic Polarization in Ni-Infiltrated Ni/YSZ SOFC Anodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ac3599
