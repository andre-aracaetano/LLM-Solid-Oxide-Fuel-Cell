1,6507,"Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-delta nano-particles were prepared by different wet-chemical synthesis, Pechini (BZCY(P)) and co-precipitation (BZCY(C)), respectively.",Characteristics of Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ nano-powders synthesized by different wet-chemical methods for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.195
2,6507,"The BZCY(C) powders have a particle size in range of about 50-150 nm, which is smaller than the BZCY(P) powders with about 500-900 nm.",Characteristics of Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ nano-powders synthesized by different wet-chemical methods for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.195
3,6507,"Both the BZCY materials show perovskite structures, but there are impurities in the BZCY (P).",Characteristics of Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ nano-powders synthesized by different wet-chemical methods for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.195
4,6507,"Moreover, the electrolyte density was higher in the BZCY (C) than the BZCY (P).",Characteristics of Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ nano-powders synthesized by different wet-chemical methods for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.195
5,6507,The single cells with BZCY (C) electrolytes exhibited about 0.23 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C and about 0.31 W cm(-2) at the same temperature were obtained when the anode-functional layer was introduced between the anode and electrolyte.,Characteristics of Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ nano-powders synthesized by different wet-chemical methods for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.195
6,6507,"Thus, the BZCY prepared by carbonate-derived co-precipitation method can be more favorable for high-purity and dense electrolytes in the solid oxide fuel cells than the BZCY prepared by Pechini method.",Characteristics of Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2)O3-δ nano-powders synthesized by different wet-chemical methods for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.195
