4,7926,"The cell with 0.38Sn-0.19MgO-Ni-SDC anode exhibits a peak power density of 374 mW cm-2 and excellent long-term stability for 100 h with a power attenuation about 13.5% in humidified methane at 700 degrees C, which is attributed to the decreased rate of carbon deposition by promoting the formation of C-O bonds instead of C-C bonds, increasing the activation barrier for methane cracking and preventing the formation of nickel carbides by the confinement effect of heterogeneous catalysts, and the enhanced rate of carbon removal is attributed to excellent hydrophilicity and adsorption of CO2, as revealed by combined density function theory (DFT) calculations and experimental characterizations.",Heterogeneous MgO-modified Ni3Sn cermet anode for hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuel.2023.129356
