1,730,"To study the geometrical scale dependency of thin film solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), we fabricated three thin films SOFCs which have the same cross-sectional structure but different electrode areas of 1 mm(2), 4 mm(2) and 9 mm(2).",Geometrical scale dependency of thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1142/S0217984920400382
2,730,"Since the activation and ohmic losses of SOFCs depend on their active region, we examined the variations of the power density of the cells with a Pt/YSZ/Pt structure and simulated the power density variations using the COMSOL software package.",Geometrical scale dependency of thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1142/S0217984920400382
