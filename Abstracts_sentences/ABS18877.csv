1,18877,This study introduces a novel approach for fabricating sub-micron dense GDC (Gd2O3 doped CeO2) barrier layers on YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrolytes via in situ hydrothermal self-crystallization at an extremely low temperature of 180 C-degrees.,An in situ hydrothermally self-crystallized dense ceria-based barrier layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d4ta00656a

3,18877,"An anode-supported single cell with a GDC barrier layer similar to 330 nm thick shows an R-ohm of 0.075 Omega cm(2) and P-Max of 1.019 W cm(-2) at 750 C-degrees, which is a great improvement over single cell with a screen-printed GDC barrier layer (R-ohm of 0.15 Omega cm(2) and P-Max of 0.661 W cm(-2)) and shows enhanced durability over 800 h. This enhanced performance is primarily due to shortend oxygen ions transport pathways, and an optimized electrolyte/cathode interface from effective interface sintering.",An in situ hydrothermally self-crystallized dense ceria-based barrier layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d4ta00656a
4,18877,This in situ hydrothermal self-crystallization method emerges as a promising and applicable technique for the preparation of a thin-film GDC barrier layer.,An in situ hydrothermally self-crystallized dense ceria-based barrier layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d4ta00656a
