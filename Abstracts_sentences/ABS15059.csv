1,15059,Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) is a promising additive to decrease the sintering temperature of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell application.,Controlled synthesis of Bi2O3-YSZ composite powders and their sintering behavior for high-performance electrolytes,10.1111/ijac.14270
2,15059,"However, Bi2O3 tends to grow into large column bars (>50 mu m) in a chemical coprecipitation method, which dramatically limits the mixing uniformity of Bi2O3 and YSZ, even much worse than that of mechanical mixing.",Controlled synthesis of Bi2O3-YSZ composite powders and their sintering behavior for high-performance electrolytes,10.1111/ijac.14270
3,15059,"In this study, the reaction temperature was increased from room temperature to 90 degrees C to increase the number of nucleation during the violate reaction between Bi3+ solution and YSZ suspension in NaOH.",Controlled synthesis of Bi2O3-YSZ composite powders and their sintering behavior for high-performance electrolytes,10.1111/ijac.14270
4,15059,"On this basis, the violence of the reaction was further moderated by adding half of NaOH first, then YSZ powders and the other half of an NaOH solution.",Controlled synthesis of Bi2O3-YSZ composite powders and their sintering behavior for high-performance electrolytes,10.1111/ijac.14270
5,15059,"The size of Bi2O3 was further decreased to sub-micrometer and Bi2O3 was homogeneously mixed with YSZ particles, even when its addition amount was as large as 20 mol%.",Controlled synthesis of Bi2O3-YSZ composite powders and their sintering behavior for high-performance electrolytes,10.1111/ijac.14270
6,15059,These composite powders effectively promoted the sintering behavior of YSZ.,Controlled synthesis of Bi2O3-YSZ composite powders and their sintering behavior for high-performance electrolytes,10.1111/ijac.14270
7,15059,"The sintering temperature of YSZ was decreased to 900 and 1000 degrees C with 10 and 5 mol% Bi2O3 doping, respectively.",Controlled synthesis of Bi2O3-YSZ composite powders and their sintering behavior for high-performance electrolytes,10.1111/ijac.14270
8,15059,Increasing the doping ratio induced severe volatilization of Bi2O3 and pore formation.,Controlled synthesis of Bi2O3-YSZ composite powders and their sintering behavior for high-performance electrolytes,10.1111/ijac.14270
9,15059,Raising the sintering temperature (no more than 1200 degrees C) enhanced the doping effect of Bi2O3 into the YSZ lattice but induced instability in the YSZ crystal structure.,Controlled synthesis of Bi2O3-YSZ composite powders and their sintering behavior for high-performance electrolytes,10.1111/ijac.14270
