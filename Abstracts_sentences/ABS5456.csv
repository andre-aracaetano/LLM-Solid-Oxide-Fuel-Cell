7,5456,"The polarization resistance of the cell with the LaNi0.4Zn0.1Fe0.5O3-delta cathode is reduced to 0.043 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, which is one of the smallest reported for H-SOFCs using cobalt-free cathodes.",Cobalt-free LaNi0.4Zn0.1Fe0.5O3-Q as a cathode for solid oxide fuel cells using proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.09.104
8,5456,The high fuel cell performance coupled with the low polarization resistance for the Zn-modified LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3-delta suggests that the Zn-doping strategy would be an interesting way to promote the performance of the cobalt-free LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3-delta material for H-SOFCs.,Cobalt-free LaNi0.4Zn0.1Fe0.5O3-Q as a cathode for solid oxide fuel cells using proton-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.09.104
