1,7232,The electrochemical behaviour of Ni-based anodes for H+ solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a composition consisting of Ni-BaCe0.89Gd0.1Cu0.01O3-5 and Ni-BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-5 was studied.,"On a variation of the kinetics of hydrogen oxidation on Ni-BaCe(Y,Gd)O3 anode for proton ceramic fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.082
2,7232,"Ni-BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-5 exhibited poorer performance in comparison with Ni-BaCe0.89Gd0.1Cu0.01O3-5, which was explained by the formation of the BaY2NiO5 phase at the electrode-electrolyte interface during electrode sintering.","On a variation of the kinetics of hydrogen oxidation on Ni-BaCe(Y,Gd)O3 anode for proton ceramic fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.082
3,7232,It was found that the hydrogen oxidation rate on the Ni-BaCe0.89Gd0.1Cu0.01O3-5 anode in the temperature range of 700 -900 degrees C was determined by the rate of the three stages.,"On a variation of the kinetics of hydrogen oxidation on Ni-BaCe(Y,Gd)O3 anode for proton ceramic fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.082
4,7232,It was shown that the electrode reaction mechanism did not change in this temperature range.,"On a variation of the kinetics of hydrogen oxidation on Ni-BaCe(Y,Gd)O3 anode for proton ceramic fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.082
5,7232,"At the temperature of 600 degrees C, the reaction mechanism became more complicated, most likely due to the influence of increased protonic conductivity in the electrolyte.","On a variation of the kinetics of hydrogen oxidation on Ni-BaCe(Y,Gd)O3 anode for proton ceramic fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.082
6,7232,The nature of the probable ratedetermining stages of hydrogen oxidation is suggested.,"On a variation of the kinetics of hydrogen oxidation on Ni-BaCe(Y,Gd)O3 anode for proton ceramic fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.082
