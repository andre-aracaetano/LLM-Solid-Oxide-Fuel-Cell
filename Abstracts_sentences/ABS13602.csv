1,13602,The electrochemical oxidation of humid hydrogen was investigated on a Y0.20Ti0.18Zr0.62O1.90 (YTZ) anode in a high temperature planar solid oxide fuel cell.,Anodic Behaviour of Y0.20Ti0.18 Zr0.62O1.90 Towards Hydrogen Electro-Oxidation in a High Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
2,13602,"Cells using platinum counter and reference electrodes on a YSZ based electrolyte were fabricated and tested in H-2/H2O atmospheres versus air in the temperature range (788-932)degrees C. Steady state polarisation measurements, cyclic voltammetry and impedance analysis were used to characterise the behaviour of the anode and determine kinetic parameters of the electro-oxidation reaction.",Anodic Behaviour of Y0.20Ti0.18 Zr0.62O1.90 Towards Hydrogen Electro-Oxidation in a High Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
3,13602,"The power output of the cell H-2, H2O/YTZ//YSZ-Al2O3//Pt/air was stable over an operation period of 500 h. For 97% H-2/3% H2O at 932 degrees C it amounted to 37 mW cm(-2) and the maximum current density obtained was 203 mA cm(-2).",Anodic Behaviour of Y0.20Ti0.18 Zr0.62O1.90 Towards Hydrogen Electro-Oxidation in a High Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
4,13602,The apparent reaction order with respect to hydrogen was calculated to be in the region of 0.5 at 932 degrees C.,Anodic Behaviour of Y0.20Ti0.18 Zr0.62O1.90 Towards Hydrogen Electro-Oxidation in a High Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
5,13602,"The impedance spectra showed three apparent processes dependent on temperature, fuel concentration and overpotential.",Anodic Behaviour of Y0.20Ti0.18 Zr0.62O1.90 Towards Hydrogen Electro-Oxidation in a High Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
6,13602,Anode polarisation resistance decreased significantly with anodic overpotential.,Anodic Behaviour of Y0.20Ti0.18 Zr0.62O1.90 Towards Hydrogen Electro-Oxidation in a High Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
7,13602,At open and short circuit (E-cell = 0 V) conditions the total area specific polarisation resistance was 12.67 and 0.96 Omega cm(2) respectively.,Anodic Behaviour of Y0.20Ti0.18 Zr0.62O1.90 Towards Hydrogen Electro-Oxidation in a High Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
