1,11737,This work applies a multiscale mechanistic damage model developed for brittle ceramics and implemented in commercial finite element (FE) packages via user subroutines to study progressive damage in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) subjected to thermomechanical loading under normal operating and shutdown conditions including redox effects.,Damage Modeling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Accounting for Redox Effects,10.1149/1945-7111/ac39de
2,11737,The damage model captures the micromechanics of stiffness reduction due to material porosity change and microcracking and integrates the as-obtained stiffness reduction law into a continuum damage mechanics (CDM) formulation for the evolution of microcracks up to fracture.,Damage Modeling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Accounting for Redox Effects,10.1149/1945-7111/ac39de
3,11737,"The volumetric swelling that occurs during redox is treated in constitutive modeling similarly to thermal expansion, but swelling strains are irreversible.",Damage Modeling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Accounting for Redox Effects,10.1149/1945-7111/ac39de
4,11737,This damage model was first validated through predictions of strength and stress-strain response for the SOFC electrode materials.,Damage Modeling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Accounting for Redox Effects,10.1149/1945-7111/ac39de
5,11737,"Next, it has been applied to predict the potential for degradation in a generic planar SOFC stack with large active area cells.",Damage Modeling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Accounting for Redox Effects,10.1149/1945-7111/ac39de
6,11737,Multicell stack models were simulated in both co-flow and counter-flow configurations.,Damage Modeling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Accounting for Redox Effects,10.1149/1945-7111/ac39de
7,11737,"In addition, a constant temperature redox cycle was also simulated to capture overall cell electrode damage due to volumetric swelling of the nickel (Ni)-based anode in the anode-supported cells.",Damage Modeling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Accounting for Redox Effects,10.1149/1945-7111/ac39de
