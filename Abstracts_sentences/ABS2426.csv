2,2426,"The very distinct operating temperatures of 80 degreesC (PEFC) and 800-950 degreesC (SOFC) impose fundamentally different requirements upon the nature of the fuel; normally purified H-2 for the former (CO trace) and usually synthesis gas for the latter (H-2, CO as main constituents).",Fuels for fuel cells: Requirements and fuel processing,10.2533/000942904777677092
3,2426,"Apart from stored hydrogen, the most relevant fuels are primary hydrocarbons (natural gas, biogas, liquids....), that then need processing (chemical conversion, cleaning) up to a level compatible with the fuel cell catalysts.",Fuels for fuel cells: Requirements and fuel processing,10.2533/000942904777677092
