1,19192,Manipulation of oxygen vacancies via electric-field-controlled ionic liquid gating has been reported in many model systems within the emergent fields of oxide electronics and iontronics.,Oxygen-Valve Formed in Cobaltite-Based Heterostructures by Ionic Liquid and Ferroelectric Dual-Gating,10.1021/acsami.9b02442
2,19192,It is then significant to investigate the oxygen vacancy formation/annihilation and migration across an additional ferroelectric layer with ionic liquid gating.,Oxygen-Valve Formed in Cobaltite-Based Heterostructures by Ionic Liquid and Ferroelectric Dual-Gating,10.1021/acsami.9b02442
3,19192,"Here, we report that via a combination of ionic liquid and ferroelectric gating, the remote control of oxygen vacancies and magnetic phase transition can be achieved in SrCoO2.5 films capped with an ultrathin ferroelectric BaTiO3 layer at room temperature.",Oxygen-Valve Formed in Cobaltite-Based Heterostructures by Ionic Liquid and Ferroelectric Dual-Gating,10.1021/acsami.9b02442
4,19192,"The ultrathin BaTiO3 layer acts as an atomic oxygen valve and is semitransparent to oxygen-ion transport due to the competing interaction between vertical electron tunneling and ferroelectric polarization plus surface electrochemical changes in itself, thus resulting in the striking emergence of new mixed-phase SrCoOx.",Oxygen-Valve Formed in Cobaltite-Based Heterostructures by Ionic Liquid and Ferroelectric Dual-Gating,10.1021/acsami.9b02442
5,19192,The lateral coexistence of brownmillerite phase SrCoO2.5 and perovskite phase SrCoO3-delta was directly observed by transmission electron microscopy.,Oxygen-Valve Formed in Cobaltite-Based Heterostructures by Ionic Liquid and Ferroelectric Dual-Gating,10.1021/acsami.9b02442
6,19192,"Besides the fundamental significance of long-range interaction in ionic liquid gating, the ability to control the flow of oxygen ions across the heterointerface by the oxygen valve provides a new approach on the atomic scale for designing multistate memories, sensors, and solid-oxide fuel cells.",Oxygen-Valve Formed in Cobaltite-Based Heterostructures by Ionic Liquid and Ferroelectric Dual-Gating,10.1021/acsami.9b02442
