2,7702,"The microstructure of the silver thus obtained was found to depend on the processing temperature, with lower sintering temperatures resulting in greater porosity and surface area.",Synthesis of 3-dimensional silver networks and their application in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.125
3,7702,"The silver current collectors was found to undergo steam embrittlement during SOFC operation, but the embrittlement could be prevented by pre-treating the silver metal with N-2 gas at high temperatures (800 degrees C) or with 10% H-2-90% Ar at room temperatures (similar to 25 degrees C).",Synthesis of 3-dimensional silver networks and their application in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.125

5,7702,"on symmetric cells indicate that the samples with greater porosity show diminished performance, confirming that the rate limiting step for the silver cathodes is oxygen transport.",Synthesis of 3-dimensional silver networks and their application in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.125
6,7702,"These silver cathodes were also compared to similarly-prepared platinum cathodes, and the silver cathodes were observed to have drastically reduced polarization resistances.",Synthesis of 3-dimensional silver networks and their application in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.125
