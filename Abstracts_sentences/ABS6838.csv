1,6838,"In an effort to build the solid oxide fuel cell for intermediate temperature operations, the oxide ion conductor member of LAMOX family appears to be an ideal candidate for electrolyte since its parent crystal La2Mo2O9 shows a monoclinic-cubic phase transition around 580 degrees C. Nonetheless, members of the LAMOX family are much less refractory than the conventional electrode compositions which are targeted to coordinate with the electrolyte of yttrium stabilized zirconia.",BSCF/GDC as a refined cathode to the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell based on a LAMOX electrolyte,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.103
2,6838,"In this work, we study the viability of a cathode composite of Ba0.5Sr05Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF) and gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) to match the electrolyte La1.8Dy0.2Mo2O9 (LDM).",BSCF/GDC as a refined cathode to the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell based on a LAMOX electrolyte,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.103
3,6838,Severe interfacial reactions between BSCF and LDM require a ceria-based diffusion barrier between them.,BSCF/GDC as a refined cathode to the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell based on a LAMOX electrolyte,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.103
4,6838,"The iron-doped GDC barrier of high sinterability is a convenient choice to block the unwanted reactions, allowing us to devise a BSCF/GDC composite cathode of gradient GDC content to relieve thermal stresses.",BSCF/GDC as a refined cathode to the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell based on a LAMOX electrolyte,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.103
