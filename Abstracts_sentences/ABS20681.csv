2,20681,"However the literature on the Weibull modulus, m, versus volume fraction porosity, P, is extremely limited despite the importance of m as a gauge of mechanical reliability.",Part I: Porosity dependence of the Weibull modulus for hydroxyapatite and other brittle materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2011.12.010
3,20681,"In Part I of this study, m is determined for 441 sintered hydroxyapatite (HA) specimens fractured in biaxial flexure for 0.08 <= P <= 0.62.",Part I: Porosity dependence of the Weibull modulus for hydroxyapatite and other brittle materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2011.12.010
4,20681,"In this study, we analyze a combined data set collected from the literature that represents work from a total of 17 different research groups (including the present authors), eight different materials and more than 1560 oxide and non-oxide specimens, the m versus P plot is U-shaped with a wide band of m values for P < 0.1 (Region I) and P > 0.55 (Region III), and a narrower band of m values in the intermediate porosity region of 0.1 < P < 0.55 (Region II).",Part I: Porosity dependence of the Weibull modulus for hydroxyapatite and other brittle materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2011.12.010
5,20681,The limited range of m (similar to 4 < m < 11) in Region II has important implications since Region II includes the P range for the majority of the applications of porous brittle materials.,Part I: Porosity dependence of the Weibull modulus for hydroxyapatite and other brittle materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2011.12.010
6,20681,"Part II of this study focuses on the P dependence of the mean fracture strength, < sigma(f) >, and the Young's modulus E for the HA specimens tested in Part I along with literature data for other brittle materials.",Part I: Porosity dependence of the Weibull modulus for hydroxyapatite and other brittle materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2011.12.010
7,20681,"Both < sigma(f) > and E are power law functions of the degree of densification, phi, where phi = 1 - P/P-G and P-G is the green (unfired) porosity.",Part I: Porosity dependence of the Weibull modulus for hydroxyapatite and other brittle materials,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2011.12.010
