1,19955,"The atomic-scale properties of lanthanum-strontium manganite (La1-xSrxMnO3-delta, LSMO) surfaces are of high interest because of the roles of the material as a prototypical complex oxide, in the fabrication of spintronic devices and in catalytic applications.",Atomically resolved surface phases of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3(110) thin films,10.1039/d0ta07032g
2,19955,"This work combines pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and surface analysis techniques (low-energy electron diffraction - LEED, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy - XPS, and low-energy He+ ion scattering - LEIS) to assess the atomic properties of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3(110) surfaces and their dependence on the surface composition.",Atomically resolved surface phases of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3(110) thin films,10.1039/d0ta07032g
3,19955,"Epitaxial films with 130 nm thickness were grown on Nb-doped SrTiO3(110) and their near-surface stoichiometry was adjusted by depositing La and Mn in sub-monolayer amounts, quantified with a movable quartz-crystal microbalance.",Atomically resolved surface phases of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3(110) thin films,10.1039/d0ta07032g
4,19955,"The resulting surfaces were equilibrated at 700 degrees C under 0.2 mbar O-2, i.e., under conditions that bridge the gap between ultra-high vacuum and the operating conditions of high-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells, where LSMO is used as the cathode.",Atomically resolved surface phases of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3(110) thin films,10.1039/d0ta07032g
5,19955,The atomic details of various composition-related surface phases have been unveiled.,Atomically resolved surface phases of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3(110) thin films,10.1039/d0ta07032g
6,19955,The phases are characterized by distinct structural and electronic properties and vary in their ability to accommodate deposited cations.,Atomically resolved surface phases of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3(110) thin films,10.1039/d0ta07032g
