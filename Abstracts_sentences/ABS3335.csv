1,3335,"Oxides of composition SrMo1-xCrxO3-delta (x = 0.1, 0.2) have been prepared, characterized and tested as anode materials in single solid-oxide fuel cells, yielding output powers higher than 700 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C with pure H-2 as a fuel.","New SrMo1-x,CrxO3-δ perovskites as anodes in solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.149
2,3335,"All the materials are suggested to present mixed ionic-electronic conductivity (mmq from neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiments, complemented with transport measurements; the presence of a Mo4+/Mo5+ mixed valence at room temperature, combined with a huge metal-like electronic conductivity, as high as 340 S cm(-1) at T = 50 degrees C for x = 0.1, could make these oxides good materials for solid-oxide fuel cells.","New SrMo1-x,CrxO3-δ perovskites as anodes in solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.149

4,3335,"The reversibility of the reduction-oxidation between the oxidized Sr(Mo,Cr)O4-delta scheelite and the reduced Sr(Mo,Cr)O-3 perovskite phases was studied by thermogravimetric analysis, which exhibit the required cyclability for fuel cells.","New SrMo1-x,CrxO3-δ perovskites as anodes in solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.149
5,3335,"An adequate thermal expansion coefficient, without abrupt changes, and a chemical compatibility with electrolytes make these oxides good candidates for anodes in intermediate-temperature SOFC (IT-SOFCs).","New SrMo1-x,CrxO3-δ perovskites as anodes in solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.149
