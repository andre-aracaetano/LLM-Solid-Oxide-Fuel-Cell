1,4326,"Two perovskite materials with SrMo1-xAlxO3-delta (x = 0.1, 0.2) compositions have been syn-thesized by reduction from the corresponding scheelite phases, with SrMo1-xAlxO4-delta stoichiometry; the pertinent characterization shows that the defective perovskites can be used as anode materials in solid oxide fuel cells, providing maximum output power densities of 633 mW/cm(2) for x = 0.2.",Al-Doped SrMoO3 Perovskites as Promising Anode Materials in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ma15113819

3,4326,"Both perovskites are cubic, defined in the Pm-3m space group, displaying a random distribution of Mo and Al cations over the 1a sites of the structure.",Al-Doped SrMoO3 Perovskites as Promising Anode Materials in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ma15113819

5,4326,"This is essential to induce ionic diffusion, providing a mixed ionic and electronic conduction (MIEC), since in MIEC electrodes, charge carriers are combined in one single phase and the ionic conductivity can be one order of magnitude higher than in a conventional material.",Al-Doped SrMoO3 Perovskites as Promising Anode Materials in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ma15113819
6,4326,"The thermal expansion coefficients of the reduced and oxidized samples demonstrated that these materials perfectly match with the La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta electrolyte, La0.4Ce0.6O2-delta buffer layer and other components of the cell.",Al-Doped SrMoO3 Perovskites as Promising Anode Materials in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ma15113819
