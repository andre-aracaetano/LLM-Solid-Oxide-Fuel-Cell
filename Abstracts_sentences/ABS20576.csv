2,20576,"The oxygen vacancy formation energy is directly related to the oxide reduction enthalpy and the vacancy concentration and, therefore, is a key quantity underlying these applications.",Assessment of exchange-correlation functionals on oxygen vacancy formation energies of metal oxides,10.1103/PhysRevB.108.104103
3,20576,The complexity of measuring oxygen vacancy formation energies experimentally suggests the utility of calculations based on density functional theory (DFT).,Assessment of exchange-correlation functionals on oxygen vacancy formation energies of metal oxides,10.1103/PhysRevB.108.104103
4,20576,"However, the calculated results are strongly dependent on the exchange-correlation functionals and other parameters such as the Hubbard U.",Assessment of exchange-correlation functionals on oxygen vacancy formation energies of metal oxides,10.1103/PhysRevB.108.104103
5,20576,"In this work, we compare the performance of the meta-GGA strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional and the commonly used semilocal generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals with experimental values of structural parameters, band gaps, magnetic structures, and oxygen vacancy formation energies for six representative oxides, i.e., CaMnO3, SrMnO3, LaMnO3, YMnO3, LaFeO3, and CeO2.",Assessment of exchange-correlation functionals on oxygen vacancy formation energies of metal oxides,10.1103/PhysRevB.108.104103
6,20576,Our results show that SCAN usually has better agreement with the experimental lattice constants and band gaps and larger magnetic moments than the commonly used GGA functionals.,Assessment of exchange-correlation functionals on oxygen vacancy formation energies of metal oxides,10.1103/PhysRevB.108.104103
7,20576,"Although SCAN overestimates the oxygen vacancy formation energies of transition metal oxides and therefore requires unusually large Hubbard U values to reproduce the experimental reduction enthalpies, it does predict the correct oxygen vacancy formation energy of CeO2, which challenges the commonly used GGA and hybrid functionals.",Assessment of exchange-correlation functionals on oxygen vacancy formation energies of metal oxides,10.1103/PhysRevB.108.104103
8,20576,Our results underscore the challenges that exist in describing these complex oxides by DFT and may shed light on developing more accurate exchange-correlation functionals for oxygen vacancy formation energy calculations.,Assessment of exchange-correlation functionals on oxygen vacancy formation energies of metal oxides,10.1103/PhysRevB.108.104103
