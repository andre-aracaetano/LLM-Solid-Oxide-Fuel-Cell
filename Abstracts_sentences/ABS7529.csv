1,7529,"A solid oxide fuel cell unit is constructed with Ni-(Ce,Gd)O2-x (GDC) as the anode, yttria-stabilized zirconia as the electrolyte, and V2O5 or Cu added (LaSr)(CoFe)O-3-GDC as the cathode.","Effect of O2 concentration on performance of solid oxide fuel cells with V2O5 or Cu added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x cathode with and without NO",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.008
2,7529,The effect of the O-2 concentration on the open circuit voltage (OCV) is studied and a mass-transfer limited OCV is observed.,"Effect of O2 concentration on performance of solid oxide fuel cells with V2O5 or Cu added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x cathode with and without NO",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.008
3,7529,The power density with Cu addition can be much higher than that with V2O5 addition but the effect of the O-2 concentration with Cu addition is larger than that with V2O5 addition.,"Effect of O2 concentration on performance of solid oxide fuel cells with V2O5 or Cu added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x cathode with and without NO",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.008
4,7529,"Without the presence of NO, both the power density and the OCV decrease with decreasing O-2 concentration.","Effect of O2 concentration on performance of solid oxide fuel cells with V2O5 or Cu added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x cathode with and without NO",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.008
5,7529,"The OCV variation can be substantial with the variation of the flow rate, the O-2 concentration and the NO concentration.","Effect of O2 concentration on performance of solid oxide fuel cells with V2O5 or Cu added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x cathode with and without NO",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.008
6,7529,"The presence Of CO2 can increase the OCV while that of NO can decrease the OCV; however, a synergistic effect can occur on the OCV when NO is present at a very low O-2 concentration which results in a sudden drop of the OCV.","Effect of O2 concentration on performance of solid oxide fuel cells with V2O5 or Cu added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x cathode with and without NO",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.008
