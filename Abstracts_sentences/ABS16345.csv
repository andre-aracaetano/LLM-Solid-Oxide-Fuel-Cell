3,16345,"In this study, fuel gas composition is systematically investigated by thermochemical equilibrium calculations on the anode side of SOFCs, pressurized up to 30 bar over a wide temperature range, up to 1000 degrees C. Since conventional hydrogen-containing fuel gas consists mainly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, high-pressure C-H-O equilibrium diagrams are numerically obtained.","High-pressure C-H-O diagrams: Fuel composition, carbon deposition, and open circuit voltage of pressurized SOFCs",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.10.122
