2,20733,The study was conducted on three-electrode half-cells with Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy under equilibrium potential.,Study of Activation Effect of Anodic Current on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Air Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.058
3,20733,"Initially, the polarization resistance (RP) tested at 800 degrees C of the LSCF electrode sintered at 900 degrees C is 0.25 Omega cm(2).",Study of Activation Effect of Anodic Current on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Air Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.058
4,20733,"During the first 20 hours of testing with anodic current density of 0.2 A cm(-2), RP increased with a linear dependence on the square root of time, suggesting Sr surface segregation.",Study of Activation Effect of Anodic Current on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Air Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.058
5,20733,After the first phase of tests RP stabilized at 0.68 Omega cm2.,Study of Activation Effect of Anodic Current on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Air Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.058
6,20733,"Continued testing at increased current density to 0.5 A cm(-2) showed that RP decreased from 0.68 to 0.46 Omega cm(2), and again to 0.39 Omega cm(2) at even higher bias of 1 A cm(-2).",Study of Activation Effect of Anodic Current on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Air Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.058
7,20733,"Moreover, short-term tests for 129 h under various currents again showed that RP decreased upon higher anodic current while increased upon lower anodic current.",Study of Activation Effect of Anodic Current on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Air Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.058
8,20733,"However, no obvious degradation on RP was shown by comparing the value before and after the test.",Study of Activation Effect of Anodic Current on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Air Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.058
9,20733,"Based on above results, the authors speculate that the application of anodic current may be able to stabilize and activate the performance of LSCF electrode through suppressing and mitigating Sr surface segregation.",Study of Activation Effect of Anodic Current on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Air Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.058
