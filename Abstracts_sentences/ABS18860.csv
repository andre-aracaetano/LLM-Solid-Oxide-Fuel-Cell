3,18860,"The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) investigations, operated in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode, illustrate that not only diffusion of metallic Ni from the anode into the electrolyte but also simultaneous counter-diffusion of Ce and Gd rare-earth cations from the electrolyte to the anode.",The diffusions and associated interfacial layer formation between thin film electrolyte and cermet anode in IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.07.080
