2,15775,All the glasses have been prepared by the melt-quench technique.,Sintering behavior of lanthanide-containing glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm16300d
3,15775,The in situ follow up of sintering behavior of glass powders has been done by a high temperature-environmental scanning electron microscope (HT-ESEM) and a hot-stage microscope (HSM) while the crystalline phase evolution and assemblage have been analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).,Sintering behavior of lanthanide-containing glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm16300d
4,15775,All the glass compositions exhibit a glass-in-glass phase separation followed by two stage sintering resulting in well sintered glass powder compacts after heat treatment at 850 degrees C for 1 h. Diopside (CaMgSi2O6) based phases constituted the major crystalline part in glass-ceramics followed by some minor phases.,Sintering behavior of lanthanide-containing glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm16300d
5,15775,"The increase in lanthanide content in glasses suppressed their tendency towards devitrification, thus resulting in glass-ceramics with a high amount of residual glassy phase (50-96 wt%) which is expected to facilitate their self-healing behavior during SOFC operation.",Sintering behavior of lanthanide-containing glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm16300d
6,15775,The electrical conductivity of the investigated glass-ceramics varied between (1.19 and 7.33) x 10(-7),Sintering behavior of lanthanide-containing glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2jm16300d
