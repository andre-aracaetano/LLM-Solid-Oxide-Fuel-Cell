1,4917,"To ascertain the function and principles of anode active layer (AAL) for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs), a thorough inquiry of the optimum Ni cermet in typical NiO-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (NBZCY) AAL is managed.",The principles for rationally designing H-SOFC anode active layer,10.1016/j.materresbull.2022.111769
2,4917,"Both the power and polarization enhance with increasing NiO from 40 to 65 wt.% (NBZCY65-35), possessing the optimal performance with the polarization resistance of 0.039 Omega cm(2) and power output of 983 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C.",The principles for rationally designing H-SOFC anode active layer,10.1016/j.materresbull.2022.111769
3,4917,This derives from the sufficient porosity and maximum triple phase boundaries for 1:1 vol of Ni and BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta after anode reduction.,The principles for rationally designing H-SOFC anode active layer,10.1016/j.materresbull.2022.111769
4,4917,"In contrast, the remarkably performance degradation for NBZCY70-30 AAL could be attributed to the inadequate proton transmission.",The principles for rationally designing H-SOFC anode active layer,10.1016/j.materresbull.2022.111769
5,4917,"In short, the deficient metal catalyst in NBZCY (NiO <= 60 wt.%) could not provide enough electrocatalysis, while the insufficient BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta in NBZCY70-30 limits the proton transfer.",The principles for rationally designing H-SOFC anode active layer,10.1016/j.materresbull.2022.111769
6,4917,The principles could give a guidance for designing high active electrodes in electrocatalytic fields.,The principles for rationally designing H-SOFC anode active layer,10.1016/j.materresbull.2022.111769
