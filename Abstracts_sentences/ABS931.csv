1,931,"The perovskite-type mixed oxide La0.3Sr0.55Ti0.95Ni0.05O3-delta (LSTN) is demonstrated to exhibit the remarkable property of structural regeneration, where Ni can be reversibly exsoluted from the host perovskite lattice resulting in a regenerable Ni catalyst for solid oxide fuel cell anode applications.",Sulfur Poisoning Recovery on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Material through Reversible Segregation of Nickel,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03669
2,931,"Results of catalytic tests for the water gas shift reaction and electrochemical investigations on a button sized fuel cell demonstrate the redox stability of LSTN, its potential application in solid oxide fuel cells, and its ability to recover catalytic activity completely after sulfur poisoning: Nickel segregation was characterized and quantified on powder samples by means of electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction-reoxidation cycles.",Sulfur Poisoning Recovery on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Material through Reversible Segregation of Nickel,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03669
3,931,Catalyst stability was much improved compared to impregnated Ni/La0.3Sr0.55TiO3-delta and Ni/Y0.08Zr0.92O2 anode materials.,Sulfur Poisoning Recovery on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Material through Reversible Segregation of Nickel,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03669
4,931,"A full cell was tested under both open circuit voltage and polarized conditions, showing a stable cell voltage over redox cycles as well as periods of reverse potential and current overload.",Sulfur Poisoning Recovery on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Material through Reversible Segregation of Nickel,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03669
5,931,The area-specific resistance of the anode layer was as low as 0.58 Omega cm(2) at 850 degrees C.,Sulfur Poisoning Recovery on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Material through Reversible Segregation of Nickel,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03669
6,931,This allows LSTN to be applied in redox-stable solid oxide fuel cell anodes and reversible segregation of Ni to be exploited for fast recovery from sulfur poisoning.,Sulfur Poisoning Recovery on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Material through Reversible Segregation of Nickel,10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03669
