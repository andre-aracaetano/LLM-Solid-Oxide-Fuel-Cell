1,1942,The electrochemical performance of two infiltrated SOFCs (solid oxide fuel cells) and the redox cycling tolerance of such cells are presented.,Development of Redox Resistant Fully Infiltrated Tubular SOFCs,10.1149/2.022404jes
2,1942,NiO-SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9) was infiltrated into a porous 8YSZ (8 mol% Y2O3) support to form the anode of the infiltrated cells and LSM (La(0.80)Sr(0.20)MuO(3)) or Nd-nickelate (Nd2NiO4) was infiltrated into a thin porous YSZ layer to form the cathode.,Development of Redox Resistant Fully Infiltrated Tubular SOFCs,10.1149/2.022404jes
3,1942,The power density of the Nd-nickelate infiltrated cell is higher than that of the LSM infiltrated cell suggesting it as a suitable cathode for intermediate temperature applications.,Development of Redox Resistant Fully Infiltrated Tubular SOFCs,10.1149/2.022404jes
4,1942,The microstructure of these infiltrated solid oxide fuel cells shows a reasonable distribution of fine particles (50-100 nm) near the interface of electrodes and electrolyte and within the bulk electrodes.,Development of Redox Resistant Fully Infiltrated Tubular SOFCs,10.1149/2.022404jes
5,1942,"Despite having much lower Ni content than conventional anode supported cells, the infiltrated fuel cells exhibit a reasonable power density at low temperatures and an excellent robustness against redox cycling when air is used as the anode oxidant.",Development of Redox Resistant Fully Infiltrated Tubular SOFCs,10.1149/2.022404jes
