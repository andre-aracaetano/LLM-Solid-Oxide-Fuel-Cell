3,7647,An equivalent circuit describing the cathode polarization resistances was constructed from analyzing impedance spectra recorded at different temperatures in oxygen.,Electrochemical characterization of La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3 cathode on Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 electrolyte for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.032
4,7647,"A competitive electrode polarization resistance is reported for this oxygen electrode using a Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 electrolyte, determined by impedance spectroscopy studies of symmetrical cells sintered at 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of the symmetrical cells revealed the absence of any reaction layer between cathode and electrolyte, and a porous electrode microstructure even when sintered at a temperature of only 800 degrees C.",Electrochemical characterization of La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3 cathode on Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 electrolyte for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.032
