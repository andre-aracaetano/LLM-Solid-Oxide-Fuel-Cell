6,21130,This has not been possible to date as the number of possible defect topologies is very large and to perform reliable total energy calculations for all of them would be prohibitively expensive.,Chemical Descriptors of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia at Low Defect Concentration: An ab Initio Study,10.1021/acs.jpca.5b02031

9,21130,"Through analysis of energetics computed using the best available Born-Mayer-Huggins empirical potential model, a point charge model, DFT, and a local strain energy estimated in the harmonic approximation, the main chemical and physical descriptors that correlate to the low-energy DFT structures are discussed.",Chemical Descriptors of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia at Low Defect Concentration: An ab Initio Study,10.1021/acs.jpca.5b02031
10,21130,It is found that the empirical potential model reproduces a general trend of increasing DFT energetics across a series of locally strain relaxed structures but is unreliable both in predicting some incorrect low-energy structures and in finding some metastable structures to be unstable.,Chemical Descriptors of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia at Low Defect Concentration: An ab Initio Study,10.1021/acs.jpca.5b02031
