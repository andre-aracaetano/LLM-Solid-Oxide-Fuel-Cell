1,19873,Fluorescence yield (FY) X-ray absorption spectroscopic experiments with a grazing-exit geometry for detection of emitted fluorescence were carried out.,"Nondestructive depth-resolved chemical state analysis of (La,Sr) MnO3 film under high temperature",10.1002/sia.3584
2,19873,The observed XAFS spectra provide the information about depth-resolved chemical state in the surface layer of film materials through the take-off angle dependence of the escape depth of the fluorescent X-ray emitted from the sample.,"Nondestructive depth-resolved chemical state analysis of (La,Sr) MnO3 film under high temperature",10.1002/sia.3584
3,19873,"For La1-xSrxMnO3 films which are the oxygen electrode materials of a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC), the Mn K XANES spectra were measured using undulator radiation at BL37XU in SPring-8 synchrotron radiation facility.","Nondestructive depth-resolved chemical state analysis of (La,Sr) MnO3 film under high temperature",10.1002/sia.3584
4,19873,"The results of the conventional FY-XAS indicated differences due to distortion of MnO6 caused by different temperature, oxygen partial pressure p(O-2) and voltage loading conditions in the spectrum profiles.","Nondestructive depth-resolved chemical state analysis of (La,Sr) MnO3 film under high temperature",10.1002/sia.3584
5,19873,"From the results of the angle-resolved measurements at 973 K in air, a depth-dependent variation of the Mn K XANES profile in surface region of the film was observed.","Nondestructive depth-resolved chemical state analysis of (La,Sr) MnO3 film under high temperature",10.1002/sia.3584
6,19873,"Though such depth-dependence was also measured in case of lower p(O-2) or voltage loading conditions at the same temperature, the absorbance proportion of absorbing bands contributing the change was different among the split 1s -> 4p transition bands.","Nondestructive depth-resolved chemical state analysis of (La,Sr) MnO3 film under high temperature",10.1002/sia.3584
7,19873,These results indicate a difference in surface region caused by a difference between the surface and the inside of the film in the chemical potential of oxygen.,"Nondestructive depth-resolved chemical state analysis of (La,Sr) MnO3 film under high temperature",10.1002/sia.3584
