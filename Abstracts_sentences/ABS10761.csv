1,10761,"In this work, we show that higher Co or Mn dopant content of up to 25 mol% on Pd can be obtained without modifying the original crystal structure of Pd via co-reduction synthesis route using hydrazine (N2H4), which is not achievable via conventional sol-gel route.",Electroless deposition of Co(Mn)/Pd-decorator into Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 scaffold as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.084
2,10761,The synthesized Co/Mn-doped Pd alloys can inhibit Pd agglomeration that hinders Pd use as an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) promoter on solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode.,Electroless deposition of Co(Mn)/Pd-decorator into Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 scaffold as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.084
3,10761,The presence of Co or Mn on Pd lattice of Co/Mn-doped Pd alloy-decorated YSZ (Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2) cathode provides dual advantages of improving the ORR performance of the cathode and enhancing the ORR performance stability during long term operation.,Electroless deposition of Co(Mn)/Pd-decorator into Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 scaffold as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.084
4,10761,"Between 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C, Pd0.90Co0.10O-impregnated YSZ cathode displayed the highest ORR performance among PdO-, Pd0.90Co0.10O-, Pd0.75Co0.025O-, Pd0.90Mn0.10O-, and Pd0.75Mn0.25O-impregnated cathodes as indicated by its relatively low area specific resistance of 0.14 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C.",Electroless deposition of Co(Mn)/Pd-decorator into Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 scaffold as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.084
5,10761,Our thermal gravimetric analyses and scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the high electrochemical performance stability of Co/Mn-doped Pd alloys during 30 hour cathodic current test correlates with their higher metal <-> metal oxide conversion reversibility and microstructure stability under thermal cycling between room temperature and 900 degrees C (relative to Pd).,Electroless deposition of Co(Mn)/Pd-decorator into Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 scaffold as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.084
