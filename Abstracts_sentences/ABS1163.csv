1,1163,A one chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) which works in a flow of a mixture of CH4 and air has been studied in the present author's laboratory.,A One-Chamber Solid Electrolyte Fuel Cell for Chemical Cogeneration,10.1007/BF02375885
2,1163,"This new type cell consists of Pt vertical bar Solid Electrolyte vertical bar Au, in which both electrodes are exposed to the CH(4)+air mixture with a CH(4)/O(2) ratio of 2 at elevated temperatures, and it generates an electric power producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide (synthetic gas) with a H(2)/CO ratio of about 2.",A One-Chamber Solid Electrolyte Fuel Cell for Chemical Cogeneration,10.1007/BF02375885
3,1163,A large difference in catalytic activity for the partial oxidation of CH(4) between the Pt and Au electrode materials leads to an oxygen concentration cell which can generate an electric power between them.,A One-Chamber Solid Electrolyte Fuel Cell for Chemical Cogeneration,10.1007/BF02375885
4,1163,"In this paper the author describes such a one-chamber fuel cell with respect to their structural feature, performance as a fuel cell and their component materials citing the experimental results made by his laboratory's group.",A One-Chamber Solid Electrolyte Fuel Cell for Chemical Cogeneration,10.1007/BF02375885
