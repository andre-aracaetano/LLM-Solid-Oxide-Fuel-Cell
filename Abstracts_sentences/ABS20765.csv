1,20765,The surface and near-surface chemical composition of electroceramic materials often shows significant deviations from that of the bulk.,Relating surface chemistry and oxygen surface exchange in LnBaCo2O5+δ air electrodes,10.1039/c5fd00027k
2,20765,"In particular, layered materials, such as cation-ordered LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta) perovskites (Ln = lanthanide), undergo surface and subsurface restructuring due to the segregation of the divalent alkaline-earth cation.",Relating surface chemistry and oxygen surface exchange in LnBaCo2O5+δ air electrodes,10.1039/c5fd00027k
3,20765,"These processes can take place during synthesis and processing steps (e.g. deposition, sintering or annealing), as well as at temperatures relevant for the operation of these materials as air electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysers.",Relating surface chemistry and oxygen surface exchange in LnBaCo2O5+δ air electrodes,10.1039/c5fd00027k
4,20765,"Furthermore, the surface segregation in these double perovskites shows fast kinetics, starting at temperatures as low as 400 degrees C over short periods of time and leading to a decrease in the transition metal surface coverage exposed to the gas phase.",Relating surface chemistry and oxygen surface exchange in LnBaCo2O5+δ air electrodes,10.1039/c5fd00027k
5,20765,"In this work, we use a combination of stable isotope tracer labeling and surface-sensitive ion beam techniques to study the oxygen transport properties and their relationship with the surface chemistry in ordered LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta) perovskites.",Relating surface chemistry and oxygen surface exchange in LnBaCo2O5+δ air electrodes,10.1039/c5fd00027k
6,20765,Time-of-Flight Secondary-Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) combined with O-18 isotope exchange was used to determine the oxygen tracer diffusion (D*) and surface exchange (k*) coefficients.,Relating surface chemistry and oxygen surface exchange in LnBaCo2O5+δ air electrodes,10.1039/c5fd00027k
7,20765,"Furthermore, Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) was used for the analysis of the surface and near surface chemistry as it provides information from the first mono-atomic layer of the materials.",Relating surface chemistry and oxygen surface exchange in LnBaCo2O5+δ air electrodes,10.1039/c5fd00027k
8,20765,"In this way, we could relate the compositional modifications (e.g. cation segregation) taking place at the electrochemically-active surface during the exchange at high temperatures and the oxygen transport properties in double perovskite electrode materials to further our understanding of the mechanism of the surface exchange process.",Relating surface chemistry and oxygen surface exchange in LnBaCo2O5+δ air electrodes,10.1039/c5fd00027k
