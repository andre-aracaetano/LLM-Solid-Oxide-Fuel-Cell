4,12813,In this work a newly discovered creep phenomenon taking place during the reduction is reported.,Accelerated creep in solid oxide fuel cell anode supports during reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.097
5,12813,This relaxes stresses at a much higher rate (similar to x10(4)) than creep during operation.,Accelerated creep in solid oxide fuel cell anode supports during reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.097
6,12813,The phenomenon was studied both in three-point bending and uniaxial tension.,Accelerated creep in solid oxide fuel cell anode supports during reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.097
7,12813,Differences between the two measurements could be explained by newly observed stress promoted reduction.,Accelerated creep in solid oxide fuel cell anode supports during reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.097
8,12813,"Finally, samples exposed to a small tensile stress (similar to 0.004 MPa) were observed to expand during reduction, which is in contradiction to previous literature.",Accelerated creep in solid oxide fuel cell anode supports during reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.097
9,12813,These observations suggest that release of internal residual stresses between the NiO and the YSZ phases occurs during reduction.,Accelerated creep in solid oxide fuel cell anode supports during reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.097
10,12813,"The accelerated creep should practically eliminate any residual stress in the anode support in an SOFC stack, as has previously been indirectly observed.",Accelerated creep in solid oxide fuel cell anode supports during reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.097
11,12813,This phenomenon has to be taken into account both in the production of stacks and in the simulation of the stress field in a stack based on anode supported SOFCs.,Accelerated creep in solid oxide fuel cell anode supports during reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.097
