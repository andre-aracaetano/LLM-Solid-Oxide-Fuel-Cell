1,12089,"Pr0.5Sr0.5FeO3 (PSFO) and La0.25Pr0.25Sr0.5FeO3 (LPSFO) nanofibers are prepared by electrospinning followed by calcination, and their morphologies, microstructures, electronic transports, and magnetic properties are studied systematically.",Preparation of PSFO and LPSFO nanofibers by electrospinning and their electronic transport and magnetic properties,10.1088/1674-1056/ac3baa
2,12089,"The temperature-dependent resistance curves of PSFO and LPSFO nanofibers are measured in a temperature range from 300 K to 10 K. With the temperature lowering, the resistance increases gradually and then decreases sharply due to the occurrence of ferromagnetic metal phase.",Preparation of PSFO and LPSFO nanofibers by electrospinning and their electronic transport and magnetic properties,10.1088/1674-1056/ac3baa
