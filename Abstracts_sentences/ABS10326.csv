1,10326,"While double perovskites of PrBaCo2O6 (PBC) have been extensively developed as the cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs), the effects of Sr- or Ca-doping at the A site on the activity and stability of the oxygen reduction reaction are yet to be fully studied.",Visiting the roles of Sr- or Ca- doping on the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability of a perovskite cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/sus2.101
2,10326,"Here, the effect of A-site doping on the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability has been studied by evaluating the performance of both symmetrical and single cells.",Visiting the roles of Sr- or Ca- doping on the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability of a perovskite cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/sus2.101
3,10326,"It is shown that Ca-doped PBC (PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O6, PBCC) shows a slightly smaller polarization resistance (0.076 omega cm(2)) than that (0.085 omega cm(2)) of Sr-doped PBC (PrBa0.8Sr0.2Co2O6, PBSC) at 700 degrees C in wet air.",Visiting the roles of Sr- or Ca- doping on the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability of a perovskite cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/sus2.101
4,10326,"Moreover, the degradation rate of PBCC is 0.0003 omega cm(2) h(-1) (0.3% h(-1)) in 100 h, about 1/10 of that of PBSC at 700 degrees C in wet air.",Visiting the roles of Sr- or Ca- doping on the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability of a perovskite cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/sus2.101
5,10326,"In addition, it is also confirmed that single cells with PBCC cathode show higher peak power density (1.22 W cm(-2) vs. 1.08 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C) and better durability (degradation rate of 0.1% h(-1) vs. 0.13% h(-1)) than those with PBSC cathode.",Visiting the roles of Sr- or Ca- doping on the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability of a perovskite cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/sus2.101
6,10326,The distribution of relaxation time analyses suggests that the better stability of the PBCC electrode may come from the fast and stable surface oxygen exchange process in the medium frequency range of the electrochemical impedance spectrum.,Visiting the roles of Sr- or Ca- doping on the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability of a perovskite cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/sus2.101
