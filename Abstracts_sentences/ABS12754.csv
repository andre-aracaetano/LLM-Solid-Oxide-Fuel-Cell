1,12754,Ni/CeO2 mulriple coating has been fabricated on SUS 430 steel via electrodepositing approach.,Electrodeposited Ni/CeO2 mulriple coating on SUS 430 steel interconnect,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.117
2,12754,"100-h initial and 3-week long-term thermal exposing to air at 800 degrees C has enunciated that the oxide scale grown on the Ni/CeO2 coated steel contains an external oxide layer of NiFe2O4 spinel, a middle oxide layer of NiO and an internal oxide layer of Cr2O3.",Electrodeposited Ni/CeO2 mulriple coating on SUS 430 steel interconnect,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.117

4,12754,"Compared to the Ni coated steel on which the same tri-layer oxide structure without discrete CeO2 particles grows in the same exposing environment, growth rate of the internal Cr2O3 layer on the NW CeO2 coated steel has been profoundly suppressed, which subsequently lowers the oxide scale area specific resistance (ASR).",Electrodeposited Ni/CeO2 mulriple coating on SUS 430 steel interconnect,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.117
