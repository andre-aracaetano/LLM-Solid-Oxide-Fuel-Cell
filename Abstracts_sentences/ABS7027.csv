2,7027,"Exploitation of new electrolytes with excellent performance is urgently required to develop low-temperature SOFCs, operating at 300-600 degrees C. A series of composite materials consisting of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 (LSGM) and a binary eutectic carbonates (52 mol% Li2CO3:48 mol% Na2CO3) were investigated with respect to their structure, morphology and ionic conductivity.",Preparation and characterization of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85-(Li/Na)2CO3 composite electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.02.082
