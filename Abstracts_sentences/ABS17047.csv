1,17047,A cathode-side contact layer with well-matched coefficient of thermal expansion is needed to prevent cracking of solid oxide fuel cell stacks from thermal cycling during stack operations.,Highly-Conductive and Durable SOFC Cathode-Side Contact Based on Reactively-Sintered Mn-Co Spinel,10.1149/1945-7111/ad11b0
2,17047,An Mn1.25Co1.75O4 (MCO) spinel layer synthesized via reactive sintering with a metal-containing precursor was proposed as a highly conductive and durable contact material.,Highly-Conductive and Durable SOFC Cathode-Side Contact Based on Reactively-Sintered Mn-Co Spinel,10.1149/1945-7111/ad11b0
3,17047,"Compared to the interconnect/contact/cathode assemblies with the (La0.80Sr0.20)0.95MnO3-x and La(Mn0.45Co0.35Cu0.2)O3 contacts, the assembly with the MCO contact exhibited the lowest area-specific resistance at 800 degrees C (8.2 m omega center dot cm2) during 2000-h cyclic exposure and was crack-free based on the cross-sectional examination, indicative of the superiority of the spinel contact over the perovskite counterparts.",Highly-Conductive and Durable SOFC Cathode-Side Contact Based on Reactively-Sintered Mn-Co Spinel,10.1149/1945-7111/ad11b0
