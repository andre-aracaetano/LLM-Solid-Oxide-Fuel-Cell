1,5578,Metal/NiO-Smarium-doped ceria (SDC) nano-composite thin film anodes were deposited on anodic aluminum oxide by co-sputtering to enhance the in-plane current-collecting ability and investigated by varying the composition of metal materials (Pt and Au).,Investigation of Reducing In-Plane Resistance of Nickel Oxide-Samaria-Doped Ceria Anode in Thin-Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en13081989
2,5578,Full fuel cells with these nano-composites were fabricated and tested at 500 degrees C. Columnar anodes with a sponge structure were fabricated by varying the DC sputtering source power and they were thermally stable at the operating temperature.,Investigation of Reducing In-Plane Resistance of Nickel Oxide-Samaria-Doped Ceria Anode in Thin-Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en13081989
3,5578,"By adding metal material, the ohmic resistance, including the current collecting resistance, was drastically reduced and the polarization resistance also decreased.",Investigation of Reducing In-Plane Resistance of Nickel Oxide-Samaria-Doped Ceria Anode in Thin-Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en13081989
4,5578,"The nano-composite electrode with a Pt content of 61 at% showed the highest performance, which is a maximum power density of 212.5 mW/cm(2) at 500 degrees C.",Investigation of Reducing In-Plane Resistance of Nickel Oxide-Samaria-Doped Ceria Anode in Thin-Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en13081989
5,5578,"In addition, Au was considered to reduce the current collecting resistance and the corresponding power density was 3 times higher than that with the NiO-SDC anode.",Investigation of Reducing In-Plane Resistance of Nickel Oxide-Samaria-Doped Ceria Anode in Thin-Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en13081989
