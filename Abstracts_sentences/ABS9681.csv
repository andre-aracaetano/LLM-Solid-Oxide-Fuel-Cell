1,9681,"Under actual operating conditions, cathode materials of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) tend to react with CO2 and/or H2O in air, resulting in degraded performances and stabilities.",Degradation of cobalt-free Ba0.95La0.05FeO3-δ cathode against CO2-H2O and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ modification,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.086
2,9681,"Here, effects of CO2 and H2O on Ba0.95La0.05FeO3-delta (BLF) cathode are systematically discussed by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM).",Degradation of cobalt-free Ba0.95La0.05FeO3-δ cathode against CO2-H2O and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ modification,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.086
3,9681,The results show that BaCO3 can be formed at 400 degrees C in a simulated air atmosphere.,Degradation of cobalt-free Ba0.95La0.05FeO3-δ cathode against CO2-H2O and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ modification,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.086
4,9681,"The content of CO2 and H2O has a significant influence on the polarization resistance (R-p) of BLF, the R-p of BLF is 0.161 Omega.cm(2) in fresh air and 0.649 Omega.cm(2) in 3% CO2-5% H2O-92% Air at 700 degrees C, respectively.",Degradation of cobalt-free Ba0.95La0.05FeO3-δ cathode against CO2-H2O and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ modification,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.086
5,9681,But such degradation is reversible by switching working gas into fresh air again.,Degradation of cobalt-free Ba0.95La0.05FeO3-δ cathode against CO2-H2O and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ modification,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.086
6,9681,"In addition, we propose two alternative ways to improve tolerance of BLF cathode against CO2 and H2O: surface coating Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (GDC) nano -particles on BLF cathode via spray-drying method and mechanical mixing GDC with BLF cathode.",Degradation of cobalt-free Ba0.95La0.05FeO3-δ cathode against CO2-H2O and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ modification,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.086
7,9681,"Compared with mechanical mixing, surface coating method is more advantageous in lowering the R-p of BLF cathode, which keeps 0.160 Omega.cm(2) with 3% CO2-5% H2O-92% Air at 700 degrees C for 24 h.
