1,3816,Sodium silicate was used as a binder to prepare LaCePr oxides (LCP) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) thin films on a Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05Li oxide ceramic substrate for the first time.,Thin-Film Fuel Cells using a Sodium Silicate Binder with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) and LaCePr Oxides (LCP) Membranes,10.1002/ente.201700469
2,3816,"The microstructure, morphology, and electrical properties of the LSCF-LCP thin films were characterized and investigated by using XRD, SEM, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",Thin-Film Fuel Cells using a Sodium Silicate Binder with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) and LaCePr Oxides (LCP) Membranes,10.1002/ente.201700469
3,3816,The film sintered at 600 degrees C presents promising density and has been successfully applied as the electrolyte membrane for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Thin-Film Fuel Cells using a Sodium Silicate Binder with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) and LaCePr Oxides (LCP) Membranes,10.1002/ente.201700469
4,3816,Such a device achieved a respectable electrochemical performance with an open-circuit voltage of 1.04V and a maximum power output of 545mWcm(-2) at 575 degrees C. These findings suggest that sodium silicate is a suitable binder for the preparation of dense thin-film membranes for SOFCs.,Thin-Film Fuel Cells using a Sodium Silicate Binder with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) and LaCePr Oxides (LCP) Membranes,10.1002/ente.201700469
5,3816,"Moreover, the preparation technology based on sodium silicate eliminated degumming and high-temperature sintering, which resulted in greatly simplifying the preparation process of the thin-film fuel cell towards potential fuel cell commercialization.",Thin-Film Fuel Cells using a Sodium Silicate Binder with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) and LaCePr Oxides (LCP) Membranes,10.1002/ente.201700469
