1,9164,"We have conducted an electrical power generation experiment using a single cell of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 as an electrolyte at an operating temperature of 800 degrees C. A moistened 10% hydrogen/argon mixture constituted the fuel gas, and air was the oxidant gas.",Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xFex)O3-δ for a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.048
2,9164,"As cathode and anode materials, we selected (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xFex)O3-delta (x=0-0.6) and Ni, respectively.",Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xFex)O3-δ for a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.048
3,9164,The power density proved to be dependent on the Fe content of the cathode; use of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn0.6Fe0.4)O3-delta as a cathode material enabled us to reach a maximum power density of 0.58 W/cm(2).,Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xFex)O3-δ for a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.048
4,9164,An analysis of X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) taken to detect mixed valence of Mn and Fe showed that each valence was over 3.0.,Cathodic characteristics of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Mn1-xFex)O3-δ for a solid oxide fuel cell with a (Ba0.3Sr0.2La0.5)InO2.75 electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.04.048
