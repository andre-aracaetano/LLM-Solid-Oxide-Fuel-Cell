1,19181,Degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cell is probably the main problem in the field of high temperature steam electrolysis.,Microstructural and chemical changes after high temperature electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.11.230
2,19181,In this study two anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells were tested as a solid oxide electrolysis cell operating from 875 degrees C to 950 degrees C at the applied voltage of 1.5 V and 1.7 V respectively.,Microstructural and chemical changes after high temperature electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.11.230
3,19181,"Microstructural and chemical changes of the cell components were studied by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis before and after the electrolysis.",Microstructural and chemical changes after high temperature electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.11.230
4,19181,FESEM analysis shows a delamination of anode layer from the electrolyte.,Microstructural and chemical changes after high temperature electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.11.230
5,19181,"Furthermore, formation of impurities like yttrium silicate at the cathode-electrolyte interface and lanthanum zirconate (LZ) at the anode-electrolyte interface were observed after electrolysis.",Microstructural and chemical changes after high temperature electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.11.230
6,19181,It also reveals that lanthanum zicronate is formed only at the interfaces between anode functional layer La0.65Sr0.3MnO3-delta (LSM)/8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and electrolyte layer (YSZ) but not at the whole anode layer.,Microstructural and chemical changes after high temperature electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.11.230
7,19181,Formation of LZ is attributed to the high partial pressure of oxygen at the anode-electrolyte interface while yttrium silicate is formed due to the diffusion of silica from glass sealant into the cathode layer.,Microstructural and chemical changes after high temperature electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.11.230
