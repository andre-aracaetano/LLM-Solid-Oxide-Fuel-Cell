1,6194,Operating conditions in a current design for a planar geometry oxide fuel cell plant are briefly reviewed and the danger of encountering metal dusting conditions identified.,High temperature carbon corrosion in solid oxide fuel cells,10.3184/096034003782748982
2,6194,Laboratory tests were designed to produce accelerated metal dusting by exposing heat resisting alloys to a CO-26 H-2-6 H2O (vol. pct) gas mixture at 680degreesC under thermal cycling conditions.,High temperature carbon corrosion in solid oxide fuel cells,10.3184/096034003782748982
3,6194,"The hot gas composition corresponded to a(c) = 2.9 and an oxygen potential high enough to oxidise chromium and aluminium, but not iron or nickel.",High temperature carbon corrosion in solid oxide fuel cells,10.3184/096034003782748982
4,6194,"The alloys tested included ferritic and austenitic chromia formers and two ferritic alumina formers, all with electropolished surfaces.",High temperature carbon corrosion in solid oxide fuel cells,10.3184/096034003782748982
5,6194,"Thermal cycling of the chromia formers led to oxide scale damage followed by internal carburisation, metal dusting and coking.",High temperature carbon corrosion in solid oxide fuel cells,10.3184/096034003782748982
6,6194,"This failure occurred very rapidly on most austenitic materials (Alloy 800, Inconel 601, 690, 693, Alloy 602CA), but did not commence until after approximately 50 one-hour cycles for the ferritic steel Fe-27Cr-0.001Y (wt %).",High temperature carbon corrosion in solid oxide fuel cells,10.3184/096034003782748982
7,6194,"The alloy with the best performance was Inconel 625, which was still protected by its Cr2O3 scale after 500 cycles.",High temperature carbon corrosion in solid oxide fuel cells,10.3184/096034003782748982
8,6194,"The alumina forming alloys showed superior performance, with no damage apparent after 1200 cycles.",High temperature carbon corrosion in solid oxide fuel cells,10.3184/096034003782748982
9,6194,"Additional tests using ground metal surfaces showed that they were more resistant to dusting in the case of chromia formers, but more susceptible in the case of alumina formers, metal dusting.",High temperature carbon corrosion in solid oxide fuel cells,10.3184/096034003782748982
