4,18605,"Upon cooling the samples, two structural phase transitions are identified: one to a tetragonal structure with I4/mcm space group (around T-1 = 240 K), and the second one to an orthorhombic Imma phase below T-2 = 100 K. The magnetic properties have also been evaluated; the Fe substitution drives an evolution from a Pauli-paramagnetic state (x = 0) to a weak ferromagnetic state combined with antiferromagnetic interactions; the susceptibility and the saturation magnetization increases monotonically with increasing the Fe-doping content.",Neutron diffraction and magnetic study of the low-temperature transitions in SrMo1-xFexO3-δ,10.1016/j.materresbull.2012.06.011
