1,5445,"Porous Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) samples were synthesized by preparing NiO/YSZ composites by tape casting and calcining at 1800 K, reducing the NiO to nickel in H-2 at 973 K, and finally leaching the nickel out of the structure with 2.2M HNO3 at 353 K. Porous YSZ was prepared from NiO/YSZ composites containing 0, 20,40, and 50 wt%",Fabrication of highly porous yttria-stabilized zirconia by acid leaching nickel from a nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2002.tb00299.x
