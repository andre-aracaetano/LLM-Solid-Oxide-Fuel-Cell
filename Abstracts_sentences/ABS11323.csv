3,11323,"In this work, the ionic conductor Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) was modified by insulator Al2O3 to enhance ion conduction and apply as electrolytes for the SOFC.",Advances in novel SDC@Al2O3 core-shell electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/jace.18339
4,11323,The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization clearly clarified that a thin Al2O3 layer in the amorphous state coated on SDC to form the SDC@Al2O3 core-shell structure.,Advances in novel SDC@Al2O3 core-shell electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/jace.18339
5,11323,"The SDC@Al2O3 electrolyte with the core-shell structure possesses a super ionic conductivity of 0.096 S cm(-1) and results in advanced cell performance of 1190 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the SDC@Al2O3 core-shell structure significantly improved in comparison with pure SDC, the newly produced oxygen vacancies can promote the oxygen ion transport.",Advances in novel SDC@Al2O3 core-shell electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/jace.18339
