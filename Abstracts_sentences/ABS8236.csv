1,8236,A bi-layered composite cathode of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM)-YSZ and LSM-La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 (LDC) was fabricated for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with a thin YSZ electrolyte film.,A bi-layered composite cathode of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-YSZ and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.01.095
2,8236,The cell with the bi-layered composite cathode displayed better performance than the cell with the corresponding single-layered composite cathode of LSM-LDC or LSM-YSZ.,A bi-layered composite cathode of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-YSZ and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.01.095
3,8236,"At 650 degrees C, the cell with the bi-layered composite cathode gave a higher maximum power density than the cells with the single-layered LSM-LDC and LSM-YSZ composite cathodes, by 52% and 175%, respectively.",A bi-layered composite cathode of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-YSZ and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.01.095
4,8236,The impedance spectra results show that the thin LSM-YSZ interlayer not only improves the cathode/electrolyte interface but also reduces the polarization resistance of the cathode.,A bi-layered composite cathode of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-YSZ and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.01.095
5,8236,"The activation energy for oxygen reduction on the bi-layered composite cathode is much smaller than that on LSM-YSZ composite cathode, and it is suggested that the special redox property of Ce4+/Ce3+ in LDC facilitates the oxygen reduction process on the bi-layered composite cathode.",A bi-layered composite cathode of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-YSZ and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.01.095
6,8236,The cell with the bi-layered composite cathode operated quite stably during a 100 h run.,A bi-layered composite cathode of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-YSZ and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.01.095
