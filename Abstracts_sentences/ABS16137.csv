1,16137,The scandia-zirconia (ScZ) solid solutions have been attracting attention from the communities interested in solid-oxide fuel cells because they possess the highest ionic conductivity among zirconia-based materials.,Enthalpies of formation in the scandia-zirconia system,10.1111/jace.14945
2,16137,"However, this system shows a relatively large number of polymorphs with lack of thermodynamic data to enable comprehensive phase control for property optimization.",Enthalpies of formation in the scandia-zirconia system,10.1111/jace.14945
3,16137,"In this work, the enthalpy of formation of the ScZ system within the range 0-20mol% Sc2O3 is determined by combining the surface energy values with enthalpy of drop solution data obtained from high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry.",Enthalpies of formation in the scandia-zirconia system,10.1111/jace.14945
4,16137,"The heats of formation, a key data for understanding phase stability, for five polymorphs: monoclinic (m), tetragonal (t), cubic (c), and rhombohedral ( and ) are reported for the first time.",Enthalpies of formation in the scandia-zirconia system,10.1111/jace.14945
