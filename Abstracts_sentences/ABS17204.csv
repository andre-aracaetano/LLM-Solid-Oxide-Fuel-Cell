5,17204,"Upon cooling the sample, two structural phase transitions appear, the first one from the cubic structure to a tetragonal I4/mcm structure close to 240 K, and the second one to an orthorhombic Imma phase below 150 K. By DSC measurements the first phase transition was identified to happen at 243 K.
