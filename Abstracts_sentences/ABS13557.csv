1,13557,"Intermediate-stage sintering of lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM, where Sr=0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20) was shown in dilatometry studies to be accelerated when subjected to alternating flows of air and nitrogen.","Low-Temperature Densification of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (La1-xSrxMnO3+δ), x=0.0-0.20",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03082.x
2,13557,"The extent of rate enhancement decreased with increased Sr content, and decreased with increased temperature, which coincides with diminished oxygen nonstoichiometry.","Low-Temperature Densification of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (La1-xSrxMnO3+δ), x=0.0-0.20",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03082.x
3,13557,Shrinkage rates were further shown to be sensitive to the difference in oxygen content in the alternating gas flows.,"Low-Temperature Densification of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (La1-xSrxMnO3+δ), x=0.0-0.20",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03082.x
4,13557,"Baseline air sintering rates were measured using stepwise isothermal dilatometry, from which kinetic parameters were calculated using the Makipirtti-Meng model.","Low-Temperature Densification of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (La1-xSrxMnO3+δ), x=0.0-0.20",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03082.x
5,13557,"Activation energies for sintering in air were determined to be 255 +/- 26, 258 +/- 28, 308 +/- 32, 373 +/- 37, and 417 +/- 41 kJ/mol for Sr=0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20, respectively.","Low-Temperature Densification of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (La1-xSrxMnO3+δ), x=0.0-0.20",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03082.x
6,13557,A diffusion-based model is proposed that is consistent with trends in accelerated shrinkage versus temperature.,"Low-Temperature Densification of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (La1-xSrxMnO3+δ), x=0.0-0.20",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03082.x
7,13557,"Transient cation vacancy gradients, which lead to higher cation mobility, were calculated from established oxygen diffusivities and oxygen nonstoichiometry as a function of temperature and time.","Low-Temperature Densification of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (La1-xSrxMnO3+δ), x=0.0-0.20",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03082.x
8,13557,A potential application of this approach is the processing of LSM-based cathode-side contact pastes in solid oxide fuel cells.,"Low-Temperature Densification of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (La1-xSrxMnO3+δ), x=0.0-0.20",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03082.x
