4,14095,The Ni-YSZ of the anode functional layer (AFL) is transformed into Ni-BZY by heat treatment with atmospheric powder at temperature (1200 degrees C) substantially lower than the normal sintering temperature of cell fabrication.,Novel modification of anode microstructure for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.090
5,14095,"By the reaction of BaO vapor with YSZ particles in AFL, very fine BZY particles are homogeneously formed on large Ni particles and thus largely increase the triple-phase-boundaries (TPB).",Novel modification of anode microstructure for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.090
6,14095,This results in a dramatic decrease of areaspecific polarization resistance (0.21 SI cm(2) at 600 degrees C) and increase of peak power density (246 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C) compared to those values (1.19 0 cm(2) and 84 mW cm(-2)) without the novel heat treatment.,Novel modification of anode microstructure for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ electrolytes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.090
