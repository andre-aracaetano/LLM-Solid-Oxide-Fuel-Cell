2,15587,"A number of advantages come mainly from the substitution of steam with CO2, representing a potential strategy for CO2 and waste heat reuse in both carbon-intensive industry (e.g. steel) and power generation applications (e.g. dry reforming coupling to solid oxide fuel cells).",Development and validation of a Ni-based catalyst for carbon dioxide dry reforming of methane process coupled to solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.187
3,15587,"The objective of this study is the development, by means of an ultrasound assisted synthesis technique, of a novel 15%Ni -6%ZrO2 -3%CaO -Al2O3 catalyst with high surface area and metal dispersion, to achieve high values of methane conversion and stable performance, obtained by significantly limiting carbon deposition at temperature in the range 700-750 degrees C.",Development and validation of a Ni-based catalyst for carbon dioxide dry reforming of methane process coupled to solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.187
4,15587,"In this range, compatible with the dry reformer-SOFC thermal integration, conventional catalysts seriously suffer from coking tolerance issues.",Development and validation of a Ni-based catalyst for carbon dioxide dry reforming of methane process coupled to solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.187
5,15587,"The catalyst exhibited very promising results with high methane conversion rates of 93% at 750 degrees C and 1.25 CO2/CH4 ratio at the reactor inlet (dilution: in SiC 4:1 in volume), stable over 450 h of operation, with no significant changes in outlet gas composition and relevant modifications on material structure as revealed by SEM/EDX, XRD and Raman, analysis.",Development and validation of a Ni-based catalyst for carbon dioxide dry reforming of methane process coupled to solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.187
