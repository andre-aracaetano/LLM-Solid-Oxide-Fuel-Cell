6,9389,"However, increasing the Cu content over y = 0.2 induces two beneficial effects: enhancement of the electrochemical activity of the La1.7Ca0.3Ni1-yCuyO4+delta (y = 0.0; 0.2; 0.4) electrodes and decreasing the sintering temperature from 1200 degrees C to 900 degrees C. Enhanced electrode activity is due to better sintering properties of the developed materials ensuring excellent adhesion and facilitating the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface and, probably, faster oxygen exchange in Cu-rich materials.",Development of La1.7Ca0.3Ni1-yCuyO4+δ Materials for Oxygen Permeation Membranes and Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/membranes12121222
