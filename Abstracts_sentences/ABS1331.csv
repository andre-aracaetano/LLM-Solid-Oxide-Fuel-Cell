1,1331,"The impedance responses and current-overpotential characteristics were studied for oxygen reducing cathodes, stoichiometric La1-xSrxMnO3 (x = 0.16-0.20) in solid oxide fuel cells, under varying conditions of temperature (700-900 degrees C) and oxygen partial pressure (1-10(-4) atm) for two distinctly different electrode morphologies (porous and dense structure).",A study on the La1-xSrxMnO3 oxygen cathode,10.1016/0013-4686(95)00393-2
2,1331,An electrode densified at the interface with the yttria-stabilized zirconia solid electrolyte was more efficient in this study.,A study on the La1-xSrxMnO3 oxygen cathode,10.1016/0013-4686(95)00393-2
3,1331,The reaction at the finely porous LSM proceeds via the triple phase boundary and ineffectively uses the mixed conductivity property of the material.,A study on the La1-xSrxMnO3 oxygen cathode,10.1016/0013-4686(95)00393-2
