1,12269,The electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient of one self produced Ca-doped LaCrO3 interconnector plate and two commercial Ca- and Sr-doped LaCrO3 interconnector plates for solid oxide fuel cells have been studied by 4 point DC measurements from oxidizing to reducing atmospheres.,Investigation of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of Ca- and Sr-doped LaCrO3,10.1080/01411599608242400
2,12269,The microstructure was studied on both as-sintered samples and samples exposed to a CO2 rich atmosphere.,Investigation of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of Ca- and Sr-doped LaCrO3,10.1080/01411599608242400
3,12269,"The commercial Sr-doped LaCrO3 has a higher electrical conductivity than the self produced Ca-doped LaCrO3, while the latter seemed to be most resistant to CO2 rich atmosphere.",Investigation of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of Ca- and Sr-doped LaCrO3,10.1080/01411599608242400
