3,8729,"The energy for H2S adsorption at the atop site of Ni(1 11) lying parallel to the surface is predicted to be -0.55 eV, while that for the dissociative adsorption is -1.75 eV. In contrast, the formation of initial molecular complexes on a Cu surface is energetically unfavorable (E-ad similar to 0.0 eV), suggesting that Cu is more sulfur-tolerant than Ni.",A mechanistic study of H2S decomposition on Ni- and Cu-based anode surfaces in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.cplett.2006.01.059
