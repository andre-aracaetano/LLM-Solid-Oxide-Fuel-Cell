1,5681,The catalytic activity of nickel-containing composites based on scandium- and cerium-stabilized zirconia (10Sc1CeSZ) was studied in the steam reforming of butane (SRB).,Effect of the Composition of Nickel-Containing Composites Based on Scandium- and Ceriumstabilized Zirconia on Their Catalytic Properties in the Steam Reforming of Butane,10.1007/s11237-014-9372-8
2,5681,Doping of the nickel composite with 0.1 wt.% platinum leads to a decrease in the temperatures required to reach 10%-90% conversion by 60-100 A degrees C. Modification of a bimetallic nickel-copper catalyst with cerium dioxide leads to high activity in SRB in the temperature range 600-800 A degrees C characteristic for solid oxide fuel cells operating on hydrocarbon fuel.,Effect of the Composition of Nickel-Containing Composites Based on Scandium- and Ceriumstabilized Zirconia on Their Catalytic Properties in the Steam Reforming of Butane,10.1007/s11237-014-9372-8
