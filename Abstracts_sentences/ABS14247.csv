1,14247,"The incorporation of Sm0.2Ce0.8O2 (SDC) into La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) is carried out by three methods: mechanical mixing, infiltration, and dip coating.",La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes incorporated with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2 by three different methods for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.060
2,14247,The effects of SDC on the electrochemical performance of the LSCF cathodes are studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at 800 degrees C for 100 h. LSCF mechanically mixed with SDC as the cathode decreases the electrochemical performance of the half-cell; the LSCF cathode infiltrated with SDC offers faster activation and decreased resistance with thermal treatment time; and the LSCF cathode dip coated with SDC has the smallest polarization resistance.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes incorporated with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2 by three different methods for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.060
