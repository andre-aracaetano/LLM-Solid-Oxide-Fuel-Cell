6,19585,Part of this activation/passivation process is fast enough to influence the resistance of the cell during i-V measurements (over less than 1 hour) and a considerable hysteresis is observed in the cell voltage during these measurements.,Electrode activation and passivation of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes,10.1002/fuce.200500111
7,19585,Impedance spectroscopy was used to investigate the activation/passivation process.,Electrode activation and passivation of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes,10.1002/fuce.200500111
8,19585,It was found that the series resistance and the part of the polarisation impedance above approximately 100 Hz were not influenced by the activation/passivation process.,Electrode activation and passivation of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes,10.1002/fuce.200500111
9,19585,The part of the polarisation impedance between I and 100 Hz was highly influenced by the activation/passivation process and during cell polarisation this part of the polarisation impedance was up to 40% lower than at open circuit conditions.,Electrode activation and passivation of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes,10.1002/fuce.200500111
