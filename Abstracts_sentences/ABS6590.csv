3,6590,"Reactivity with YSZ revealed only small amounts of Gd2Zr2O7 formation resulting after annealing at 1000 degrees C, with higher annealing temperatures allowing dissolution of the unstable pyrochlore, into the YSZ lattice, SrZrO3 formation was noted at lower temperatures for high Go-containing compositions, with reaction occurring at higher temperatures for compositions containing even less Co, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.","Gd1-xAxCo1-yMnyO3 (A = Sr, Ca) as a cathode for the SOFC",10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00082-X
