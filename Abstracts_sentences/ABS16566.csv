4,16566,"We have found that the oxygen excess-type LSO (OE-LSO), namely La10Si6O27 on weighted basis, exhibited high conductivity, and substitution of the Si-site of LSO with some dopants (Mn+) had a positive effect toward the conducting property.",Effect of cation doping on ionic and electronic properties for lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.059
5,16566,"Furthermore, it was also found that addition of a very small amount of iron ions into the M-doped OE-LSO, La-10(Si6-yMyn+)O27-(2-0.5n)y, improved its conductivity.",Effect of cation doping on ionic and electronic properties for lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.059
6,16566,"On the other hand, replacement of the La-site with various ions for La-10(Si6-yMyn+)O27-(2-0.5n)y did little to improve conductivity.",Effect of cation doping on ionic and electronic properties for lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.059
7,16566,"The electronic transport numbers for Al-doped OE-LSO with Fe-addition, (1-alpha)(La-10(Si5.8Al0.2)O-26.9)-alpha(FeO gamma), evaluated with the Hebb-Wagner polarization method were very low: i.e., 1.1 x 10(-3) and 2.9 x 10(-3) under P(O-2)=1.1 x 10(4)",Effect of cation doping on ionic and electronic properties for lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.059

9,16566,"Conductivity for each sample was unchanged under humidified atmosphere at 1073 K sustained for over 50 h, revealing that both compositions were chemically stable.",Effect of cation doping on ionic and electronic properties for lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.059
10,16566,"It was concluded that 0.995{La-10(Si5.8Al0.2)O-26.9}-0.005(FeO gamma) is suitable for the fuel cell electrolytes because of its high and almost pure ionic conductivity, and its good chemical stability under humidified as well as reducing conditions.",Effect of cation doping on ionic and electronic properties for lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.059
