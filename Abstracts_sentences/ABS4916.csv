1,4916,"One of the features of Mitsui-type solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is that the gas separators are made of MgO/MgAl2O4 composite ceramics, onto which several LaCrO3 ceramics are joined so as to connect the cells electrically in series.",Development of gas separators for solid oxide fuel cells -: Joining of MgO/MgAl2O4 composite and LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.107.349
2,4916,"Since one of the functions of the gas separator is the separation of fuel gas and oxidant gas, the joining interface of MgO/MgAl2O4 composite and LaCrO3 must maintain gas tightness at the operating temperature over 1200 K for a long term.",Development of gas separators for solid oxide fuel cells -: Joining of MgO/MgAl2O4 composite and LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.107.349
3,4916,The authors developed a ceramic joining technique according to which a ceramics slurry is coated on the joining surfaces and then firing is performed at 1773 K.,Development of gas separators for solid oxide fuel cells -: Joining of MgO/MgAl2O4 composite and LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.107.349
4,4916,The average bending strength of the joints was 65 MPa at 1273 K.,Development of gas separators for solid oxide fuel cells -: Joining of MgO/MgAl2O4 composite and LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.107.349
5,4916,The joining interface held gas tightness against four thermal cycles from 1773 K to room temperature.,Development of gas separators for solid oxide fuel cells -: Joining of MgO/MgAl2O4 composite and LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.107.349
6,4916,The vicinity of the joining interface showed an altered quality due to the joining process.,Development of gas separators for solid oxide fuel cells -: Joining of MgO/MgAl2O4 composite and LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.107.349
7,4916,"However, the altered area was not extended and the interface held gas tightness for not less than 8000 h under the operating condition of the SOFC.",Development of gas separators for solid oxide fuel cells -: Joining of MgO/MgAl2O4 composite and LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.107.349
