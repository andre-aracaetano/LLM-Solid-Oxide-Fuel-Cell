3,15915,"According to the results, the structure of the glass with 32 % molar BaO (Ba32) predominantly consisted of Q(2) structural species.","Structure, phase formation, and wetting behavior of BaO-SiO2-B2O3 based glass-ceramics as sealants for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s11581-013-0934-x
4,15915,"In glasses with 37 and 42 % molar BaO (Ba37 and Ba42), with the substitution of SiO2 by BaO, distribution of Q(n) units widened, silicate glass network depolymerized, and concentration of Q(1) structural units increased at the expense of Q(2) units.","Structure, phase formation, and wetting behavior of BaO-SiO2-B2O3 based glass-ceramics as sealants for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s11581-013-0934-x
5,15915,"X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that in samples Ba32 and Ba37, initially, Ba3Si5O13 and Ba5Si8O21 phases were crystallized, respectively, and it seemed they acted as the sites for the subsequent growth of BaSi2O5 phase.","Structure, phase formation, and wetting behavior of BaO-SiO2-B2O3 based glass-ceramics as sealants for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s11581-013-0934-x
