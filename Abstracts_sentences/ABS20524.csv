4,20524,"It was found that properly controlling the porosity in the CFL would improve the performance of the cells using 02 in the cathode side (O-2-cells), with a maximum power density (MPD) value achieving as high as 0.58 W cm(-2) at 850 degrees C.",Fabrication and electrochemical properties of cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cells via slurry spin coating,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.12.115
5,20524,"However, this improvement is not so evident for the cells using air in the cathode side (air-cells).",Fabrication and electrochemical properties of cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cells via slurry spin coating,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.12.115
6,20524,"When increasing the porosity in the cathode-supporter, a significant increase of the power density for the air cells due to the decreasing R-conc,R-c (cathode concentration polarization to the cell resistance) can be ascertained.",Fabrication and electrochemical properties of cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cells via slurry spin coating,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.12.115
7,20524,"In terms of our analysis on various electrochemical parameters, the R-act (activation polarization to the cell resistance) is assumed to be mainly responsible for the impedance arcs measured under the OCV condition, with a negligible R-conc,R-c value being able to be detected in our impedances.",Fabrication and electrochemical properties of cathode-supported solid oxide fuel cells via slurry spin coating,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.12.115
8,20524,"In this case, a significant decreasing size of the impedance arcs due to the increasing porosity in the cathode supporter would correspond to a decrease of the R-act values, which was proved to be induced by the decreasing R-conc,R-c.
