1,12107,"Ni/Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) structure is prepared with poly(methyl methacrylate) as the template and characterized using X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, H-2 temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy.",A highly active Ni/Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode catalyst with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta14034d
2,12107,Lattice oxygen in 3DOM SDC shows a higher activity than that in hydrothermally synthesized bulk SDC.,A highly active Ni/Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode catalyst with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta14034d
3,12107,"3DOM SDC also exhibits a stronger interaction with Ni compared to bulk SDC, which facilitates the release of lattice oxygen and the formation of oxygen vacancies in SDC in a reducing atmosphere.",A highly active Ni/Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode catalyst with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta14034d
4,12107,"Therefore, Ni/3DOM SDC shows a much higher catalytic activity for electrochemical oxidation than Ni/bulk SDC as the anode material of solid oxide fuel cells.",A highly active Ni/Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode catalyst with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta14034d
5,12107,"With Ni/3DOM SDC as the anode, a cell supported by a 500 mu m-thick SDC-carbonate composite electrolyte layer exhibits maximum power densities (P-max) of 1.28 and 1.63 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C with H-2 and methanol as fuels, respectively, more than twice the P-max of a similar cell with a Ni/bulk SDC anode.",A highly active Ni/Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode catalyst with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta14034d
6,12107,The Ni/3DOM SDC anode also shows a high resistance to coking.,A highly active Ni/Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode catalyst with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta14034d
