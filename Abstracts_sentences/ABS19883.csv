2,19883,"In order to evaluate the carbon formation limits, five galvanostatic tests were performed in this work at electrolysis current densities from 1.5 to 2.25 A/cm(2) and reactant (H2O + CO2) conversion of up to 67%.",Carbon Deposition in Solid Oxide Cells during Co-Electrolysis of H2O and CO2,10.1149/2.079403jes
3,19883,Delamination and carbon nano-fibers were observed at the Ni-YSZIYSZ interface for two cells with a dense microstructure operated at electrolysis current densities of 2.0 and 2.25 A/cm(2) and a conversion of 59% and 67% respectively.,Carbon Deposition in Solid Oxide Cells during Co-Electrolysis of H2O and CO2,10.1149/2.079403jes
4,19883,"Based on the nominal gas composition, carbon formation only occurs, according to equilibrium thermodynamics, at a reactant conversion above 99%.",Carbon Deposition in Solid Oxide Cells during Co-Electrolysis of H2O and CO2,10.1149/2.079403jes
5,19883,"Therefore, the observed carbon formation is ascribed to a change in gas composition due to the diffusion limitations within the Ni-YSZ support and the active Ni-YSZ electrode.",Carbon Deposition in Solid Oxide Cells during Co-Electrolysis of H2O and CO2,10.1149/2.079403jes
6,19883,"Carbon nano-fibers were only observed close to the YSZ electrolyte, indicating a very reducing atmosphere and a large over-potential gradient in the active electrode, being highest at the interface to the bulk electrolyte and decreasing toward the Ni-YSZ support.",Carbon Deposition in Solid Oxide Cells during Co-Electrolysis of H2O and CO2,10.1149/2.079403jes
