1,14671,"Addressing the fuel distribution and endothermic cooling by the internal reforming, we have measured longitudinal current/temperature variations by Electrode-segmentation in a microtubular solid oxide fuel cell operated with syngas (50% pre-reformed methane) and equivalent H-2/N-2 (100% conversion of syngas to H-2) at three different flow rates.",Current and temperature distributions in-situ acquired by electrode-segmentation along a microtubular solid oxide fuel cell operating with syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.024
2,14671,"Regardless of the syngas flow rates, currents and temperatures show irregular fluctuations with varying amplitudes from upstream to downstream segment.",Current and temperature distributions in-situ acquired by electrode-segmentation along a microtubular solid oxide fuel cell operating with syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.024
3,14671,Analysis of the fluctuations suggests that the methane steam reforming reaction is highly affected by the H-2 partial pressure.,Current and temperature distributions in-situ acquired by electrode-segmentation along a microtubular solid oxide fuel cell operating with syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.024
4,14671,"Current-voltage curves plotted for the syngas and equivalent H-2/N-2 flow rates reveal that the fuel depletion is enhanced toward the downstream during the syngas operation, resulting in a larger performance degradation.",Current and temperature distributions in-situ acquired by electrode-segmentation along a microtubular solid oxide fuel cell operating with syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.024
5,14671,All the segments exhibit temperature drops with the syngas flow compared with the equivalent H-2/N-2 flow due to the endothermic cooling by the methane steam reforming reaction.,Current and temperature distributions in-situ acquired by electrode-segmentation along a microtubular solid oxide fuel cell operating with syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.024
6,14671,"Despite the drops, the segment temperatures remain above the furnace temperature; besides, the maximum temperature difference along the cell diminishes.",Current and temperature distributions in-situ acquired by electrode-segmentation along a microtubular solid oxide fuel cell operating with syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.024
7,14671,The MSR reaction rate does not consistently increase with the decreasing gas inlet velocity (increasing residence time on the catalyst); which we ascribe to the dominating impact of the local temperatures.,Current and temperature distributions in-situ acquired by electrode-segmentation along a microtubular solid oxide fuel cell operating with syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.024
