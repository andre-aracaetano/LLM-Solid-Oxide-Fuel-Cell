2,6259,All cells were tested at 850 degrees C with a constant current load of 15.2 A (current density of 0.22 A cm(-2) per cell) and 30% fuel utilization.,Effects of coal syngas and H2S on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells Part 2.: Stack tests,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.102
3,6259,The H2S injection immediately and significantly affected the power degradation of the stack system regardless of the carrier fuel.,Effects of coal syngas and H2S on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells Part 2.: Stack tests,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.102
4,6259,Results for the test with only H-2 and N-2 in the presence of H2S (119-120 ppm) indicated that the power decay and area-specific resistance (ASR) degradation values were lower than those for the tests where simulated syngas containing CO and increased water content was used.,Effects of coal syngas and H2S on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells Part 2.: Stack tests,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.102
5,6259,The results indicate that contact points in the stack contributed to the power degradation of the system.,Effects of coal syngas and H2S on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells Part 2.: Stack tests,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.102
