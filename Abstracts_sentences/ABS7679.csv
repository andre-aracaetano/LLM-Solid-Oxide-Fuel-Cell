3,7679,"Two types of copper cermets, CuO-YSZ-ceria and CuO-SDC(Ce(0.85)Sm(0.15)O(1,925))-ceria, are compared in terms of the anodic performance in hydrogen and propane.",Thin film solid oxide fuel cells with copper cermet anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.017
4,7679,"Maximum power densities for hydrogen and propane at 800 degrees C are 0.26 W cm(-2) and 0.17 W cm(-2) for CuO-YSZ-ceria anodes and 0.35 W cm(-2) and 0.22 W cm(-2) for CuO-SDC-ceria anodes, respectively.",Thin film solid oxide fuel cells with copper cermet anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.017
5,7679,"Electrochemical impedance analysis suggests that CuO-SDC-ceria exhibits a much lower anodic polarization resistance than CuO-YSZ-ceria, which could be explained by the intrinsic mixed oxygen ionic and electronic conductivities for SDC in the reducing atmosphere.",Thin film solid oxide fuel cells with copper cermet anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.017
