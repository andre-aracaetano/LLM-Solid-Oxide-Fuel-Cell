1,16647,"Cermets composed of nickel metal and Y(2)O(3)-ZrO(2)-TiO(2) ternary ceramics were investigated by X-ray diffraction, dilatometry, electrical and microstructural measurements and are regarded as improved anode materials with respect to long-term stability.",Structure - Property Relationships of Ni/YSZ and Ni/(YSZ+TiO2) Cermets,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<243::AID-FUCE243>3.0.CO;2-Y
2,16647,With increasing titania content it was possible to minimise the electrical and microstructural changes during long-term annealing at 1000 degrees C in reducing atmosphere.,Structure - Property Relationships of Ni/YSZ and Ni/(YSZ+TiO2) Cermets,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<243::AID-FUCE243>3.0.CO;2-Y
3,16647,Under these conditions a cermet containing a ceramic with 10 mol% TiO(2) showed a reduction in electrical conductivity of only 8% after 1000 h and a change in Ni particle size from only 1.6 to 1.8 mu m.,Structure - Property Relationships of Ni/YSZ and Ni/(YSZ+TiO2) Cermets,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<243::AID-FUCE243>3.0.CO;2-Y
4,16647,The results are explained in terms of an improved bonding strength at the interface between the ceramics and the metal due to a reduction of interfacial energy and are compared with results obtained with SOFC anode substrate materials.,Structure - Property Relationships of Ni/YSZ and Ni/(YSZ+TiO2) Cermets,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<243::AID-FUCE243>3.0.CO;2-Y
