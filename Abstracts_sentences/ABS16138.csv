3,16138,"The results indicate that the oxide scale formed on the metallic interconnect consists of a spinel (Fe, Cr, Mn)(3)O-4 or (Fe, Cr, Ni)(3)Co2O4 outer layer and a chromia (Cr2O3) inner layer.",Oxide scale formation on different metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.corsci.2012.04.014
4,16138,The Crofer 22 APU and Conicro 4023 W188 samples were determined to be more promising as metallic interconnects than SS430 due to their higher oxidation resistance.,Oxide scale formation on different metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.corsci.2012.04.014
