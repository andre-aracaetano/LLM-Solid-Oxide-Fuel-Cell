2,17898,This methane is used for generating electricity with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Density Functional Theory-Based Adsorption Studies of ClO2 and Its Decomposition Products on Defective and Metal-Doped Graphene,10.1002/pssb.202300553
3,17898,"This methane fermentation provides H2S, which reduces the efficiency of SOFCs even at a level as low as a few parts per million.",Density Functional Theory-Based Adsorption Studies of ClO2 and Its Decomposition Products on Defective and Metal-Doped Graphene,10.1002/pssb.202300553
4,17898,"It has been experimentally reported that a nitrogen (N)-doped graphene-based material known as pyridinic N removes H2S via an oxidation reaction compared with another graphene-based material known as oxidized N. To understand this experimental result, we investigated H2S adsorption on pyridinic N and oxidized N by a density functional theory analysis and further examined the activation barrier of dissociation reactions.",Density Functional Theory-Based Adsorption Studies of ClO2 and Its Decomposition Products on Defective and Metal-Doped Graphene,10.1002/pssb.202300553
5,17898,We found that the adsorption of H2S on pyridinic N is more stable than that on oxidized N.,Density Functional Theory-Based Adsorption Studies of ClO2 and Its Decomposition Products on Defective and Metal-Doped Graphene,10.1002/pssb.202300553
6,17898,"In addition, the H2S dissociation reaction occurs only on pyridinic N.",Density Functional Theory-Based Adsorption Studies of ClO2 and Its Decomposition Products on Defective and Metal-Doped Graphene,10.1002/pssb.202300553
