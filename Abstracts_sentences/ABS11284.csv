2,11284,"In this work, an interconnected microporous structure of Ni-based anode was newly fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), controlling the melting behavior of particles and stacking them up to form a high-porosity space net structure with point contacts.",Fabrication of particle-stacking porous anode for solid oxide fuel cell using laser powder bed fusion,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2023.105920
3,11284,"The results show that the YSZ sprayed powder initially behaves as nanoparticles, forming an unmanageable sub-microporous structure.",Fabrication of particle-stacking porous anode for solid oxide fuel cell using laser powder bed fusion,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2023.105920
4,11284,"After densification, however, it melts as microparticles and forms micropores distributing with a wider manageable range.",Fabrication of particle-stacking porous anode for solid oxide fuel cell using laser powder bed fusion,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2023.105920
5,11284,"In addition, densified YSZ powder forms interconnected pores with isolated islandshaped sintered particles finely distributed along the laser scanning direction at XY orientation.",Fabrication of particle-stacking porous anode for solid oxide fuel cell using laser powder bed fusion,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2023.105920
6,11284,"Due to a narrow molten pool and large sintering shrinkage generated, an overlapped area forms only at Z orientation.",Fabrication of particle-stacking porous anode for solid oxide fuel cell using laser powder bed fusion,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2023.105920
7,11284,"These overlaps can be improved by adding Ni element, behaving as a particle binder in the matrix, but this is easy to form Ni segregations and deteriorate the element homogeneity.",Fabrication of particle-stacking porous anode for solid oxide fuel cell using laser powder bed fusion,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2023.105920
