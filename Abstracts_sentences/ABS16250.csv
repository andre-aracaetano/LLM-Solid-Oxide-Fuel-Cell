2,16250,"Based on the main gas components of typical producer gases (CO, CO2, H-2, H2O, N-2, and light hydrocarbons), the expected SOFC performance will be in the range of cells that use, for example, reformed natural gas as fuel.",Equilibrium Calculations of the Composition of Trace Compounds from Biomass Gasification in the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operating Temperature Interval,10.1021/ef800828m
3,16250,"However, other minor components such as compounds of S, Cl, Na, and K may form species that degrade the SOFC fuel electrode and thus have a negative influence on SOFC performance.",Equilibrium Calculations of the Composition of Trace Compounds from Biomass Gasification in the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operating Temperature Interval,10.1021/ef800828m
4,16250,Knowledge of the composition of the minor components and the expected level of these compounds is therefore of great importance to be able to perform a detailed experimental study and thus evaluate the expected SOFC performance.,Equilibrium Calculations of the Composition of Trace Compounds from Biomass Gasification in the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operating Temperature Interval,10.1021/ef800828m
5,16250,"The present work comprises results from equilibrium calculations of the composition of biomass gasification gases from two types of biomass gasifiers, one that uses air as gasifying agent and one that uses steam, in the SOFC operating temperature interval (750-1000 degrees C).",Equilibrium Calculations of the Composition of Trace Compounds from Biomass Gasification in the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Operating Temperature Interval,10.1021/ef800828m
