2,2973,Inhibition of the cubic-rhombohedral phase transformation in both oxidation and reduction atmospheres is achieved for I I ScSZ by the addition of 2.0 mol% Mn2O3.,Phase transformation and low temperature sintering of manganese oxide and scandia co-doped zirconia,10.1016/j.matlet.2006.07.020
3,2973,"The Mn2O3 addition can lower the sintering temperature of I I ScSZ ceramics, and the 11 ScSZ-2Mn(2)O(3) compact can be sintered to nearly full density at 850 degrees C. 11 ScSZ-2Mn(2)O(3) ceramic with the cubic structure sintered at 900 degrees C possesses the conductivity of similar to 0.10 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C, which is very promising for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications.",Phase transformation and low temperature sintering of manganese oxide and scandia co-doped zirconia,10.1016/j.matlet.2006.07.020
