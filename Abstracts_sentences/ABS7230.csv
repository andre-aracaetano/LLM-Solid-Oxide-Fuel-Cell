1,7230,Developments of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT SOFCs) require novel anode materials with a high electrochemical activity at 800-1070 K.,Cellulose-precursor synthesis of nanocrystalline Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ for SOFC anodes,10.1007/s10008-004-0507-z
2,7230,"The polarization of cermet anodes, made of nickel, ceria and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and applied onto a YSZ solid electrolyte, can be significantly reduced by catalytically active ceria additions, the relative role of which increases with decreasing temperature.",Cellulose-precursor synthesis of nanocrystalline Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ for SOFC anodes,10.1007/s10008-004-0507-z
3,7230,"Further improvement is observed when using Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (CGO) having a high oxygen ionic conductivity instead of undoped ceria, owing to enlargement of the electrochemical reaction zone.",Cellulose-precursor synthesis of nanocrystalline Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ for SOFC anodes,10.1007/s10008-004-0507-z
4,7230,"Nanocrystalline CGO powders with grain sizes of 8-35 nm were thus synthesized via the cellulose-precursor technique and introduced into Ni-CGO-YSZ cermets, and tested in contact with a (La0.9Sr0.1)(0.98)Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte at 873-1073 K.",Cellulose-precursor synthesis of nanocrystalline Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ for SOFC anodes,10.1007/s10008-004-0507-z
5,7230,"The results showed that the anode performance can be enhanced by additional surface activation, in particular by impregnation with a Ce-containing solution, and also by incorporation of YSZ, which probably acts as a cermet-stabilizing component.",Cellulose-precursor synthesis of nanocrystalline Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ for SOFC anodes,10.1007/s10008-004-0507-z
6,7230,The overpotential of the surface-modified Ni-CGO (25 wt%-75 wt%) anode in a 10% H-2/90% N-2 atmosphere was approximately 110 mV at 1073 K with a current density of 200 mA/cm(2).,Cellulose-precursor synthesis of nanocrystalline Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ for SOFC anodes,10.1007/s10008-004-0507-z
