2,4829,A NiO phase was found to develop along the Ni/YSZ interfaces extending to TPBs in the operated cells.,Microstructural and chemical evolution near anode triple phase boundary in Ni/YSZ solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.10.005
3,4829,"The thickness of the NiO ribbon phase remains constant at similar to 5 nm in hydrogen for operating durations up to 540 h. When operating on synthesis gas, an increase in interphase thickness was observed from similar to 11 nm for 24 h of operation to similar to 51 nm for 550 h of operation.",Microstructural and chemical evolution near anode triple phase boundary in Ni/YSZ solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.10.005
