1,5554,"A novel (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O-3/(Gd,Ce)O2-delta (LSCM/GDC) composite electrode is developed and applied as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode for direct oxidation of methane.","High-performance (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3/(Gd,Ce)O2-δ composite anode for direct oxidation of methane",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.075
2,5554,The optimum composition of the composite anode is 33 wt.% LSCM and 67 wt.% GDC.,"High-performance (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3/(Gd,Ce)O2-δ composite anode for direct oxidation of methane",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.075
3,5554,"At an output current density of 0.5 A cm(-2), the overpotential of the anode in wet H-2 and CH4 at 850 degrees C is 0.073 and 0.248 V (i.e., an anodic resistance of 0.146 and 0.496 ohm cm(2)), respectively.","High-performance (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3/(Gd,Ce)O2-δ composite anode for direct oxidation of methane",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.075
4,5554,The oxidation of CH4 on the composite anode is primarily studied by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy under different temperatures and a dc bias.,"High-performance (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3/(Gd,Ce)O2-δ composite anode for direct oxidation of methane",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.075
5,5554,The stability of the LSCM/GDC composite anode is evaluated under different current loadings in wet CH4 at 850 degrees C for 50 h. The results show that the developed LSCM/GDC composite anode has high stability in CH4 fuel and possesses good electrochemical performance that is comparable with a Ni cermet anode.,"High-performance (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3/(Gd,Ce)O2-δ composite anode for direct oxidation of methane",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.075
