1,15807,"A 3D model is developed to describe an anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), by ANSYS/Fluent evaluating reactions including methane steam reforming (MSR)/water-gas shift (WGSR) reactions in thick anode layer and H-2-O-2/CO-O-2 electrochemical reactions in anode active layer, coupled with heat, mass species, momentum, and ion/electron charges transport processes in SOFC.",Computational fluid dynamics model development on transport phenomena coupling with reactions in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.4798789
2,15807,"The predicted results indicate that electron/ion exchange appears in the very thin region in active layers (0.018 mm in anode and 0.01 mm in cathode), based on three phase boundary, operating temperature and concentration of reactants (mainly H-2).",Computational fluid dynamics model development on transport phenomena coupling with reactions in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.4798789
3,15807,Active polarization happening in active layers dominates over concentration and ohmic losses.,Computational fluid dynamics model development on transport phenomena coupling with reactions in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.4798789
4,15807,High gradient of current density exists near interface between electrode and solid conductor due to the block by gas channel.,Computational fluid dynamics model development on transport phenomena coupling with reactions in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.4798789
5,15807,It is also found the reaction rates of MSR and WGSR along main flow direction and cell thickness direction decrease due to low concentration of fuel (CH4) caused by mass consumption.,Computational fluid dynamics model development on transport phenomena coupling with reactions in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.4798789
6,15807,"With increasing operating temperature from 978 K to 1088 K, the current density and the reaction rate of MSR are increased by 10.8% and 5.4%, respectively.",Computational fluid dynamics model development on transport phenomena coupling with reactions in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.4798789

8,15807,"CO-O-2 has been considered in charge transfer reaction in anode active layer and it is found that the current density and species distributions are not sensitive, but WGSR reaction will be forced backwards to supply more CO for CO-O-2 electrochemical reaction.",Computational fluid dynamics model development on transport phenomena coupling with reactions in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1063/1.4798789
