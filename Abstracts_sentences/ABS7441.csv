1,7441,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with Sr0.8La0.2TiO3 anode-side supports, along with Ni-Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) anode, YSZ electrolyte, and LSM-YSZ (LSM=La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) cathode, were prepared.",Solid oxide fuel cell with oxide anode-side support,10.1149/1.2957602
2,7441,Button cells yielded a power density up to 1.0 W/cm(2) in humidified H-2 and air at 800 degrees C.,Solid oxide fuel cell with oxide anode-side support,10.1149/1.2957602
3,7441,The cells showed much-improved stability against coking in methane compared with conventional Ni-YSZ anode-supported SOFCs.,Solid oxide fuel cell with oxide anode-side support,10.1149/1.2957602
4,7441,A detailed model was used to fit the SOFC electrical results and to show that the good stability in methane was a result of the high O-to-C ratio in the Ni-YSZ anode due to the Sr0.8La0.2TiO3 support.,Solid oxide fuel cell with oxide anode-side support,10.1149/1.2957602
