3,18196,"Individual effect of each control factor on cell performance degradation was evaluated: chromium poisoning, air humidity and temperature were classified, in such order, as the most influencing parameters for cathode and cell degradation.",Stability of ferritic perovskite cathodes in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells under different processing and operation parameters,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.09.048
4,18196,"Unexpected high degradation rates are reported at 750 degrees C. Limited influence of the type of cathode on long-term cells behavior is observed: LSF/SDC cathodes exhibits, however, higher long-term stability.",Stability of ferritic perovskite cathodes in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells under different processing and operation parameters,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.09.048
