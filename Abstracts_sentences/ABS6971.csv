2,6971,"These cells were made of conventional materials including yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin film, a Ni + YSZ anode and a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) cathode.",Enhanced performance of a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell with an SDC-impregnated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.02.017
3,6971,Our results showed that the cell performance was greatly enhanced with the SDC-impregnated LSM cathode.,Enhanced performance of a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell with an SDC-impregnated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.02.017
4,6971,"At a furnace temperature of 750 degrees C, the maximum power density was as high as 404 mW cm(-2) for a CH4 to O-2 ratio of 2:1, which was 4.0 times higher than the cell with a pure LSM cathode (100 mW cm(-2)).",Enhanced performance of a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell with an SDC-impregnated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.02.017
5,6971,"The overall polarization resistance of the impregnated cell was 1.6 ohm cm(2), which was much smaller than that of the non-impregnated one (4.2 ohm cm2).",Enhanced performance of a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell with an SDC-impregnated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.02.017
6,6971,The impregnation introduced SDC nanoparticles greatly extended the electrochemical active zone and hence greatly improved the cell performance.,Enhanced performance of a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell with an SDC-impregnated cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.02.017
