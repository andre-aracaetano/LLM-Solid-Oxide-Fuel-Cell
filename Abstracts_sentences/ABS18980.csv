3,18980,The effect of pressurised oxygen on the area specific polarisation resistance (ASRp) of (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3-delta/8YSZ SOFC cathodes was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).,8YSZ/(La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ cathode performance at 1-3 bar oxygen pressures,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.024
4,18980,"Pellets of 8YSZ were pressed and sintered at 1350 degrees C, and screen printed layers of LSM/8YSZ cathode and LSM current collector were applied and sintered at 1300 C and 1200 C respectively.",8YSZ/(La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ cathode performance at 1-3 bar oxygen pressures,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.024
5,18980,"EIS was carried out between 1 and 3 bar oxygen at 800-1000 degrees C. One process dominated the spectra, and was identified as process C, (Jorgensen and Morgensen, 2001) 12] by comparison of measured and reference frequency maxima, the dependence of polarisation resistance on P-o2, the capacitance, and the activation energy.",8YSZ/(La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ cathode performance at 1-3 bar oxygen pressures,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.024
6,18980,It is suggested that this represents the physical process of dissociative adsorption of oxygen at the triple phase boundaries of the electrode.,8YSZ/(La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ cathode performance at 1-3 bar oxygen pressures,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.024
7,18980,"A second process, with a magnitude almost independent of P-O2, is observed, which may be process B [2], related to transport of oxygen ions in the YSZ.",8YSZ/(La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-δ cathode performance at 1-3 bar oxygen pressures,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.024
