1,4954,BaCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta(BCFN)/Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9(SDC) composite material was prepared and characterized as cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Study on BaCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ-SDC composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.025
2,4954,The X-ray diffraction result proved that there was no obvious reaction between the BCFN and SDC after calcination at 1000 degrees C for 10 h. AC impedance spectra based on La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta(LSGM) electrolyte measured at intermediate temperatures showed that a cathode with 30 wt% SDC exhibited the best electrochemical performance among the electrodes studied.,Study on BaCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ-SDC composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.025
