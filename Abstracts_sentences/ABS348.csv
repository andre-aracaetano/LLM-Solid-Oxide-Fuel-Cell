2,348,Interventions via policy instruments and business models may be required for cost reduction until the fuel cell is driven purely by market forces.,Pathways to commercialisation of biogas fuelled solid oxide fuel cells in European wastewater treatment plants,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116127
3,348,In this work a novel market potential assessment methodology is developed and applied to quantify the impact of various interventions on biogas fuelled solid oxide fuel cell cost reduction and synthesize pathways to its commercialisation.,Pathways to commercialisation of biogas fuelled solid oxide fuel cells in European wastewater treatment plants,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116127
4,348,The method is applied to 6181 plants in 27 European countries.,Pathways to commercialisation of biogas fuelled solid oxide fuel cells in European wastewater treatment plants,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116127
5,348,Results show that 71% cost reduction is required for a medium sized fuel cell to be market driven.,Pathways to commercialisation of biogas fuelled solid oxide fuel cells in European wastewater treatment plants,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116127
6,348,Existing incentives can trigger cost reduction by 13-38% but are not able to sustain it until the fuel cell is market driven.,Pathways to commercialisation of biogas fuelled solid oxide fuel cells in European wastewater treatment plants,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116127
7,348,"Innovations in business models, and incentivising business models instead of technologies can trigger and sustain cost reduction.",Pathways to commercialisation of biogas fuelled solid oxide fuel cells in European wastewater treatment plants,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116127
8,348,"Results also show that under today's high capital cost, the number of economically attractive plants required to install fuel cells are lowest when business models are incentivised compared to other interventions.",Pathways to commercialisation of biogas fuelled solid oxide fuel cells in European wastewater treatment plants,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116127
9,348,Incentivising new business models to encourage innovation in the sector has more impact that incentivising technologies.,Pathways to commercialisation of biogas fuelled solid oxide fuel cells in European wastewater treatment plants,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116127
