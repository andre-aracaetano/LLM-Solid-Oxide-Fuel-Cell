1,7103,The integrated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)/gas turbine (GT) system is an appealing power generation solution for mobile applications from energy conversion efficiency point of view.,Control of the dual mode operation of generator/motor in SOFC/GT-based APU for extended dynamic capabilities,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.170
2,7103,"The relatively poor dynamic capabilities of the SOFC/GT system, which are often the results of system characteristics and SOFC operation safety considerations, limit their widespread applications and must be enhanced to meet safe, efficient and fast load following requirements.",Control of the dual mode operation of generator/motor in SOFC/GT-based APU for extended dynamic capabilities,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.170
3,7103,"To this end, the SOFC/GT system can be augmented by an energy storage unit (e.g., battery) and a dual operating generator/motor (G/M).",Control of the dual mode operation of generator/motor in SOFC/GT-based APU for extended dynamic capabilities,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.170
4,7103,This paper focuses on investigating the G/M dual mode operation and its implications on system transient performance and battery requirements.,Control of the dual mode operation of generator/motor in SOFC/GT-based APU for extended dynamic capabilities,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.170
5,7103,Active shaft load control is achieved to manage the load transients through: (a) pre-conditioning of the generator power for load step-up transients; (b) absorbing the excessive power by motoring operation for load step-down transients.,Control of the dual mode operation of generator/motor in SOFC/GT-based APU for extended dynamic capabilities,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.170
6,7103,"By taking full advantage of the bi-directional operation of G/M, we show that better trade-offs between power tracking and thermal management can be achieved, power and energy requirements for the energy storage (battery) can be reduced, and overall system performance can be enhanced.",Control of the dual mode operation of generator/motor in SOFC/GT-based APU for extended dynamic capabilities,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.170
