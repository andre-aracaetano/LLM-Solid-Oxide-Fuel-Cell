1,17986,"Perovskite oxides obtained from Ba1-xLaxFeO3-delta (BLF) are considered beneficial materials for electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells and oxygen permeation membranes because of their high oxygen permeability, which is a criterion of oxide ion (O2-)-electronic mixed conductivity.",Evaluating the Rate-determining Steps of Oxygen Permeation in Ba0.5La0.5FeO3-? Perovskite,10.5796/electrochemistry.22-00128
