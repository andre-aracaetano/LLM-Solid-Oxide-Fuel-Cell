2,10654,The effect of the distance between two cells on the cell performance was investigated.,Effect of the Cell Distance on the Cathode in Single Chamber SOFC Short Stack,10.1149/1.3196245
3,10654,"A single cell consisted of a porous NiO/8 mol % Y(2)O(3)-stabilized ZrO(2) (YSZ) anode support, a YSZ electrolyte membrane, and a Ce(0.8)Sm(0.2)O(1.9)-impregnated La(0.7)Sr(0.3)MnO(3) cathode.",Effect of the Cell Distance on the Cathode in Single Chamber SOFC Short Stack,10.1149/1.3196245
4,10654,The experimental result demonstrated that the effect of the distance on the cathode was quite distinct when the distance (D) was equal to 2 mm.,Effect of the Cell Distance on the Cathode in Single Chamber SOFC Short Stack,10.1149/1.3196245
