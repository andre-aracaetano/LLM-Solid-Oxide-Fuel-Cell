1,17116,Recent works have shown that Suspension Plasma Spraying (SPS) allows depositing Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) dense coatings for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells provided that the powder size distribution and plasma parameters are carefully adapted.,Influence of arc instabilities on the injection in suspension plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v10.i3.50
2,17116,This paper presents a further analysis of important SPS parameters which leads to control the interaction plasma jet-suspension.,Influence of arc instabilities on the injection in suspension plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v10.i3.50
3,17116,A particular attention is paid to the treatment of liquid materials mechanically injected (suspension jet or drops) according to different working parameters such as the plasma mixture and the injection pressure.,Influence of arc instabilities on the injection in suspension plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v10.i3.50
4,17116,"Concerning the suspension injection, by observing the suspension drops injection with a fast shutter camera triggered by a defined voltage level of the plasma torch, it is shown that plasma jet fluctuations have a strong influence on drops fragmentation.",Influence of arc instabilities on the injection in suspension plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v10.i3.50
