1,14519,Numerous attempts have been made to improve the oxidation resistance and electrical conductivity of the interconnectors in solid oxide fuel cells.,Microstructure and diffusion behavior in the multilayered oxides formed on a Co-W electroplated ferritic stainless steel followed by oxidation treatment,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.04.048
2,14519,A Co-W alloy coating on ferritic stainless steel has attracted attention because the Co-W oxide layer formed by the oxidation treatment of the Co-W alloy coating has proven effective in reducing the outward diffusion of Cr and improving oxidation resistance.,Microstructure and diffusion behavior in the multilayered oxides formed on a Co-W electroplated ferritic stainless steel followed by oxidation treatment,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.04.048
3,14519,This study was designed to elucidate the diffusion behavior of elements and the barrier mechanism of the CoWO4 layer.,Microstructure and diffusion behavior in the multilayered oxides formed on a Co-W electroplated ferritic stainless steel followed by oxidation treatment,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.04.048
4,14519,"After oxidation in air at 750 degrees C, a dense, multilayered oxide formed, comprising (from the stainless steel substrate to the outer layer) Cr2O3, (Cr,Fe,Co)(3)O-4, CoWO4, (Co,Fe)(3)O-4, and CoWO4 layers.",Microstructure and diffusion behavior in the multilayered oxides formed on a Co-W electroplated ferritic stainless steel followed by oxidation treatment,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.04.048
5,14519,"The CoWO4 layer and neighboring oxide layers were carefully analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy with electron energy-loss spectroscopy, confirming the absence of trivalent cations (Co3+, Fe3+, and Cr3+) and the presence of Fe2+ ions in the CoWO4 layer; thus, CoWO(4 )functions as a selective diffusion barrier to trivalent cations, as hypothesized.",Microstructure and diffusion behavior in the multilayered oxides formed on a Co-W electroplated ferritic stainless steel followed by oxidation treatment,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.04.048
6,14519,"The Cr-containing oxide layer grows based on the reaction between the metallic cations from the substrate and the inward-diffusing oxide ions, whereas Fe and Co can diffuse outward through CoWO4 as Fe2+ and Co2+ ions.",Microstructure and diffusion behavior in the multilayered oxides formed on a Co-W electroplated ferritic stainless steel followed by oxidation treatment,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.04.048
