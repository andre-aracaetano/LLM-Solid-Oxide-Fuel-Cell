2,9026,"The structure, which receives only biogas, was formed into 15-mm pellets with only one side for detecting methane (CH4).",Analysis of Electric Signals from Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Sensors Detecting Methane Biogas,10.15376/biores.17.1.281-298
3,9026,The detection of 40% to 99.99% CH4 provided a high level of accuracy compared with 10% to 30% CH4.,Analysis of Electric Signals from Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Sensors Detecting Methane Biogas,10.15376/biores.17.1.281-298
4,9026,"The biogas (60% increased remarkably at voltage levels of 20 to 21 mV. The electrical signal from the micro-SOFC sensor corresponded to the quantity of CH4, with the chemical reaction of the dry reforming activities (NiO and Co3O4) highly catalyzed and transformed from CH4 to H2, thus generating electrons.",Analysis of Electric Signals from Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Sensors Detecting Methane Biogas,10.15376/biores.17.1.281-298
5,9026,"It was concluded that the micro-SOFC sensor is suitable for detecting methane measurements at intermediate temperatures, with the ceramic structure offering low degradation compared with metal sensors.",Analysis of Electric Signals from Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Sensors Detecting Methane Biogas,10.15376/biores.17.1.281-298
