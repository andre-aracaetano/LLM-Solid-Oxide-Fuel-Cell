1,11479,We prepared Ba substituted lanthanum silicate (La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2) and examined the effect of Ba substitution on the crystal structure and conductivity.,"Ionic conductivity of apatite-type solid electrolyte material, La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1), and its fuel cell performance",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.050
2,11479,The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results for a series of compositions showed that Ba ion can occupy the La site of an apatite structure with the composition La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1).,"Ionic conductivity of apatite-type solid electrolyte material, La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1), and its fuel cell performance",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.050
3,11479,Rietveld analysis of the synchrotron XRD profiles revealed Ba occupation in the La 4f site rather than the La 6h site and a decrease in the occupation factors of the oxide ions of the SiO4 tetrahedra.,"Ionic conductivity of apatite-type solid electrolyte material, La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1), and its fuel cell performance",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.050
4,11479,The conductivity of La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 exhibited a maximum at X=0.6 and the value was the same as that of YSZ (8 mol% Y2O3 doped ZrO2) at 750 degrees C.,"Ionic conductivity of apatite-type solid electrolyte material, La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1), and its fuel cell performance",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.050
5,11479,"On the other hand, the activation energy of about 50 kJ mol(-1) for La9.4Ba0.6Si6O26.7 was smaller than that of YSZ.","Ionic conductivity of apatite-type solid electrolyte material, La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1), and its fuel cell performance",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.050
6,11479,Thus the conductivity of La9.4Ba0.6Si6O26.7 was a higher than those of YSZ below 750 degrees C.,"Ionic conductivity of apatite-type solid electrolyte material, La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1), and its fuel cell performance",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.050
7,11479,The conductivity parallel to the c-axis which is attributed to the 2a site oxide ions migration is known to be dominant in La10Si6O27.,"Ionic conductivity of apatite-type solid electrolyte material, La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1), and its fuel cell performance",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.050
8,11479,"However, Ba substitution seems to produce oxygen vacancies and create another pathway for oxide ions perpendicular to the c-axis.","Ionic conductivity of apatite-type solid electrolyte material, La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1), and its fuel cell performance",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.050
9,11479,The increase in the pathways leads to an increase in the conductivity.,"Ionic conductivity of apatite-type solid electrolyte material, La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1), and its fuel cell performance",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.050
10,11479,We also reported the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) performance of La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 with a maximum power density of 65 mW cm(-2) using La0.9Sr0.1CoO3-delta as a cathode and NiO-SDC (Sm doped CeO2) as an anode.,"Ionic conductivity of apatite-type solid electrolyte material, La10-XBaXSi6O27-X/2 (X=0-1), and its fuel cell performance",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.050
