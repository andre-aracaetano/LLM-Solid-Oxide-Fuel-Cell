3,15425,Analysis of the dependence of conductivity on the composition at a given temperature shows that the conducting properties of composites can be described based on the percolation model.,Optimization of composite cathode based on praseodymium cuprate for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1134/S1023193515050079
4,15425,Electrocatalytic properties of composite cathodes supported on the surface of the Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) solid electrolyte using the screen printing technique were studied by the impedance spectroscopy technique in the range of oxygen partial pressures of 10(-2) to 0.21 atm at the temperatures of 500-900A degrees C. Analysis of polarization resistance (R (eta)) isotherms on the partial pressure of oxygen shows that the rate-determining steps of the oxygen reduction reaction on the cathode are dissociation of adsorbed molecular oxygen and charge transfer.,Optimization of composite cathode based on praseodymium cuprate for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1134/S1023193515050079
5,15425,It is found that the minimum of polarization resistance corresponding to 0.4 Ohm cm(2) at 700A degrees C in air is reached in the range of intermediate temperatures (500-750A degrees C) for the composition containing 33 wt % GDC.,Optimization of composite cathode based on praseodymium cuprate for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1134/S1023193515050079
