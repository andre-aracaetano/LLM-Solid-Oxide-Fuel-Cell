3,3918,The thermodynamic and environmental performances of the system are studied comprehensively to identify the effects of the key operating parameters on the system operation.,"Thermodynamic design, evaluation, and optimization of a novel quadruple generation system combined of a fuel cell, an absorption refrigeration cycle, and an electrolyzer",10.1002/er.7634
4,3918,"The results show that as fuel cell current density increases from 2000 to 8000 A/m(2); the system energy and exergy efficiencies decrease by nearly 20%, but the unit carbon dioxide emission increases by 30.38%.","Thermodynamic design, evaluation, and optimization of a novel quadruple generation system combined of a fuel cell, an absorption refrigeration cycle, and an electrolyzer",10.1002/er.7634
5,3918,"Also, the energy and exergy efficiencies are maximized, and the unit carbon dioxide emission is minimized at a specified value of fuel utilization factor.","Thermodynamic design, evaluation, and optimization of a novel quadruple generation system combined of a fuel cell, an absorption refrigeration cycle, and an electrolyzer",10.1002/er.7634
6,3918,"Additionally, increasing the steam to carbon ratio has a damaging effect on the system efficiencies but leads to higher unit carbon dioxide emission.","Thermodynamic design, evaluation, and optimization of a novel quadruple generation system combined of a fuel cell, an absorption refrigeration cycle, and an electrolyzer",10.1002/er.7634
