1,18227,La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM) with an extraordinary oxygen-ion conductivity has been extensively studied as an electrolyte material for intermediate temperature solid oxide cells (SOCs).,"High-performance, stable buffer-layer-free La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 electrolyte-supported solid oxide cell with a nanostructured nickel-based hydrogen electrode",10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.123742
2,18227,"However, the conventional hightemperature sintering process of electrodes results in detrimental reaction between LSGM and Ni-based hydrogen electrode and microstructural coarsening of the electrode.","High-performance, stable buffer-layer-free La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 electrolyte-supported solid oxide cell with a nanostructured nickel-based hydrogen electrode",10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.123742
3,18227,"Herein, a buffer-layer-free LSGM electrolyte-supported single cell with a nanostructured Ni-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) electrode is developed using a sintering-free fabrication approach.","High-performance, stable buffer-layer-free La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 electrolyte-supported solid oxide cell with a nanostructured nickel-based hydrogen electrode",10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.123742
4,18227,The cell exhibits a peak power density of 1.23 W cm-2 at 800 degrees C and an electrolysis current density of 1.85 A cm-2 at 1.5 V with excellent operating stability.,"High-performance, stable buffer-layer-free La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 electrolyte-supported solid oxide cell with a nanostructured nickel-based hydrogen electrode",10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.123742
5,18227,"The good performance and durability is owing to the synergistic effects of the elimination of elemental interdiffusion at the electrode/ electrolyte interface, polarization induced in situ formation of hetero-interfaces between Ni-GDC and LSGM, and remarkable structural stability of Ni-GDC.","High-performance, stable buffer-layer-free La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 electrolyte-supported solid oxide cell with a nanostructured nickel-based hydrogen electrode",10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.123742
6,18227,This study provides an innovative means for the development of efficient and durable buffer-layer-free LSGM-supported SOCs.,"High-performance, stable buffer-layer-free La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 electrolyte-supported solid oxide cell with a nanostructured nickel-based hydrogen electrode",10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.123742
