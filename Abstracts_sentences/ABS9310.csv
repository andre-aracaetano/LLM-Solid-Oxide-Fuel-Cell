1,9310,"Anode-supported yttria-doped barium cerate (BCY) electrolyte cells are fabricated and durability tests are conducted as a function of the current density (cell voltage sign), air flow rate, and BCY electrolyte thickness.",Effects of the Air Flow Rate and Electrolyte Thickness on the Durability of Yttria-doped Barium Cerate (BCY)-based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
2,9310,"As the air flow rate increases and the current density decreases (from negative to positive cell voltage), the cell voltage drop rate is reduced during the constant current test.",Effects of the Air Flow Rate and Electrolyte Thickness on the Durability of Yttria-doped Barium Cerate (BCY)-based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
3,9310,The thick (18 mu m) electrolyte cell exhibits relatively stable performance in comparison with the thin (10 mu m) electrolyte cell.,Effects of the Air Flow Rate and Electrolyte Thickness on the Durability of Yttria-doped Barium Cerate (BCY)-based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
4,9310,"Electrolyte/electrode delamination is not observed on the cells, even after the negative voltage operation, and this is attributed to sufficient electronic conduction inside the BCY electrolyte.",Effects of the Air Flow Rate and Electrolyte Thickness on the Durability of Yttria-doped Barium Cerate (BCY)-based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
5,9310,"Thus, the present work indicates that the durability of BCY-based cells can be improved with optimization of the air utilization and electrolyte thickness.",Effects of the Air Flow Rate and Electrolyte Thickness on the Durability of Yttria-doped Barium Cerate (BCY)-based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
