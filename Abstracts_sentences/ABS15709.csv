9,15709,"It is found that 470.6-2267 mP center dot s and 7.69-17.07 mS/cm are the appropriate values for the viscosity and conductivity, respectively, to obtain relative uniform nanofibers by applying a V-min in the range of 17-26 kV. The results in this work are expected to serve as a reference for the industrialization of LSM/LSCF nanofiber electrodes and the preparation of other SOFC nanofiber cathodes by electrospinning.",Insight into the Electrospinning Process for SOFC Cathode Nanofibers,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c00317
