1,500,A hybrid power system consists of a combination of two or more power generation technologies to make best use of their operating characteristics and to obtain efficiencies higher than that could be obtained from a single power source.,Hybrid fuel-cell strategies for clean power generation,10.1109/TIA.2005.847293
2,500,"Since fuel cells directly convert fuel and an oxidant into electricity through an electrochemical process, they produce very low emissions and have higher operating efficiencies.",Hybrid fuel-cell strategies for clean power generation,10.1109/TIA.2005.847293
3,500,"Hence, combining fuel cells with other sources, the efficiency of the combined system can be further increased or extend the duration of the available power to the load as a backup power.",Hybrid fuel-cell strategies for clean power generation,10.1109/TIA.2005.847293
4,500,"In this paper, different types of fuel-cell hybrid systems and their applications are presented.",Hybrid fuel-cell strategies for clean power generation,10.1109/TIA.2005.847293
5,500,An analysis of the combined cycle operation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-microturbine is presented.,Hybrid fuel-cell strategies for clean power generation,10.1109/TIA.2005.847293
6,500,A strategy for combining the thermophotovoltaic power generation unit and SOFC to obtain the hybrid power system that would have higher efficiency is proposed.,Hybrid fuel-cell strategies for clean power generation,10.1109/TIA.2005.847293
7,500,The hybrid operation of wind power and solar power system with proton exchange membrane fuel cell is also presented.,Hybrid fuel-cell strategies for clean power generation,10.1109/TIA.2005.847293
