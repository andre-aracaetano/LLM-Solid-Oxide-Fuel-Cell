1,14882,The poisoning effect of a sulfur-containing impurity on the electrochemical oxidation of H-2 has been studied at 1023-1273 K in a gas mixture of H-2 and H2O at the interface between a Ni-YSZ cermet electrode and a YSZ electrolyte using a complex impedance analysis and a DC polarization method.,"The poisoning effect of sulfur-containing impurity gas on a SOFC anode: Part I. Dependence on temperature, time, and impurity concentration",10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00653-6
2,14882,"The polarization resistance and the overvoltage of the electrode increased when the H2S concentration exceeded 0.05, 0.5, and 2 ppm at 1023, 1173 and 1273 K, respectively.","The poisoning effect of sulfur-containing impurity gas on a SOFC anode: Part I.

3,14882,"A large temperature dependence was observed, which insists that a high-grade desulfurization is necessary at lower operating temperatures.","The poisoning effect of sulfur-containing impurity gas on a SOFC anode: Part I.

4,14882,"The time needed for the influence of the sulfide impurity to saturate was almost independent of the sulfide concentration, and was found to be approximately 12, 9 and 4 ks at 1023, 1173 and 1273 K, respectively.","The poisoning effect of sulfur-containing impurity gas on a SOFC anode: Part I.

5,14882,"Within the present experimental conditions, the performance loss caused by the sulfur-poisoning was recoverable when the sulfur source was removed from the fuel; the time needed for the recovery was approximately 360, 90 and 4 ks at 1023, 1173 and 1273 K, respectively.","The poisoning effect of sulfur-containing impurity gas on a SOFC anode: Part I.

6,14882,The degree of sulfur-poisoning was found to depend not on the equilibrium partial pressure of S-2 but on the total sulfur content in the fuel.,"The poisoning effect of sulfur-containing impurity gas on a SOFC anode: Part I.
