2,2253,SOFC button cells were prepared through deposition of colloidal slurries onto anode supported substrates and were analyzed as a function of temperature and polarization via voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).,Characterization of electrolyte-electrode interlayers in thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.019
3,2253,It was found that the electro-catalytic activity or electrode/electrolyte interfacial areas were enhanced through the addition of these interlayers.,Characterization of electrolyte-electrode interlayers in thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.019
4,2253,This performance improvement was attributed to the introduction of a diffuse mixed conduction region associated with these interlayers.,Characterization of electrolyte-electrode interlayers in thin film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.04.019
