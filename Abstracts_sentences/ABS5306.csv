1,5306,"In order to reduce the sintering temperature of Ni-based anode-supported thin 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) elsectrolyte solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), alumina, with a weight percent of 1, 3, 5, and 7, is respectively doped into YSZ as sintering aid.",Ni-based anode-supported Al2O3-doped-Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 thin electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells with Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 buffer layer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.023
2,5306,"A pure YSZ buffer layer is introduced between the Al2O3-doped-YSZ electrolyte and Ni-YSZ anode, to prevent Al2O3 and NiO from forming non-conductive spinet NiAl2O4.",Ni-based anode-supported Al2O3-doped-Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 thin electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells with Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 buffer layer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.023
3,5306,"The experimental results show that doping proper amount of Al2O3 doping can reduce the sintering temperature of YSZ, e.g., 1 wt.% doping decreases the temperature from 1673 K to 1573 K. Anode-supported SOFCs are prepared with Al2O3-doped-YSZ electrolytes sintered at different temperatures.",Ni-based anode-supported Al2O3-doped-Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 thin electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells with Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 buffer layer,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.023
