1,4568,"Cathodic material La1.0Sr1.0FeO4+delta for an intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) was prepared via the glycine-nitrate process and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",Preparation and electrochemical properties of La1.0Sr1.0FeO4+δ as cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-008-9536-9
2,4568,XRD results showed that no reaction occurred between the La1.0Sr1.0FeO4+delta electrode and Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte at 1000 A degrees C. SEM results showed that the electrode formed good contact with the SDC electrolyte after sintering at 1000 A degrees C for 2 h. The electrochemical properties of La1.0Sr1.0FeO4+delta were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and steady state polarization measurement.,Preparation and electrochemical properties of La1.0Sr1.0FeO4+δ as cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-008-9536-9
3,4568,"At 700 A degrees C, the polarization resistance was about 3.90 Omega cm(2), and the lowest polarization overpotential was 57 mV at a current density of 55 mA cm(-2).",Preparation and electrochemical properties of La1.0Sr1.0FeO4+δ as cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-008-9536-9
