4,21007,"Vibrational Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared emission spectroscopy (FTIRES), and near-infrared thermal (NIR) imaging, along with electrochemical measurements, provide surface and gas-phase molecular-specific diagnostics with the requisite temporal, spatial, and thermal resolution to correlate in operand observations with model chemical mechanisms associated With oxidation and carbon formation on Ni-based, anode-supported cells.",Toward a Working Mechanism of Fuel Oxidation in SOFCs: In Situ Optical Studies of Simulated Biogas and Methane,10.1021/jp511304x
5,21007,This present work expands upon earlier in operand studies to folly assess the performance of commercially available Ni-YSZ anode SOFCs from 700 to 800 degrees C and to provide a more comprehensive description of the anode chemistry involved.,Toward a Working Mechanism of Fuel Oxidation in SOFCs: In Situ Optical Studies of Simulated Biogas and Methane,10.1021/jp511304x
