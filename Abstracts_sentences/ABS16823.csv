1,16823,"To determine the effect of grain boundaries and grain orientation on the electrical properties of solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes, a comparison of the in-plane and across-plane ionic conductivity of both strongly and poorly textured, columnar-grained doped ceria thin films was performed within equivalent temperature ranges (150-300 degrees C).",Comparison of the in- and across-plane ionic conductivity of highly oriented neodymium doped ceria thin films,10.1016/j.actamat.2017.12.057
2,16823,"Additionally, the in-plane conductivity of partially amorphous films, polycrystalline films with randomly oriented grains, and single crystal, epitaxial films with no grain boundaries was determined.",Comparison of the in- and across-plane ionic conductivity of highly oriented neodymium doped ceria thin films,10.1016/j.actamat.2017.12.057
3,16823,Pulsed laser deposition permitted the growth of all these types of films and the ability to grow columnar-grained doped ceria on both conducting and insulating surfaces enabled testing of the films both in-plane and across-plane.,Comparison of the in- and across-plane ionic conductivity of highly oriented neodymium doped ceria thin films,10.1016/j.actamat.2017.12.057
4,16823,"Compared to the columnar-grained samples, partially amorphous films exhibited a lower conductivity, while epitaxial doped ceria exhibited an enhancement in conductivity of 2 orders of magnitude.",Comparison of the in- and across-plane ionic conductivity of highly oriented neodymium doped ceria thin films,10.1016/j.actamat.2017.12.057
5,16823,"Between 300 and 400 degrees C, the in-plane conductivity of the strongly textured film was higher than the poorly textured one.",Comparison of the in- and across-plane ionic conductivity of highly oriented neodymium doped ceria thin films,10.1016/j.actamat.2017.12.057
6,16823,"The conductivity and activation energy in-plane and across-plane for the strongly textured film was similar (2.75 x 10(-5) S/cm, 0.70 eV vs. 5.50 x 10(-5) S/cm, 0.68 eV at 250 degrees C).",Comparison of the in- and across-plane ionic conductivity of highly oriented neodymium doped ceria thin films,10.1016/j.actamat.2017.12.057
7,16823,"In contrast, for the poorly textured films, the in-plane and across plane conductivity values differed by almost an order of magnitude (2.86 x 10(-5) S/cm, 0.55 eV vs. 1.99 x 10(-4) S/cm, 0.78 eV at 250 degrees C) suggesting that the boundaries between oriented grains were less resistive.",Comparison of the in- and across-plane ionic conductivity of highly oriented neodymium doped ceria thin films,10.1016/j.actamat.2017.12.057
8,16823,These results further strengthen the argument that grain orientation affects ionic transport through grain boundaries.,Comparison of the in- and across-plane ionic conductivity of highly oriented neodymium doped ceria thin films,10.1016/j.actamat.2017.12.057
