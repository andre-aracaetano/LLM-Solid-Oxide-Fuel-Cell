3,20181,"Here, the performance of four types of nickel-ceria-based fuel electrodes, which differ concerning layer sequence and manufacturing processes, was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at the nominal operating temperature of 600 degrees C. Electrodes produced through screen-printed GDC exhibited an acceptable polarization resistance (0.260 Omega cm2), whereas electrodes with an additional printed Ni/GDC layer demonstrated inferior performance (0.550 Omega cm2).",Ni/GDC Fuel Electrode for Low-Temperature SOFC and its Aging Behavior Under Accelerated Stress,10.1149/1945-7111/ad4917
4,20181,Electrodes formed through infiltration of GDC into the printed GDC-layer displayed unreproducible performance values ranging from 0.16 to 1.20 Omega cm2 despite similar processing.,Ni/GDC Fuel Electrode for Low-Temperature SOFC and its Aging Behavior Under Accelerated Stress,10.1149/1945-7111/ad4917
5,20181,"Conversely, electrodes with an extra layer of GDC infiltrated into the Ni-backbone exhibited good performance (0.195 Omega cm2) and stability.",Ni/GDC Fuel Electrode for Low-Temperature SOFC and its Aging Behavior Under Accelerated Stress,10.1149/1945-7111/ad4917
6,20181,Accelerated degradation tests under OCV at increased operating temperatures of 700 and 900 degrees C were performed on the sample based on a GDC infiltrated Ni-backbone that performed best among reproducible samples.,Ni/GDC Fuel Electrode for Low-Temperature SOFC and its Aging Behavior Under Accelerated Stress,10.1149/1945-7111/ad4917
