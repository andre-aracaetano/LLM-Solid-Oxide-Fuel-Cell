1,12680,"The (100-x)Nd1.8Sr0.2NiO4-delta:(x)Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (x = 00, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 vol%) composites are obtained by ball milling requisite mixture at 200 rotations per minute for 2 h under acetone followed by sintering at 1000 degrees C for 4 h. The increase in concentration of Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta in composite reduces the crystallite size of host Nd1.8Sr0.2NiO4-delta from 378 +/- 0.7 to 210 +/- 0.8 nm.",Nd1.8Sr0.2NiO4_δ:Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.052
2,12680,"The dc (electronic) conductivity of composite decreases moderately with an increase in Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta, content in composite up to 30 vol%, and it decreases abruptly, thereafter at x > 30.",Nd1.8Sr0.2NiO4_δ:Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.052
3,12680,"A minimum polarization resistance value of 0.24 Omega cm(2) (at 700 degrees C) is obtained for a (70)Nd1.8Sr0.2NiO4-delta:(30)Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta composite cathode, and this value is attributed to the optimal dispersion of Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta into Nd1.8Sr0.2CuO4-delta matrix.",Nd1.8Sr0.2NiO4_δ:Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.052
4,12680,The oxygen partial pressure dependent polarization resistance study suggests that the charge transfer and the non-charge transfer oxygen adsorption-desorption along with diffusion are the major rate limiting steps of overall oxygen reduction reaction process.,Nd1.8Sr0.2NiO4_δ:Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.052
