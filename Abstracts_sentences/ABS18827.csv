1,18827,CO2 electrolysis with solid oxide electrolytic cells (SOECs) using intermittently available renewable energy has potential applications for carbon neutrality and energy storage.,Pulsed electrolysis of carbon dioxide by large-scale solid oxide electrolytic cells for intermittent renewable energy storage,10.1002/cey2.262
2,18827,"In this study, a pulsed current strategy is used to replicate intermittent energy availability, and the stability and conversion rate of the cyclic operation by a large-scale flat-tube SOEC are studied.",Pulsed electrolysis of carbon dioxide by large-scale solid oxide electrolytic cells for intermittent renewable energy storage,10.1002/cey2.262
3,18827,One hundred cycles under pulsed current ranging from -100 to -300 mA/cm(2) with a total operating time of about 800 h were carried out.,Pulsed electrolysis of carbon dioxide by large-scale solid oxide electrolytic cells for intermittent renewable energy storage,10.1002/cey2.262
4,18827,"The results show that after 100 cycles, the cell voltage attenuates by 0.041%/cycle in the high current stage of -300 mA/cm(2), indicating that the lifetime of the cell can reach up to about 500 cycles.",Pulsed electrolysis of carbon dioxide by large-scale solid oxide electrolytic cells for intermittent renewable energy storage,10.1002/cey2.262
5,18827,"The total CO2 conversion rate reached 52%, which is close to the theoretical value of 54.3% at -300 mA/cm(2), and the calculated efficiency approached 98.2%, assuming heat recycling.",Pulsed electrolysis of carbon dioxide by large-scale solid oxide electrolytic cells for intermittent renewable energy storage,10.1002/cey2.262
6,18827,"This study illustrates the significant advantages of SOEC in efficient electrochemical energy conversion, carbon emission mitigation, and seasonal energy storage.",Pulsed electrolysis of carbon dioxide by large-scale solid oxide electrolytic cells for intermittent renewable energy storage,10.1002/cey2.262
