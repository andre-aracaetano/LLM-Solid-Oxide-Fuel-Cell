3,14395,"In this study, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF), which is one of the most active cathode materials and shows significant hydration effect suggesting possible proton conductivity, was investigated as the cathode for proton conducting IT-SOFC at temperature down to similar to 450 degrees C.",Effects of H2O and CO2 on Electrochemical Behaviors of BSCF Cathode for Proton Conducting IT-SOFC,10.1149/2.0611702jes
4,14395,"The stability and compatibility of BSCF cathode with BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb), one of the leading proton conducting electrolyte materials, were studied at intermediate temperature in various atmospheres.",Effects of H2O and CO2 on Electrochemical Behaviors of BSCF Cathode for Proton Conducting IT-SOFC,10.1149/2.0611702jes
5,14395,"In addition, experiments were carried out to understand the electrochemical behaviors of BSCF as a mixed proton, oxide ion and electron conducting cathode using BSCF/BZCYYb/BSCF symmetrical cells in simulated air containing different concentrations of water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), especially at lower temperature of similar to 450 degrees C.",Effects of H2O and CO2 on Electrochemical Behaviors of BSCF Cathode for Proton Conducting IT-SOFC,10.1149/2.0611702jes
6,14395,"The results are analyzed from the underlying oxygen electrode reaction mechanism point of view, and the direction for future research to further improve the cathode for proton conducting IT-SOFC is pointed out.",Effects of H2O and CO2 on Electrochemical Behaviors of BSCF Cathode for Proton Conducting IT-SOFC,10.1149/2.0611702jes
