1,19742,The impact of sulfur-poisoning on reforming chemistry and electrochemistry of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells is analyzed via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.,Sulfur Poisoning of Anode-Supported SOFCs under Reformate Operation,10.1002/fuce.201200180
2,19742,Different types of anode supported cells are operated in hydrogen/steam - as well as simulated reformate - (H-2+H2O+ CO+CO2+N-2) fuels containing 0.1-15ppm of H2S. A detailed analysis of impedance spectra by the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) and a subsequent complex nonlinear least squares (CLNS) fit separates the impedance changes taking place at the anode and the cathode.,Sulfur Poisoning of Anode-Supported SOFCs under Reformate Operation,10.1002/fuce.201200180
3,19742,"Two main features were detected in the DRT, a decreased reaction rate of the electrochemical hydrogen oxidation and a deactivation of the catalytic conversion of CO via the water-gas shift reaction.",Sulfur Poisoning of Anode-Supported SOFCs under Reformate Operation,10.1002/fuce.201200180
4,19742,"During the first exposure of the cell to a H2S-containing fuel, an enhanced degradation is observed.",Sulfur Poisoning of Anode-Supported SOFCs under Reformate Operation,10.1002/fuce.201200180
5,19742,The degradation rate increases several hours after H2S was added to the fuel and decreases after the poisoning is completed.,Sulfur Poisoning of Anode-Supported SOFCs under Reformate Operation,10.1002/fuce.201200180
6,19742,"The polarization resistance increased by a factor of 2-10, depending on H2S-content, fuel composition and cell type.",Sulfur Poisoning of Anode-Supported SOFCs under Reformate Operation,10.1002/fuce.201200180
7,19742,"Comparing the temporal characteristics of the polarization resistance of two different anode supported cells, it could be shown that the accumulated H2S-amount divided by the Ni-surface area inside the anode substrate and anode functional layer determine the onset of the degradation.",Sulfur Poisoning of Anode-Supported SOFCs under Reformate Operation,10.1002/fuce.201200180
