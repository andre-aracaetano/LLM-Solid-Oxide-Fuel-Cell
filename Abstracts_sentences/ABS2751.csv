1,2751,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) show high energy-conversion efficiency and thus emit less CO2 than conventional combustion engines.,Rh/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 Catalyst for Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/cctc.201801824
2,2751,"Although SOFCs can directly convert hydrocarbons such as liquefied petroleum gas, these fuels readily induce coking on the electrodes of fuel cell stacks.",Rh/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 Catalyst for Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/cctc.201801824
3,2751,"To avoid coking, hydrocarbons can be subjected to a preliminary endothermic steam-reforming step at a relatively low temperature using waste heat from the stack.",Rh/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 Catalyst for Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/cctc.201801824
4,2751,"Herein, we report that a Rh/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 catalyst exhibited higher propane-steam-reforming activity than other Rh/Ce1-xZrxO2 catalysts and Rh/gamma-Al2O3.",Rh/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 Catalyst for Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/cctc.201801824
5,2751,"Catalyst characterization revealed that Rh/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 had excellent redox property and high H2O-adsorption activity, which contributed to the activation of steam and thus enhanced the propane-steam-reforming activity of this catalyst.",Rh/Ce0.25Zr0.75O2 Catalyst for Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/cctc.201801824
