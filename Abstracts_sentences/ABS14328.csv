1,14328,This study focuses on solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) co-generation systems for commercial buildings.,Installation Potentials of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Co-generation for Commercial Buildings in Japan,
2,14328,"The objectives of this study are to investigate the potentials of SOFC installation into various commercial buildings under regional conditions, and to estimate geographical distribution of SOFC potentials over Japan.",Installation Potentials of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Co-generation for Commercial Buildings in Japan,
3,14328,An optimization model minimizing the system cost was employed to analyze optimal SOFC units for each building type corresponding to 8 climate regions of Japan.,Installation Potentials of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Co-generation for Commercial Buildings in Japan,
4,14328,The results indicate that the difference among regions is small.,Installation Potentials of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Co-generation for Commercial Buildings in Japan,
5,14328,The study estimated the potential SOFC installed in every municipal areas based on the statistics of floor areas of each building type or GIS data and optimal SOFC units derived by the model.,Installation Potentials of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Co-generation for Commercial Buildings in Japan,
6,14328,Furthermore the acceptance rate in terms of payback year was taken into account to estimate the feasible installation capacity of SOFC from the potential SOFC.,Installation Potentials of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Co-generation for Commercial Buildings in Japan,
7,14328,"Consequently the potential and the feasible installation of SOFC in whole Japan were estimated to be 16 GW and 5 GW, respectively, when the unit cost of SOFC is assumed to be 500 k & YEN;/kW. Stores have the maximum share of approximately 50-70% in terms of the capacity, followed by hospitals and hotels.",Installation Potentials of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Co-generation for Commercial Buildings in Japan,
8,14328,"It is predicted that the primary energy consumption can be decreased by 220PJ, which is 19% reduction.",Installation Potentials of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Co-generation for Commercial Buildings in Japan,
