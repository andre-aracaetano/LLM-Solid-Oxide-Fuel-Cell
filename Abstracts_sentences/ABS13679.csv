2,13679,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) has become the dominant oxygen electrode material in electrolysis and reversible operation.,Stable high current density operation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ oxygen electrodes,10.1039/c9ta04020j
3,13679,"However, LSCF has been widely reported to degrade due to Sr surface segregation.",Stable high current density operation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ oxygen electrodes,10.1039/c9ta04020j
4,13679,The present understanding is that the segregation rate and hence the degradation rate increases with increasing temperature and current density.,Stable high current density operation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ oxygen electrodes,10.1039/c9ta04020j
5,13679,Here we present a study of LSCF electrode performance and stability carried out with a series of extended life tests (1000 hours) over a range of temperatures and reversing current densities.,Stable high current density operation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ oxygen electrodes,10.1039/c9ta04020j
6,13679,"Although the results at lower temperatures (650-700 degrees C) show the expected increase in segregation-induced degradation with increasing current density, at higher temperature (750 degrees C) stability is improved and the electrodes become fully stable at the highest current density of 1.5 A cm(-2), maintaining a stable polarization resistance of 0.08 Omega cm(2).",Stable high current density operation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ oxygen electrodes,10.1039/c9ta04020j
7,13679,This unexpected result is explained by the increased electrochemical activity of LSCF at the higher temperature and a very rapid development of a stable surface segregated Sr layer.,Stable high current density operation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ oxygen electrodes,10.1039/c9ta04020j
