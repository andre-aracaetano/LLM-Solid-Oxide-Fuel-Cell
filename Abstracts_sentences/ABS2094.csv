1,2094,LSM(La(Sr)MnO3)/YSZ(Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2) composite cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) was fabricated by using the composite particle consisting of well-dispersed nano-size grains of LSM and YSZ.,Morphology control of the electrode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by using nanoparticles,10.1023/A:1017953228854
2,2094,The composite cathode had a porous structure as well as uniformly dispersed fine LSM and YSZ grains.,Morphology control of the electrode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by using nanoparticles,10.1023/A:1017953228854
3,2094,Such unique morphology of the composite cathode led high electrochemical activity at 800degreesC.,Morphology control of the electrode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by using nanoparticles,10.1023/A:1017953228854
4,2094,It suggests that the intermediate temperature (less than 800degreesC) operation of SOFCs will be achieved by using composite particles.,Morphology control of the electrode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by using nanoparticles,10.1023/A:1017953228854
