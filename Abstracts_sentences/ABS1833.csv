4,1833,"The need of reliable SOFC operations and current effort toward commercialization call for advanced monitoring technology, which constitutes one of the most important directions for SOFC research and development.",Monitoring of solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1002/apj.554
5,1833,"In this article, as an attempt toward monitoring of SOFC systems a hybrid monitoring approach is developed which formulates the fault detection problem as a linear matrix inequality (LMI).",Monitoring of solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1002/apj.554
6,1833,The formulation is then illustrated through its application to the solid oxide fuel cell and its system to handle constraints and detect faults early.,Monitoring of solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1002/apj.554
