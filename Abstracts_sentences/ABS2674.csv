4,2674,"The results show that using steam as the gasification agent yields the highest electrical efficiency (41.8%), power-to-heat ratio (4.649), and exergetic efficiency (39.1%), but the lowest fuel utilization efficiency (50.8%).",Effect of gasification agent on the performance of solid oxide fuel cell and biomass gasification systems,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.08.083
5,2674,"In addition, the exergy destruction is found to be the highest at the gasifier for the air and enriched oxygen gasification cases and the heat exchanger that supplies heat to the air entering the SOFC for the steam gasification case.",Effect of gasification agent on the performance of solid oxide fuel cell and biomass gasification systems,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.08.083
