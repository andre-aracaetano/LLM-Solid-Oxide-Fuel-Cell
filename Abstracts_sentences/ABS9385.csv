1,9385,"Solid oxide fuel cell materials calcium doped lanthanum chromite (La,Ca)CrO3 and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) are known to interact with each other, This interaction causes interruption of cosintering processes and the formation of secondary phases which degrade fuel cell performance.",Reactions at the calcium doped lanthanum chromite-yttria stabilized zirconia interface,10.1006/jssc.1996.0134
2,9385,"The present study shows by X-ray diffraction and microscopic analysis that Ca migrates via an exsolved Ca-Cr-O liquid phase emanating from (La,Ca)CrO3 and reacts with YSZ to obtain an intermediate layer of CaZrO3, The width of the CaZrO3 reaction region was found to increase with increasing Ca content in the exsolved Ca-Cr-O second phase.",Reactions at the calcium doped lanthanum chromite-yttria stabilized zirconia interface,10.1006/jssc.1996.0134
3,9385,"Calcium zirconate was observed to react with YSZ along the YSZ grain boundaries, eventually digesting YSZ grains into a CaZrO3 matrix.",Reactions at the calcium doped lanthanum chromite-yttria stabilized zirconia interface,10.1006/jssc.1996.0134
4,9385,"The results demonstrate the improbability of cosintering (La,Ca)CrO3 and YSZ in the presence of the Ca-Cr-O liquid phase and illustrate the importance of obtaining single phase (La,Ca)CrO3 to achieve compatibility with YSZ.",Reactions at the calcium doped lanthanum chromite-yttria stabilized zirconia interface,10.1006/jssc.1996.0134
