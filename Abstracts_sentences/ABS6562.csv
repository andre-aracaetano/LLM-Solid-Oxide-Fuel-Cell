2,6562,"In this work, nanosized Pr6O11 particles were introduced into PBMO backbone on both anode and cathode as synergic catalysts and to optimize the electrode reactions.",PrBaMn2O5+δ with praseodymium oxide nano-catalyst as electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.117868
3,6562,"The as-prepared electrode was investigated by X-ray diffraction, H-2-temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), O-2 temperature programmed desorption (O-2-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and the electrochemical measurements.",PrBaMn2O5+δ with praseodymium oxide nano-catalyst as electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.117868
4,6562,"After coated with Pr6O11, the cathode polarization resistance (R-p) of PBMO decreased from 0.25 to 0.016 Omega cm(2), the anode R-p reduced from 0.46 to 0.20 Omega cm(2) and the power outputs of symmetrical cells improved by similar to 75% at 800 degrees C. The TPR and TPD results indicate that the electrode catalytic activity was significantly promoted by Pr6O11.",PrBaMn2O5+δ with praseodymium oxide nano-catalyst as electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.117868
5,6562,"Furthermore, the stability tests show that PBMO with Pr6O11 is highly stable in redox conditions.",PrBaMn2O5+δ with praseodymium oxide nano-catalyst as electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.117868
