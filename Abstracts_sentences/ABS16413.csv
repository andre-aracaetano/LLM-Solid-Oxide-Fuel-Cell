1,16413,Heat-resistant ferritic alloys were investigated for use as a SOFC separator material in order to reduce the difference in thermal expansion between the electrolyte and separator.,Development of a ferritic alloy separator for a planar SOFC,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.65.574
2,16413,"The heat resistance of ferritic alloys was improved by adding a small amount of lanthanum, making it possible to use them as a SOFC separator.",Development of a ferritic alloy separator for a planar SOFC,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.65.574
3,16413,The thermal cycle characteristics were improved in a 50 mm x 50 mm single cell using this ferritic alloy in comparison with a cell using an Ni-based alloy.,Development of a ferritic alloy separator for a planar SOFC,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.65.574
4,16413,The single cell was operated for about 7000 h. Degradation of the cell performance was apparently mainly caused by gas leakage.,Development of a ferritic alloy separator for a planar SOFC,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.65.574
