2,15506,"Carbon was introduced on the surface by ion implantation, and both the carbon-implanted and unimplanted samples were subjected to oxidation at 800 degrees C for 500 h. Ion implantation produced a carbon-rich amorphous region at the top surface.",Improvement in Oxidation Resistance of Ferritic Stainless Steel by Carbon Ion Implantation,10.1149/1.3290771
