1,10297,"The oxygen nonstoichiometry, delta, of La1-xCaxCrO3-delta (x=0.1-0.3) was measured by means of thermogravimetry as a function of oxygen partial pressure, P(O-2), temperature, T, between 1073 and 1373 K, and the content of calcium, x.","Oxygen nonstoichiometry of the perovskite-type oxide la1-xCaxCrO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2, 0.3)",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.037
2,10297,"In any compositions, delta becomes larger and is getting closer to delta=x/2 with decreasing P(O-2).","Oxygen nonstoichiometry of the perovskite-type oxide la1-xCaxCrO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2, 0.3)",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.037
3,10297,"At the same P(O-2), delta of La1-xCaxCrO3-delta increases with increasing T and x. There is almost no difference in oxygen nonstoichiometry between Ca-doped lanthanum chromite and Sr-doped lanthanum chromite.","Oxygen nonstoichiometry of the perovskite-type oxide la1-xCaxCrO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2, 0.3)",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.037
4,10297,Defect chemical analysis was performed taking defect interaction into consideration.,"Oxygen nonstoichiometry of the perovskite-type oxide la1-xCaxCrO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2, 0.3)",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.037
5,10297,The nonstoichiometry curves were reproduced well by the proposed defect model and the obtained thermodynamic parameters.,"Oxygen nonstoichiometry of the perovskite-type oxide la1-xCaxCrO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2, 0.3)",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.037
6,10297,The influence of defect interaction on defect formation energy can be mainly attributed to change in interatomic potential due to defect-induced lattice expansion.,"Oxygen nonstoichiometry of the perovskite-type oxide la1-xCaxCrO3-δ (x=0.1, 0.2, 0.3)",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.037
