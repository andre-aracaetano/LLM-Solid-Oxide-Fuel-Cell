1,10961,"Effect of anode functional layer thickness on the performance of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has been investigated in the intermediate temperatures of 600-650 degrees C. Three types of cells with different thickness (0, 4, 10 micron) of nanostructured anode functional layer (AFL) consisting of Ni-ScSZ (Scandia stabilized zirconia) are prepared.",Effect of nanostructured anode functional layer thickness on the solid-oxide fuel cell performance in the intermediate temperature,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.128
2,10961,"The SOFCs consist of Ni-3YSZ (3 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia) anode tube support with the AFL, ScSZ electrolyte, and LSCF (lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite) and GDC (gadolinium doped ceria) mixture cathode.",Effect of nanostructured anode functional layer thickness on the solid-oxide fuel cell performance in the intermediate temperature,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.128
3,10961,It is shown that the performance of the cell is improved as the thickness of the anode functional layer increases.,Effect of nanostructured anode functional layer thickness on the solid-oxide fuel cell performance in the intermediate temperature,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.128
4,10961,"Power densities of the cell with 10 micron thick AFL at 600 and 650 C are shown to be 0.22 and 0.27 W/cm(2) at 0.75 V, respectively.",Effect of nanostructured anode functional layer thickness on the solid-oxide fuel cell performance in the intermediate temperature,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.128
5,10961,"According to impedance spectroscopy, improvement of both ohmic and polarization resistances has been observed by increasing the thickness of the AFL, suggesting that the AFL also acts as a better contact layer between the electrolyte and the anode support, and the effectiveness of the AFL by optimizing the thickness.",Effect of nanostructured anode functional layer thickness on the solid-oxide fuel cell performance in the intermediate temperature,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.128
