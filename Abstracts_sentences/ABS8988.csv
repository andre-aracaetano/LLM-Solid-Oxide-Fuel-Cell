1,8988,"One potential solution to the problems of energy storage and conversion is the use of reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R-PCEC), which are based on the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology and offer a flexible route to the generation of renewable fuels.",Sn-doped cobalt containing perovskite as the air electrode for highly active and durable reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells,10.26599/JAC.2024.9220836
2,8988,"However, the R-PCEC development faces a range of significant challenges, including slow oxygen reaction kinetics, inadequate durability, and poor round-trip efficiency resulting from the inadequacy of an air electrode.",Sn-doped cobalt containing perovskite as the air electrode for highly active and durable reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells,10.26599/JAC.2024.9220836
3,8988,"To address these issues, we report novel B-sites doped Pr0.5Ba0.5Co0.7Fe0.3O3-delta (PBCF) with varying amounts of Sn as the air electrode for R-PCEC to further enhance electrochemical performance at lower temperatures.",Sn-doped cobalt containing perovskite as the air electrode for highly active and durable reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells,10.26599/JAC.2024.9220836
4,8988,"At 600 degrees C, R-PCEC with an air electrode consisting of Pr0.5Ba0.5Co0.7Fe0.25Sn0.05O3+delta has achieved peak power density of 1.12 W center dot cm(-2) in the fuel cell mode and current density of 1.79 A center dot cm(-2) in the electrolysis mode at a voltage of 1.3 V. Moreover, R-PCECs have shown good stability in the electrolysis mode of 100 h. This study presents a practical method for developing durable high-performance air electrodes for R-PCECs.",Sn-doped cobalt containing perovskite as the air electrode for highly active and durable reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells,10.26599/JAC.2024.9220836
