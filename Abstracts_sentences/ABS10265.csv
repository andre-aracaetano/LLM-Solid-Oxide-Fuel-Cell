1,10265,"A series of composites with nominal compositions of BaCe0.8Sm0.2O3-delta(BCS)-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9(SDC) (20:80, 35:65, 50:50, 65:35 wt.%) are synthesized by a modified citric acid-nitrate sol-gel combustion method and evaluated as the electrolytes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 decorated with electron-blocking acceptor-doped BaCeO3 as electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.065
2,10265,The TEM results show that doped BaCeO3 decorated SDC particles are formed after calcining at 1000 degrees C for 3 h. X-ray diffraction results reveal that the composites are only composed of BaCeO3-based and SDC phases without any other impurity phases.,Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 decorated with electron-blocking acceptor-doped BaCeO3 as electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.065
3,10265,"Besides, BaCeO3-based phase is uniformly distributed in the sintered electrolytes according to EDS element mapping.",Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 decorated with electron-blocking acceptor-doped BaCeO3 as electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.065
4,10265,"The open cell voltages (OCVs) of the single cells increase gradually with increasing the proportion of BaCeO3-based phase, and are higher than those for bare SDCbased cells.",Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 decorated with electron-blocking acceptor-doped BaCeO3 as electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.065
5,10265,"Besides, the power performances of the cells are superior to SDC-based cells when BaCeO3 based phase is lower than 35 wt.%.",Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 decorated with electron-blocking acceptor-doped BaCeO3 as electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.065
6,10265,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis indicates that, in addition to blocking electronic current leakage, BaCeO3-based phase would induce higher ohmic and polarization resistance, which is detrimental to power performance.",Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 decorated with electron-blocking acceptor-doped BaCeO3 as electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.065
7,10265,Further specific effort should be focused on synthesizing uniform SDC@BCS core-shell electrolyte powders and minimizing the proportion of BCS phase towards high-performance SOFCs with high OCVs.,Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 decorated with electron-blocking acceptor-doped BaCeO3 as electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.065
