1,10570,"In the pursuit for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode materials that can operate over a wide temperature range, especially at low temperatures such as 600 degrees C, perovskite structure materials La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF), Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (BSCF), and Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (SSCF) are studied.","Perovskite-type La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3, and Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode materials and their chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.06.070
2,10570,"Their electrochemical performance is compared by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at 600 degrees C, 700 degrees C and 800 degrees C for 100 hrs through an AISI 441 interconnect/cathode/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte half-cell structure.","Perovskite-type La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3, and Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode materials and their chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.06.070
3,10570,"The BSCF cathode has the smallest polarization resistance at 600 degrees C, closely followed by the SSCF cathode; the LSCF cathode has the smallest polarization resistance working at 700 degrees C; the SSCF cathode has the smallest polarization resistance working at 800 degrees C, closely followed by the LSCF cathode.","Perovskite-type La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3, and Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode materials and their chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.06.070
4,10570,"From 600-800 degrees C, SrCrO4 phase forms on the SSCF cathodes near the interconnect while BaCrO4 phase forms on the BSCF cathodes near the interconnect.","Perovskite-type La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3, and Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode materials and their chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.06.070
5,10570,"For the LSCF cathodes, however, SrCrO4 phase is only detected at 700 degrees C and 800 degrees C. Cr species diffusion to and poisoning of the cathodes do not directly correlate with the half-cell performance.","Perovskite-type La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3, and Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode materials and their chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.06.070
6,10570,"Lattice constant, stoichiometry, particle size, Cr deposition, and working temperature are important factors to consider.","Perovskite-type La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3, and Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode materials and their chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.06.070
