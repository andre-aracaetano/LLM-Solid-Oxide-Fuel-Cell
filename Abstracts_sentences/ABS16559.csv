1,16559,"A systematic comparison of sulfur poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4, a commercially available reforming catalyst, demonstrated the heightened and rapid degradation of Ni/YSZ methane reforming activity.","A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
2,16559,Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 has nearly 15 times the hydrogen uptake capacity of Ni/YSZ which implies a difference in active nickel area.,"A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
3,16559,"Because of this difference in active nickel surface area, Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 was diluted in pure alpha-Al2O3 to achieve the same active nickel surface area as Ni/YSZ.","A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
4,16559,"The turnover frequencies (TOF) for steam methane reforming without sulfur on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 were similar, although there was some deactivation on Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 possibly as a result of coking which was observed visually.","A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
5,16559,"Sulfur deactivation on both catalysts was examined for H2S, SO2, and COS at concentrations of 1, 3, and 5 ppm.","A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
6,16559,Ni/YSZ deactivated rapidly to an activity close to zero.,"A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
7,16559,"Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 deactivated quickly in the first 20 min, but then reached a non-zero steady state activity.","A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
8,16559,The relative deactivation rates for the sulfur species examined were COS >,"A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
9,16559,"SO2 >= H2S. Reaction temperatures of 650 degrees C, 750 degrees C, and 800 degrees C were evaluated, but temperature did not strongly affect deactivation rates for either catalyst.","A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
10,16559,The overarching result of this study is that Ni/YSZ methane reforming activity is more sensitive to sulfur deactivation than a commercial reforming catalyst.,"A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
11,16559,"The effect is so strong, that the use of Ni/YSZ with any hydrocarbon fuel may require removal of sulfur to sub-ppm levels.","A comparison of H2S, SO2, and COS poisoning on Ni/YSZ and Ni/K2O-CaAl2O4 during methane steam and dry reforming",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.06.009
