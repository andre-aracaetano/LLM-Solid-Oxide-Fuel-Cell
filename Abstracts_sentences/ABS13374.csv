2,13374,The addition of Al2TiO5 to the braze alloy lowers the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the resulting composite sufficiently so as to produce joints in which the YSZ does not crack due to CTE mismatch.,A braze system for sealing metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.067
3,13374,Optimization of the reactive element (Ti) loading is discussed with regard to its effect on electrolyte conductivity.,A braze system for sealing metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.067
