5,16101,"Here we overcome these challenges of thermal stability and microstructural design by stabilizing metal nanoparticles on a scaffold of Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-(0)(SDC) films with highly porous and vertically-oriented morphology, where the oxide serves as a support, as a mixed conducting transport layer for fuel electro-oxidation reactions, and as an inherently active partner in catalysis.",Robust nanostructures with exceptionally high electrochemical reaction activity for high temperature fuel cell electrodes,10.1039/c3ee43546f
6,16101,"The SDC films are grown on single crystal YSZ electrolyte substrates by means of pulsed-laser deposition, and the metals (11 mu g cm(-2) of Pt, Ni, Co, or Pd) are subsequently applied by D. C. sputtering.",Robust nanostructures with exceptionally high electrochemical reaction activity for high temperature fuel cell electrodes,10.1039/c3ee43546f
7,16101,"The resulting structures are examined by TEM, SIMS, and electron diffraction, and metal nanoparticles are found to be stabilized on the porous SDC structure even after exposure to 650 degrees C under humidified H-2 for 100 h. A.C. impedance spectroscopy of the metal-decorated porous SDC films reveals exceptionally high electrochemical reaction activity toward hydrogen electro-oxidation, as well as, in the particular case of Pt, coking resistance when CH4 is supplied as the fuel.",Robust nanostructures with exceptionally high electrochemical reaction activity for high temperature fuel cell electrodes,10.1039/c3ee43546f
