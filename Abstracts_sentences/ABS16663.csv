2,16663,"The fuel reforming processes considered in this study are adiabatic steam reforming (ASR), partial oxidation reforming (POX), and autothermal reforming (ATR).",Design point analyses of solid oxide fuel cell-steam cycle combined system: Effects of fuel reforming and bottoming cycle steam parameters,10.1002/er.7886
3,16663,"For the bottoming cycles, subcritical (SubC), supercritical (SupC), ultrasupercritical (USC), and advanced ultrasupercritical (A-USC) steam cycles are considered.",Design point analyses of solid oxide fuel cell-steam cycle combined system: Effects of fuel reforming and bottoming cycle steam parameters,10.1002/er.7886
4,16663,"The results show that the efficiency of the ASR-combined system, which varies from 72.60% to 75.07% lower heating value (LHV) depending on the bottoming cycle, is the highest, followed by ATR (61.54%-65.65% LHV) and",Design point analyses of solid oxide fuel cell-steam cycle combined system: Effects of fuel reforming and bottoming cycle steam parameters,10.1002/er.7886

6,16663,"On the other hand, the net power produced by the combined systems for a fixed SOFC cell area is in the reverse order, POX being the highest, followed by ATR and ASR systems.",Design point analyses of solid oxide fuel cell-steam cycle combined system: Effects of fuel reforming and bottoming cycle steam parameters,10.1002/er.7886
7,16663,"Even though the efficiency of the standalone A-USC cycle is 10.25% points higher than the SubC steam cycle, the net efficiencies of the SOFC combined systems are less sensitive to the bottoming cycles, that is, 2.46% points difference between SubC and A-USC for the ASR-combined system, 5.11% points difference for the POX, and 4.11% points difference for the ATR systems.",Design point analyses of solid oxide fuel cell-steam cycle combined system: Effects of fuel reforming and bottoming cycle steam parameters,10.1002/er.7886
8,16663,Parametric studies are also conducted for the oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) and steam to carbon ratio (S/C) to investigate the suitable values in achieving the highest efficiency of the SOFC-steam cycle combined system and minimum carbon deposition in the anode of SOFC.,Design point analyses of solid oxide fuel cell-steam cycle combined system: Effects of fuel reforming and bottoming cycle steam parameters,10.1002/er.7886
