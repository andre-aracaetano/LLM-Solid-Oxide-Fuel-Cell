1,14186,"The reaction mechanism of the most commonly used anode material, Ni/ytrria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cermets, in H-2-H2O solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was investigated.",Competitive adsorption reaction mechanism of Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet anodes in H2-H2O solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1345873
2,14186,"Because the reaction mechanism for the Ni/YSZ anode in H-2 has not been conclusively determined, we investigated the detailed dependence of de polarization and interfacial conductivity of Ni/YSZ cermet anode on the partial pressure of hydrogen (PH2) Based on our experimental results, wb developed a model that links the chemical reactions on the anode with the electrical characteristics of the anode such as the de polarization and the interfacial conductivity.",Competitive adsorption reaction mechanism of Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet anodes in H2-H2O solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1345873
3,14186,"In our model, we assumed competitive adsorption equilibrium of H-2, H2O, and O on Ni surfaces at the three-phase boundary, and assumed the rate-determining step to be Langmuir-type reactions of H with O. In SOFCs with Ni/YSZ anodes, reported dependencies of the current and interfacial conductivity on p(H) and p(H2O) differ among previous studies.",Competitive adsorption reaction mechanism of Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet anodes in H2-H2O solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1345873
4,14186,Both our measured dependencies and previously published dependencies were successfully reproduced by our Langmuir reaction model.,Competitive adsorption reaction mechanism of Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet anodes in H2-H2O solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1345873
5,14186,"Furthermore, possible reasons for these different observed dependencies include the different adsorption equilibrium constants.",Competitive adsorption reaction mechanism of Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet anodes in H2-H2O solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1345873
