1,12030,"A new oxide of the Ruddlesden-Popper series in the (Eu,Sr)(n+1)(Co,Fe)(n)O3n+1 system has been isolated and structurally characterized.",Eu2SrCo1.5Fe0.5O7 a new promising Ruddlesden-Popper member as a cathode component for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ta11254a
2,12030,"X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy show that polycrystalline Eu2SrCo1.5Fe0.5O7 constitutes the n = 2 member of a homologous series, the essential feature of which is the existence of two connected Co/Fe octahedral layers with a perovskite-like structure, linked by an EuO rock-salt like layer.",Eu2SrCo1.5Fe0.5O7 a new promising Ruddlesden-Popper member as a cathode component for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ta11254a
3,12030,Random distributions of 3d-metals in the perovskite blocks and interstitial and oxygen vacancies in the rock-salt layers (anti Frenkel defects) are observed by electron microscopy.,Eu2SrCo1.5Fe0.5O7 a new promising Ruddlesden-Popper member as a cathode component for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ta11254a
