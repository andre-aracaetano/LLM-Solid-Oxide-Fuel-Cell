6,20885,"A maximum peak power density of 829, 522, and 749 mWmiddotcm(-2) was obtained for the electrochemical oxidations of H-2, CO, and syngas, respectively, and a high current density of -1.89 Amiddotcm(-2) was produced in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO at a temperature of 850 degrees C. More interestingly, no significant degradation of the electrochemical performance was observed in both operating modes, indicating that the NiFe-R.P.PSFNNb proposed in this work could be a promising candidate as a bifunctional electrode for the practical implementation of RSOCs.",A Highly Efficient Bifunctional Electrode Fashioned with In Situ Exsolved NiFe Alloys for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01360
