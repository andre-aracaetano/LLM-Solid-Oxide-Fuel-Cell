3,2165,"Herein, Pr0.5Ba0.25-xCa0.25CoO3-delta is studied to understand the roles of Ba-deficiency in tuning oxygen transport and electrochemical behaviors in the system.",A-site cation deficiency tuned oxygen transport dynamics of perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.25-xCa0.25CoO3-δ oxide for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.178
4,2165,Our findings indicate that Ba-deficiency can significantly accelerate oxygen surface exchange process and bring similar to 77% reduction of polarization resistance in this process.,A-site cation deficiency tuned oxygen transport dynamics of perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.25-xCa0.25CoO3-δ oxide for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.178
5,2165,"It is interesting to note that Ba-deficiency can slightly slow oxygen ion bulk diffusion rate and induce a minor increase of polarization resistance in the corresponding process, which associates with the inhibited oxygen vacancy mobility caused by the interactions between negatively charged Ba vacancy and positively charged oxygen vacancy.",A-site cation deficiency tuned oxygen transport dynamics of perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.25-xCa0.25CoO3-δ oxide for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.178
