2,6243,A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modeling with electrochemistry and melting/solidification solver is used to demonstrate various operating scenarios of the mPCM-SOFC stack including drastic load vari-ations such as rapid ramp-up and shutdown.,Metallic PCM-integrated solid oxide fuel cell stack for operating range extension,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115309
3,6243,Pure aluminum and copper-silicon-manganese eutectic alloy are evaluated as the potential mPCMs.,Metallic PCM-integrated solid oxide fuel cell stack for operating range extension,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115309
4,6243,"The results show that the mPCM can improve the temperature distribution of the SOFC stack and enables the use of exceptionally high air utilization of 85%, which can reduce the parasitic loss of the air blower.",Metallic PCM-integrated solid oxide fuel cell stack for operating range extension,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115309
5,6243,The mPCM can suppress the temperature variation of the stack when the load is drastically changed.,Metallic PCM-integrated solid oxide fuel cell stack for operating range extension,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115309
6,6243,"Melting of PCM can prolong the operation at peak-load by absorbing large heat generation, while solidification of PCM can sustain the stack temperature at part-load and shutdown conditions.",Metallic PCM-integrated solid oxide fuel cell stack for operating range extension,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115309
7,6243,"The mPCM can also function as the inlet gas preheater, enabling direct feeding of room-temperature fuel and air into the stack, enhancing the cooling behavior.",Metallic PCM-integrated solid oxide fuel cell stack for operating range extension,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115309
