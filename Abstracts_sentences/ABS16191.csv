1,16191,"A performance of an anode-supported tubular Ni-8YSZ/Ni-ScSZ/ScSZ/GDC/LSC cell was investigated at 650-750 degrees C by feeding model kerosene reformate gas (H-2, H2O, CO, CO2, and CH4) to a Ni-8YSZ/Ni-ScSZ anode.",Performance of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell with model kerosene reformate gas,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.09.004
