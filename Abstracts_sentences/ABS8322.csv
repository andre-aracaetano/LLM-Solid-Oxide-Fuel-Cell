1,8322,"We report a ferric-air, solid oxide battery that consists of a tubular solid oxide cell with Ca(OH)(2)/CaO dispersed Fe/FeOx powders integrated as the redox-active materials in the fuel chamber.",A Ferric-Air Battery base on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Electrical Energy Storage,10.14447/jnmes.v16i4.150
2,8322,"The key feature here is the use of Ca(OH)(2) to prevent agglomeration and coarsening of Fe/FeOx powders, and more importantly to enable in situ production of H-2/H2O as the electrochemical active redox couple in the fuel electrode.",A Ferric-Air Battery base on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Electrical Energy Storage,10.14447/jnmes.v16i4.150
3,8322,The proof-of-concept solid oxide battery exhibits an energy capacity of 144 Wh kg(-1)-Fe at a ferric utilization of 18.8% and excellent stability in ten discharge/charge cycles with a voltage efficiency of 83% that have great potential for improvement.,A Ferric-Air Battery base on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Electrical Energy Storage,10.14447/jnmes.v16i4.150
4,8322,"These results showed encouraging promise of the ferric-air, solid oxide batteries for electrical energy storage applications.",A Ferric-Air Battery base on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell for Electrical Energy Storage,10.14447/jnmes.v16i4.150
