2,3370,"In this article, Ag-CuO braze, which conducted directly at 950 degrees C in air, has been investigated as a sealant candidate between the SS430 interconnect and the Ni/YSZ anode for the planar solid oxide fuel cells.",Effective Ag-CuO sealant for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.01.131
3,3370,The results for leakage rates indicate that the lowest leakage is as low as 0.001 sccm cm(-1).,Effective Ag-CuO sealant for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.01.131
4,3370,SEM images demonstrates that both the pure Ag and 6 mol% CuO in the braze integrates the anode inherently.,Effective Ag-CuO sealant for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.01.131
5,3370,"However pure Ag wets poorly on the SS430 interconnect surface but 6 mol% CuO braze forms a reaction zone, upon which Ag wets well, so the hermeticity has been improved significantly.",Effective Ag-CuO sealant for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.01.131
