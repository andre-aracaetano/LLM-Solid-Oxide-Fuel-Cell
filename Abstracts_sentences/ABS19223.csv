1,19223,This study prepared a dense Sm-doped ceria (SDC) and an SDC carbonate composite (abbreviated as SDC-C).,Electrical Properties of Sm-doped Ceria (SDC) and SDC Carbonate Composite,10.1002/jccs.201300243
2,19223,The latter was prepared by immersing porous SDC with a formula of (Ce0.8Sm0.2)O-1.9 and a relative density of approximately 65-70% into a molten mixture of carbonates containing 1:1 molar ratio of Li2CO3 and Na2CO3 at 500 degrees C.,Electrical Properties of Sm-doped Ceria (SDC) and SDC Carbonate Composite,10.1002/jccs.201300243
3,19223,The relative density of the SDC-C was close to 100%.,Electrical Properties of Sm-doped Ceria (SDC) and SDC Carbonate Composite,10.1002/jccs.201300243
4,19223,"In addition, SDC oxide without carbonates, which also has a relative density of close to 100%, was heat treated at 1600 degrees C.",Electrical Properties of Sm-doped Ceria (SDC) and SDC Carbonate Composite,10.1002/jccs.201300243
5,19223,"At 500 degrees C, the electrical conductivity and ionic transference number (t(i)) of the SDC oxide were 1.79(5) x 10(-3) S.cm(-1) and 0.99(2), respectively, such that electronic conduction could be disregarded.",Electrical Properties of Sm-doped Ceria (SDC) and SDC Carbonate Composite,10.1002/jccs.201300243
6,19223,Increasing the temperature caused a gradual decrease in the t(i) of SDC.,Electrical Properties of Sm-doped Ceria (SDC) and SDC Carbonate Composite,10.1002/jccs.201300243
7,19223,"Following the addition of carbonates to SDC, the electrical conductivity reached 1.23(9) x 10(-1) S.cm(-1) at 500 degrees C. After 14 days (340 h), the electrical conductivity of the SDC-C at 490 degrees C, leveled off at about 6 x 10(-2) S.cm(-1).",Electrical Properties of Sm-doped Ceria (SDC) and SDC Carbonate Composite,10.1002/jccs.201300243
8,19223,SDC-C could be used as a potential electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) at temperatures below 500 degrees C.,Electrical Properties of Sm-doped Ceria (SDC) and SDC Carbonate Composite,10.1002/jccs.201300243
