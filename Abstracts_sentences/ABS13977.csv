1,13977,"(La,Sr)CoO3 and (La,Sr)2CoO4 dual phase powders were synthesized via thermal plasma to be used as cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC).","Thermal plasma synthesis of (La,Sr)CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC)",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.07.031
2,13977,"This covered pure (La,Sr)CoO3 as well as the composites where the fraction of (La,Sr)2CoO4 was gradually increased reaching the mid-composition.","Thermal plasma synthesis of (La,Sr)CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC)",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.07.031
3,13977,"Powders, all synthesized in the same condition, were extremely small in size, especially at mid-composition where they were close to 30 nm in size.","Thermal plasma synthesis of (La,Sr)CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC)",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.07.031
4,13977,Area specific resistance (ASR) determined from the symmetric cell imply improved cathodic performance at the mid-composition.,"Thermal plasma synthesis of (La,Sr)CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC)",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.07.031
5,13977,"Taking ASR = 0.15 U*cm2 as benchmark, it was found that the (La,Sr)CoO3: (La,Sr)2CoO4 = 0.53:0.47 cathode may be used at temperatures close 750 degrees C. Measurements taken from several runs however imply that the cathode performance was not stable and ASR values increases with cycling.","Thermal plasma synthesis of (La,Sr)CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC)",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.07.031
6,13977,This was attributed to the powder form of the cathode which would be expected to coarsen rapidly due to accelerated surface diffusion.,"Thermal plasma synthesis of (La,Sr)CoO3-(La,Sr)2CoO4 composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC)",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.07.031
