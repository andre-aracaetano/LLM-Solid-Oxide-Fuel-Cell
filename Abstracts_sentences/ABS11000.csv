5,11000,"Compared with SNDC, 1 mol% Fe-doped SNDC (Fe-SNDC) sintered at 1250 degrees C shows a higher total conductivity of 2.13 x 10(-2)S center dot cm(-1)at 650 degrees C. Also, it exhibits that doping of Fe can increase the conductivity of grain interior and grain boundary simultaneously.",Densification and electrical conductivity of Fe and Mn-doped Ce0.83Sm0.085Nd0.085O2-& by solid-liquid method,10.1111/ijac.13610
