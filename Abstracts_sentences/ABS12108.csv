1,12108,"A 5-cell solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack with external manifold structure is assembled and underwent a durability test with an output of 250 w for nearly 4400 h when current density and operating temperature are 355 mA/cm(2) and 750 degrees C. Cells used in the stack are anode-supported cells (ASC) with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes, Ni/YSZ hydrogen electrodes, and",Study on component interface evolution of a solid oxide fuel cell stack after long term operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.03.040
