1,5404,Direct carbon fuel cells (DCFC) that use zirconia-based electrolytes and molten Sb anodes have much promise for the efficient conversion of carbonaceous solid fuels into electricity.,Zirconia-Based Electrolyte Stability in Direct-Carbon Fuel Cells with Molten Sb Anodes,10.1149/2.0871506jes
2,5404,"However, etching of the electrolyte, and ultimately cell failure, has been observed during operation.",Zirconia-Based Electrolyte Stability in Direct-Carbon Fuel Cells with Molten Sb Anodes,10.1149/2.0871506jes
3,5404,"In this study, we have investigated this etching phenomenon as a function of the electrolyte composition and cell operating conditions and demonstrated that it is not electrochemical in nature, but rather results from reaction between the electrolyte and Sb2O3 that is produced during cell operation.",Zirconia-Based Electrolyte Stability in Direct-Carbon Fuel Cells with Molten Sb Anodes,10.1149/2.0871506jes
4,5404,Etching was also observed when a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) wafer was immersed in molten Sb2O3.,Zirconia-Based Electrolyte Stability in Direct-Carbon Fuel Cells with Molten Sb Anodes,10.1149/2.0871506jes
