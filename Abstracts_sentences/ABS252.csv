2,252,"As an electrical power generator of power plants, it has a higher achievable efficiency (80%) than the Molten Carbonate (MCFC) and the Solid Oxide (SOFC) fuel cells, and has less emission than conventional coal-combustion power plants.",Analytical modeling of electrochemical mechanisms in CO2 and CO/CO2 producing Direct Carbon Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.01.010
3,252,"In this paper, we propose a comparative study based on an analytical model for polarizations calculation in DCFC producing CO2 and a mixture of (CO/CO2) and using a carbonate melt (62 Li2CO3/38 K2CO3 mol%) as electrolyte.",Analytical modeling of electrochemical mechanisms in CO2 and CO/CO2 producing Direct Carbon Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.01.010
4,252,"The obtained results indicate that when the CO is taken into account in the anode side, the DCFC performance increases by 15% compared to only CO2 producing DCFC system at the same operating conditions (moves from 1350 W m(-2) to 1550 W m(-2)).",Analytical modeling of electrochemical mechanisms in CO2 and CO/CO2 producing Direct Carbon Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.01.010
5,252,"Simulations lead to understand the effect of the operating conditions (temperature, cathodic gas composition and inlet cathodic pressure) on the performance of the DCFC in order to solve all constraints preventing the development of this type of fuel cell.",Analytical modeling of electrochemical mechanisms in CO2 and CO/CO2 producing Direct Carbon Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.01.010
6,252,The comparison of the obtained results with data from literature illustrates a relatively good agreement with an absolute average deviation of about 4%.,Analytical modeling of electrochemical mechanisms in CO2 and CO/CO2 producing Direct Carbon Fuel Cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2012.01.010
