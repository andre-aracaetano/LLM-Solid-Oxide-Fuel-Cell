1,9894,The La1.5Nd0.3Pr0.2NiO4.16 material was prepared by the citrate method and used as a cathode for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,La1.5Nd0.3Pr0.2NiO4.16: A New Cathode Material for IT-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-023-00818-x
2,9894,The study was carried out in the presence of a thin interfacial layer composed of 50% GDC10 and 50% 8YSZ deposited on both surfaces of the GDC10 (Ce1.9Gd0.1O1.95) electrolyte.,La1.5Nd0.3Pr0.2NiO4.16: A New Cathode Material for IT-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-023-00818-x
3,9894,"The purity of the materials was studied by X-ray diffraction, while X-ray photon-electron spectrometry (XPS) was used to characterize the surface chemical state of the synthesized material; the morphology of the electrode and cross-sectional images of the cell were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",La1.5Nd0.3Pr0.2NiO4.16: A New Cathode Material for IT-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-023-00818-x
4,9894,Iodometric titration has also been performed to evaluate oxygen over-stoichiometry.,La1.5Nd0.3Pr0.2NiO4.16: A New Cathode Material for IT-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-023-00818-x
5,9894,"Cross-sectional SEM images have shown good adherence between all the cell components, and the cationic character of the cathode material was confirmed by the XPS and iodometric analysis.",La1.5Nd0.3Pr0.2NiO4.16: A New Cathode Material for IT-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-023-00818-x
6,9894,The use of these materials as an oxygen cathode has shown interesting electrochemical properties with an area-specific resistance (ASR) value of the order of 0.060 (omega.cm(2)) at 600 ? and 0.022 (omega.cm(2)) at 700 ?.,La1.5Nd0.3Pr0.2NiO4.16: A New Cathode Material for IT-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-023-00818-x
7,9894,The activation energy (Ea) of the LNPNO5 material is very low and is of the order of 0.96 eV.,La1.5Nd0.3Pr0.2NiO4.16: A New Cathode Material for IT-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-023-00818-x
