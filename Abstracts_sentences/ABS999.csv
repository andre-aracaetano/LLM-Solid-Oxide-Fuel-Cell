1,999,"A test system based around a thin-walled extruded solid electrolyte tubular reactor has been developed, which enables the fuel reforming catalysis and surface chemistry occurring within solid oxide fuel cells and the electrochemical performance of the fuel cell to be studied under genuine operating conditions.","Development of a novel test system for in situ catalytic, electrocatalytic and electrochemical studies of internal fuel reforming in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1023/A:1019024312481
2,999,"It permits simultaneous monitoring of the catalytic chemistry and the cell performance, allowing direct correlation between the fuel cell performance and the reforming characteristics of the anode, as well as enabling the influence of drawing current on the catalysis and surface reaction pathways to be studied.","Development of a novel test system for in situ catalytic, electrocatalytic and electrochemical studies of internal fuel reforming in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1023/A:1019024312481
3,999,"Temperature-programmed reaction measurements can be carried out on anodes in an actual SOFC, and have been used to investigate the reduction characteristics of different anode formulations, methane activation and methane steam reforming, and to evaluate the nature and level of carbon deposition on the anode during reforming.","Development of a novel test system for in situ catalytic, electrocatalytic and electrochemical studies of internal fuel reforming in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1023/A:1019024312481
