1,18161,"In this paper, Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) is used as a barrier interlayer between Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8-Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) anode and 8YSZ electrolyte to avoid solid state interaction of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) for high temperature application.",Investigation of single SOEC with BSCF anode and SDC barrier layer,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.049
2,18161,"The crystal structure and surface morphologies of BSCF and SDC powders were characterized, respectively.",Investigation of single SOEC with BSCF anode and SDC barrier layer,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.049
3,18161,BSCF-SDC/YSZ/SDC-BSCF symmetric cells and BSCF-SDC/YSZ/Ni-YSZ single button cells were prepared and the related electrochemical performances were tested at 850 degrees C.,Investigation of single SOEC with BSCF anode and SDC barrier layer,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.049
4,18161,"The results showed that ASR data of BSCF-SDC/YSZ is 0.42 Omega cm(2) at 850 C. The hydrogen production rate of the single SOEC using BSCF/SDC anode can be up to 177.4 mL cm(-2) h(-1), also the cell exhibits excellent stability, which indicates that it could be a potential candidate for the future application of SOEC technology.",Investigation of single SOEC with BSCF anode and SDC barrier layer,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.049
