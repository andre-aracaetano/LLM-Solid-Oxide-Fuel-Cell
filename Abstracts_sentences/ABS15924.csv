4,15924,"The SDC powders were calcined at 800, 1000 and 1200 degrees C for 5 h whereas YSB powders were calcined at 550, 650 and 750 degrees C for 2 h. The result from XRD showed that the SDC powder having a Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 structure after the calcine at a temperature of 800 to 1200 degrees C for 5 h and YSB having an Y0.25Bi0.75O1.5 structure at 750 degrees C for 2 h. An increase in the calcination temperature on the SDC at 800, 1000 and 1200 degrees C for 5 h caused an increased in crystalline size to 42.4, 58.7 and 79.9 nm, respectively.",Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.90 (SDC)/Y0.25Bi0.75O1.5 (YSB) Bilayered Electrolytes for Intermediate Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
5,15924,An increase in YSB calcination temperature to 750 degrees C resulted in the transformation of YSB from tetragonal into cubic fluorite structure with a crystallite size of 28.86 nm.,Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.90 (SDC)/Y0.25Bi0.75O1.5 (YSB) Bilayered Electrolytes for Intermediate Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
