1,14492,"Composites of Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were prepared by infiltration of LSM nanoparticles, of aqueous salt solutions, and of molten salts into porous YSZ and tested as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes at 973 K.",SOFC cathodes prepared by infiltration with various LSM precursors,10.1149/1.2183867
2,14492,"All of the composites showed essentially identical performance, with a current-independent impedance of similar to 0.4 Omega cm(2).",SOFC cathodes prepared by infiltration with various LSM precursors,10.1149/1.2183867
3,14492,"Atomic force microscopy images of LSM particles on YSZ (100) suggest that LSM wets YSZ after calcination, implying that the structures of the LSM-YSZ composites are similar because of LSM mobility.",SOFC cathodes prepared by infiltration with various LSM precursors,10.1149/1.2183867
