1,16485,Fiber-coupled radiometry allows for the radiometric measurement of high temperatures in environments where there is no line of sight to the target.,Radiation Thermometry Based on Photonic Crystal Fiber,10.1007/s10765-011-0940-z
2,16485,"However, transmission through conventional silica optical fibers degrades rapidly at elevated temperatures, and exotic fibers-such as sapphire fibers-typically cannot be bent.",Radiation Thermometry Based on Photonic Crystal Fiber,10.1007/s10765-011-0940-z
3,16485,"As part of a project to investigate the performance of solid oxide fuel cells, the feasibility of using an alternative fiber, solid-core silica photonic crystal fiber (PCF), was tested.",Radiation Thermometry Based on Photonic Crystal Fiber,10.1007/s10765-011-0940-z
4,16485,"The test system used an Inconel blackbody as a source, and a detection system based on an InGaAs array spectrometer with a wavelength range of 907 nm to 1681 nm.",Radiation Thermometry Based on Photonic Crystal Fiber,10.1007/s10765-011-0940-z
5,16485,The temperature was determined from the spectrometer signal at particular wavelengths using the Planck relationship.,Radiation Thermometry Based on Photonic Crystal Fiber,10.1007/s10765-011-0940-z
6,16485,"Two tests were performed: (1) long-term high temperature soak tests to measure the drift and noise in thermal radiation levels, in which spectra are sequentially recorded over a long period of time with the blackbody cavity at a constant temperature and (2) temperature dependence tests, whereby thermal radiation spectra are recorded with the blackbody cavity at several temperatures.",Radiation Thermometry Based on Photonic Crystal Fiber,10.1007/s10765-011-0940-z
7,16485,"At 934 A degrees C, the transmission of the PCF decreased at a rate of 0.078 % per hour corresponding to a temperature error of -0.12 A degrees C per hour.",Radiation Thermometry Based on Photonic Crystal Fiber,10.1007/s10765-011-0940-z
