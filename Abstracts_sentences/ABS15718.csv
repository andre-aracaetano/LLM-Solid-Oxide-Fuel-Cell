4,15718,"The obtained composite displayed a methanol conversion above 99.9% at 450 degrees C and an ethanol conversion above 99% at 600 degrees C, which was highly superior to the common Ni-Cu/Al2O3 catalyst.",A Fibrous Perovskite Nanomaterial with Exsolved Ni-Cu Metal Nanoparticles as an Effective Composite Catalyst for External Steam Reforming of Liquid Alcohols,10.3390/cryst13111594
5,15718,The catalytic performance of our assembled catalysts also remained stable in methanol and ethanol atmospheres for 50 h and no coking was detected.,A Fibrous Perovskite Nanomaterial with Exsolved Ni-Cu Metal Nanoparticles as an Effective Composite Catalyst for External Steam Reforming of Liquid Alcohols,10.3390/cryst13111594
6,15718,"Furthermore, when the reformed gas was fed into a Y0.08Zr0.92O2 (YSZ)-based SOFC system, the open circuit voltage remained around 1.1 V at 700 degrees C for 50 h accordingly, without coking, and the voltage remained virtually unchanged at 0.7 V for 50 h at 700 degrees C and 400 mA cm-2 during galvanostatic discharge mode, indicating that using LBMNCu nanofiber as a catalyst for hydrogen production and utilization is an efficient strategy.",A Fibrous Perovskite Nanomaterial with Exsolved Ni-Cu Metal Nanoparticles as an Effective Composite Catalyst for External Steam Reforming of Liquid Alcohols,10.3390/cryst13111594
