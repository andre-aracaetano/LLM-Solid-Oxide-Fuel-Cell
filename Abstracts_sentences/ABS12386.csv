1,12386,"LnBaCo(2)O(5+delta) (Ln = Nd, Sm, Gd, and Y) oxides with a cation ordered perovskite structure have been investigated as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",LnBaCo2O5+δ oxides as cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2839028
2,12386,"The oxygen content 5 + delta, thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), and electrical conductivity (metallic) decrease with decreasing size of the Ln(3+) ions from Ln = La to Y. While the decrease in TEC is due to the decreasing ionicity of the Ln-O bond, the decrease in electrical conductivity is due to the increasing oxide ion vacancies and a bending of the O-Co-O bonds.",LnBaCo2O5+δ oxides as cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2839028
