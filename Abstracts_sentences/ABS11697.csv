1,11697,"The three layers with porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) backbone/dense YSZ/porous NiO-YSZ were fabricated by tape-casting process, respectively, then laminated together and co-fired at 1300 degrees C for 5 h. The cathode material La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) was loaded by infiltrating the precursor of metal ions into porous YSZ backbone.",Fabrication and Performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Infiltrated-Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Cathode on Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028947
2,11697,"As a result, LSCF nanoparticles with the size of 60-100 nm were uniformly distributed on YSZ backbone.",Fabrication and Performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Infiltrated-Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Cathode on Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028947
3,11697,The power density was 1.046W cm(-2) and the polarization resistance was 0.17 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C in humidified H-2 (3 vol.% H2O).,Fabrication and Performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Infiltrated-Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Cathode on Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028947
4,11697,"But the stability was not good enough, especially in early operating stage, e.g., 20 h. After that, it showed good stability for the following 70 h operating under a constant voltage of 0.7 V at 750 degrees",Fabrication and Performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Infiltrated-Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Cathode on Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028947
