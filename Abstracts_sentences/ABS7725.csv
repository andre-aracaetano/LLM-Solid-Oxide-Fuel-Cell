1,7725,"In this paper, we fabricate a thin film solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) cathode which is coated with an Au layer by sputtering.",Au-Coated Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferrite Cathode for Lowering Sheet Resistance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1007/s12541-019-00013-3
2,7725,The fabricated thin film SOFC has a 370-nm-thick Ni anode/880-nm-thick YSZ electrolyte/440-nm-thick LSCF cathode/130-nm-thick Au layer.,Au-Coated Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferrite Cathode for Lowering Sheet Resistance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1007/s12541-019-00013-3
3,7725,"The electrochemical performances of the thin film SOFC with the LSCF cathode coated with a 130-nm-thick Au layer and another SOFC without an Au layer are measured at the operating temperature of 600 degrees C. Since the LSCF cathode coated with a 130-nm-thick Au layer significantly lowers the sheet resistance (in-plane direction resistance), the peak power densities of the thin film SOFC with the LSCF cathode coated with a 130-nm-thick Au layer and the thin film SOFC with the LSCF cathode without a 130-nm-thick Au layer are 500mW/cm(2) and 49mW/cm(2), respectively.",Au-Coated Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferrite Cathode for Lowering Sheet Resistance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1007/s12541-019-00013-3
4,7725,"Due to the LSCF cathode coated with a 130-nm-thick Au layer, the peak power density of the thin film SOFC with the Au-coated LSCF cathode is 10 times higher than that of the LSCF cathode without Au layer.",Au-Coated Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferrite Cathode for Lowering Sheet Resistance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1007/s12541-019-00013-3
