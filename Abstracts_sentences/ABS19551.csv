1,19551,"Effect of redox cycling on a Ni-YSZ anode prepared from 50 wt.% NiO and 50 wt.% YSZ was investigated by using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), XRD and SEM techniques.",Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anode investigated by TPR technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.06.016
2,19551,XRD results showed that NiO was formed during re-oxidation.,Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anode investigated by TPR technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.06.016
3,19551,Both the XRD and TPR results depicted that the conversion of nickel to NiO depended on the re-oxidation temperature.,Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anode investigated by TPR technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.06.016
4,19551,The oxidation of Ni to NiO occurred quickly in the initial several minutes and then reached a quasi equilibrium.,Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anode investigated by TPR technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.06.016
5,19551,"The TPR profiles tracing the redox cycling showed that it brought continuous changes in the NiO micro-structure at 800 degrees C, whereas at 600 degrees C it had only little effects on the reduction of NiO. Re-oxidation resulted in the formation of spongy aggregates of NiO crystallites.",Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anode investigated by TPR technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.06.016
6,19551,Redox cycling at 800 degrees C led to a continuous decrease in the primary crystallite size of NiO and a high dispersion of the Ni particles.,Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anode investigated by TPR technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.06.016
7,19551,"A continuous expansion of the slice sample was observed in both of the oxidized and reduced states during the redox cycling at 800 degrees C, whereas this process did not occur during the redox cycling at 600 degrees C.
