1,7982,"Cr contamination, generated by system components located upstream a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and responsible for Cr-poisoning induced air electrode performance degradation, must be suppressed by hindering the access of Cr pollutants to the cathode compartment.",Mitigating Cr Contamination by Hot Air Filtering in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.002112esl
2,7982,"For this purpose, we developed an air filter, based on a (La,Sr)CoO(3)-coated ceramic foam, which was evaluated on its Cr-trapping potential within an SOFC system.",Mitigating Cr Contamination by Hot Air Filtering in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.002112esl
3,7982,"An in-situ measurement based on a novel hot air sampling technique indicated a 7-fold decrease of the Cr contaminating level after the installation of a Cr getter filter, which should significantly extend SOFC lifetime.",Mitigating Cr Contamination by Hot Air Filtering in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.002112esl
