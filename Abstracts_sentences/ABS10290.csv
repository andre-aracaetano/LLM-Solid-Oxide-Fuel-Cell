2,10290,Rietveld analysis of the XRD data confirms the tetragonal symmetry in the I4/mcm space group with unit cell parameters of a = b = 6.0567(3) and c = 8.5831(5) .,Robust doped BaCeO3-δ electrolyte for IT-SOFCs,10.1007/s11581-017-2086-x
3,10290,The addition of ZnO as a sintering additive was found to reduce the sintering temperature and enhance both overall sinterability and grain growth.,Robust doped BaCeO3-δ electrolyte for IT-SOFCs,10.1007/s11581-017-2086-x
4,10290,"Sintering temperature was reduced by 200-300 A degrees C, and a very high relative density of about 98% was achieved at 1400 A degrees C. Impedance spectroscopy in humidified 5% H-2/Ar atmosphere shows that the protonic conductivity at 600 A degrees C was 8.60 x 10(-3) S cm(-1).",Robust doped BaCeO3-δ electrolyte for IT-SOFCs,10.1007/s11581-017-2086-x
5,10290,Thermal analysis performed in pure CO2 atmosphere shows very good chemical stability up to 1200 A degrees C. Good biaxial flexure strength of 100-200 MPa was reported which makes this material a promising electrolyte material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Robust doped BaCeO3-δ electrolyte for IT-SOFCs,10.1007/s11581-017-2086-x
