2,5234,"In this study, fuel recirculation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operated with ammonia is investigated.",A numerical study of fuel recirculation in ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.139
3,5234,"Recirculation operation results in a notable elevation of nitrogen content within the cell, originating from the decomposition of ammonia within the cell and subsequently rein-troduced into the inflow stream.",A numerical study of fuel recirculation in ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.139
4,5234,"Therefore, the fuel flow rate needs to be increased to maintain the fuel utili-zation level the same as the base operation, which is an ammonia-fueled operation without recirculation.",A numerical study of fuel recirculation in ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.139
5,5234,"A multiscale model of an SOFC stack is used to compare the base operation and saturated level of the recirculation operation cases based on their polarization curves and distributions of ammonia, hydrogen, current density, temperature, first principal stress, and nitriding in the fuel electrode.",A numerical study of fuel recirculation in ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.139
6,5234,"The results show that overall stack per-formance, as reflected in the polarization curves, remains comparable between the base and recirculation operation cases.",A numerical study of fuel recirculation in ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.139
7,5234,The power densities exhibit a difference of less than 2% between the base and recirculation operation cases.,A numerical study of fuel recirculation in ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.139
8,5234,"Moreover, it is indicated that the recirculation operation cases lead to more uniform hydrogen and current density distributions, lower temperature gradients, and lower thermal stresses.",A numerical study of fuel recirculation in ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.139
9,5234,The results demonstrate that the recirculation operation cases lead to a reduction of up to 38% in the maximum tensile stresses within the fuel support layer.,A numerical study of fuel recirculation in ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.139
10,5234,"Nevertheless, these recirculation operation cases also induce nitriding across a larger portion of the active area.",A numerical study of fuel recirculation in ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.139
11,5234,But as shown here this is a challenge that can effectively be addressed by applying nickel coatings to the inlet headers.,A numerical study of fuel recirculation in ammonia-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.139
