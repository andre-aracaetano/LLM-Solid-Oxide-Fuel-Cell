2,3232,The first model makes simplifying assumptions for activation and concentration polarizations and obtains an analytical solution.,Modeling the performance of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1115/1.1842781
3,3232,"In the second procedure, we allow the polarizations to vary with the current density and solve the equations numerically.",Modeling the performance of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1115/1.1842781
4,3232,The results of the two methods are in good agreement with the experimentally quoted performance results.,Modeling the performance of a tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1115/1.1842781
