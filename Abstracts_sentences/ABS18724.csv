2,18724,Different control strategies have been used in biotrickling filters but proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control studies have not been reported to date.,PID control system for biogas desulfurization under anoxic conditions,10.1002/jctb.5243
3,18724,The aim of this study was to demonstrate the stability and robustness of PID control in an anoxic biotrickling filter.,PID control system for biogas desulfurization under anoxic conditions,10.1002/jctb.5243
4,18724,"RESULTS: Three PID tuning methods were tested: Ziegler-Nichols, Approximate M-constrained integral gain optimization (AMIGO), and maintained oscillation.",PID control system for biogas desulfurization under anoxic conditions,10.1002/jctb.5243
5,18724,"The best results were obtained using PID control by the maintained oscillation method, where the system reached stabilization 0.41 h after the H2S inlet step.",PID control system for biogas desulfurization under anoxic conditions,10.1002/jctb.5243
6,18724,"Moreover, the nitrate consumptionwas 15.4% lower than that without control.",PID control system for biogas desulfurization under anoxic conditions,10.1002/jctb.5243
