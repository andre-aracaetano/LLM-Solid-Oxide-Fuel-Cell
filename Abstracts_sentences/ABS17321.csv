7,17321,"On the contrary to the prediction, it was found that the R-p is lowered by the high resistance film in common to all the electrodes studied.",Polarization reduction by a highly resistant electrolyte film in SOFC oxygen electrodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00102-4
8,17321,The effective reaction area of the Pt electrode was measured from the peak area of the cyclic voltammetry.,Polarization reduction by a highly resistant electrolyte film in SOFC oxygen electrodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00102-4
9,17321,It was found that the enhancement of the electrode by the high resistance film is accompanied by a decrease in the reaction area.,Polarization reduction by a highly resistant electrolyte film in SOFC oxygen electrodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00102-4
10,17321,This uncommon experimental fact is explained by the non-uniform electrode model as follows.,Polarization reduction by a highly resistant electrolyte film in SOFC oxygen electrodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00102-4
11,17321,"If the current distribution is completely uniform over the entire electrode area, the reaction area is a maximum, but the R-p is the highest because it is determined by the local area of the lowest performance, which is, for this case, most polarized.",Polarization reduction by a highly resistant electrolyte film in SOFC oxygen electrodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00102-4
12,17321,"If the current density is concentrated on the high performance local area, the reaction area is effectively smaller, but the local area of the lower performance is equally polarized with that of the higher performance, thus the R-p being lower than that for the first case.",Polarization reduction by a highly resistant electrolyte film in SOFC oxygen electrodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00102-4
13,17321,"If one can assume that the interfacial resistance is decreased by the high resistance film, this model assigns the former case to the uncoated electrolyte and the latter to the coated electrolyte.",Polarization reduction by a highly resistant electrolyte film in SOFC oxygen electrodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00102-4
