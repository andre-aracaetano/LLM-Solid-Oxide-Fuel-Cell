2,14243,The incipient wetness impregnation method enables Co3O4 nanoparticles on the LSCF surface without altering the bulk porosity of the LSCF electrode.,Cobalt oxide enhanced lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.3233/MGC-210114
3,14243,"The polarization resistance of LSCF electrodes is significantly reduced by Co3O4 doping, and both charge transfer and diffusion/conversion resistances were positively affected.",Cobalt oxide enhanced lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.3233/MGC-210114
4,14243,"The highest reduction in charge transfer resistance is obtained at 700 degrees C, which is increased from 21% to 32% through reduction of po(2).",Cobalt oxide enhanced lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.3233/MGC-210114
5,14243,"Conversely, the highest reduction in diffusion/conversion resistance is achieved at 550 degrees C. By increasing po(2), the reduction is increased from 57% to 66% and its activation energy is reduced up to 33% compared to pure LSCF.",Cobalt oxide enhanced lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite electrode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.3233/MGC-210114
