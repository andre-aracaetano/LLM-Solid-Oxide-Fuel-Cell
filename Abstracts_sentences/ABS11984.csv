3,11984,"The thin and amorphous SiO2 films,grown by low-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD), become sphericalparticles of nickel silicates uniformly dispersed on the YSZ skeletonafter sintering at 1400 & DEG;C. Also, the SiO2-anchoredNi particles supported on YSZ (Ni/YSZ-SiO2) are obtainedvia direct reduction.",Highly Dispersed Ni over a YSZ Anode Anchored by SiO2 at High Temperature through Low-Temperature Chemical Vapor Deposition,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00550
