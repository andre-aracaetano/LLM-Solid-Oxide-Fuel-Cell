1,15560,"The electrochemical behavior of pure lanthanum chromite and strontium dopedlanthanum chromite was studied by impedance spectroscopy under H(2)/H(2)O, CO/CO(2) and CH(4)/H(2)O. Results show that the electrochemical oxidation of H(2) is faster than that of CO or CH(4).",Lanthanum Chromite as an Anode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/BF02375628
