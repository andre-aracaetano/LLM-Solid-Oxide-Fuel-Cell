1,10263,"In this study, micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (T-SOFCs) with extruded La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte as the mechanical support and LaCo0.4Ni0.6O3-delta (LCNO) or LaCo0.4Ni0.4Cu0.2O3-delta (LCNCO) as cathodes were prepared and characterized.",Characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with LaCo0.4Ni0.6-xCuxO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.170
2,10263,Partial substitution of Cu for the Ni-ion positions in the LCNO lattices was found to significantly enhance the densification and accelerate the grain growth.,Characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with LaCo0.4Ni0.6-xCuxO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.170
3,10263,"The porosity-corrected electrical conductivity was significantly increased from 1275 S/cm for LCNO ceramic to 1537 S/cm for LCNCO ceramic, because the acceptor doping was compensated by the formation of hole carriers that produced additional polarons and significantly augmented the electrical conductivity.",Characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with LaCo0.4Ni0.6-xCuxO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.170
4,10263,"SOFCs with three configurations were built in this study, including Cell A that had a lanthanum-doped ceria (LDC) buffer layer inserted between the LSGM electrolyte and the LCNCO cathode, Cell B that used an LCNO-LSGM composite cathode, and Cell C that featured an LCNCO-LSGM composite cathode.",Characteristics of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with LaCo0.4Ni0.6-xCuxO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.170
5,10263,"Among the three cells, Cell C with 263 mu m of LSGM electrolyte possessed the lowest Ohmic resistance of 0.89 Omega cm(2), a polarization resistance of 0.69 Omega cm(2), and the highest maximum power density of 178 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C.
