1,8665,The direct utilization of methanol and ethanol was tested in La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) anodes to verify stability and to determine whether this material can inhibit carbon formation.,Direct Utilization of Methanol and Ethanol on La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-011-0076-8
2,8665,"The catalytic decomposition of the alcohols was tested ex situ, while performance and stability were tested in situ at 800 degrees C. Ex situ results indicate that in methanol LSCM rapidly loses its catalytic activity for the decomposition reaction, while in ethanol pyrolytic reactions are dominant.",Direct Utilization of Methanol and Ethanol on La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-011-0076-8
3,8665,LSCM does not inhibit carbon formation with both alcohol fuels.,Direct Utilization of Methanol and Ethanol on La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-011-0076-8
4,8665,In situ cell performance is modest both in hydrogen and alcohols fuels.,Direct Utilization of Methanol and Ethanol on La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-011-0076-8
5,8665,"Performance degradation is observed after exposure to the alcohols, but coking does not permanently damage the electrode structure.",Direct Utilization of Methanol and Ethanol on La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-011-0076-8
6,8665,Increased conductivities as well as optimization of the electrode microstructures are required to improve the performance of these anodes.,Direct Utilization of Methanol and Ethanol on La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s12678-011-0076-8
