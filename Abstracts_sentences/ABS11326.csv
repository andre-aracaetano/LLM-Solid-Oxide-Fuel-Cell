4,11326,"In addition, an open circuit voltage, which is almost equal to the theoretical value of 1.1 V, and maximum power densities of 835, 277, and 67 mW cm(-2) at 700, 600, and 500 degrees C, respectively, were achieved on a single cell supported by a 75 wt% Ni-SDC cermet anode when a 60 mu m thick Sr- and Mg-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM) electrolyte was used.",Improved power generation performance of solid oxide fuel cells using doped LaGaO3 electrolyte films prepared by screen printing method II.

5,11326,The improved power density was explained by the enlarged reaction area for the anode as a result of the low polarization resistance of the anode by high porosity and uniform distribution of Ni and SDC particles.,Improved power generation performance of solid oxide fuel cells using doped LaGaO3 electrolyte films prepared by screen printing method II.

6,11326,"Although a small amount of Ni diffused to the interface between the La-doped ceria (LDC) buffer layer and the LSGM electrolyte film, an adverse reaction that deteriorates cell performance seemed to be suppressed, and thus, reasonably high power density was achieved on the cell using the LSGM film prepared by the screen printing method with optimization of the anode substrate structure and composition.",Improved power generation performance of solid oxide fuel cells using doped LaGaO3 electrolyte films prepared by screen printing method II.
