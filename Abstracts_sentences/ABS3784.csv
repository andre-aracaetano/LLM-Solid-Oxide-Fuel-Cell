1,3784,A novel electrode architecture consisting in alternating layers of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) is prepared for the first time by spray-pyrolysis deposition and investigated as cathode material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs).,A novel multilaminated composite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.296
2,3784,"Cathodes with different number of LSCF/CGO bilayers (N = 0, 3 and 5) are prepared and characterized.",A novel multilaminated composite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.296
3,3784,"The multilaminated cathodes are highly porous with connected vertical channels and display an unusual undulated morphology, which increases the contact area between CGO and LSCF materials.",A novel multilaminated composite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.296
4,3784,"The oxygen reduction activity has been investigated by impedance spectroscopy, obtaining improved values of polarization resistance as the number of bilayers increases due to extended three-phase-boundary (TPB) length for the oxygen reduction reactions.",A novel multilaminated composite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.296
