3,17401,"For the oxygen reduction reaction, the electron transfer between the electrode and oxygen, and the incorporation of oxygen ions into the electrode are the main controlling processes of oxygen reduction reaction for electrodes sintered at 1150 and 1200 degrees C. Increasing the sintering temperature up to 1250 degrees C increases the Sr diffusion through GDC interlayer, which leads to Sr accumulation at the GDC/YSZ interface with SrZrO3 formation and subsequent cell performance degradation.",Performance of La0.5Sr1.5MnO4±δ Ruddlesden-Popper manganite as electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells.
