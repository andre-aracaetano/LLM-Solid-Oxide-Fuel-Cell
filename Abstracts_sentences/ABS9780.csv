1,9780,"in this paper, fuel-processing technologies are developed for application in residential power generation (RPG) in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Self-sustained operation of a kWe-class kerosene-reforming processor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.084
2,9780,Kerosene is selected as the fuel because of its high hydrogen density and because of the established infrastructure that already exists in South Korea.,Self-sustained operation of a kWe-class kerosene-reforming processor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.084
3,9780,"A kerosene fuel processor with two different reaction stages, autothermal reforming (ATR) and adsorptive desulfurization reactions, is developed for SOFC operations.",Self-sustained operation of a kWe-class kerosene-reforming processor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.084
4,9780,ATR is suited to the reforming of liquid hydrocarbon fuels because oxygen-aided reactions can break the aromatics in the fuel and steam can suppress carbon deposition during the reforming reaction.,Self-sustained operation of a kWe-class kerosene-reforming processor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.084
5,9780,ATR can also be implemented as a self-sustaining reactor due to the exothermicity of the reaction.,Self-sustained operation of a kWe-class kerosene-reforming processor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.084
6,9780,"The We self-sustained kerosene fuel processor, including the desulfurizer, operates for about 250 h in this study.",Self-sustained operation of a kWe-class kerosene-reforming processor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.084
7,9780,This fuel processor does not require a heat exchanger between the ATR reactor and the desulfurizer or electric equipment for heat supply and fuel or water vaporization because a suitable temperature of the ATR reformate is reached for H2S adsorption on the ZnO catalyst beds in desulfurizer.,Self-sustained operation of a kWe-class kerosene-reforming processor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.084
8,9780,"Although the CH4 concentration in the reformate gas of the fuel processor is higher due to the lower temperature of ATR tail gas, SOFCs can directly use CH4 as a fuel with the addition of sufficient steam feeds (H2O/CH4 >= 1.5), in contrast to low-temperature fuel cells.",Self-sustained operation of a kWe-class kerosene-reforming processor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.084
9,9780,"The reforming efficiency of the fuel processor is about 60%, and the desulfurizer removed H2S to a sufficient level to allow for the operation of SOFCs.",Self-sustained operation of a kWe-class kerosene-reforming processor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.084
