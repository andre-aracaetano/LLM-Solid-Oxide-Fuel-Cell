1,9192,The idea of using the sol-gel technique for producing low-cost components for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application has attracted great interest.,Screen printing of sol-gel-derived electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.02.020
2,9192,"Besides its economic advantages, the sol-gel technique additionally offers the chance to reduce either the thickness of the electrolyte and therefore to reduce ohmic resistances or to lower the sintering temperature of single components like the electrolyte layer, due to the clearly reduced particle sizes of colloidal distributed particles in the sol.",Screen printing of sol-gel-derived electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.02.020
3,9192,The work presented here deals with the development of sols and their application in combination with yttria fully stabilized zirconia mixed-oxide powders for the preparation of screen-printing pastes.,Screen printing of sol-gel-derived electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.02.020
4,9192,"Besides physical, chemical and thermal characterization of the sols, variations of the composition of the sol as well as of the pastes composed of sol and mixed-oxide powder were evaluated for preparing dense, gas-tight layers sintered at various temperatures, resulting in sufficient gas-tightness to ensure high power density SOFCs.",Screen printing of sol-gel-derived electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.02.020
