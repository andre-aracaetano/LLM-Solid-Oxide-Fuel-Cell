1,7125,"The La0.6Sr0.4Fe03.5-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95-delta (LSF-GDC) support with large straight open pores was formed by the phase inversion tape method, and used as a cathode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) comprising GDC electrolyte and Ni-GDC anode.",Solid oxide fuel cells supported on cathodes with large straight open pores and catalyst-decorated surfaces,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.05.028
2,7125,La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSC) nano-particles were deposited deeply inside the cathode using the impregnation method.,Solid oxide fuel cells supported on cathodes with large straight open pores and catalyst-decorated surfaces,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.05.028
3,7125,"The single cell with the LSC-modified cathode exhibited a maximum power density of 726 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, much higher than the one with the un-modified cathode (298 mW cm(-2)).",Solid oxide fuel cells supported on cathodes with large straight open pores and catalyst-decorated surfaces,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.05.028
4,7125,"The polarization resistance determined with the impedance spectroscopy was 0.025 Omega cm(2) for the former, which was one order of magnitude smaller than that for the latter.",Solid oxide fuel cells supported on cathodes with large straight open pores and catalyst-decorated surfaces,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.05.028
5,7125,"It is concluded that the presence of large straight open pores in the phase inversion-derived cathode allows for easy impregnation of catalytically active nano -particles, enlarging the triple-phase-boundaries for oxygen reduction reaction and hence enhancing the electrochemical performance of the cathode-supported SOFCs.",Solid oxide fuel cells supported on cathodes with large straight open pores and catalyst-decorated surfaces,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.05.028
