2,5130,The glass was sealed between two metallic interconnect plates and tested for electrical stability at elevated temperatures and dual environments under dc loading.,Electrical Stability of a Novel Refractory Sealing Glass in a Dual Environment for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03466.x
3,5130,"The isothermal aging results showed very stable electrical resistivity with values 5-9 orders of magnititudes higher than typical SOFC function materials at 850 degrees C for similar to 700 h. For comparison, a state-of-the-art sealing glass (G18, Ba-Ca-Al-B-Si) was also evaluated in a similar condition and showed a less stable condition in accelerated tests at 830 degrees C for similar to 100 h. Interfacial microstructure was characterized and possible reactions are discussed.",Electrical Stability of a Novel Refractory Sealing Glass in a Dual Environment for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03466.x
