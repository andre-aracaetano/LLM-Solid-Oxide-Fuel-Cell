2,17958,"Here, we explore the promotion effect of metal nanoparticles on the surface exchange reaction rates of (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSM) as a function of temperature and the LSM orientation.","Promotion Effect of Metal Nanoparticle on Surface Exchange Reaction of (La,Sr)MnO3 Film with Different Orientation",10.1149/2.1101706jes
3,17958,"The surface chemical exchange coefficient, K-chem, is investigated using electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) method for Pt and Pd decorated epitaxial (001)-, (110)-, and (111)-oriented LSM films.","Promotion Effect of Metal Nanoparticle on Surface Exchange Reaction of (La,Sr)MnO3 Film with Different Orientation",10.1149/2.1101706jes
4,17958,"Compared with the bare LSM film, larger K-chem is observed with the Pd and Pt nanoparticles decorated LSM films at the temperature in the range from 500 degrees C to 650 degrees C. Pt nanoparticles decorated on (110)-LSM promotes the surface exchange rate to a factor up to 129, about 5 times higher than the Pd decorated (110)-LSM.","Promotion Effect of Metal Nanoparticle on Surface Exchange Reaction of (La,Sr)MnO3 Film with Different Orientation",10.1149/2.1101706jes
