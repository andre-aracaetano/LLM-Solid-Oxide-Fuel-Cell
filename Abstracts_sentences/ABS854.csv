1,854,"In order to produce valuable chemicals and electric energy at the same time, fuel cell type reactor (FCR) has been proposed.",Applications of fuel cell reactor in electrocatalyze reactions,
2,854,"The features of the FCR are: (1) the energy of oxidation which is converted into potential energy between cathode and anode can be directly used as the electric power, therefore, it theoretically has high electrical efficiencies; (2) reaction mixture were not directly mixed, so the safety is improved and gaseous combustion reaction is avoided; (3) the activity of surface oxidant species on anode catalyst is controlled by applying external potential to the electrode catalysts so that partial oxidation reactions can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude.",Applications of fuel cell reactor in electrocatalyze reactions,
3,854,"FCR is widely used in a variety of catalytic reactions on Pt, Pd, Ag, Ni, Au, IrO2 and RuO2 surfaces.",Applications of fuel cell reactor in electrocatalyze reactions,
4,854,"In this paper, the principle of operation of three kinds of FCR, including sour fuel cell reactor, proton-exchange membrane fuel cell reactor, solid-oxide fuel cell reactor, is depicted, and a comparison between FCR and other conventional chemical reactors is made.",Applications of fuel cell reactor in electrocatalyze reactions,
5,854,Furthermore the major problems which will be encountered in the industrialization of FCR are also discussed.,Applications of fuel cell reactor in electrocatalyze reactions,
