2,11689,"In the cathodic sequence, one possible solution to improve the electrochemical performance consists of a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and a samaria-doped ceria (SDC) bilayer.",Influence of SDC-YSZ Contact at Different Atmospheres in SOFC Operation and Processing Conditions,10.1149/1.3133244
3,11689,But this layer sequence is still problematic due to solid-state reactions and interdiffusion at the YSZ/SDC interface.,Influence of SDC-YSZ Contact at Different Atmospheres in SOFC Operation and Processing Conditions,10.1149/1.3133244
4,11689,"The phase formation and element diffusion have been studied when samples are sintered at different atmospheres (oxidizing, inert, and reducing) and temperatures (1100, 1200, and 1300 degrees C) by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis/wavelength dispersive X-ray analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",Influence of SDC-YSZ Contact at Different Atmospheres in SOFC Operation and Processing Conditions,10.1149/1.3133244
5,11689,The reaction and interdiffusion are preceded by the migration of the cerium to the YSZ lattice.,Influence of SDC-YSZ Contact at Different Atmospheres in SOFC Operation and Processing Conditions,10.1149/1.3133244
