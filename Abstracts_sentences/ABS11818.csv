1,11818,Gamma radiation has always an impact on semiconductor material by altering its physico-chemical properties.,Enhanced Performance of LSCF as a Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell By Using Gamma Radiation,10.21608/EJCHEM.2022.136138.5996
2,11818,In this paper nano sized crystallites of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) which is a promising cathode material for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).LSFC was synthesized by sol-gel technique and modified sol-gel technique by Gamma irradiation methods.,Enhanced Performance of LSCF as a Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell By Using Gamma Radiation,10.21608/EJCHEM.2022.136138.5996
3,11818,"The structure, morphology, elemental analyses and surface area were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) analysis and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.",Enhanced Performance of LSCF as a Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell By Using Gamma Radiation,10.21608/EJCHEM.2022.136138.5996
4,11818,"Also Dc conductivity was measured from room temperature up to 500 degrees C. Results showed that samples synthesized by irradiation method were more porous structure,higher surface area and oxygen vacancies as compared to un-irradiated sample.",Enhanced Performance of LSCF as a Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell By Using Gamma Radiation,10.21608/EJCHEM.2022.136138.5996
5,11818,"So, irradiation technique has a pronounced effective role in improvement microstructure of LSCF cathode material.",Enhanced Performance of LSCF as a Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell By Using Gamma Radiation,10.21608/EJCHEM.2022.136138.5996
