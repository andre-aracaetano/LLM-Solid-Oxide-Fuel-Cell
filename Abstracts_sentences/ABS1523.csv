1,1523,This short communication describes the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) fueled by directly feeding premium gasoline to the anode without using external reforming.,Gasoline-fueled solid oxide fuel cell with high power density,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.038
2,1523,The novel component of the fuel cell that enables such operation is the mixed conductivity MoO2-based anode.,Gasoline-fueled solid oxide fuel cell with high power density,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.038
3,1523,"Using this anode, a fuel cell demonstrating a power density >3.0 W cm(-2) at 0.6 V was successfully fabricated.",Gasoline-fueled solid oxide fuel cell with high power density,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.038
4,1523,"Over a 24 h period of operation, the open cell voltage remained stable at similar to 0.9 V. At the cell voltage of 0.6 V, its current density dropped over the first 7 h to a value of similar to 3.0 A cm(-2), where it stayed for the remaining 17 h of the test with a minor fluctuation.",Gasoline-fueled solid oxide fuel cell with high power density,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.038
5,1523,Power density of similar to 2.0 W cm(-2) at 0.6 V was still measured after 24 h on stream with a continuous feed of gasoline.,Gasoline-fueled solid oxide fuel cell with high power density,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.038
6,1523,"Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of the anode surface pre- and post-testing showed no evidence of coking, which hints at the reason for the observed stability under the harsh cell operating conditions.",Gasoline-fueled solid oxide fuel cell with high power density,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.038
7,1523,The implication of this preliminary study is that an SOFC using a MoO2-based anode has potential for generating electrical power from gasoline for future hybrid electric vehicles.,Gasoline-fueled solid oxide fuel cell with high power density,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.038
