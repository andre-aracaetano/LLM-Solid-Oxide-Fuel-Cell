2,1749,The dispersion of Co0.5Ni0.5O particles into a porous-platinum-based anode increased the cell performance in an SOFC using a stabilized-zirconia electrolyte.,Electrocatalytic activity of Co0.5Ni0.5O particles for the anodic oxidation of methane,10.2320/matertrans1989.41.1621
3,1749,"Among the catalysts studied, C0.5Ni0.5O, CoO, and NiO, the increase was the most prominent for Co0.5Ni0.5O.",Electrocatalytic activity of Co0.5Ni0.5O particles for the anodic oxidation of methane,10.2320/matertrans1989.41.1621
4,1749,"The anodic polarization resistance and the production rates of CO, CO2, and H-2 in the outlet gas showed a high Co0.5Ni0.5O catalytic activity for the electrochemical oxidation of methane, indicating the activation of the steam-reforming reaction caused by the formation of surface active sites in relation to the cation vacancy in the CoO-NiO solid solution.",Electrocatalytic activity of Co0.5Ni0.5O particles for the anodic oxidation of methane,10.2320/matertrans1989.41.1621
