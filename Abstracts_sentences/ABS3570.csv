2,3570,"Materials selection is dominated by the need to satisfy performance, cost and stability criteria in the aggressive environment provided by the molten carbonate electrolyte.",Materials for high-temperature fuel cells,10.1098/rsta.1996.0074
3,3570,"Accordingly, materials developments associated with the MCFC have been focused on reducing fabrication costs and improving reliability over extended periods.",Materials for high-temperature fuel cells,10.1098/rsta.1996.0074
4,3570,"In contrast, materials selection for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is still a very active endeavour due to the different requirements arising from the range of operating temperatures (500-1000 degrees C), various design configurations and market opportunities.",Materials for high-temperature fuel cells,10.1098/rsta.1996.0074
5,3570,"It is expected that electrode-supported thick-film electrolyte technology will satisfy most of the technical requirements, and investigations are urgently required to reduce the associated fabrication costs, and to provide relevant thermomechanical property data.",Materials for high-temperature fuel cells,10.1098/rsta.1996.0074
6,3570,"SOFC systems operate on a variety of fuels, and their relative simplicity makes them particularly promising candidates for small-scale combined beat and power applications, and for incorporation into electric vehicles.",Materials for high-temperature fuel cells,10.1098/rsta.1996.0074
