1,10386,One approach to improve the performances of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes is to use a composite electrode that typically consists of a two-phase porous mixture of a solid electrolyte (yttria-stabilized zirconia) and an electrocatalytic material.,Micromodeling of functionally graded SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2766651
2,10386,The best electrochemical performances with such a type of cathode are obtained when the composition varies within the composite cathode called graded electrode.,Micromodeling of functionally graded SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2766651

4,10386,"A one-dimensional, homogeneous model and a discrete element method was used.",Micromodeling of functionally graded SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2766651
5,10386,"The present study proposes a one-dimensional dc and ac model that takes into account mass and charge conservation, transport of species, and reaction kinetics.",Micromodeling of functionally graded SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2766651
6,10386,The influence of transport parameters and microstructure on the shape of both polarization curves and impedance diagrams is discussed.,Micromodeling of functionally graded SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2766651
