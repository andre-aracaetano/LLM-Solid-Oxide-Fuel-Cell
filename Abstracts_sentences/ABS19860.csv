6,19860,"The max temperature gradient both parallel to the channel and perpendicular to the electrolyte decreases with the increase in beta, due to the decrease in the bi-polar plate volume, but the max temperature gradient perpendicular to the channel increases with the increase in alpha and beta (except beta = 0.5) due to the rib effect.",Numerical study on the effect of bi-polar plate geometry in the SOFC heating-up process,10.1063/1.5047278
