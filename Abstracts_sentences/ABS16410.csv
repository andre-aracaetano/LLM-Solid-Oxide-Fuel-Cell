6,16410,"Some of the optimized trial alloys demonstrated remarkable characteristics at 600 degrees C. Results of constant load creep experiments and steam oxidation tests indicate the potential of these alloys as candidate materials for application in highly efficient steam power plants with steam temperatures above 620 degrees C. At high stress levels some of the presented alloys, especially those containing enhanced levels of W and Nb, even exhibit higher creep strength than standard ferritic-martensitic steel P92.",Development of high chromium ferritic steels strengthened by intermetallic phases,10.1016/j.msea.2013.11.048
