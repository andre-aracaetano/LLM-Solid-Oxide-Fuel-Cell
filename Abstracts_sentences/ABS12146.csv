1,12146,Dual atmosphere conditions have been shown to be detrimental for the ferritic stainless steel interconnects used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) under certain conditions.,The effect of pre-oxidation parameters on the corrosion behavior of AISI 441 in dual atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.05.165
2,12146,"In the present work, we analyze the influence of pre-oxidation on corrosion resistance in dual atmosphere with regard to two parameters: the pre-oxidation time and the pre-oxidation location (pre-oxidation layer on the air-facing side or the hydrogen-facing side).",The effect of pre-oxidation parameters on the corrosion behavior of AISI 441 in dual atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.05.165
3,12146,"The steel AISI 441 is investigated and pre-oxidation is achieved in air at 800 degrees C. To examine the influence of pre-oxidation time on corrosion behavior, five different pre-oxidation times are used: 0, 11, 45, 180, and 280 min.",The effect of pre-oxidation parameters on the corrosion behavior of AISI 441 in dual atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.05.165
4,12146,"The samples are exposed discontinuously to dual atmosphere for 1000 h at 600 degrees C. Photographs, taken throughout the exposure, show that the pre-oxidation time correlates with the onset of breakaway corrosion.",The effect of pre-oxidation parameters on the corrosion behavior of AISI 441 in dual atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.05.165
5,12146,"To analyze the influence of pre-oxidation location on corrosion behavior, the samples are pre-oxidized for 180 min, and then a pre-oxidation layer is removed from one side of the sample.",The effect of pre-oxidation parameters on the corrosion behavior of AISI 441 in dual atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.05.165
6,12146,Subsequent dual atmosphere exposure at 600 degrees C for 500 h shows that the pre-oxidation layer on the hydrogen-facing side is more important for corrosion resistance in dual atmosphere than the pre-oxidation layer on the air-facing side.,The effect of pre-oxidation parameters on the corrosion behavior of AISI 441 in dual atmosphere,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.05.165
