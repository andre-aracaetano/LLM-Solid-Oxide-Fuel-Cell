1,14939,"Although solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks are generally considered promising devices due to their many unique advantages, there are very few experiments and reports on anode support-type SOFC stacks with tubular (T-) designs, since it is quite difficult to determine a proper external air flow path design to support proper air and heat distribution qualities compared with cathode support T-SOFC stacks.",Investigation of proper external air flow path for tubular fuel cell stacks with an anode support feature,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.036
2,14939,"In this paper, a large-scale 3D multiphysics model for the external air flow path of a convenient anode support T-SOFC stack is developed for the first time to investigate the general flow distribution characteristics of the external air flow paths.",Investigation of proper external air flow path for tubular fuel cell stacks with an anode support feature,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.036
3,14939,"A novel external air flow path for an anode support T-stack is achieved by modifying the main and sub inlet/outlet manifolds, feed/exhaust headers structures and cross-section parameters.",Investigation of proper external air flow path for tubular fuel cell stacks with an anode support feature,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.036
4,14939,This new design is proven to greatly increase the air supply qualities among the tubes and over each tube surface and decrease the temperature gradients in the entire stack.,Investigation of proper external air flow path for tubular fuel cell stacks with an anode support feature,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.036
5,14939,The design could be the proper basic form used for anode support for T-SOFC stacks to achieve good stack performance and duration time in the near future.,Investigation of proper external air flow path for tubular fuel cell stacks with an anode support feature,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.06.036
