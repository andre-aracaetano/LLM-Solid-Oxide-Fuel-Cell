1,4678,"Various kinds of fuels based on alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol) and hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, and ethylene) were directly supplied to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to compare their power generation characteristics.",Direct-alcohol/hydrocarbon SOFCs: Comparison of power generation characteristics for various fuels,10.5796/electrochemistry.70.18
2,4678,"The results on current-voltage characteristics and anodic polarization have revealed that methanol-, ethanol-, and methane-based fuels exhibited satisfactory electrochemical performance, whereas the use of other carbonaceous fuels with a higher carbon number resulted in carbon deposition and consequent degradation of power generation characteristics.",Direct-alcohol/hydrocarbon SOFCs: Comparison of power generation characteristics for various fuels,10.5796/electrochemistry.70.18
