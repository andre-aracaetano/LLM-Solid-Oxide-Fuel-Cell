2,10156,The crystal structure changed from trigonal (x = 0 or 0.25) to a mixture of trigonal and orthorhombic (x = 0.5) and to orthorhombic (x = 0.75 or 1.0).,La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xRuxO3-δ as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.111
3,10156,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis after electrochemical testing indicated that the relative concentrations of Ru4+ to Ru6+ and Mn4+ to Mn2+ influence the performance of a single cell.,La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xRuxO3-δ as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.111
4,10156,The transformation from Ru4+ to Ru6+ releases two electrons but that from Mn4+ to Mn2+ creates two electron holes (an oxygen vacancy).,La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xRuxO3-δ as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.111
5,10156,"The relative concentrations in LSMR were determined using the stoichiometric ratio (x) of Ru, and then, the concentrations of electrons and electron holes for influencing the cathode electrochemical catalytic reactivity were estimated.",La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xRuxO3-δ as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.111
