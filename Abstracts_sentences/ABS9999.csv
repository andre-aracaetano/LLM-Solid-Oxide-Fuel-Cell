1,9999,"La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (LSCF-CGO) nanostructured cathodes with different LSCF-content are prepared in a single step by spray-pyrolysis deposition, simplifying notably the fabrication process compared to the traditional methods.",LSCF-CGO nanocomposite cathodes deposited in a single step by spray-pyrolysis,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.10.010
2,9999,"The phase formation, structure, microstructure and electrochemical properties of the cathodes are investigated as a function of the CGO-content and the temperature by using X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and impedance spectroscopy.",LSCF-CGO nanocomposite cathodes deposited in a single step by spray-pyrolysis,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.10.010
3,9999,"The addition of CGO to LSCF limits the grain growth, giving rise to fine particles of approximately 30 nm of diameter after sintering at 800 degrees C. A small particle size of 50 nm is retained even after sintering at 1000 degrees C. However, the polarization resistance, determined by impedance spectroscopy, is not significantly improved with the CGO-addition.",LSCF-CGO nanocomposite cathodes deposited in a single step by spray-pyrolysis,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.10.010
4,9999,"The performance of these nanocomposite electrodes, investigated in NiO-CGO anode-supported cells, shows an improved power density of 0.9 Wcm(-2) at 650 degrees C, compared to 0.56 Wcm(-2) for a conventional screen-printed cathode.",LSCF-CGO nanocomposite cathodes deposited in a single step by spray-pyrolysis,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.10.010
