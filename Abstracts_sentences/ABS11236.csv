5,11236,"The polarization of model electrochemical cells with cermet anodes comprising Ni, yttria-stabilized zirconia and Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (50:30:20 wt.%), deposited onto the protective zirconia films, was found quite similar to that of copper-zirconia cermets without interlayers, suggesting that the electrochemical reaction is essentially governed by the oxygen anion transfer from zirconia phase and/or hydrogen oxidation in the vicinity of zirconia film surface.",Protective YSZ-based thin films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering,10.1016/j.vacuum.2009.03.020
