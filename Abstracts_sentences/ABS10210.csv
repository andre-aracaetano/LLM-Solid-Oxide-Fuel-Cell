3,10210,The dominant factors for the terminal voltage drop of the present fuel cell were the resistance of solid electrolyte and the overpotentials at both electrodes.,Electrochemical properties of solid oxide fuel cell with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte and cermet electrodes,10.2109/jcersj.113.597
4,10210,"Addition of CuO to SDC-Pt cathode and addition of SnO2 to SDC-Ni anode reduced the overpotentials at the electrodes and increased the terminal voltage and power density of the cell with SDC electrolyte (500,mu m thickness) using a 97 vol% H-2-3 vol% H2O fuel.",Electrochemical properties of solid oxide fuel cell with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte and cermet electrodes,10.2109/jcersj.113.597
