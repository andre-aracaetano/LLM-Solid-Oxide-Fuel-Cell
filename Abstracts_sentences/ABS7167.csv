3,7167,"The biochar was doped with nitrogen using NH3 evaporated from ammonia solution, as a simulated digestate liquid, and this was found to significantly improve H2S adsorption.",Development of a sustainable nitrogen-doped biochar desulfurizer for solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.106631
4,7167,"Furthermore, the total H2S adsorption capacity was 2.3 times higher compared to biochar treated with a pure NH3 gas source.",Development of a sustainable nitrogen-doped biochar desulfurizer for solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.106631
5,7167,"This improvement was attributed to lower pyridinic-N content, leading to a lower degree of O* radical formation, and ultimately, better micropore utilization.",Development of a sustainable nitrogen-doped biochar desulfurizer for solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.106631
