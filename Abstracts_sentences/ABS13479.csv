1,13479,Characteristics of 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powder prepared by spray drying of nitrate precursor solution has been reported.,Characteristics of 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia powder prepared by spray drying process,10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.01.019
2,13479,The spray dried Zr-Y nitrate powder contained spherical agglomerates of fine particles which decomposed completely on heating up to 400 degrees C and formed cubic YSZ phase on calcination at 600 degrees C for 2 h. The YSZ powder obtained after calcination was hard agglomerates of fine particles such that particle size decreased considerably with milling time.,Characteristics of 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia powder prepared by spray drying process,10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.01.019
3,13479,The agglomerates consist of primary crystallites of nearly 12 nm size.,Characteristics of 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia powder prepared by spray drying process,10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.01.019
4,13479,Sinterability of the YSZ powder prepared by the spray drying process depends on milling time and maximum sintered density of 97% of the theoretical value was achieved for the sample prepared from powder milled for 48 h. The microstructure of the sintered samples was also depends on milling time.,Characteristics of 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia powder prepared by spray drying process,10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.01.019
5,13479,Sintered YSZ ceramics without intragranular pores could be prepared from powder milled for 48 h that showed ionic conductivity value of 0.13 S/cm at 1000 degrees C suitable for solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte applications.,Characteristics of 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia powder prepared by spray drying process,10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.01.019
