1,13521,Incorporation of nanoparticles into devices such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) may provide benefits such as higher surface areas or finer control over microstructure.,Nanoparticle scaffolds for syngas-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta06029f
2,13521,"However, their use with traditional fabrication techniques such as screen-printing is problematic.",Nanoparticle scaffolds for syngas-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta06029f
3,13521,"Here, we show that mixing larger commercial particles with nanoparticles allows traditional ink formulation and screen-printing to be used while still providing benefits of nanoparticles such as increased porosity and lower sintering temperatures.",Nanoparticle scaffolds for syngas-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta06029f
4,13521,SOFC anodes were produced by impregnating ceria-gadolinia (CGO) scaffolds with nickel nitrate solution.,Nanoparticle scaffolds for syngas-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta06029f
5,13521,"The scaffolds were produced from inks containing a mixture of hydrothermally-synthesised nanoparticle CGO, commercial CGO and polymeric pore formers.",Nanoparticle scaffolds for syngas-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta06029f
6,13521,"The scaffolds were heat-treated at either 1000 or 1300 degrees C, and were mechanically stable.",Nanoparticle scaffolds for syngas-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta06029f
7,13521,In situ ultra-small X-ray scattering (USAXS) shows that the nanoparticles begin sintering around 900-1000 degrees C. Analysis by USAXS and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the low temperature heat-treated scaffolds possessed higher porosity.,Nanoparticle scaffolds for syngas-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta06029f
8,13521,"Impregnated scaffolds were used to produce symmetrical cells, with the lower temperature heat-treated scaffolds showing improved gas diffusion, but poorer charge transfer.",Nanoparticle scaffolds for syngas-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta06029f
9,13521,"Using these scaffolds, lower temperature heat-treated cells of Ni-CGO/200 mu m YSZ/CGO-LSCF performed better at 700 degrees C (and below) in hydrogen, and performed better at all temperatures using syngas, with power densities of up to 0.15 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C.",Nanoparticle scaffolds for syngas-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta06029f
10,13521,This approach has the potential to allow the use of a wider range of materials and finer control over microstructure.,Nanoparticle scaffolds for syngas-fed solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta06029f
