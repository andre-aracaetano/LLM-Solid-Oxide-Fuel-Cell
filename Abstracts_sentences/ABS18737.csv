5,18737,"At 700 degrees C, losses are dominated by ionic conduction and charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface, while oxygen adsorption and bulk diffusion provide a minor contribution to polarization.",Distribution of Relaxation Times and Equivalent Circuits Analysis of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ,10.3390/catal9050441
6,18737,"The performances of pristine materials are remarkable as a very low polarization resistance is measured at 700 degrees C. After prolonged testing at operative temperature, the BSCF cathodes show increasing total polarization resistance, especially due to progressive limitations in the migration of oxygen ions, caused by secondary phase formation.",Distribution of Relaxation Times and Equivalent Circuits Analysis of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ,10.3390/catal9050441
7,18737,DRT analysis supports the physical interpretation of phenomena taking place in the material and shows the formation of a new contribution at low frequency which can be ascribed to partial decomposition of BSCF.,Distribution of Relaxation Times and Equivalent Circuits Analysis of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ,10.3390/catal9050441
