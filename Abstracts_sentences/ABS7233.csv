1,7233,"SOFC/GT hybrid systems (HS) thanks to their high performance, in term of efficiency, emissions and fuel flexibility can represent a remarkable solution for Micro-Grids power range.",Integration of SOFC/GT hybrid systems in Micro-Grids,10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.100
2,7233,"In particular, due to the synergistic effect of using a high temperature fuel cell such as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and a recuperative gas turbine (GT), the integrated system efficiency and flexibility can be significantly increased during load following operation.",Integration of SOFC/GT hybrid systems in Micro-Grids,10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.100
3,7233,"Specifically, the goal of this paper is to demonstrate the enhanced flexibility of the hybrid plant obtained through the development of a suitable main control strategy to regulate both GT and SOFC, following a daily load demand typical of a Micro-Grid.",Integration of SOFC/GT hybrid systems in Micro-Grids,10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.100
4,7233,"In particular, in the model, thanks to the implemented thermal SOFC management, also SOFC takes part to the partialization process.",Integration of SOFC/GT hybrid systems in Micro-Grids,10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.100
5,7233,"In this way, the developed model permits to guarantee high HS efficiency performance (54.5% mean efficiency on daily basis), short time response and a wide part-load degree (up to 42.8% of nominal HS power), proving the feasibility of SOFC/GT hybrid system integration in Micro-Grids.",Integration of SOFC/GT hybrid systems in Micro-Grids,10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.100
