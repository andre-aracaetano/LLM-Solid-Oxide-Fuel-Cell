3,16215,"Cells using 50-mol% In-Sb and Sn-Sb mixtures exhibited open-circuit voltages (OCV) of 1.0 and 0.93 V, values that are identical to that of cell with pure In and Sn respectively.",Characteristics of Molten Alloys as Anodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.006112jes
4,16215,"Also similar to the pure In and Sn anodes, the impedances of these cells were initially low but increased dramatically after drawing a small amount of charge, implying formation of In(2)O(3) and SnO(2) layers at the electrolyte interface.",Characteristics of Molten Alloys as Anodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.006112jes
