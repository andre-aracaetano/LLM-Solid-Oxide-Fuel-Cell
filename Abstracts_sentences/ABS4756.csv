1,4756,The electrocatalytic performance of the impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) cathodes has been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a three-electrode configuration for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Interpretation of an inductive loop in the impedance of the impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 cathodes,10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.04.032
2,4756,"The significant inductive loop observed in the fourth quadrant was related to two factors, one is the amount of LSCF loading, the other is the testing temperatures.",Interpretation of an inductive loop in the impedance of the impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 cathodes,10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.04.032
3,4756,The inductive loop in the impedance spectra disappeared under dc bias or low oxygen partial pressure.,Interpretation of an inductive loop in the impedance of the impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 cathodes,10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.04.032
4,4756,"Based on this, the inductive loop in the impedance spectra is closely related to the excess oxygen adsorbed on the surface of electrode can be concluded.",Interpretation of an inductive loop in the impedance of the impregnated La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 cathodes,10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.04.032
