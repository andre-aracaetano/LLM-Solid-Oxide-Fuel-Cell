1,10133,Lanthanum calcium chromite (LCC) supported on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) prepared in this laboratory exhibits very good performances both as anode and cathode in a fuel cell when operated in the range of 1023 to 1173 K.,A preliminary study of a CH4/O-2 solid oxide fuel cell,
2,10133,"Ln the anodic mode it shows reactivities towards H-2, CO and CH4 oxidation with the products being CO2 and H2O. Current density of similar to 100 mA cm(-2) at the cell potential of 900 mV is achieved while the maximum output power is obtained at similar to 200 mA cm(-2), and 400 mV cell voltage and corresponds to 140 mW cm(-2).",A preliminary study of a CH4/O-2 solid oxide fuel cell,
3,10133,In the experiments the theoretical cell voltage at the open circuit condition is not achieved.,A preliminary study of a CH4/O-2 solid oxide fuel cell,
4,10133,"Very interestingly, under moderate loads the anodic selectivity is switched to CO and H-2 rather than CO2 and H2O and under high drain currents the cell behaves as an oxygen pump.",A preliminary study of a CH4/O-2 solid oxide fuel cell,
