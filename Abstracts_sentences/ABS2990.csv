4,2990,The ionic conductivity is remarkably increased by magnesium doping and La9.6Si5.7Mg0.3O26.1 has exhibited a conductivity of 30 ins cm(-1) at 800 degrees,Magnesium doped lanthanum silicate with apatite-type structure as an electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.06.026
5,2990,"C. Owing to low activation energy, the compound shows higher conductivity than yttria stabilized zirconia below 780 degrees C. Oxygen gas concentration cell measurements revealed that the compound is an oxide ion conductor.",Magnesium doped lanthanum silicate with apatite-type structure as an electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.06.026
6,2990,"A solid oxide fuel cell using La9.6Si5.7Mg0.3O26.1 as an electrolyte was found to work at 608, 706 and 805 degrees C with power densities of 1.3, 5.8 and 20.0 mW cm- 2, respectively, which demonstrates that magnesium doped lanthanum silicates can be used for IT-SOFC electrolytes.",Magnesium doped lanthanum silicate with apatite-type structure as an electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.06.026
7,2990,The low power densities are probably due to insufficient performance of Pt paste electrodes.,Magnesium doped lanthanum silicate with apatite-type structure as an electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.06.026
