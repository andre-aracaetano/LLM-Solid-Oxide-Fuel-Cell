6,7556,"By increasing the operating pressure up to 10 bar, the system efficiency increases and the temperature gradient can be minimized.",Modelling of tubular-designed solid oxide fuel cell with indirect internal reforming operation fed by different primary fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.102
7,7556,The use of a high inlet S: C ratio reduces the cooling spot at the entrance of reformer channel but the electrical efficiency is considerably decreased.,Modelling of tubular-designed solid oxide fuel cell with indirect internal reforming operation fed by different primary fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.102
8,7556,An IIR-SOFC with a counter-flow pattern (as based case) is compared with that with co-flow pattern (co-flow of air and fuel streams through fuel cell).,Modelling of tubular-designed solid oxide fuel cell with indirect internal reforming operation fed by different primary fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.102
9,7556,The IIR-SOFC with co-flow pattern provides higher voltage and a smoother temperature gradient along the system due to superior matching between heat supplied from electrochemical reaction and heat required for steam reforming reaction; thus it is expected to be a better option for practical applications.,Modelling of tubular-designed solid oxide fuel cell with indirect internal reforming operation fed by different primary fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.102
