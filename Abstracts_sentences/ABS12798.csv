1,12798,Composites formed by infiltration of 45 wt % La(0.3)Sr(0.7)TiO(3) (LST) into 65% porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were examined for application as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes.,SOFC anodes based on infiltration of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3,10.1149/1.2976775
2,12798,"Although LST does not react with YSZ, the structure of the LST deposits was strongly affected by the calcination temperature.",SOFC anodes based on infiltration of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3,10.1149/1.2976775
3,12798,"At 1373 K, the LST formed loosely packed, 0.1 mu m particles that filled the YSZ pores.",SOFC anodes based on infiltration of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3,10.1149/1.2976775
4,12798,The conductivity of this composite depended strongly on the pretreatment conditions but was greater than 0.4 S/cm after heating to 1173 K in humidified (3% H(2)O) H(2).,SOFC anodes based on infiltration of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3,10.1149/1.2976775
5,12798,"Following calcination at 1573 K, the LST had sintered significantly, decreasing the conductivity of the composite by a factor of approximately 5.",SOFC anodes based on infiltration of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3,10.1149/1.2976775
6,12798,"The addition of a catalyst was critical for achieving reasonable electrochemical performance, with the addition of 0.5 wt % Pd and 5 wt % ceria increasing the power density of otherwise identical cells from less than 20 to 780 mW/cm(2) for operation in humidified (3% H(2)O) H(2) at 1073 K. Electrodes prepared from LST deposits calcined at 1373 K were found to exhibit a much better performance than those prepared from LST deposits calcined at 1573 K, demonstrating that the structure of the composite is critical for achieving high performance.",SOFC anodes based on infiltration of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3,10.1149/1.2976775
