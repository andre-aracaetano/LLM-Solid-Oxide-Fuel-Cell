1,6803,A model-based Design of Experiments method was employed for the optimization of measurements on a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Investigating Reliability on Fuel Cell Model Identification. Part I: A Design of Experiments Approach,10.1002/fuce.201100036
2,6803,"Based on a simplified SOFC model, a variation of the D-optimality was used as optimization criterion for the calculation of optimal experimental designs (determinant of the covariance matrix with weighting factors).",Investigating Reliability on Fuel Cell Model Identification. Part I: A Design of Experiments Approach,10.1002/fuce.201100036
3,6803,Solutions for different numbers of design points were calculated and the behavior of optimization criteria as functions of the number of design points as well as of the number of repetitions of measurements was analyzed.,Investigating Reliability on Fuel Cell Model Identification. Part I: A Design of Experiments Approach,10.1002/fuce.201100036
4,6803,A new type of graph was introduced which depicts the behavior of optimization criteria for constant number of measurements.,Investigating Reliability on Fuel Cell Model Identification. Part I: A Design of Experiments Approach,10.1002/fuce.201100036
5,6803,"This approach showed that, for constant numbers of measurements, the precision is higher and therefore the reliability in the cell's model identification is improved when repeated measurements of a small set of optimal design points are effectuated, instead of many different measurements.",Investigating Reliability on Fuel Cell Model Identification. Part I: A Design of Experiments Approach,10.1002/fuce.201100036
6,6803,"Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed showing the influence of the parameter values on the values of the optimization criterion and the optimal measurements.",Investigating Reliability on Fuel Cell Model Identification. Part I: A Design of Experiments Approach,10.1002/fuce.201100036
7,6803,The used methodology and its theoretical conclusions may be used as a basis for development of diagnostics tools or filtering existing data for optimal parameter estimations.,Investigating Reliability on Fuel Cell Model Identification.
