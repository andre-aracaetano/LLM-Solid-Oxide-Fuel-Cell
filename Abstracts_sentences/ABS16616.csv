1,16616,"This study investigated the combined effects of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), planetary ball-mill (PBM) treatment, and sintering temperature on La0.7Sr0.3Ga0.7Mg0.1Fe0.2O3-delta (LSGMF73712) as an electrolyte material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).","Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La(Sr)Ga(Mg, Fe)O3-δ with planetary ball-mill treatment for solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes",10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.05.075
2,16616,The SHS products (SHS-LSGMF73712) were compared with that prepared via solid-state reaction (SSR) in terms of sinterability and power generation performance.,"Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La(Sr)Ga(Mg, Fe)O3-δ with planetary ball-mill treatment for solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes",10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.05.075
3,16616,"The SHS products were treated with PBM for 10, 30, 50, and 70 h. The SHS products contained the by-product LaSrGaO4; however, in the SHS products treated with PBM for longer than 50 h, the by-product disappeared after sintering at 1350 degrees C for 3 h in air.","Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La(Sr)Ga(Mg, Fe)O3-δ with planetary ball-mill treatment for solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes",10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.05.075
4,16616,"Among the samples, SHS products treated with PBM for 70 h displayed superior sintering (1350 degrees C), whereas the SSR product (SSR-LSGMF73712) was successfully sintered at 1450 degrees C for 3 h in air.","Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La(Sr)Ga(Mg, Fe)O3-δ with planetary ball-mill treatment for solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes",10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.05.075
5,16616,"Under the cell configuration of Ni-Fe/SHS-LSGMF73712-PBM70h (0.3 mm thick)/Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3, the maximum power density was 0.673 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C using humidified hydrogen gas (3 mol% H2O) as a fuel and air as an oxidizing agent at a flow rate of 100 mL/min, which was almost equivalent to that using SSR-LSGMF73712 (0.629 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C) under the same conditions.","Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La(Sr)Ga(Mg, Fe)O3-δ with planetary ball-mill treatment for solid oxide fuel cell electrolytes",10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.05.075
