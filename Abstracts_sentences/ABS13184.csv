2,13184,"Here we demonstrate the use of Raman spectroscopy to perform local thermal and temporal measurements, both of which are essential if phase formation diagrams are to be mapped out and compared to thermodynamic phase stability predictions.",Raman spectroscopy as a probe of temperature and oxidation state for gadolinium-doped ceria used in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1021/jp076361j
3,13184,We find that the time resolution of the Raman technique is more than sufficient to capture essential dynamic effects associated with a change of chemical composition.,Raman spectroscopy as a probe of temperature and oxidation state for gadolinium-doped ceria used in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1021/jp076361j
