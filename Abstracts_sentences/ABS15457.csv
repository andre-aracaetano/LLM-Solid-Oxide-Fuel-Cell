2,15457,"In conventional anodes, percolation of the Ni phase for acceptable conductivity requires relatively high Ni contents (i.e., > 35 vol% of solids) which can reduce cell reliability due to increased coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch with the YSZ electrolyte and damage produced by redox cycling.",Development and Characterization of Porous Composites for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Conduction Layers Using Ceramic-Filled Highly Porous Ni Foam,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02889.x

7,15457,"For example, a Ni foam-YSZ composite with a nickel loading of 13 vol% has a CTE of 10.7 x 10(-6) K(-1), but with a similar electrical conductivity to a conventional anode (similar to 3000 S/cm) which requires at least 30 vol% Ni resulting in a CTE > 13 x 10(-6) K(-1).",Development and Characterization of Porous Composites for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Conduction Layers Using Ceramic-Filled Highly Porous Ni Foam,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02889.x
