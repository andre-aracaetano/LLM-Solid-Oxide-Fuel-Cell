1,7595,"LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (LNF), LNF-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC), and LNF-SDC-Ag cathodes on SDC electrolytes were investigated at intermediate temperatures using AC impedance spectroscopy.",LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9-Ag composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.05.135
2,7595,"Results show that adding 50 wt.% SDC into LNF yields a significant low area specific resistance (ASR) which was found to be 0.92 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Infiltrating 0.3 mg/cm(2) Ag into LNF-50 wt.% SDC can improve the electronic conductivity and oxygen exchange reaction activity, and thereby remarkably decrease the ASRs.",LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9-Ag composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.05.135
3,7595,"The ASR value of the LNF-SDC-Ag cathode is as low as 0.18 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, and 0.46 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C.",LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9-Ag composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.05.135
