1,12021,"Oxides of composition SrMo1-xFexO3-delta (x=0.1, 0.2) have been prepared, characterized and tested as anode materials in single solid-oxide fuel cells, yielding output powers close to 900 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C with pure H-2 as a fuel.",Optimized energy conversion efficiency in solid-oxide fuel cells implementing SrMo1-xFexO3-δ perovskites as anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.02.002
2,12021,"This excellent performance is accounted for the results of an in situ neutron powder diffraction experiment, at the working temperature of the SOFC, showing the presence of a sufficiently high oxygen deficiency, with large displacement factors for oxygen atoms that suggest a large lability and mobility, combined with a huge metal-like electronic conductivity, as high as 340S cm(-1) at T=50 degrees C for x=0.1.",Optimized energy conversion efficiency in solid-oxide fuel cells implementing SrMo1-xFexO3-δ perovskites as anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.02.002
