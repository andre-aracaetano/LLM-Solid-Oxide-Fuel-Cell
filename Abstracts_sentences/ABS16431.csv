3,16431,"High-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imaging is used to visualize, for the first time, the extent of Ni diffusion into screen-printed microcrystalline YSZ electrolytes of approximately 2-3 & mu;m thickness, due to the high temperature (typically >1300 & DEG;C) used in the conventional sintering process.",Elucidating the performance benefits enabled by YSZ/Ni-YSZ bilayer thin films in a porous anode-supported cell architecture,10.1039/d3nr01604h
4,16431,"As an alternative approach, dense YSZ thin films and Ni(O)-YSZ nanocomposite layers are prepared using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at a relatively low temperature of 750 & DEG;C. YSZ thin films exhibit densely packed nanocrystalline grains and a remarkable suppression of Ni diffusion, which are further associated with some reduction in the ohmic resistance of the cell, especially in the low temperature regime.",Elucidating the performance benefits enabled by YSZ/Ni-YSZ bilayer thin films in a porous anode-supported cell architecture,10.1039/d3nr01604h
5,16431,"Moreover, the use of a Ni-YSZ nanocomposite layer resulted in improved contact at the YSZ/anode interface as well as a higher density of triple phase boundaries due to the nanoscale Ni and YSZ grains being homogeneously distributed throughout the structure.",Elucidating the performance benefits enabled by YSZ/Ni-YSZ bilayer thin films in a porous anode-supported cell architecture,10.1039/d3nr01604h
