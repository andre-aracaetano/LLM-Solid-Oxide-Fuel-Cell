1,12757,The creation of A-site cation defects within a perovskite oxide can substantially alter the structure and properties of its stoichiometric analogue.,Influence of crystal structure on the electrochemical performance of A-site-deficient Sr1-sNb0.1Co0.9O3-δ perovskite cathodes,10.1039/c4ra06191h
2,12757,"In this work, we demonstrate that by vacating 2 and 5% of A-site cations from SrNb0.1Co0.9O3-delta (SNC1.00) perovskites (Sr1-sNb0.1Co0.9O3-delta, s = 0.02 and 0.05; denoted as SNC0.98 and SNC0.95, respectively), a Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion with varying extents takes place, leading to the formation of a modified crystal lattice within a the perovskite framework.",Influence of crystal structure on the electrochemical performance of A-site-deficient Sr1-sNb0.1Co0.9O3-δ perovskite cathodes,10.1039/c4ra06191h
3,12757,"Electrical conductivity, electrochemical performance, chemical compatibility and microstructure of Sr1-sNb0.1Co0.9O3-delta as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells were evaluated.",Influence of crystal structure on the electrochemical performance of A-site-deficient Sr1-sNb0.1Co0.9O3-δ perovskite cathodes,10.1039/c4ra06191h
4,12757,"Among SNC1.00, SNC0.98 and SNC0.95, SNC0.95 (P4/mmm symmetry (#123)) which exhibits a large JT distortion in conjunction with charge-ordering of cobalt (Co) shows the best oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity at low temperature while SNC0.98 (P4mm symmetry (#99)), which displays a local JT distortion, shows the poorest performance.",Influence of crystal structure on the electrochemical performance of A-site-deficient Sr1-sNb0.1Co0.9O3-δ perovskite cathodes,10.1039/c4ra06191h
