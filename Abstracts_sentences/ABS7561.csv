1,7561,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) hybrid cycle power plant system is expected to be a higher efficiency energy system than a conventional gas turbine combined cycle system (GTCC).,Optimal design and operation of a SOFC-GTCC hybrid cycle power plant system,10.1252/kakoronbunshu.33.453
2,7561,The optimal design and operational conditions of a SOFC-GTCC hybrid system were derived by using static principle models.,Optimal design and operation of a SOFC-GTCC hybrid cycle power plant system,10.1252/kakoronbunshu.33.453
3,7561,Results showed that the electrical efficiency of a 100 MW pressurized topping cycle system can be more than 70% on the basis of high heating value.,Optimal design and operation of a SOFC-GTCC hybrid cycle power plant system,10.1252/kakoronbunshu.33.453
4,7561,"On the other hand, the electrical efficiency of the SOFC-GTCC hybrid system minimizing the life cycle cost decreased to 67%, because the initial cost of SOFC is much higher than that of GTCC.",Optimal design and operation of a SOFC-GTCC hybrid cycle power plant system,10.1252/kakoronbunshu.33.453
5,7561,The SOFC-GTCC system showed robustness to load changes during operation when it was designed through a multi-period optimization.,Optimal design and operation of a SOFC-GTCC hybrid cycle power plant system,10.1252/kakoronbunshu.33.453
