1,12806,"Understanding the sintering processes extensively is critical in fabricating a flat cell for solid oxide fuel cell stacks, but few have reported the sintering process and stress development during the constrained sintering of the electrolyte layer on anode substrate.",Constrained sintering of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte on anode substrate,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.010
2,12806,"In this study, we show that the green tape of half cell fabricated by co-tape casting cracks into several pieces when it is heated directly to 1400 degrees C of profile I, while it remains flat and complete when the green tape is sintered with additional pre-sintered profile at 1300 degrees C of profile II.",Constrained sintering of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte on anode substrate,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.010
3,12806,"The strain rate characteristics indicate that the difference of 2.43 x 10(-6) s(-1) between the electrolyte and the anode layer leads to the stress development in the directly sintered cell, while it reduces to 6.7 x 10(-8)",Constrained sintering of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte on anode substrate,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.010

5,12806,"The stress based on continuum model calculated results in the sintered cell demonstrates that the stress increases from 0 at about 1000 degrees C to 2.60 MPa at 1300 degrees C, and increased from 2.60 MPa to 6.54 MPa in temperature range of 1300-1400 degrees C.",Constrained sintering of Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte on anode substrate,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.010
