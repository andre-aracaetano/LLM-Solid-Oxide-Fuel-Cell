2,7478,"These aimed to address the outstanding technological and economic issues that have delayed mass production of SOFCs, by increasing electrode surface areas per unit volume relative to planar structures, increasing power outputs per unit volume/mass, facilitating sealing at high temperatures, and decreasing fabrication costs per kW. Some recent experimental results are presented of the effects of temperature, hydrogen flow rate, thermal cycling and time of NiO reduction with H-2 on the subsequent performance of 25 mm long H-2|Ni-CGO|CGO|LSCF|air MT-SOFCs, incorporating cerium-gadolinium oxide (CGO) electrolyte, nickel anodes and lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite-CGO (LSCF-CGO) cermet cathodes, designed to operate at 500-600 A degrees C. Maximum power densities of 3-5.5 kW m(-2) were achieved as the temperature was increased from 550-600 A degrees C. The co-extruded MT-SOFCs were resilient to three thermal cycles when heated to operating temperature in ca.",Micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells fabricated from hollow fibres,10.1007/s10800-011-0334-8
