1,8136,"This paper investigates the performance of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with two types of solid electrolytes, namely oxygen ion-conducting (SOFC-O2-) and proton-conducting electrolytes (SOFC-H+).",Performance of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells: Proton and oxygen ion conductors,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.003
2,8136,Our previous work reported that the SOFC-H+ shows superior theoretical performance over the SOFC-O2- electrolyte.,Performance of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells: Proton and oxygen ion conductors,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.003
3,8136,"However, in this work when all resistances are taken into account, the actual performance of the SOFC-O2- (Ni-YSZ/YSZ/YSZ-LSM) becomes significantly better than that of SOFC-H+ (Pt/SCY/Pt).",Performance of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells: Proton and oxygen ion conductors,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.003
4,8136,"The maximum power density of the SOFC-O2- is about 34 times higher than that of the SOFC-H+ when operated at an inlet H2O:EtOH ratio of 3, a fuel utilization factor of 80% and a temperature of 1200 K.",Performance of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells: Proton and oxygen ion conductors,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.003
5,8136,Then the required values of the total resistance of the SOFC-H+ to achieve the same power density as the SOFC-O2- were determined.,Performance of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells: Proton and oxygen ion conductors,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.003
6,8136,"It was found that due to the superior theoretical performance of the SOFC-H+, it is not necessary to reduce the SOFC-H+ total resistance to the same values as the one for SOFC-O2-.",Performance of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells: Proton and oxygen ion conductors,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.003
7,8136,"The study also indicates that reduction of only the electrolyte resistance is not sufficient to improve the SOFC-H+ performance and, therefore, the other resistances including activation, electrodes and interconnect resistances need to be reduced simultaneously.",Performance of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells: Proton and oxygen ion conductors,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.003
8,8136,"Finally, the improvement of the electrolyte resistance by changing its resistivity and thickness is discussed.",Performance of ethanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells: Proton and oxygen ion conductors,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.003
