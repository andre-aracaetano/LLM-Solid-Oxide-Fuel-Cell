4,13003,"In order to better understand the influence mechanism of corrugated electrolyte, not only the effect of the corrugated electrolyte on the overall cell performance is analyzed, but also the local gas distribution, concentration polarization, activation polarization, exchange current density and electron current density are discussed.",Three-Dimensional Modeling of Anode-Supported Planar SOFC with Corrugated Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2974
5,13003,"The results show that the corrugated electrolyte leads to a decrease in the local exchange current density, but the enlargement of the activation reaction zone leads to an increase in the total charge transfer, thereby resulting in an improvement in cell performance.",Three-Dimensional Modeling of Anode-Supported Planar SOFC with Corrugated Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2974
