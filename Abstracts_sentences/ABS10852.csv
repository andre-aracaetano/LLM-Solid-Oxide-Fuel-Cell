1,10852,Non-stoichiometric oxides are key functional materials within technologies such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and gas sensors that often exhibit interdependent electrochemical and mechanical properties affecting operando mechanical stability.,"Operando reduction of elastic modulus in (Pr, Ce)O2-δ thin films",10.1016/j.actamat.2015.12.007
2,10852,"Here, we explore this electrochemomechanical coupling experimentally and computationally for (Pr, Ce)O2-delta (PCO), a model SOFC cathode material.","Operando reduction of elastic modulus in (Pr, Ce)O2-δ thin films",10.1016/j.actamat.2015.12.007
3,10852,"We quantified Young's elastic modulus E of PCO thin films in situ, at temperatures up to 600 degrees C and oxygen partial pressures pO(2) down to 10(-3) atm via environmentally controlled nanoindentation.","Operando reduction of elastic modulus in (Pr, Ce)O2-δ thin films",10.1016/j.actamat.2015.12.007
4,10852,The observed significant reduction (up to 40%) in E with increased temperature or decreased pO(2) correlated with changes in oxygen vacancy concentration delta and lattice parameter a expected due to chemical expansion.,"Operando reduction of elastic modulus in (Pr, Ce)O2-δ thin films",10.1016/j.actamat.2015.12.007
5,10852,We confirmed the trend of decreased E with increased delta and a via first principles calculations for bulk PCO.,"Operando reduction of elastic modulus in (Pr, Ce)O2-δ thin films",10.1016/j.actamat.2015.12.007
6,10852,"The experimentally observed decrease in E vs. pO(2) and temperature was more extreme than predicted by bulk computations, and is anticipated from the higher concentration of vacancies in thin films relative to bulk.","Operando reduction of elastic modulus in (Pr, Ce)O2-δ thin films",10.1016/j.actamat.2015.12.007
7,10852,"These results demonstrate that accurate models of deformation in thin-film devices comprising these chemomechanically coupled oxides may differ markedly from bulk counterparts, and must reflect significant, reversible decreases in elastic moduli resulting from increased temperature and decreased pO(2).","Operando reduction of elastic modulus in (Pr, Ce)O2-δ thin films",10.1016/j.actamat.2015.12.007
