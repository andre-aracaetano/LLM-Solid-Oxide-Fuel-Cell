1,17360,LZSA glass ceramic (LiO2-ZrO2-SiO2-Al2O3) was tested for its thermomechanical compatibility as a sealing material with a stainless steel interconnect (AISI 430) of a planar SOFC.,Development of Alternative Glass Ceramic Seal for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1155/2012/346280
2,17360,"With this purpose, the densification and crystallization behavior of LZSA were investigated initially.",Development of Alternative Glass Ceramic Seal for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1155/2012/346280
3,17360,"It was observed that the material reached maximum relative density and shrinkage, respectively 95% and 17%, at 800 degrees C, which corresponded approximately to the crystallization temperature of the material as evidenced by DTA analysis.",Development of Alternative Glass Ceramic Seal for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1155/2012/346280
4,17360,"In the next step, LZSA tapes were cast from slurries and prepared either as LZSA laminates or LZSA-steel bilayers.",Development of Alternative Glass Ceramic Seal for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1155/2012/346280
5,17360,"The densification behavior and microstructural features of cofired LZSA laminates and LZSA-steel bilayers were analyzed at 800 and 900 degrees C. Maximum relative density and defect-free interfaces were observed for laminates and bi-layers cofired at 800 degrees C, whereas increased porosity and detached bi-layer were the characteristics of the samples fired at 900 degrees C.",Development of Alternative Glass Ceramic Seal for a Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1155/2012/346280
