1,18030,"This study proposes a novel microwave-matrix reformer (MMR) to convert biogas, a greenhouse gas that causes climate change, into high-quality fuel energy.",Development of Microwave-Matrix Partial Oxidation Reformer,
2,18030,"To show its performance potential, it has identified the characteristics of biogas conversion and product gas for O-2/C ratio, steam feed, reformed gas recirculation, and water supply in the recirculation pipe, which affect CH4 and CO2 conversions.",Development of Microwave-Matrix Partial Oxidation Reformer,
3,18030,The reforming characteristics for different variables were achieved and the results are as follows.,Development of Microwave-Matrix Partial Oxidation Reformer,
4,18030,"The optimal conditions of the MMR were 100% recirculation rate and 10 mL/min water feed rate when O-2/C ratio and total gas supply were 1 and 30L/min, respectively.",Development of Microwave-Matrix Partial Oxidation Reformer,
5,18030,"Under these conditions, CH4 conversion was 68.6%, CO2 conversion was 37.9%, H-2 selectivity was 88.1%, and H-2/CO was 1.54, which were resonable for applying to stack for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell.",Development of Microwave-Matrix Partial Oxidation Reformer,
