2,12643,"In this study, bismuth-doped Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-delta (Pr0.4Bi0.1Ba0.5MnO3-delta, Bi-PBM) is proposed and investigated as a symmetrical electrode material for SSOFCs.",A highly efficient bismuth substitution induced A-site ordered layered perovskite electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2ta08892d
3,12643,"A-Site ordered Pr0.8Bi0.2BaMn2O5+delta (L-Bi-PBM) is obtained by in situ annealing disordered Bi-PBM at 800 degrees C for 10 h. With the substitution of bismuth in Pr-sites, the catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction and fuel oxidation can be enhanced significantly owing to the improved oxygen diffusion efficiency.",A highly efficient bismuth substitution induced A-site ordered layered perovskite electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2ta08892d
