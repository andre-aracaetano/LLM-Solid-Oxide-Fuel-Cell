6,19272,"Although X-ray diffraction identified the structure of both oxides as cubic perovskite with Pm3m space group, electron diffraction found in the LTS oxide the incomplete formation of an ordered superstructure with a Cmmm space group, in contrast to only the shortrange ordering in the HTS oxide.",Influence of synthesis temperature on oxygen exchange behavior of electrode material PrBaFe2O6_d,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116339

8,19272,"These results, however, can reflect only a peculiarity of the LTS oxide state with disordered anion sublattice at high temperature and does not mean unambiguous independence of oxygen exchange behavior on thermodynamic parameters of the oxidation reaction.",Influence of synthesis temperature on oxygen exchange behavior of electrode material PrBaFe2O6_d,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116339
