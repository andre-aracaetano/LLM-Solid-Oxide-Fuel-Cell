1,11153,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been under great consideration during this last decade and much effort has been dedicated to model their thermo-mechanical behavior, trying to take into account the different properties of the materials, such as their elasticity.",Young's modulus of some SOFCs materials as a function of temperature,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.05.009
2,11153,"In this paper, we report the elastic behavior of three classical materials used in SOFCs as a function of temperature: Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), La0.8Sr0.21MnO3 (LSM) and Ni-YSZ.",Young's modulus of some SOFCs materials as a function of temperature,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.05.009
3,11153,Both YSZ and LSM present unusual behaviors.,Young's modulus of some SOFCs materials as a function of temperature,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.05.009
4,11153,"The elastic modulus of YSZ first decreases slowly up to 150 degrees C, then dramatically up to 550 degrees C (certainly due to atomic motion) and finally increases probably because of an order-disorder transition (oxygen vacancies).",Young's modulus of some SOFCs materials as a function of temperature,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.05.009
5,11153,The state of the art on zirconia was reviewed.,Young's modulus of some SOFCs materials as a function of temperature,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.05.009
6,11153,"For the LSM material, Young's modulus could not be determined below 600 degrees C. Above this temperature, samples with totally closed porosity present a continuously increasing modulus, while the other samples have a quite constant modulus.",Young's modulus of some SOFCs materials as a function of temperature,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.05.009
