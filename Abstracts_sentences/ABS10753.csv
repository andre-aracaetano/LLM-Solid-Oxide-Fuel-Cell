1,10753,"In this study, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) consisting of a NiO-YSZ anode, a NiO/YSZ-YSZ functional layer, YSZ electrolyte and a (La0.8Sr0.2)MnO3 + yttria-stabilized zirconia (LSM-YSZ) cathode were fabricated by tape-casting, lamination, and a co-firing process.",Fabrication and characterization of planar-type SOFC unit cells using the tape-casting/lamination/co-firing method,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.011
2,10753,NiO/YSZ-YSZ nano-composite powder was synthesized for the anode functional layer via the Pechini process in order to improve cell performance.,Fabrication and characterization of planar-type SOFC unit cells using the tape-casting/lamination/co-firing method,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.011
3,10753,"After optimization of the slurries for the anode functional anode, electrolyte and cathode, all components were casted so as to fabricate the monolithic laminate.",Fabrication and characterization of planar-type SOFC unit cells using the tape-casting/lamination/co-firing method,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.011
4,10753,The co-firing temperature was optimized to minimize second phase formation between the (La0.8Sr0.2)MnO3 (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and to increase the sinterability of the YSZ electrolyte.,Fabrication and characterization of planar-type SOFC unit cells using the tape-casting/lamination/co-firing method,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.011
5,10753,"The YSZ electrolyte was fully sintered with the addition of 0.5 wt% CuO, and the second phases of La2Zr2O7 and SrZrO3 did not form at 1350 degrees C. Ni-YSZ anode-supported unit cells were fabricated by co-firing at 1250-1400 degrees C.",Fabrication and characterization of planar-type SOFC unit cells using the tape-casting/lamination/co-firing method,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.011
6,10753,"The unit cells co-fired at 1250 degrees C, 1300 degrees C, 1325 degrees C, 1350 degrees C and 1400 degrees C had maximum power densities of 0.18, 0.18, 0.30, 0.46 and 0.036 W/cm(2), respectively, in humidified hydrogen (similar to 3% H2O) and air at 800 degrees C.
