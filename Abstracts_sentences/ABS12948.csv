1,12948,"In this work, we report a systematic study on temperature-dependent local structural evolution, oxygen stoichiometry, and electrochemical properties of an oxygen-deficient perovskite Sr0.2Y0.3CoO3-delta (SYC30) for oxygen electrocatalysis.",Understanding Structure-Activity Relationships in Sr1-xYxCoO3-δ through in Situ Neutron Diffraction and Electrochemical Measurements,10.1021/acsami.8b12943
2,12948,The obtained results are then closely compared with its analogue Sr0.9Y0.1CoO3-delta (SYC10) of different crystal structures to establish structure-activity relationships.,Understanding Structure-Activity Relationships in Sr1-xYxCoO3-δ through in Situ Neutron Diffraction and Electrochemical Measurements,10.1021/acsami.8b12943
3,12948,The comparison shows that both SYC30 and SYC10 consist of alternate layers of oxygen-deficient Co1-polyhedra and oxygen-saturated Co-2-octahedra with Co1-polyhedra being responsible for V-o(center dot center dot) migration.,Understanding Structure-Activity Relationships in Sr1-xYxCoO3-δ through in Situ Neutron Diffraction and Electrochemical Measurements,10.1021/acsami.8b12943
4,12948,"It is also found that the distribution and concentration of oxygen vacancies within the Co1-layer are, respectively, less symmetrical and lower in SYC30 than those in SYC10, making the former unfavorable for oxygen transport.",Understanding Structure-Activity Relationships in Sr1-xYxCoO3-δ through in Situ Neutron Diffraction and Electrochemical Measurements,10.1021/acsami.8b12943
5,12948,"A molecular orbital energy analysis reveals that the energy gap between Fermi level and O 2p level in the active Co1-polyhedra is larger in SYC30 than that in SYC10, further suggesting that SYC10 is a better oxide-ion conductor and thus a better electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction, which is unambiguously confirmed by the subsequent electrochemical measurements.",Understanding Structure-Activity Relationships in Sr1-xYxCoO3-δ through in Situ Neutron Diffraction and Electrochemical Measurements,10.1021/acsami.8b12943
