1,15896,Physicochemical properties of La1-xBaxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LBCF) oxides are presented in aspect of their possible application as cathode materials in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC).,La1-xBaxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskites for application in intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.05.025
2,15896,"The obtained results show that the increase of concentration of Ba2+ leads to an increase of unit cell volume and to a decrease of crystal structure distortion, which is accompanied by an increase of the level of oxygen nonstoichiometry in the studied compounds.",La1-xBaxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskites for application in intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.05.025
3,15896,"For samples with x >= 0.6 cubic structure was observed, which is particularly worth noting for BaCo0.2Fe0.8O3-delta composition, as both BaCoO3-delta and BaFeO3-delta often, but depending on oxygen nonstoichiometry delta, adopt hexagonal-type structure.",La1-xBaxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskites for application in intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.05.025
4,15896,"Electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient data of the materials are quite similar, comparing to La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-delta oxides.",La1-xBaxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskites for application in intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.05.025
5,15896,"For samples with barium content >= 0.6, at high temperatures, a clearly visible maximum on electrical conductivity dependence on temperature can be seen, which may be related to a significant increase of the oxygen nonstoichiometry.",La1-xBaxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskites for application in intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.05.025
6,15896,"The highest conductivity in the intermediate temperature range (600-800 degrees C) was observed for La0.6Ba0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta composition, however obtained values are significantly lower, comparing to strontium analog: La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta.",La1-xBaxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskites for application in intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.05.025
7,15896,"La0.6Ba0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta oxide was used as the cathode material in custom-made button-type IT-SOFCs, which properties were evaluated in 600-800 degrees C temperature range.",La1-xBaxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskites for application in intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.05.025
8,15896,"Additionally, chemical stability of that material in relation to Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 electrolyte was studied.",La1-xBaxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-δ perovskites for application in intermediate temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.05.025
