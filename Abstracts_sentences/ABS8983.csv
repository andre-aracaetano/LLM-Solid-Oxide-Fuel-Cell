1,8983,The degradation of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (ITSOFC) cathodes has been identified as a major issue limiting the development of ITSOFCs as high efficiency energy conversion devices.,Degradation of (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes at the Nanometer Scale and below,10.1021/acsami.6b05290
2,8983,"In this work, the effect of Cr poisoning on (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.93)(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-delta (LSCF6428), a particularly promising ITSOFC cathode material, was investigated on symmetrical cells using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and multiscale structural/chemical analysis by advanced electron and ion microscopy.",Degradation of (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes at the Nanometer Scale and below,10.1021/acsami.6b05290
3,8983,"The systematic combination of bulk and high-resolution analysis on the same cells allows, for the first time, direct correlation of Cr induced performance degradation with subtle and localized structural/chemical changes of the cathode down to the atomic scale.",Degradation of (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes at the Nanometer Scale and below,10.1021/acsami.6b05290
4,8983,"Up to 2 orders of magnitude reduction in conductivity, oxygen surface exchange rate, and diffusivity were observed in Cr poisoned LSCF6428 samples.",Degradation of (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes at the Nanometer Scale and below,10.1021/acsami.6b05290
5,8983,"These effects are associated with the formation of nanometer size SrCrO4; grain boundary segregation of Cr; enhanced B -site element exsolution (both Fe and Co); and reduction in the Fe valence, the latter two being related to Cr substitution in LSCF.",Degradation of (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes at the Nanometer Scale and below,10.1021/acsami.6b05290
6,8983,The finding that significant degradation of the cathode happens before obvious microscale change points to new critical SOFC degradation mechanisms effective at the nanometer scale and below.,Degradation of (La0.6Sr0.4)0.95(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes at the Nanometer Scale and below,10.1021/acsami.6b05290
