1,9759,The study examines the effect of using low nickel (Ni) with high ceria (CeO2) anode content towards the oxidation of H-2 and CH4 fuel by evaluating the activation energy of the ohmic process and charge transfer process.,"Low Nickel, Ceria Zirconia-Based Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A Study of Composition and Oxidation Using Hydrogen and Methane Fuel",10.3390/su132413789
2,9759,"Using a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SOFC), the anodes are made up of 50% YSZ with varying NiO:CeO2 percentages from 0% NiO, 50% CeO2 to 50% NiO, 0% CeO2.","Low Nickel, Ceria Zirconia-Based Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A Study of Composition and Oxidation Using Hydrogen and Methane Fuel",10.3390/su132413789
3,9759,"The performance is measured based on maximum power density (MPD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and activation energy, E-a of the ohmic (Rohm) and charge transfer (R-ct) processes.","Low Nickel, Ceria Zirconia-Based Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A Study of Composition and Oxidation Using Hydrogen and Methane Fuel",10.3390/su132413789
4,9759,"We found that by lowering the Ni content to lower than 50% NiO, anode conductivity will drop by 7-fold.","Low Nickel, Ceria Zirconia-Based Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A Study of Composition and Oxidation Using Hydrogen and Methane Fuel",10.3390/su132413789
5,9759,"An anode containing 37.5% NiO, 12.5% CeO2 yield MPD of 41.1 and 2.9 mW cm(-2) when tested on H-2 and CH4 fuels thus have the lowest Ni content without an abrupt negative effect on the MPD and EIS.","Low Nickel, Ceria Zirconia-Based Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A Study of Composition and Oxidation Using Hydrogen and Methane Fuel",10.3390/su132413789
6,9759,"The significant effect of conductivity drops on MPD and EIS are observed to occur at 25% NiO, 25% CeO2 and lower NiO content.","Low Nickel, Ceria Zirconia-Based Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A Study of Composition and Oxidation Using Hydrogen and Methane Fuel",10.3390/su132413789
7,9759,"However, anode content of 25% NiO, 25% CeO2 has the lowest E-a for R-ct (29.74 kJ mol(-1)) for operation in CH4, making it the best anode composition to oxidize CH4.","Low Nickel, Ceria Zirconia-Based Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A Study of Composition and Oxidation Using Hydrogen and Methane Fuel",10.3390/su132413789
8,9759,"As a conclusion, an anode containing 25% NiO:25% CeO2:50% YSZ and 37.5% NiO:12.5% CeO2:50% YSZ shows promising results in becoming the low Ni anode for coking-tolerant SOFC.","Low Nickel, Ceria Zirconia-Based Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A Study of Composition and Oxidation Using Hydrogen and Methane Fuel",10.3390/su132413789
