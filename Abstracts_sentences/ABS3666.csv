2,3666,Of particular interest are advanced lightweight planar cells for electricity supply units in cars and other mobile systems.,High-velocity DC-VPS for diffusion and protecting barrier layers in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1361/105996306X146758
3,3666,"Such cells, in one new design, consist mainly of metallic parts, for example, of ferrite steels.",High-velocity DC-VPS for diffusion and protecting barrier layers in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1361/105996306X146758
4,3666,These cells shall operate in the temperature range of 700 to 800 degrees C where oxidation and diffusion processes can be of detrimental effect on cell performance for long-term operation.,High-velocity DC-VPS for diffusion and protecting barrier layers in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1361/105996306X146758
5,3666,"Problems arise in particular by diffusion of chromium species from the interconnect or the cell containment into the electrolyte/cathode interface forming insulating phases and by the mutual diffusion of substrate and anode material, for example, iron and chromium from the ferrite into the anode and nickel from the anode into the ferrite, which in both cases reduces performance and system lifetime.",High-velocity DC-VPS for diffusion and protecting barrier layers in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1361/105996306X146758
6,3666,"Additional intermediate layers of perovskite-type material, (e.g., doped LaCrO3) applied with high-velocity direct-current vacuum plasma spraying (DC-VPS) can reduce such effects considerably if they are stable and of high electronic conductivity.",High-velocity DC-VPS for diffusion and protecting barrier layers in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1361/105996306X146758
