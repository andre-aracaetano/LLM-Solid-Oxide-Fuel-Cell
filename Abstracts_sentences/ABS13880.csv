4,13880,"In particular, the Ln = Nd samples exhibit superior cathode performances in SOFC compared to those obtained with the Ln = La or Gd samples in LnSr(3)(Fe,Co)(3)O-10.","Crystal chemistry and electrochemical properties of Ln(Sr,Ca)3(Fe,Co)3O10 intergrowth oxide cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c0jm03230a
5,13880,"Further improvement in the cathode performance and a decrease in the TEC value have been realized by a substitution of less electropositive Ca for Sr in NdSr3-yCayFe1.5Co1.5O10, demonstrating that NdSr2.5Ca0.5Fe1.5Co1.5O10 (NSCFC) is the optimum composition among the Ln(Sr,Ca)(3)(Fe,Co)(3)O-10 samples investigated.","Crystal chemistry and electrochemical properties of Ln(Sr,Ca)3(Fe,Co)3O10 intergrowth oxide cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c0jm03230a
6,13880,"The improved performance of NSCFC is attributed to the decreased lattice distortion in the perovskite layer, which is beneficial to enhance the oxide-ion conductivity.","Crystal chemistry and electrochemical properties of Ln(Sr,Ca)3(Fe,Co)3O10 intergrowth oxide cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c0jm03230a
