1,1909,A two-dimensional model is developed to study the performance of a planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) running on steam/methane mixture The model considers the heat/mass transfer electrochemical reactions direct internal reforming of methane (CH4) and water gas shift reaction in an SOFC,Electrolytic effect in solid oxide fuel cells running on steam/methane mixture,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.069
2,1909,It is found that at an operating potential of 0 8 V the upstream and downstream of SOFC work in electrolysis and fuel cell modes respectively At the open-circuit voltage the electricity generated by the downstream part of SOFC is completely consumed by the upstream through electrolysis which is contrary to our common understanding that electrochemical reactions cease under the open-circuit conditions In order to inhibit the electrolytic effect the SOFC can be operated at a lower potential or use partially pre-reformed CH4 as the fuel Increasing the inlet gas velocity from 05 ms(-1) to 5 0 m s(-1) does not reduce the electrolytic effect but decreases the SOFC performance (c) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved,Electrolytic effect in solid oxide fuel cells running on steam/methane mixture,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.069
