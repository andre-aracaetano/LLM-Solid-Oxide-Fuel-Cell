5,20996,"The global extinction limits are determined, which indicate that for the typical anodic syngas mixture and using air as the oxidizer, a laminar diffusion flame can be established for strain rates between 50 s(-1) and 1400 s(-1), and the extinction strain rate may be further increased using oxy-rich flames.",Extinction of laminar diffusion flames burning the anodic syngas fuel from solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.04.015

9,20996,"The dilution-induced and stretched-induced extinction processes appear to be similar in that the extinction is initiated locally in the region of the highest scalar dissipation rate (chi) near the centerline, and then the extinction region spreads radially out until the flame is globally extinguished.",Extinction of laminar diffusion flames burning the anodic syngas fuel from solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.04.015
10,20996,"The main difference is that for the former, the chemical activity is reduced which decreases the radical species pool, while for the latter, the scalar dissipation rate is increased, causing an increase in the rate of loss of heat and radical species from the reaction zone.",Extinction of laminar diffusion flames burning the anodic syngas fuel from solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.04.015
11,20996,"The temporal evolution of extinction process also indicates that flame extinction starts locally in the region of the highest chi, and then spreads radially leading to global extinction.",Extinction of laminar diffusion flames burning the anodic syngas fuel from solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.04.015
