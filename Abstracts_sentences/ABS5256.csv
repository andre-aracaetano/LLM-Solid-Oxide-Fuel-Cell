1,5256,The effects of a post-annealing treatment on the performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) were investigated.,Post-Annealing of Thin-Film Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Electrolytes for Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2014.10121
2,5256,"Nickel oxide-samarium doped ceria (NiO-SDC) anodes and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes were deposited on anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes by RF sputtering and DC reactive sputtering, respectively.",Post-Annealing of Thin-Film Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Electrolytes for Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2014.10121
3,5256,"The half-cell of YSZ/NiO-SDC was then heat-treated at 600 degrees C for 10 h, and a porous platinum (Pt) cathode was deposited on the annealed YSZ/NiO-SDC structure by DC magnetron sputtering.",Post-Annealing of Thin-Film Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Electrolytes for Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2014.10121
4,5256,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis revealed a significant decrease in the ohmic resistance and a slight increase in the cathodic impedance.,Post-Annealing of Thin-Film Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Electrolytes for Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2014.10121
5,5256,Such a result may be attributed to the increased grain size and enhanced crystallinity of the YSZ electrolyte after the heat treatment.,Post-Annealing of Thin-Film Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Electrolytes for Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2014.10121
6,5256,"The maximum power density observed for the heat-treated cell was 35 mW/cm(2) at 450 degrees C, more than three times higher than the 10 mW/cm2 value obtained for the as-deposited cell.",Post-Annealing of Thin-Film Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Electrolytes for Anode-Supported Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1166/jnn.2014.10121
