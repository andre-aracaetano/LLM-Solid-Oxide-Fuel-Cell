2,8845,We investigate bi-layered Ni-YSZ anodes from a modeling point of view.,Modeling Analysis of Bi-Layer Ni-(ZrO2)x(Y2O3)1-x Anodes for Anode-Supported Intermediate Temperature-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en7095647
3,8845,"The model includes reaction kinetics (Butler-Volmer equation), mass transport (Dusty-Gas model), and charge transport (Ohm's law), and allows to gain an insight into the distribution of the electrochemical reaction within the electrode.",Modeling Analysis of Bi-Layer Ni-(ZrO2)x(Y2O3)1-x Anodes for Anode-Supported Intermediate Temperature-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en7095647
4,8845,"Additionally, the model allows to evaluate a reciprocal overall electrode resistance 1/R-p approximate to 6 S.cm(-2) for a bi-layer electrode formed by a 10 mu m thick active layer (AL) composed of 0.25 mu m radius Ni and YSZ particles (34% vol. Ni), coupled to a 700 mu m thick support layer (SL) formed by 0.5 mu m radius Ni and YSZ particles (50% vol. Ni), and operated at a temperature of 1023 K. Simulation results compare satisfactorily to literature experimental data.",Modeling Analysis of Bi-Layer Ni-(ZrO2)x(Y2O3)1-x Anodes for Anode-Supported Intermediate Temperature-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en7095647
5,8845,"The model allows to investigate, in detail, the effect of morphological and geometric parameters on the various sources of losses, which is the first step for an optimized electrode design.",Modeling Analysis of Bi-Layer Ni-(ZrO2)x(Y2O3)1-x Anodes for Anode-Supported Intermediate Temperature-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/en7095647
