1,11147,"A novel polygeneration concept, which has been proposed recently, comprises a fuel-cell calciner integrated system in order to produce electricity and lime which can be used for direct air capture (DAC) to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.",Pilot-scale calcination of limestone in steam-rich gas for direct air capture,10.1016/j.ecmx.2019.100007
2,11147,"However, the scalability of the integrated system needs to be further studied.",Pilot-scale calcination of limestone in steam-rich gas for direct air capture,10.1016/j.ecmx.2019.100007
3,11147,"In this work, calcination of limestone under steam-rich conditions simulating flue gas from a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and subsequent ambient carbonation has been explored.",Pilot-scale calcination of limestone in steam-rich gas for direct air capture,10.1016/j.ecmx.2019.100007
4,11147,"Limestone was calcined under two steam concentration (21% and 35% vol) conditions in a 25 kWth pilot-scale bubbling fluidised bed (BFB), and then exposed to ambient air to evaluate DAC performance.",Pilot-scale calcination of limestone in steam-rich gas for direct air capture,10.1016/j.ecmx.2019.100007
5,11147,"Samples were characterised in order to quantify the hydration and carbonation conversions over time and, therefore, their DAC capacity.",Pilot-scale calcination of limestone in steam-rich gas for direct air capture,10.1016/j.ecmx.2019.100007
6,11147,"It was observed that steam reduces calcination time, confirming its catalytic effect, while the calcination temperature remained the same regardless of the steam composition at the same CO2 partial pressure.",Pilot-scale calcination of limestone in steam-rich gas for direct air capture,10.1016/j.ecmx.2019.100007
7,11147,"Moreover, increasing steam concentration during calcination affected the material performance and DAC capacity at ambient conditions positively.",Pilot-scale calcination of limestone in steam-rich gas for direct air capture,10.1016/j.ecmx.2019.100007
8,11147,"Therefore, these findings demonstrate that limestone calcined under typical SOFC afterburner exhaust conditions is suitable as a DAC sorbent.",Pilot-scale calcination of limestone in steam-rich gas for direct air capture,10.1016/j.ecmx.2019.100007
