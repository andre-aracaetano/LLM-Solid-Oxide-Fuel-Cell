5,13235,The influence of YSZ coating thickness on the performance of SOFC test cell was investigated in order to optimize YSZ thickness in terms of open circuit voltage of the cell and YSZ ohmic loss.,Influence of YSZ electrolyte thickness on the characteristics of plasma-sprayed cermet supported tubular SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.03.004
6,13235,"It was found that the reduction of YSZ thickness from 100 mu m to 40 mu m led to the increase of the maximum output power density from 0.47 W/cm(2) to 0.76 W/cm(2) at 1000 degrees C. Using an APS 4.5YSZ coating of about 40 gin as the electrolyte, the test cell presented a maximum power output density of over 0.88 W/cm(2) at 1030 degrees C.",Influence of YSZ electrolyte thickness on the characteristics of plasma-sprayed cermet supported tubular SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.03.004
