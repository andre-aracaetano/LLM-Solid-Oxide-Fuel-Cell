1,15683,The effect on solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode performance of replacing CeO2 with a Ce0.6Zr0.4O2 solid solution in Cu-ceria-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) composites was investigated.,Enhanced thermal stability of SOFC anodes made with CeO2-ZrO2 solutions,10.1149/1.1945374
2,15683,"In both cases, the electrode composites were made by impregnation of porous YSZ with nitrate salts.",Enhanced thermal stability of SOFC anodes made with CeO2-ZrO2 solutions,10.1149/1.1945374
3,15683,"Calcination of the CeO2 to 1273 K, prior to the addition of Cu, resulted in a large decrease in anode performance, with the anode impedance at 973 K in H-2 increasing from approximately 0.5 Omega cm(2) to greater than 2 Omega cm(2).",Enhanced thermal stability of SOFC anodes made with CeO2-ZrO2 solutions,10.1149/1.1945374
4,15683,Similar high-temperature treatment of Cu-Ce0.6Zr0.4O2-YSZ composites had much less effect on anode performance.,Enhanced thermal stability of SOFC anodes made with CeO2-ZrO2 solutions,10.1149/1.1945374
