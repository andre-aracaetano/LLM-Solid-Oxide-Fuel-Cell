1,12499,Ni/YSZ is considered as a benchmark material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) but suffers from both Ni agglomeration and carbon deposition when hydrocarbons are used as fuels.,Methane steam reforming over Ni/YSZ cermet anode materials synthesized by different methods,10.1039/d3re00679d
2,12499,"In the present study, samples of Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) with 1.25 < molar ratio Ni/(Y + Zr) < 1.5 were prepared by a sol-gel method and by impregnation of YSZ with nickel, in both aqueous and organic media.",Methane steam reforming over Ni/YSZ cermet anode materials synthesized by different methods,10.1039/d3re00679d
3,12499,"The Ni/YSZ materials were characterized by dynamic TG analysis, FTIR, XRD, UV-vis, TPR, TPO and TEM techniques.",Methane steam reforming over Ni/YSZ cermet anode materials synthesized by different methods,10.1039/d3re00679d
4,12499,"The properties of the Ni/YSZ materials were discussed in relation with the corresponding catalytic activities for methane steam reforming, which were also compared to that of a commercial material.",Methane steam reforming over Ni/YSZ cermet anode materials synthesized by different methods,10.1039/d3re00679d
5,12499,The superior catalytic performance of the sol-gel-prepared catalyst and its resistance to poisoning despite noticeable (though comparable to those measured on the other samples) carbon deposits were attributed to the greater homogeneity of the mixture of nickel and YSZ phases.,Methane steam reforming over Ni/YSZ cermet anode materials synthesized by different methods,10.1039/d3re00679d
