1,20599,"Neodymium nickelates Nd2Ni1-xO4+delta with Ni non-stoichiometry, varied in a wide x range of 0.0-0.08, are synthesized for the first time, and their properties are studied depending on the Ni content.","Effect of Ni non-stoichiometry on the structural, thermal and conductivity properties of Nd2Ni1-xO4+δ",10.1016/j.ssi.2022.116082

3,20599,"According to the XRD data, the materials of the Nd2Ni1-O-x(4+delta) series are single-phase in the range of x from 0.0 to 0.06 and exhibit an orthorhombic structure with a Fmmm space group.","Effect of Ni non-stoichiometry on the structural, thermal and conductivity properties of Nd2Ni1-xO4+δ",10.1016/j.ssi.2022.116082
4,20599,"Results of the TGA-DSC studies shows that the temperature of the Fmmm - I4/mmm phase transition changes insignif-icantly (up to similar to 5 degrees C), thus does not depend on Ni non-stoichiometry.","Effect of Ni non-stoichiometry on the structural, thermal and conductivity properties of Nd2Ni1-xO4+δ",10.1016/j.ssi.2022.116082
5,20599,The Raman scattering studies reveal that at low Ni deficiency the Raman spectra are typical for the Ni-stoichimetric oxidized (delta approximate to 0.2) Nd2NiO4+(delta).,"Effect of Ni non-stoichiometry on the structural, thermal and conductivity properties of Nd2Ni1-xO4+δ",10.1016/j.ssi.2022.116082
