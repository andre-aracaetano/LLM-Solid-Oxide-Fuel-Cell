1,16806,Samarium doped cerium oxide (SDC) thin films were grown evaporating cubic phase cerium oxide doped by 15% of samarium nanopowder (Sm0.15Ce0.85O1.95)-SDC thin films were formed on Alloy 600 (Fe-Ni-Cr) and optical quartz (SiO2) substrates using e-beam deposition technique controlling (influencing thin film properties) deposition parameters: substrate temperature and electron gun power.,Samarium doped cerium oxide thin films deposited by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2009.09.032
2,16806,"SDC thin films (1.5-2 mu m of thickness) were deposited when the electron gun power was 0.12 kW, 0.3 kW, 0.45 kW, 0.6 kW, and 0.78 kW during thin films deposition.",Samarium doped cerium oxide thin films deposited by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2009.09.032
3,16806,"The formed SDC thin films were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).",Samarium doped cerium oxide thin films deposited by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2009.09.032
4,16806,It was determined that electron gun power (in the range from 0.12 kW to 0.78 kW) has the influence on crystallite size (increased from 5 nm to 19.2 nm) which increases as the gun power increases.,Samarium doped cerium oxide thin films deposited by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2009.09.032
5,16806,The crystallite size increases from 12 nm to 47 nm by increasing substrate temperature from 100 degrees C to 600 degrees C.,Samarium doped cerium oxide thin films deposited by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2009.09.032
6,16806,"The texture of formed SDC thin films is not influenced by e-beam gun power, but it is influenced by substrate temperature when it is above 300 degrees C. Deposited SDC thin films are stoichiometric and repeat the stoichiometry of elements of the chosen evaporated SDC material.",Samarium doped cerium oxide thin films deposited by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2009.09.032
7,16806,The deposited SDC films were annealed in air to 800 degrees C temperature and were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in order to understand the stability and influence the temperature on the structure of formed thin films.,Samarium doped cerium oxide thin films deposited by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2009.09.032
8,16806,The thermal treatment shows that deposited SDC thin films are stable and the crystallite size and texture are not changing during the heating and cooling.,Samarium doped cerium oxide thin films deposited by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2009.09.032
