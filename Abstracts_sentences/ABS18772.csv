3,18772,"Here, we have tracked such a phase transition path by allowing the relaxed SrCoO3 film to naturally reduce toward the SrCoO2.5 phase and investigated the time-dependent correlated structural, electronic, and magnetic states in the intermediate SrCoOx systems.","Time Evolution of the Structural, Electronic, and Magnetic Phases in Relaxed SrCoO3 Thin Films",10.1021/acsaelm.1c00831
4,18772,"The strained film, on the other hand, is very much stable in terms of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties.","Time Evolution of the Structural, Electronic, and Magnetic Phases in Relaxed SrCoO3 Thin Films",10.1021/acsaelm.1c00831
5,18772,The magnetic phase coexistence and the correlation between the magnetic exchange interaction and the O 2p hole density are also realized in the SrCoOx systems.,"Time Evolution of the Structural, Electronic, and Magnetic Phases in Relaxed SrCoO3 Thin Films",10.1021/acsaelm.1c00831
6,18772,"Our study greatly improves the fundamental understanding of the topotactic phase evolution by uncovering the hidden correlated phases in SrCoOx systems, which encourages us to investigate the same in another topotactic phase transition material, SrFeOx, for the pursuits in developing such phase transition-related technological potential applications.","Time Evolution of the Structural, Electronic, and Magnetic Phases in Relaxed SrCoO3 Thin Films",10.1021/acsaelm.1c00831
