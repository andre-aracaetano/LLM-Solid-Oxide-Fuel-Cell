2,18651,"The apparent coinciding of the concentration polarization and Faraday efficiency decrease at certain current density (-0.5Acm(-2) or -0.6Acm(-2) for selected steam content) indicates that steam starvation appears to affect the hydrogen production's linearity, which in essence the Ni/NiO redox process is believed to play a role in such normal SOEC operations.",Deficiency of hydrogen production in commercialized planar Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSM-YSZ steam electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.174
