1,10052,Alkali/alkaline-earth borosilicate glass alumina composites containing 10 vol% Al2O3 were prepared for use as solid oxide fuel cell sealants.,Effect of Alumina Nanofiller on Properties of Heat-Treated Glass Composite Sealants,10.1166/jnn.2014.9931
2,10052,The effect of heat treatment and Al2O3 addition on the viscosities and electrical conductivities was investigated to improve cyclic sealing performance.,Effect of Alumina Nanofiller on Properties of Heat-Treated Glass Composite Sealants,10.1166/jnn.2014.9931
3,10052,"Upon a 48-h heat treatment, the viscosity of the glass alumina composites at 750 degrees C was approximately four orders of magnitude higher than that of the base glass owing to the crystallization of the glass in the presence of Al2O3.",Effect of Alumina Nanofiller on Properties of Heat-Treated Glass Composite Sealants,10.1166/jnn.2014.9931
4,10052,Heat treatment increased the electrical conductivities of both the base glass and the glass alumina composites.,Effect of Alumina Nanofiller on Properties of Heat-Treated Glass Composite Sealants,10.1166/jnn.2014.9931
5,10052,The electrical conductivities of glass alumina composites in the range from 400 degrees C to 550 degrees C were three times higher than those of the base glass regardless of heat treatment.,Effect of Alumina Nanofiller on Properties of Heat-Treated Glass Composite Sealants,10.1166/jnn.2014.9931
6,10052,This increase in the conductivities and viscosities by heat treatment was attributed to the devitrification and structural densification of the sealing glass and the partial dissolution of the Al2O3 filler in alkali/alkaline-earth borosilicate sealing glass.,Effect of Alumina Nanofiller on Properties of Heat-Treated Glass Composite Sealants,10.1166/jnn.2014.9931
