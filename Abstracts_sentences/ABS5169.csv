1,5169,"The conventionally mixed LSM-YSZ, LSM impregnated YSZ (LSM + YSZ) and Pd impregnated LSM-YSZ (Pd + LSM-YSZ) cathodes, were prepared and evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and single cell testing.","High performance solid oxide fuel cells with electrocatalytically enhanced (La, Sr)MnO3 cathodes",10.1016/j.elecom.2009.03.009
2,5169,"The electrochemical performance of the impregnated cathodes have been significantly boosted due to the formation of nano-sized LSM and Pd particles on the YSZ and LSM-YSZ substrates, respectively, and in turn, the increased area of the triple phase boundary (TPB) where the O-2 reduction reaction occurs, the power densities as high as 1.42 and 0.83 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C were achieved from single cells with the Pd + LSM-YSZ and LSM + YSZ cathodes, respectively, in contrast to 0.20 W cm(-2) from the single cell with the conventional LSM-YSZ cathode.","High performance solid oxide fuel cells with electrocatalytically enhanced (La, Sr)MnO3 cathodes",10.1016/j.elecom.2009.03.009
3,5169,Suggesting the Pd + LSM-YSZ and LSM + YSZ cathodes can be well used for the intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,"High performance solid oxide fuel cells with electrocatalytically enhanced (La, Sr)MnO3 cathodes",10.1016/j.elecom.2009.03.009
