3,10093,"Previous Study has shown that the C(H)4 fed SOFC-H had significantly better performance than the SOFC-O. However, the present study reveals that the actual performance of the CH4 fed SCFC-H is considerably lower than the SOFC-O, partly due to higher ohmic overpotential of SOFC-H. It is also found that the CH4 fed SOFC-H has considerably higher cathode concentration overpotential and lower anode concentration overpotential than the SOFC-O. The anode concentration overpotentials of the CH4 fed SOFC-H and SOFC-O are found to decrease with increasing temperature, which is different from previous analyses on the H-2 fed SOFC.",Modeling of methane fed solid oxide fuel cells: Comparison between proton conducting electrolyte and oxygen ion conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.04.073
