1,6080,Direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cell (D-HC SOFC) can directly operate on low-cost and readily availablehydrocarbon fuels without reforming.,Direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,
2,6080,"With high power density and low operation cost, D-HC SOFC has the potential of greatly speeding the application of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) in portable devices, back-up power supplies, auxiliary power units (APU) and distributed- power stations.",Direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,
3,6080,"At the beginning of this paper, the principle of SOFC is briefly introduced followed by a thermodynamic analysis on the feasibility of D-HC SOFC.",Direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,
4,6080,"Then, the status of DHC SOFC research and development is reviewed.",Direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,
5,6080,It is showed that most of the research on D-HC SOFC has been focused on avoiding carbon deposition caused by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon fuels at elevated operating temperatures.,Direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,
6,6080,"There are three ways to remove carbon in D-HC SOFC: lowering operating temperature, using proper catalyst that can suppress carbon formation reaction in anodes, and promoting electrochemical oxidation by running SOFC at large enough current.",Direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,
7,6080,Some works on the anode reaction mechanism are also described.,Direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,
8,6080,"Finally, the author's view on further research and development on D-HC SOFC is presented, that more work is required in D-HC SOFC stacks and anode reaction mechanisms associated with gas (including reactants and products and any other kind of gases produced during SOFC operation) distributions in SOFC.",Direct-hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells,
