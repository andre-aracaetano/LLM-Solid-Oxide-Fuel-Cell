1,13200,"A novel anode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), consisting of a Ruddlesden-Popper compound, La0.6Sr1.4Fe0.4Cr0.6O3.8, with in situ exsolved alpha-Fe nanoparticles (RP-LSF + Fe), is prepared from the phase conversion of the La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-delta (LSFCr-3) perovskite under humid H-2 at 800 degrees C. On the surface of the RP-LSF thorn Fe anode, Fe cations are presented to be a mixture of Fe2+ and Fe3+, of which the average valence is lower than that in the bulk (Fe3+).",A novel anode for solid oxide fuel cells prepared from phase conversion of La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ perovskite under humid hydrogen,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.07.132
2,13200,"The coverage of atomic hydrogen on the RP-LSF thorn Fe anode is over 0.8 in the pH(2) range of 0.017-0.27 atm, implying a significant effect of these small amount (similar to 8 mol % on the surface) of exsolved Fe nanoparticles (similar to 200-300 nm) on promoting the dissociative absorption of H-2.",A novel anode for solid oxide fuel cells prepared from phase conversion of La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ perovskite under humid hydrogen,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.07.132

4,13200,The addition of catalytic amount of Ni (1-3 wt.%) greatly improves the fuel flexibility of the RP-LSF thorn Fe anode.,A novel anode for solid oxide fuel cells prepared from phase conversion of La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ perovskite under humid hydrogen,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.07.132
5,13200,"Furthermore, it contributes to acceleration the phase conversion of the LSFCr-3 perovskite and reduced time for in situ preparation of the RP-LSF thorn Fe anode.",A novel anode for solid oxide fuel cells prepared from phase conversion of La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ perovskite under humid hydrogen,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.07.132
6,13200,"The RP-LSF thorn Fe anode with 2.7 wt.% Ni exhibits a stable cell performance under 2.7% H2O+1:1-(H-2:CO) and 2.7% H2O + CH4 for similar to 30 h. It costs shortest time (30 h) to reach a stable cell voltage of 0.76 V at a galvanostatic current density of 0.25 A/cm(2) under humid H-2, which is clearly an active and stable anode material for SOFCs.",A novel anode for solid oxide fuel cells prepared from phase conversion of La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ perovskite under humid hydrogen,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.07.132
