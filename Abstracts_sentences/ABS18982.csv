5,18982,The samples initially with the tetragonal phase showed a significant decrease in the conductivity but an increase in the strength whereas the samples with the rhombohedral phase generally showed no change and the ones with the cubic phase showed slight decreases in both properties.,"Degradation mechanism of scandia-stabilised zirconia electrolytes: Discussion based on annealing effects on mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and Raman spectrum",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.09.001
6,18982,"From above results, the conductivity degradation of the sample with the tetragonal phase was attributed to two causes: the formation of low conductive but transformable t-phase from the high conductive t'-phase and the formation of t-phase from the C-phase.","Degradation mechanism of scandia-stabilised zirconia electrolytes: Discussion based on annealing effects on mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and Raman spectrum",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.09.001
