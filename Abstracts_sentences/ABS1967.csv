1,1967,"BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY7) exhibits adequate protonic conductivity as well as sufficient chemical and thermal stability over a wide range of SOFC operating conditions, while layered perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta,5 (PBSC) has advanced electrochemical properties.",Proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells with layered PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ perovskite cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.046
2,1967,This research fully takes advantage of these advanced properties and develops a novel protonic ceramic membrane fuel cell (PCMFC) of Ni-BZCY7 vertical bar BZCY7 vertical bar PBSC.,Proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells with layered PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ perovskite cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.046
3,1967,"Experimental results show that the cell may achieve the open-circuit potential of 1.005 V, the maximal power density of 520 mW cm(-2), and a low electrode polarization resistance of 0.12 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Increasing operating temperature leads to the decrease of total cell resistance, among which electrolyte resistance becomes increasingly dominant over polarization resistance.",Proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells with layered PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ perovskite cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.046
4,1967,"The results also indicate that PBSC perovskite cathode is a good candidate for intermediate temperature PCMFC development, while the developed Ni-BZCY7 vertical bar BZCY7 vertical bar PBSC cell is a promising functional material system for SOFCs.",Proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells with layered PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ perovskite cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.046
