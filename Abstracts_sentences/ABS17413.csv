2,17413,The model locally describes transport and reaction phenomena within the cell components through mass conservation equations.,"PHYSICALLY-BASED DECONVOLUTION OF IMPEDANCE SPECTRA: INTERPRETATION, FITTING AND VALIDATION OF A NUMERICAL MODEL FOR LANTHANUM STRONTIUM COBALT FERRITE-BASED SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.04.181
3,17413,"The microstructural properties of the electrodes are predicted through numerical three-dimensional reconstruction of the microstructure, with input parameters obtained from the analysis of SEM pictures of each layer.","PHYSICALLY-BASED DECONVOLUTION OF IMPEDANCE SPECTRA: INTERPRETATION, FITTING AND VALIDATION OF A NUMERICAL MODEL FOR LANTHANUM STRONTIUM COBALT FERRITE-BASED SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.04.181
4,17413,"Simulations show that the model reproduces impedance spectra obtained in different operating conditions with the same set of fitting parameters, comprising material-specific kinetic constants and electrochemical capacitances, which fairly agree with independent literature data and a previous analysis of the spectra through DRT.","PHYSICALLY-BASED DECONVOLUTION OF IMPEDANCE SPECTRA: INTERPRETATION, FITTING AND VALIDATION OF A NUMERICAL MODEL FOR LANTHANUM STRONTIUM COBALT FERRITE-BASED SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.04.181
5,17413,The model allows for the deconvolution and quantification of the characteristic resistance and frequency of the different physical processes that build up the impedance of the cell.,"PHYSICALLY-BASED DECONVOLUTION OF IMPEDANCE SPECTRA: INTERPRETATION, FITTING AND VALIDATION OF A NUMERICAL MODEL FOR LANTHANUM STRONTIUM COBALT FERRITE-BASED SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.04.181
6,17413,"In particular, 7 processes are identified: charge-transfer reactions between LSCF/GDC, GDC/YSZ and Ni/YSZ interfaces appear in the high-frequency range, the medium-frequency feature is due the oxygen reduction reaction and the gas diffusion in the anode, while the low-frequency arc is mainly due to the gas conversion in the anodic channel.","PHYSICALLY-BASED DECONVOLUTION OF IMPEDANCE SPECTRA: INTERPRETATION, FITTING AND VALIDATION OF A NUMERICAL MODEL FOR LANTHANUM STRONTIUM COBALT FERRITE-BASED SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.04.181
7,17413,"An additional low frequency contribution (<1 Hz), not considered in the model, is observed and tentatively attributed to the adsorption of oxygen onto the LSCF surface.","PHYSICALLY-BASED DECONVOLUTION OF IMPEDANCE SPECTRA: INTERPRETATION, FITTING AND VALIDATION OF A NUMERICAL MODEL FOR LANTHANUM STRONTIUM COBALT FERRITE-BASED SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.04.181
8,17413,Simulation results suggest that more efforts must be dedicated to characterize and improve the oxygen transfer at the LSCF/GDC and GDC/YSZ interfaces.,"PHYSICALLY-BASED DECONVOLUTION OF IMPEDANCE SPECTRA: INTERPRETATION, FITTING AND VALIDATION OF A NUMERICAL MODEL FOR LANTHANUM STRONTIUM COBALT FERRITE-BASED SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.04.181
9,17413,"The study shows that a quantitative interpretation of impedance spectra is possible with a reduced number of fitting parameters when a physically-based approach is adopted, making the model an attractive tool for diagnostic purposes.","PHYSICALLY-BASED DECONVOLUTION OF IMPEDANCE SPECTRA: INTERPRETATION, FITTING AND VALIDATION OF A NUMERICAL MODEL FOR LANTHANUM STRONTIUM COBALT FERRITE-BASED SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS",10.1016/j.electacta.2016.04.181
