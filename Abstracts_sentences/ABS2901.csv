1,2901,Fuel cells directly and efficiently convert the chemical energy of a fuel into electrical energy.,"Analysis of structure perovskite cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells, SOFCs",
2,2901,"Of the various types of fuel cells, the solid oxide (SOFC), combine the advantages in environmentally benign energy generation with fuel flexibility.","Analysis of structure perovskite cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells, SOFCs",
3,2901,"However, the need for high operating temperatures (800 - 1000 degrees C) has resulted in high costs and major challenges in relation to the compatibility the cathode materials.","Analysis of structure perovskite cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells, SOFCs",
4,2901,"As a result, there have been significant efforts in the development of intermediate temperature SOFC (500 - 700 degrees C).","Analysis of structure perovskite cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells, SOFCs",
5,2901,A key obstacle for operation in this temperature range is the limited activity of traditional cathode materials for electrochemical reduction of oxygen.,"Analysis of structure perovskite cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells, SOFCs",
6,2901,"In this article, the progress of recent years is discussed in cathodes for SOFC perovskite structure (ABO(3)), more efficient than the traditionally used La1-xSrxMnO3-delta (LSM) or (La, Sr) CoO3.","Analysis of structure perovskite cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells, SOFCs",
7,2901,"Such is the case of mixed conductors (MIEC) double perovskite structure (AA'B2O5+delta) using different doping elements as La, Sr, Fe, Ti, Cr, Sm, Co, Cu, Pr, Nd, Gd, dy, Mn, among others, which could improve the operational performance of existing cathode materials, promoting the development of optimized intermediate temperature SOFC designs.","Analysis of structure perovskite cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells, SOFCs",
