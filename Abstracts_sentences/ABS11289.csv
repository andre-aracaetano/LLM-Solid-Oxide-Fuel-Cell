1,11289,Interlayer composite thin film of Pr2Ni0.71Cu0.24Ga0.05O4-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (PNCG-SDC) was deposited between the La0.9Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3.delta (LSGM) thin film and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) powder cathode for increasing the cathodic activity for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Pr2Ni0.71Cu0.24Ga0.05O4-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite film as active cathodic layer for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.10.027
2,11289,It was found that cathodic overpotential was decreased by introduction of PNCG-SDC composite film resulting in the increased power density on both anode and electrolyte supported LSGM cell.,Pr2Ni0.71Cu0.24Ga0.05O4-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite film as active cathodic layer for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.10.027
3,11289,"The maximum power density of the anode supported cell using PNCG-SDC film was increased to 2.35 and 0.3 W/cm(2) at 700 and 500 degrees C, respectively, which is higher than that of the cell without PNCG-SDC film.",Pr2Ni0.71Cu0.24Ga0.05O4-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite film as active cathodic layer for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.10.027
4,11289,The activation energy estimated by cathodic overpotential indicated that PNCG-SDC film was effective for increasing the activity of active sites.,Pr2Ni0.71Cu0.24Ga0.05O4-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite film as active cathodic layer for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.10.027
5,11289,"Based on these results, PNCGSDC composited film, which may be double columnar structure, was highly effective for increasing cathodic performance to oxygen reduction at intermediate temperature.",Pr2Ni0.71Cu0.24Ga0.05O4-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 composite film as active cathodic layer for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.10.027
