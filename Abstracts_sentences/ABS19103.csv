1,19103,"In this study, methane assisted high temperature steam/CO2 co-electrolysis process is performed on symmetrical cells with a configuration of SFM-SDC/LSGM/SFM-SDC to produce high-quality synthesis gas (syngas, a mixture of H-2 and CO).",Methane assisted solid oxide co-electrolysis process for syngas production,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.096
2,19103,"The Nernst potential has been evaluated for solid oxide cells in the methane assisted mode, which is reduced by nearly one order of magnitude through substituting the anode atmosphere from air to methane.",Methane assisted solid oxide co-electrolysis process for syngas production,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.096
3,19103,"The open circuit voltage (OCV) is -0.06 V at 800 degrees C, and an electrolysis current density of -242 mAcm(-2) has been obtained at 850 degrees C and 03 V. Effects of operating conditions on products composition have been revealed by using the chemical equilibrium co-electrolysis model and HSC software.",Methane assisted solid oxide co-electrolysis process for syngas production,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.096
4,19103,High-quality syngas with high conversion rate of CO2 to CO as well as ideal H-2/CO molar ratio of 2 could be achieved in both electrode sides by adjusting appropriate operating conditions.,Methane assisted solid oxide co-electrolysis process for syngas production,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.096
5,19103,"The short-term cell voltage is slightly fluctuant less than 0.05 V at 850 degrees C and -120 mAcm(-2), in which condition carbon deposition has been observed in the SFM-SDC anode due to the low O2-/CH4 ratio.",Methane assisted solid oxide co-electrolysis process for syngas production,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.01.096
