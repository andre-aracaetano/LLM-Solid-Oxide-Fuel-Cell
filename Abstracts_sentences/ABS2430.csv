1,2430,"A parametric analysis is carried out in order to investigate the effect of different microstructural and operating parameters on the performance of a micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC).","A parametric analysis of a micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC)",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.032
2,2430,The results show that the cathode morphology (its microstructure and material) are important factors to consider.,"A parametric analysis of a micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC)",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.032
3,2430,"Other parameters such as inlet velocity (flow rate) and mixing ratio are also very effective in improving the cell performance but these parameters should be carefully controlled in order to avoid their counter-effects, like, lower fuel utilization, anode coking and oxidation-reduction.","A parametric analysis of a micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC)",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.032
4,2430,"There are some other parameters such as, operating pressure, electrode porosity, permeability and cathode radiative emissivity, which have minimal effect in performance enhancement.","A parametric analysis of a micro-tubular, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SC-SOFC)",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.10.032
