4,14422,Both composite components exhibit similar thermal expansion coefficients.,Structural and electrical properties of Bi3Y0.9W0.1O6.15-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (BiYWO-LSM) composites,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.09.002
5,14422,Composites of different molar ratios of components were prepared by sintering the components together at 850 degrees C. Electrical behavior was studied by a.c. impedance spectroscopy and transference number measurements were used to determine the ionic and electronic contributions to total conductivity.,Structural and electrical properties of Bi3Y0.9W0.1O6.15-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (BiYWO-LSM) composites,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.09.002
6,14422,"Percolation type behavior was observed for total conductivity and the percolation threshold value was determined to be in the bismuth rich region of the compositional range, due to the significant difference in the grain sizes of the two components.",Structural and electrical properties of Bi3Y0.9W0.1O6.15-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (BiYWO-LSM) composites,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.09.002
