1,17845,"In underwater applications such as unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) propulsion, mass and volume constraints often dictate system energy density and specific energy, which are targeted to exceed 300 Wh L-1 and 300 Wh kg(-1), respectively, in order to compete with state-of-the-art battery technologies.",Carbide-based fuel system for undersea vehicles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.008
2,17845,"To address this need, a novel carbide-based fuel system (CFS) intended for use with a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is under development that is capable of achieving these energy metrics as well as sequestering carbon dioxide.",Carbide-based fuel system for undersea vehicles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.008
3,17845,The proposed CFS uses calcium carbide and calcium hydride that react with water to generate acetylene and hydrogen as the fuel and calcium hydroxide as a carbon dioxide scrubber.,Carbide-based fuel system for undersea vehicles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.008
4,17845,The acetylene is hydrogenated to ethane and then reformed to syngas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) before being utilized by the SOFC.,Carbide-based fuel system for undersea vehicles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.008
5,17845,"Carbon dioxide effluent from the SOFC is reacted with the calcium hydroxide to produce a storable solid, calcium carbonate, thus eliminating gas evolution from the UUV A system configuration is proposed and discussion follows concerning energy storage metrics, operational parameters and preliminary safety analysis.",Carbide-based fuel system for undersea vehicles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.008
