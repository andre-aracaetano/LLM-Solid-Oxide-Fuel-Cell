1,19228,The catalytic reduction of CO2 to CO using solid oxide electrolytic cells (SOECs) is considered as a sustainable solution to simultaneously remove excessive CO2 in the air and creates valuable chemicals.,Enhanced CO2 electrolysis at metal-oxide interfaces,10.1007/s10008-022-05121-1
2,19228,It is well known that catalyst interface plays an important role in heterogeneous catalytic process.,Enhanced CO2 electrolysis at metal-oxide interfaces,10.1007/s10008-022-05121-1
3,19228,"However, supported perovskite nanoparticles catalysts are still far away from satisfactory for industrial application.",Enhanced CO2 electrolysis at metal-oxide interfaces,10.1007/s10008-022-05121-1
4,19228,"In this study, we prepare a series of double-layer perovskite materials Sr2Fe1.5+xMo0.5O6-delta (SF1.5+xM, x=0-0.1) through synergistic doping and pretreating for forming Fe/Sr2Fe1.5+xMo0.5O6-delta interface to enhance the catalytic activity.",Enhanced CO2 electrolysis at metal-oxide interfaces,10.1007/s10008-022-05121-1
5,19228,"In addition, the well-constructed interface contributes to an extremely high current efficiency of similar to 92.6% at 1.4 V, 850 degrees C. The CO yield of Fe/SF1.5+xM with this well-developed interface is as high as 4.6 mL min(-1) cm(-2), which was two times more than that of SF1.5 M. We further demonstrate long-term stability of CO2 electrolysis even after a continuous operation of 100 h without carbon deposition.",Enhanced CO2 electrolysis at metal-oxide interfaces,10.1007/s10008-022-05121-1
6,19228,This inspires establishing well-contacted interface through exsolving metallic nanoparticles (NPs) over perovskite material for significantly improving catalytic activity and stability.,Enhanced CO2 electrolysis at metal-oxide interfaces,10.1007/s10008-022-05121-1
