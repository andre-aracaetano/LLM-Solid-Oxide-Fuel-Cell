1,18428,The reduction of NO by ethylene in the presence of excess oxygen was investigated in a recently developed monolithic electropromoted reactor (MEPR).,Electrochemical Promotion of NO Reduction by C2H4 in Excess O2 Using a Monolithic Electropromoted Reactor and Pt-Rh Sputtered Electrodes,10.1007/s11244-008-9110-3
2,18428,"In this novel dismantlable monolithic-type electrochemically promoted catalytic reactor, thin (similar to 140 nm) porous catalyst films are sputter-deposited on thin (0.25 mm) parallel solid electrolyte plates supported in the grooves of a ceramic monolithic holder and serve as electropromoted catalyst elements.",Electrochemical Promotion of NO Reduction by C2H4 in Excess O2 Using a Monolithic Electropromoted Reactor and Pt-Rh Sputtered Electrodes,10.1007/s11244-008-9110-3
3,18428,"Using Pt-Rh(1:1)/YSZ/Au-type catalyst elements, the 8-plate reactor operated with apparent Faradaic efficiency exceeding unity achieving significant and reversible enhancement in the rates of C2H4 and NO consumption in presence of up to 10% O-2 in the feed at gas flow rates of 1,000 cc/min.",Electrochemical Promotion of NO Reduction by C2H4 in Excess O2 Using a Monolithic Electropromoted Reactor and Pt-Rh Sputtered Electrodes,10.1007/s11244-008-9110-3
