3,5758,"The mechanical performances of the samples are measured via tensile tests by placing them between two metallic interconnector plates after the glass formation process as well as after 1, 5 and 10 thermal cycles.",Fabrication of glass ceramic sealants with ceramic fiber filler for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.10.161
4,5758,"The results show that the mechanical strength in general tends to decrease with increasing the ceramic filler content, which can be attributed to poor adhesion due to reduced glass ceramic composition.",Fabrication of glass ceramic sealants with ceramic fiber filler for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.10.161
5,5758,"On the other hand, thermal cycle behavior of the samples with ceramic fibers is found to be improved at some extend.",Fabrication of glass ceramic sealants with ceramic fiber filler for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.10.161
6,5758,This may be due to the behavior of ceramic filler network and relatively slow crystallization with increasing the amount of the filler as proven by microstructural observations.,Fabrication of glass ceramic sealants with ceramic fiber filler for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.10.161
