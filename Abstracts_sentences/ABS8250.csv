1,8250,"Recently, semiconductor-ionic materials (SIMs) have emerged as new functional materials, which possessed high ionic conductivity with successful applications as the electrolyte in advanced low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).",The sintering temperature effect on electrochemical properties of Ce0.8Sm0.05Ca0.15O2- (SCDC)-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3- (LSCF) heterostructure pellet,10.1186/s11671-019-2979-x
2,8250,"In order to reveal the ion-conducting mechanism in SIM, a typical SIM pellet consisted of semiconductor La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3- (LSCF) and ionic conductor Sm and Ca Co-doped ceria Ce0.8Sm0.05Ca0.15O2- (SCDC) are suffered from sintering at different temperatures.",The sintering temperature effect on electrochemical properties of Ce0.8Sm0.05Ca0.15O2- (SCDC)-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3- (LSCF) heterostructure pellet,10.1186/s11671-019-2979-x
3,8250,"It has been found that the performance of LSCF-SCDC electrolyte fuel cell decreases with the sintering temperature, the cell assembled from LSCF-SCDC pellet sintered at 600 degrees C exhibits a peak power density (P-max) of 543mW/cm(2) at 550 degrees C and also excellent performance of 312mW/cm(2) even at LT (500 degrees C).",The sintering temperature effect on electrochemical properties of Ce0.8Sm0.05Ca0.15O2- (SCDC)-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3- (LSCF) heterostructure pellet,10.1186/s11671-019-2979-x
