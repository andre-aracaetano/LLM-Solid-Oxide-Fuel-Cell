1,13512,"In this study, two models are developed to investigate the performance of a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) for CO(2) electrolysis at different levels.",Modeling of a solid oxide electrolysis cell for carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1016/j.cej.2010.08.032
2,13512,The first model is a one-dimensional model which is basing on a previously developed electrochemical model for steam electrolysis and considered all overpotentials in the SOEC.,Modeling of a solid oxide electrolysis cell for carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1016/j.cej.2010.08.032
3,13512,The second model is a two-dimensional thermal-fluid model consisting of the 1D model and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model.,Modeling of a solid oxide electrolysis cell for carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1016/j.cej.2010.08.032
4,13512,"It is found that the mean electrolyte temperature initially decreases with increasing operating potential, reaches the minimum at about 1.1 V and increases considerably with a further increase in potential.",Modeling of a solid oxide electrolysis cell for carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1016/j.cej.2010.08.032
5,13512,"At the thermal-neutral voltage (1.463 V at 1173 K), the calculated mean electrolyte temperature matches the inlet gas temperature.",Modeling of a solid oxide electrolysis cell for carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1016/j.cej.2010.08.032
6,13512,Increasing the operating potential increases both the local current density and the electrolyte Nernst potential.,Modeling of a solid oxide electrolysis cell for carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1016/j.cej.2010.08.032
7,13512,The electrochemical performance can be improved by increasing the inlet gas velocity from 0.2 m s(-1) to 1.0 m s(-1) but further increasing the inlet gas velocity will not considerably enhance the SOEC performance.,Modeling of a solid oxide electrolysis cell for carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1016/j.cej.2010.08.032
8,13512,"It is also found that a change of electrode permeability in the order of 10(-16) m(2) to 10(-13) m(2) does not noticeably influence the SOEC performance in the present study, due to negligible convection effect in the porous electrodes.",Modeling of a solid oxide electrolysis cell for carbon dioxide electrolysis,10.1016/j.cej.2010.08.032
