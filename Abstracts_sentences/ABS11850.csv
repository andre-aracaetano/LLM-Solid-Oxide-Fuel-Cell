1,11850,Near-infrared (NIR) thermal imaging is used to study anodes of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) when operating with alcohol fuels.,Methanol and Ethanol Fuels in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermal Imaging Study of Carbon Deposition,10.1021/ef2003975
2,11850,Relative propensities for carbon formation can be determined from surface cooling under fuel flows and subsequent heating under oxidizing conditions at temperatures between 700 and 800 degrees C. Ethanol forms considerable amounts of carbon at all temperatures and voltages studied as evidenced by substantial cooling related to carbon reactions and heating under oxidizing conditions.,Methanol and Ethanol Fuels in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermal Imaging Study of Carbon Deposition,10.1021/ef2003975
3,11850,Methanol operation depends greatly on cell temperature and voltage.,Methanol and Ethanol Fuels in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermal Imaging Study of Carbon Deposition,10.1021/ef2003975
4,11850,"At 700 degrees C, temperature changes resemble those with ethanol, suggesting carbon deposition is occurring.",Methanol and Ethanol Fuels in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermal Imaging Study of Carbon Deposition,10.1021/ef2003975
5,11850,"At 800 degrees C, there is less cooling, which indicates that the oxide flux at higher polarizations mitigates the effects of endothermic carbon reactions.",Methanol and Ethanol Fuels in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermal Imaging Study of Carbon Deposition,10.1021/ef2003975
6,11850,"Under oxidizing conditions after fuel exposure, the small observed temperature increase demonstrates that little carbon is formed.",Methanol and Ethanol Fuels in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermal Imaging Study of Carbon Deposition,10.1021/ef2003975
7,11850,"At 750 degrees C the cooling depends on voltage, revealing a set of conditions where cooling from endothermic reactions and heating from exothermic reactions are balanced.",Methanol and Ethanol Fuels in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermal Imaging Study of Carbon Deposition,10.1021/ef2003975
8,11850,"The results show that while dry ethanol is not a clean fuel under any of our conditions, methanol can be at higher temperatures.",Methanol and Ethanol Fuels in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermal Imaging Study of Carbon Deposition,10.1021/ef2003975
9,11850,"NIR thermal imaging proves a valuable stand-off technique for identifying cell deterioration in situ, with potential for process monitoring in operating SOFCs.",Methanol and Ethanol Fuels in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermal Imaging Study of Carbon Deposition,10.1021/ef2003975
