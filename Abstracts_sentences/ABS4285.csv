1,4285,In this communication we report the fabrication of nanostructured (La0.85Sr0.15)(0.98)MnO3 (LSM)/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) composite cathodes consisting of homogeneously distributed and connected LSM and YSZ grains approximately 100 nm large.,Performance and durability of nanostructured (La0.85Sr0.15)0.98MnO3/yttria-stabilized zirconia cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.045
2,4285,We also investigate for the first time the role of the cathode nanostructure on the performance and the durability of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Performance and durability of nanostructured (La0.85Sr0.15)0.98MnO3/yttria-stabilized zirconia cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.045

4,4285,"Detailed microstructural characterization by transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed that many of the LSM/YSZ junctions in the cathode faced the homogeneously connected pore channels, indicating the formation of a considerable number of triple phase boundaries.",Performance and durability of nanostructured (La0.85Sr0.15)0.98MnO3/yttria-stabilized zirconia cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.045
5,4285,The nanostructure served to reduce cathodic polarization.,Performance and durability of nanostructured (La0.85Sr0.15)0.98MnO3/yttria-stabilized zirconia cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.045
6,4285,"As a result, these anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells showed high power densities of 0.18, 0.40, 0.70 and 0.86W cm(-2) at 650, 700, 750 and 800 degrees C, respectively, under the cell voltage of 0.7 V. Furthermore, no significant performance degradation of the cathode was observed during operation at 700 C for 1000 h under a constant current density of 0.2 A cm(-2).",Performance and durability of nanostructured (La0.85Sr0.15)0.98MnO3/yttria-stabilized zirconia cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.045
