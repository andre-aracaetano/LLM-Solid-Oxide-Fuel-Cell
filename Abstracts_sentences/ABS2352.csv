3,2352,"Changes in crystal structure and microstructure of the paste films with the sintering temperature have been investigated to show that porous network structure with a grain growth evolves up to 1300 degrees C, whereas densification occurred above 1400 degrees C. Anode supported SOFCs using the pasted MDLS films were successfully fabricated: an open circuit voltage of 0.91 V and a maximum power density of 150 mW cm(-2) measured at 800 degrees C were obtained with the electrolyte film sintered at 1500 degrees",Fabrication of apatite-type lanthanum silicate films and anode supported solid oxide fuel cells using nano-sized printable paste,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2013.08.041
