3,10744,"The effects of GDC concentration in the suspension on the phase composition, microstructure, and electrochemical performance of the resulting cathode are studied.",Liquid plasma sprayed nano-network La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 composite as a high-performance cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.07.108
4,10744,"When the GDC concentration increases to 15 g L-1, the nanosized GDC particles distribute uniformly and continuously on the LSCF backbone to form a porous network structure.",Liquid plasma sprayed nano-network La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 composite as a high-performance cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.07.108
5,10744,"The electrochemical studies further indicate that the cathode polarization decreased with the increase in GDC concentration from 0 g L-1 to 15 g L-1, whereas a further increase in the GDC concentration increases the cathode polarization instead.",Liquid plasma sprayed nano-network La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 composite as a high-performance cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.07.108
6,10744,"At 600 and 750 degrees C, the cathode prepared using 15 g L-1 GDC concentration exhibits an impressive area-specific polarization resistance (R-p) of 0.1 Omega cm(2) and 0.009 Omega cm(2), respectively.",Liquid plasma sprayed nano-network La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 composite as a high-performance cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.07.108
