1,14520,"This study focuses on the influence of the microstructure on the conductivity of the BaCe0.8Zr0.1Y0.1O3-delta compound, prepared by nitrate-glycine autocombustion, with a special attention to the influence of less studied parameters, i.e. the nature of the precursors and the ratio between the nitrate precursors and the glycine, and the temperature of the calcination step.",Influence of the autocombustion synthesis conditions and the calcination temperature on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of BaCe0.8Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ electrolyte material,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.07.030
2,14520,It has been shown that the nature of the precursors and the ratio between the nitrate precursors and the glycine impact strongly both the microstructure of the powders after autocombustion and of the pellets calcined at 1000 degrees C and sintered at 1400 degrees C.,Influence of the autocombustion synthesis conditions and the calcination temperature on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of BaCe0.8Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ electrolyte material,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.07.030
