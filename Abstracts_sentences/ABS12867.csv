1,12867,The impact of sintering temperature on Cr-poisoning of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes was systematically studied.,Long-Term Cr Poisoning Effect on LSCF-GDC Composite Cathodes Sintered at Different Temperatures,10.1149/2.0841609jes
2,12867,"La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-d delta - Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta symmetric cells were aged at 750 degrees C in synthetic air with the presence of Crofer 22 APU, a common high temperature interconnect, over 200 hours and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine the degradation process.",Long-Term Cr Poisoning Effect on LSCF-GDC Composite Cathodes Sintered at Different Temperatures,10.1149/2.0841609jes
3,12867,"Both the ohmic resistance (R-Omega) and polarization resistance (R-P) of LSCF-GDC cells, extracted from EIS spectra, for different sintering temperatures increase as a function of aging time.",Long-Term Cr Poisoning Effect on LSCF-GDC Composite Cathodes Sintered at Different Temperatures,10.1149/2.0841609jes
4,12867,"Furthermore, the Cr-related degradation rate increases with decreased cathode sintering temperature.",Long-Term Cr Poisoning Effect on LSCF-GDC Composite Cathodes Sintered at Different Temperatures,10.1149/2.0841609jes
5,12867,The polarization resistance of cathode sintered at lower temperature (950 degrees C) increases dramatically while aging with the presence of Cr and also significantly decreases the oxygen partial pressure dependence after aging.,Long-Term Cr Poisoning Effect on LSCF-GDC Composite Cathodes Sintered at Different Temperatures,10.1149/2.0841609jes
6,12867,The degradation rate shows a positive correlation to the concentration of Cr.,Long-Term Cr Poisoning Effect on LSCF-GDC Composite Cathodes Sintered at Different Temperatures,10.1149/2.0841609jes
7,12867,"The results indicate that decreased sintering temperature increases the total surface area, leading to more available sites for Sr-Cr-O nucleation and thus greater Cr degradation.",Long-Term Cr Poisoning Effect on LSCF-GDC Composite Cathodes Sintered at Different Temperatures,10.1149/2.0841609jes
