2,7076,"In this study, three types of coal with different ranks were used to power DC-SOFCs and the effects of the characteristics of different coals and their subsequent pyrolysis products on the output performance of DC-SOFCs were investigated.",A Comparative Study on the Performance of Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Powered with Different Rank Coals,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00051
3,7076,Results indicate that the peak power density of the anthracite-powered fuel cell is the highest-up to 45 mW/cm(2)-owing to its low ash content and high H-2 concentration in the pyrolysis gas.,A Comparative Study on the Performance of Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Powered with Different Rank Coals,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00051
4,7076,"However, the low reactivity of the semicoke derived from anthracite pyrolysis resulted in the poor stability of the anthracite-powered fuel cell.",A Comparative Study on the Performance of Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Powered with Different Rank Coals,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00051
5,7076,"The low-rank lignite exhibits a high ash content and low H-2 and CO concentrations in the pyrolysis gas, resulting in a lower peak power density of the DC-SOFC powered with lignite fuel than that powered with anthracite and bituminous fuel.",A Comparative Study on the Performance of Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Powered with Different Rank Coals,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00051
6,7076,"However, the reactivity of the semicoke from lignite pyrolysis is higher than that of the other semicokes when deashed lignite is used as fuel, and the peak power density of the DC-SOFC is the largest at 21.8 mW/cm(2) and the discharge life is the longest.",A Comparative Study on the Performance of Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Powered with Different Rank Coals,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00051
7,7076,"Based on the pyrolysis behavior of coals and the electrochemical performance of DC-SOFCs powered with different types coal, an anode zone reaction process is proposed.",A Comparative Study on the Performance of Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Powered with Different Rank Coals,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00051
8,7076,"Considering the output power density and stability of the cell, a low-rank coal with low ash and high reactivity is a promising fuel for DC-SOFCs.",A Comparative Study on the Performance of Direct Carbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Powered with Different Rank Coals,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00051
