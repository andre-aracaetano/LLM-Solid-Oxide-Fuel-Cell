3,1095,This paper summarizes and discusses the preliminary experimental results on the long-term aging tests of the reversible solid oxide planar short stack for fuel cell operation (4000 h) at a current density of 0.5 A cm(-2) which shows a degradation of 0.6% per 1000 h and for steam electrolysis operation (3450 h) and co-electrolysis operation of CO2 and H2O (640 h) under different current densities from -0.3 to -0.875 A cm(-2) which show different degradation rates depending on current density and on steam or co-electrolysis.,Long-term tests of a Julich planar short stack with reversible solid oxide cells in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.192
