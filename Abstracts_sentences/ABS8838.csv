6,8838,"Posttest analysis shows that a dense iron oxide layer formed on the surface of the nickel-iron alloy during the early stage of oxidation, which prevents the further oxidation of the substrate as well as the functional anode layer, and thus, making nickel-iron supported SOFC exhibits better redox stability at 750 degrees C. Adding 0.5 wt % magnesium oxide into the nickel-iron alloy (50 wt% iron) can inhibit the metal sintering and reduce the linear shrinkage, making the single cell exhibit promising thermal stability.",Porous nickel-iron alloys as anode support for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells: II.
