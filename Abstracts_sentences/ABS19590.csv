1,19590,Gd2O3-doped ceria (GCO) is irreplaceable as interface/buffer layer between a mixed conducting cathode such as La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and an 8 mol % Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (8YSZ) thin film electrolyte.,Nanoscale Gd-Doped CeO2 Buffer Layer for a High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003016
2,19590,"To meet the demands of high performance, indispensable characteristics of this interface (LSCF/GCO/8YSZ) are (i) no reaction of GCO with LSCF or YSZ and (ii) a GCO layer that is defect-free (closed porosity, no cracks).",Nanoscale Gd-Doped CeO2 Buffer Layer for a High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003016
3,19590,It is well known that state-of-the-art screen printed and sintered GCO buffer layers are imperfect and ultimately reduce the overall performance.,Nanoscale Gd-Doped CeO2 Buffer Layer for a High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003016
4,19590,This study concentrates on the evaluation of nanoscaled GCO thin films integrated into anode supported cells (ASC).,Nanoscale Gd-Doped CeO2 Buffer Layer for a High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003016
5,19590,GCO thin films were deposited on 8YSZ electrolyte by a low temperature metal organic deposition (MOD) process.,Nanoscale Gd-Doped CeO2 Buffer Layer for a High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003016
6,19590,MOD is preferable because it is a versatile technique for large scale and low cost fabrication for various material compositions.,Nanoscale Gd-Doped CeO2 Buffer Layer for a High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003016
7,19590,"The authors investigated the influence of preparation parameters with respect to chemical homogeneity and film quality (pores, cracks) of GCO thin films with a constant film thickness between 50 nm and 100 nm.",Nanoscale Gd-Doped CeO2 Buffer Layer for a High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003016
8,19590,Electrochemical performance of anode supported cells employing MOD derived GCO thin films will be presented in terms of ohmic resistance (ASR(Omega)) and will be evaluated in contrast to screen printed and sintered GCO thick films.,Nanoscale Gd-Doped CeO2 Buffer Layer for a High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003016
9,19590,Nanoscale MOD derived thin films with low processing temperatures and dense film qualities were vastly superior to state-of-the-art GCO and beneficial to the overall cell performance.,Nanoscale Gd-Doped CeO2 Buffer Layer for a High Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003016
