6,11667,This conductivity is greater than that of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) between 323 and 1323 K. The average coefficient of thermal expansion of LNCF is smaller than that of LSCF.,Characterization of LaNixCoyFe1-x-yO3 as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.015
7,11667,"To investigate the chemical stability against Cr2O3, we heated LNCF-Cr2O3, LSCF-Cr2O3 and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSC)-Cr2O3 powder mixtures at 1073 K for 0-1000 h. We found that LNCF powder was less reactive with Cr2O3 than LSCF and LSC powder.",Characterization of LaNixCoyFe1-x-yO3 as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.015
