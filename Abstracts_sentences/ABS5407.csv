2,5407,"However, the electrical properties of the Co-W-coated stainless steels have not yet been evaluated.",Microstructure and area specific resistance of cathodic half cells for solid oxide fuel cells composed of perovskite-type cathodes and Co-alloy-coated ferritic stainless steel interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2020.126659
3,5407,"In this study, cathodic half-cells were experimentally manufactured with La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF) as cathodes, and uncoated, Co-coated, and Co-W-coated FSSs as interconnects, respectively.",Microstructure and area specific resistance of cathodic half cells for solid oxide fuel cells composed of perovskite-type cathodes and Co-alloy-coated ferritic stainless steel interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2020.126659
4,5407,"Then their oxidation property and area-specific resistance (ASR) were evaluated at 800 degrees C. Based on phase identification and microstructural analysis, the Co-W-coating was confirmed to effectively suppress the Cr poisoning of the cathode.",Microstructure and area specific resistance of cathodic half cells for solid oxide fuel cells composed of perovskite-type cathodes and Co-alloy-coated ferritic stainless steel interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2020.126659
