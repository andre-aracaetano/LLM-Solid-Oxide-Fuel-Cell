3,10259,"Doping W keeps PrBaFe2O5+delta stability after high-temperature treatment in both air and hydrogen atmospheres, decreases the thermal expansion coefficient from 17.11 x 10(-6) to 14.59 x 10(-6) K-1, increases the content of oxygen species that are essential for the electrocatalytic reactions, and increases the chemical oxygen surface exchange coefficient by 121% at 800 degrees C. Consequently, doping W greatly improves the electrochemical performance, such as decreasing the areaspecific cathode polarization resistance by 35.5% to 0.031 Omega.cm(2) at 800 degrees C, reducing the anode polarization resistance by 17.7% to 0.123 Omega.",Tungsten-Doped PrBaFe2O5+δ Double Perovskite as a High-Performance Electrode Material for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.1c01618
