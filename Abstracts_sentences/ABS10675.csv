1,10675,"To achieve high power density in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), we introduce a dense La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3-delta (LSFM) nano-film anode between a Ni-Fe metallic substrate and a LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte.",A dense La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3-δ nano-film anode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05664g
2,10675,"Although a three-phase boundary (TPB) is believed to be required for anode active sites, the cell with the LSFM mixed-conductor thin-film anode exhibited much improved power density compared with that of the cell with a simple porous Ni-Fe anode.",A dense La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3-δ nano-film anode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05664g
3,10675,The maximum power density of the cell with the LSFM film was approximately 3.0 W cm(-2) at 973 K.,A dense La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3-δ nano-film anode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05664g
4,10675,The improved power density was primarily attributed to the enhanced anodic activity.,A dense La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3-δ nano-film anode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05664g
5,10675,"Furthermore, we observed that the dense LSFM thin-film anode is effective in increasing the fuel utilization of a Ni-Fe metallic anode supported cell.",A dense La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3-δ nano-film anode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05664g
6,10675,This suggests that a two-phase boundary (anode and gas phase) at the LaFeO3 perovskite is highly active towards the anodic reaction.,A dense La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3-δ nano-film anode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05664g
