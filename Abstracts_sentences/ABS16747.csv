1,16747,"Microcontact impedance spectroscopy was used to measure the electrode polarization resistance of geometrically defined, thin, circular (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.92)MnO3 (LSM) microelectrodes deposited on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as a function of the electrode diameter (similar to 20-200 mu m).",Geometry dependence of cathode polarization in solid oxide fuel cells investigated by defined Sr-doped LaMnO3 microelectrodes,10.1149/1.1391160
2,16747,The electrode polarization resistance is proportional to the inverse of the square of the electrode diameter.,Geometry dependence of cathode polarization in solid oxide fuel cells investigated by defined Sr-doped LaMnO3 microelectrodes,10.1149/1.1391160
3,16747,"This clear result indicates a rate-determining step of the oxygen reduction that is connected with the electrode area rather than depending on the length of the three-phase boundary LSM, O-2/YSZ.",Geometry dependence of cathode polarization in solid oxide fuel cells investigated by defined Sr-doped LaMnO3 microelectrodes,10.1149/1.1391160
