1,10107,"Taking Y2O3 stabilized Bi2O3 (YSB)as an example, bismuth oxide-added (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSM) is evaluated as a cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) with 8 mol% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) electrolytes.","Bismuth oxide-coated (La,Sr)MnO3 cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes",10.1016/j.electacta.2008.11.067
2,10107,"YSB was added to LSM cathodes using an impregnation method, dramatically improving the electrode performance.","Bismuth oxide-coated (La,Sr)MnO3 cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes",10.1016/j.electacta.2008.11.067
3,10107,"The interfacial polarization resistance R-p, at 700 degrees C for the electrode coated with 50 wt.% of YSB is 0.14 Omega cm(2), which is only 0.2% of the value for a pure LSM electrode.","Bismuth oxide-coated (La,Sr)MnO3 cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes",10.1016/j.electacta.2008.11.067
4,10107,"The high oxygen ionic conductivity and the catalytic activity of YSB, as well as the favorable electrode microstructure are likely reasons for the dramatic reduction of R-p.","Bismuth oxide-coated (La,Sr)MnO3 cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes",10.1016/j.electacta.2008.11.067
5,10107,The YSB-added LSM cathodes also exhibited lower overpotential and higher exchange current density than the pure LSM cathode.,"Bismuth oxide-coated (La,Sr)MnO3 cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes",10.1016/j.electacta.2008.11.067
6,10107,"Moreover, these electrodes show much lower R-p than that of parallel-fabricated LSM electrodes with samaria-doped-CeO2 as well as other LSM-based electrodes reported in the literature, demonstrating the superiority of the of YSB as the ionic conduction component in composite LSM electrodes.","Bismuth oxide-coated (La,Sr)MnO3 cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes",10.1016/j.electacta.2008.11.067
7,10107,The superior performance of the single cell further demonstrates that the bismuth oxide-added LSM cathode is an excellent candidate for IT-SOFCs.,"Bismuth oxide-coated (La,Sr)MnO3 cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells with yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes",10.1016/j.electacta.2008.11.067
