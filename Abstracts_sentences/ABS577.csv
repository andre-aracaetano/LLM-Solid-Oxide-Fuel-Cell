1,577,"XRD, XPS and electrochemical studies show clear evidence of chemical interaction under oxidising and reducing conditions between YSZ and CuO, both components of a widely studied anode material for high performance solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Is YSZ stable in the presence of Cu?,10.1039/b807378c
2,577,The aim of this work is to identify and verify the nature of this interaction and find means to prevent its formation during the fabrication process of a fuel cell.,Is YSZ stable in the presence of Cu?,10.1039/b807378c
