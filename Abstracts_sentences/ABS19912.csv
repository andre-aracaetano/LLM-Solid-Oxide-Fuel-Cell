2,19912,Electrolytic deposition of yttrium salts is used to form thin (<100 nm) coatings on both flat steel sheets (material: Crofer 22 APU) and its properties are proven on woven wire-meshes (materials from two different sources: SUS316 and SUS316L).,Effective yttrium based coating for steel interconnects of solid oxide cells: Corrosion evaluation in steam-hydrogen atmosphere,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226814
3,19912,The oxide scale on the coated Crofer 22 APU sheet remains intact after 2000 h operation at 750 degrees C in H-2 with 90% H2O.,Effective yttrium based coating for steel interconnects of solid oxide cells: Corrosion evaluation in steam-hydrogen atmosphere,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226814
4,19912,"The corrosion rate at 750 degrees C of the coated Crofer 22 APU sheets is compared with that of uncoated samples and of samples with a commercial magneton sputtered CGO coating revealing that the coatings reduce the parabolic rate constant characteristic of the corrosion by a factor of 10 and 20 for the CGO and the Y, respectively.",Effective yttrium based coating for steel interconnects of solid oxide cells: Corrosion evaluation in steam-hydrogen atmosphere,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226814
5,19912,"The coated meshes also exhibit high corrosion resistance and long-term-stable low electrical resistance at 650 degrees C, both in 90% H2O in H-2, and in air.",Effective yttrium based coating for steel interconnects of solid oxide cells: Corrosion evaluation in steam-hydrogen atmosphere,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226814
6,19912,"In addition to the experimental work, Y-Cr-O-2 phase diagrams are constructed illustrating the high stability of the YCrO3 phase (that forms during corrosion) over a wide temperature and pO(2) range.",Effective yttrium based coating for steel interconnects of solid oxide cells: Corrosion evaluation in steam-hydrogen atmosphere,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226814
