1,17135,The degradation of Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based solid oxide electrolysis cells operated at high current densities was studied.,Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells: Degradation at High Current Densities,10.1149/1.3447752
2,17135,"The degradation was examined at 850 degrees C, at current densities of -1.0, -1.5, and -2.0 A/cm(2), with a 50:50 (H(2)O:H(2)) gas supplied to the Ni/YSZ hydrogen electrode and oxygen supplied to the lanthanum, strontium manganite (LSM)/YSZ oxygen electrode.",Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells: Degradation at High Current Densities,10.1149/1.3447752
3,17135,Electrode polarization resistance degradation is not directly related to the applied current density but rather a consequence of adsorbed impurities in the Ni/YSZ hydrogen electrode.,Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells: Degradation at High Current Densities,10.1149/1.3447752
4,17135,"However, the ohmic resistance degradation increases with applied current density.",Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells: Degradation at High Current Densities,10.1149/1.3447752
5,17135,The ohmic resistance degradation is attributed to oxygen formation in the YSZ electrolyte grain boundaries near the oxygen electrode/electrolyte interface.,Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells: Degradation at High Current Densities,10.1149/1.3447752
