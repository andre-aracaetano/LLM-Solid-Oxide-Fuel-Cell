2,7616,"When either La(0.58)Sr(0.4)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) (LSCF)-Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.95) (GDC) or Ni-added LSCF-GDC composite is used as the anode, the oscillations of the electrical current and the formation rates of CO and CO(2) occur.",Oscillation of electrical current during direct methane oxidation over Ni-added LSCF-GDC anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cej.2009.06.014
3,7616,"The oscillation of the electrical current can be explained by a mechanism of periodic oxidation-reduction of the bulk lattice of the anode, with the determining factor being the build-up of the concentration of the oxygen vacancies to a certain extent.",Oscillation of electrical current during direct methane oxidation over Ni-added LSCF-GDC anode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cej.2009.06.014
