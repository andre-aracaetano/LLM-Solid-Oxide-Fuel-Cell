1,11821,One of the key directions for the development of commercial solid oxide fuel cells fuelled by natural gases consists in the search for efficient fuel electrode materials operated under hydrocarbon-containing atmospheres.,Catalytic properties of Sr2Ni0.75Mg0.25MoO6_d based composites for application in hydrocarbon-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.159
2,11821,"Within the present work, we synthesized and characterised novel composites based on a double-perovskite Sr2Ni0.75Mg0.25MoO6_5 phase and a second phase comprised of SrMoO4 or NiO. For these composite materials, the reduction behaviour, tolerance to carbon dioxide and catalytic activity towards the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons mixture were comprehensively studied.",Catalytic properties of Sr2Ni0.75Mg0.25MoO6_d based composites for application in hydrocarbon-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.159
3,11821,It is shown that the target properties of the designed composites are affected not only by the type of catalysts but also by the method of their preparation.,Catalytic properties of Sr2Ni0.75Mg0.25MoO6_d based composites for application in hydrocarbon-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.159
