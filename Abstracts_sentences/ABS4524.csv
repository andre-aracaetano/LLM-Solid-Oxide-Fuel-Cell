2,4524,"However, controversial information on the A-site deficiency effect on structural, transport and electrochemical properties of these materials apparently requires further studies of such systems.",Mixed ionic-electronic conductivity features of A-site deficient Nd nickelates,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.024

4,4524,(Nd2-xCax)(0.975)NiO4+delta (x = 0-0.4) samples were synthesized via a solution-assisted solid state reaction method and characterized by X-ray diffraction.,Mixed ionic-electronic conductivity features of A-site deficient Nd nickelates,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.024
5,4524,Oxygen transport was studied by the temperature programmed isotope exchange of oxygen with (CO2)-O-18 in the flow reactor.,Mixed ionic-electronic conductivity features of A-site deficient Nd nickelates,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.024
6,4524,A high oxygen mobility of materials (D* similar to 10(-7) cm(2)/s at 700 degrees C) is provided by the cooperative mechanism of oxygen migration involving both regular and highly-mobile interstitial oxygen.,Mixed ionic-electronic conductivity features of A-site deficient Nd nickelates,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.024
7,4524,"As typical for Ruddlesden-Popper phases, doping with Ca leads to increase of total conductivity due to holes' formation and decrease of oxygen mobility due to hampering cooperative mechanism, however, this effect is less pronounced compared to A-site stoichiometric Nd nickelates which can be attributed to oxygen vacancies formation and their participation in cooperative migration as well as to other features of A-site deficiency.",Mixed ionic-electronic conductivity features of A-site deficient Nd nickelates,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.024
8,4524,High mixed ionic-electronic conductivity of materials makes them promising in using as solid oxide fuel cells cathodes and oxygen separation membranes.,Mixed ionic-electronic conductivity features of A-site deficient Nd nickelates,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.024
