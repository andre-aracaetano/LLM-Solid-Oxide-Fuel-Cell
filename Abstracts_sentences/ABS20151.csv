6,20151,"Since the electrification of transport is likely to be a major aspect of the transformation of domestic energy consumption, electric cars are also included in the microgrid model.",Long term energy storage with reversible solid oxide cells for microgrid applications,10.1016/j.egyr.2021.02.059
7,20151,"The performance of the microgrid is evaluated in terms of its grid independence (self-sufficiency ratio, SSR) and economics (simple payback time and net present value).",Long term energy storage with reversible solid oxide cells for microgrid applications,10.1016/j.egyr.2021.02.059
8,20151,Optimisation is used to select and size the microgrid's components under different scenarios.,Long term energy storage with reversible solid oxide cells for microgrid applications,10.1016/j.egyr.2021.02.059
9,20151,Optimisation results suggest that battery storage is often preferred to HESS.,Long term energy storage with reversible solid oxide cells for microgrid applications,10.1016/j.egyr.2021.02.059
10,20151,"However, two factors in particular can cause the selection of HESS to be favoured: (i) a requirement for high SSR and (ii) a lower constraint (6 kW) on the PV capacity per household.",Long term energy storage with reversible solid oxide cells for microgrid applications,10.1016/j.egyr.2021.02.059
