2,8006,Lowering down its operating temperature is important for commercialization.,Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
3,8006,More attentions are therefore paid on how to decrease the operating temperature from traditional 800-1 000 degrees C to 600 degrees C or below.,Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
4,8006,"The paper summarizes the development of the electrolytes, cathodes, and anodes for SOFCs operated below 600 degrees C. Choosing alternative ceria-based oxides with high ionic conductivity at low temperature, decreasing the electrolyte thickness, and constructing bilayered electrolytes with additional electronic blocking layer to enhance the open circuit voltage are all effective approaches for the improving electrolytes.",Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
5,8006,"While for the electrodes, novel materials are developed to increase the catalytic activity at low temperature.",Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
6,8006,"Moreover, ion-impregnation method is applied to optimize the microstructure of electrodes.",Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
7,8006,"Thus the triple phase boundary and active site has been enhanced, resulting in decreased electrode resistance and direct utilization of hydrocarbon without carbon deposition.",Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
8,8006,"In addition, new types of low temperature SOFCs such as single chamber SOFCs and micro SOFCs are also presented, which might have significant impact on the development of low temperature SOFCs.",Low Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,
