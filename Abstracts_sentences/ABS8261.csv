1,8261,"In the perovskite structures widely investigated and used as Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) cathodes, oxygen reduction is mainly limited to the triple phase boundary (TPB), where oxygen (air), electrode and electrolyte are in contact.",Synthesis and characterization of Co-doped Lanthanum Nickelate perovskites for solid oxide fuel cell cathode material,
2,8261,"It is possible via the sol-gel modified Pechini method to: 1) control the material grain size, which can increase TPBs, 2) produce a homogenous material and 3) obtain a cathode material in a faster way compared with the solid state route.",Synthesis and characterization of Co-doped Lanthanum Nickelate perovskites for solid oxide fuel cell cathode material,
3,8261,"LaNixCo1-xO3 (x = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7) were synthesized by the modified Pechini method.",Synthesis and characterization of Co-doped Lanthanum Nickelate perovskites for solid oxide fuel cell cathode material,
4,8261,The perovskite phase formation began at 350 degrees C and the presence of pure LaNi0.7Co0.3O3 LaNi0.5Co0.5O3 and LaNi0.3Co0.7O3 structures was evidenced by High Temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) measurements.,Synthesis and characterization of Co-doped Lanthanum Nickelate perovskites for solid oxide fuel cell cathode material,
5,8261,Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs showed that the microstructure evolves with the amount of cobalt from a coalesced to an open structure.,Synthesis and characterization of Co-doped Lanthanum Nickelate perovskites for solid oxide fuel cell cathode material,
6,8261,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on symmetrical cells LaNixCo1-xO3/YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia)/LaNixCo1-xO3 showed that the highest ASR (area specific resistance) is obtained with x = 0.3, whereas ASR values are similar for x = 0.5 and 0.7 at temperatures higher than 600 degrees C.",Synthesis and characterization of Co-doped Lanthanum Nickelate perovskites for solid oxide fuel cell cathode material,
7,8261,"At temperatures lower than 600 degrees C, ASR is the lowest for LaNi0.5Co0.5O3, showing that this composition with intermediate porosity appears as a good choice for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).",Synthesis and characterization of Co-doped Lanthanum Nickelate perovskites for solid oxide fuel cell cathode material,
