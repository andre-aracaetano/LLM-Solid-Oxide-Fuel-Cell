1,17,A no-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell operated on a fuel-rich ethanol flame was reported.,A high-performance no-chamber fuel cell operated on ethanol flame,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.004
2,17,Heat produced from the combustion of ethanol thermally sustained the fuel cell at a temperature of 500-830 degrees C. Considerable amounts of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were also produced during the fuel-rich combustion which provided the direct fuels for the fuel cell.,A high-performance no-chamber fuel cell operated on ethanol flame,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.004
3,17,The location of the fuel cell with respect to the flame was found to have a significant effect on the fuel cell temperature and performance.,A high-performance no-chamber fuel cell operated on ethanol flame,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.004
4,17,The highest power density was achieved when the anode was exposed to the inner flame.,A high-performance no-chamber fuel cell operated on ethanol flame,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.004
5,17,"By modifying the Ni + Sm0.2Ce0.80O1.9 (SDC) anode with a thin Ru/SDC catalytic layer, the fuel cell envisaged not only an increase of the peak power density to similar to 200 mW cm(-2) but also a significant improvement of the anodic coking resistance.",A high-performance no-chamber fuel cell operated on ethanol flame,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.004
