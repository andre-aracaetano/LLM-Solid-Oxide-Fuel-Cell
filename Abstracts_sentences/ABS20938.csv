1,20938,"Several high-temperature energy conversion and storage technologies rely on redox cycling of Fe-based materials, including storage materials in solid-oxide Fe-air batteries and oxygen carriers in chemicallooping combustion.","Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
2,20938,"The materials' macroporosity necessary for gas flow is, however, irreversibly diminished during redox cycling due to (i) large volume changes during the redox transformations, (ii) foam sintering at elevated operating temperature (550-900 degrees C), and (iii) formation and growth of Kirkendall microporosity.","Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
3,20938,"To address these challenges, we use directional freeze-casting to create highly porous, lamellar, Fe-composite foams containing uniformly distributed sintering inhibitor (SI) particles-","Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
4,20938,"either Y2O3 -stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ), CeO2, or ZrO2-at 0, 5, 10, or 15% of the solid volume.","Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
5,20938,"We characterize these foams before, during, and after redox cycling (Fe/FeO/Fe3O4, via H2O and H-2) at 800 degrees C using operando synchrotron X-ray microtomography, metallography, and scanning electron microscopy.","Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
6,20938,Shrinkage of the foam volume and formation of a gas-blocking shell surrounding the foam are reduced as the SI fraction increases.,"Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
7,20938,Volumetric shrinkage after the first five redox cycles is decreased from 66% (for pure-Fe foams) to 45% (for all Fe-composites containing 5 vol % SI).,"Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
8,20938,"Foams containing 15 vol % YSZ show no volumetric shrinkage after five cycles, although, after 20 cycles, they have shrunk 53%.","Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
9,20938,"Post-cycling analysis reveals segregation of the SI particles to the cores of individual lamellae, surrounded by thick layers of sintered Fe on the lamellae surfaces.","Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
10,20938,"This segregation occurs due to Fe diffusion through FeO to the lamellae surfaces during oxidation, leaving behind the SI particles, which are then pushed into clusters by FeO/Fe3O4 contraction during reduction.","Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
11,20938,"The SI is thus rendered ineffective, which explains why foam densification is delayed (compared with pure-Fe foams), rather than fully prevented, after repeated cycling.","Hierarchical Structural Changes During Redox Cycling of Fe-Based Lamellar Foams Containing YSZ, CeO2, or ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.0c05107
