1,6937,"To improve the thermal stability and intrinsically sluggish kinetics of oxygen electrode reactions in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) at intermediate temperatures, a novel layered swedenborgite structure Y0.8Er0.2BaCo3.2Ga0.8O7+delta (YEBCG) catalyst is introduced as an alternative to perovskite materials that contain cobalt.",Activity of layered swedenborgite structured Y0.8Er0.2BaCo3.2Ga0.8O7+δ for oxygen electrode reactions in at intermediate temperature reversible ceramic cells,10.1039/d0ta11000k
2,6937,"The thermal expansion coefficient of YEBCG is 8.41 x 10(-6) K-1, which is relatively well matched to the state-of-the-art proton-conducting and oxygen-ion-conducting electrolytes.",Activity of layered swedenborgite structured Y0.8Er0.2BaCo3.2Ga0.8O7+δ for oxygen electrode reactions in at intermediate temperature reversible ceramic cells,10.1039/d0ta11000k
3,6937,"The chemical bulk diffusion and surface exchange coefficients of YEBCG are 7.12 x 10(-4) and 8.01 x 10(-3) cm(2) s(-1), respectively, at 650 degrees C, which leads to much faster action than with state-of-art perovskite structured materials at intermediate temperatures.",Activity of layered swedenborgite structured Y0.8Er0.2BaCo3.2Ga0.8O7+δ for oxygen electrode reactions in at intermediate temperature reversible ceramic cells,10.1039/d0ta11000k
4,6937,"The maximum power densities of YEBCG cells are notably high, reaching 0.77 and 0.83 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C in SOFC and protonic ceramic fuel cell modes, respectively.",Activity of layered swedenborgite structured Y0.8Er0.2BaCo3.2Ga0.8O7+δ for oxygen electrode reactions in at intermediate temperature reversible ceramic cells,10.1039/d0ta11000k
5,6937,"Under electrolysis, the YEBCG cells achieve outstanding current densities of -0.61 and -4.42 A cm(-2) at 500 and 700 degrees C, respectively, under an applied voltage of 1.4 V. Furthermore, the RPCC with YEBCG present no degradation over an entire 1000 h in fuel cell and electrolysis cell modes.",Activity of layered swedenborgite structured Y0.8Er0.2BaCo3.2Ga0.8O7+δ for oxygen electrode reactions in at intermediate temperature reversible ceramic cells,10.1039/d0ta11000k
6,6937,"These results demonstrate the excellent properties, including good durability, of the YEBCG air electrode when used in high performance SOFCs and RPCCs.",Activity of layered swedenborgite structured Y0.8Er0.2BaCo3.2Ga0.8O7+δ for oxygen electrode reactions in at intermediate temperature reversible ceramic cells,10.1039/d0ta11000k
