1,11314,Digital light processing (DLP)-stereolithography three-dimensional (3D) printing is a well known technique for fabricating components with complex geometries.,Digital light processing-stereolithography three-dimensional printing of yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.113
2,11314,"However, the application of DLP 3D printing to functional ceramics such as 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ), which is one of the most extensively used electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells, is still a great challenge.",Digital light processing-stereolithography three-dimensional printing of yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.113
3,11314,"Therefore, the fabrication of fully 8YSZ monoliths via DLP 3D printing was attempted herein, including the preparation of UV-curable ceramic suspensions, shaping of green bodies, and debinding and sintering.",Digital light processing-stereolithography three-dimensional printing of yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.113
4,11314,The results show that intact green bodies printed using a 30 vol% 8YSZ-photosensitive resin suspension with 0.1 wt% oleic acid as the dispersant under the optimized printing conditions was sufficiently dense without connected pores after vacuum debinding and sintering in air.,Digital light processing-stereolithography three-dimensional printing of yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.113
5,11314,The successful fabrication of 8YSZ monoliths with design flexibility via 3D printing provides a simple method for preparing functional ceramic components and may expand the application of 3D printing technology to the energy field.,Digital light processing-stereolithography three-dimensional printing of yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.113
