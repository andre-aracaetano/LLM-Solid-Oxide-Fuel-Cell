5,19615,The model carries out a thermodynamic analysis in order to calculate the energy efficiency and the exergetic consumption of the system; these performances are subsequently compared with those of a low-temperature hydrogen generation system evaluated from experimental data measured in test sessions performed on a complete BoP integrating a pressurized Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyser.,A comparative assessment on hydrogen production from low- and high-temperature electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.065

7,19615,"The results of this study show that the modeled SOEC hydrogen generation system can compete with the PEM electrolyser, achieving better performance than the low-temperature system at hydrogen production rate higher than 18.3 g h(-1) (corresponding to 0.25 A cm(-2)) and showing an energy efficiency up to 14% higher than the PEM system at 1 A cm(-2).",A comparative assessment on hydrogen production from low- and high-temperature electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.065
