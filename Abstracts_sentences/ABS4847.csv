1,4847,Methanol is a promising fuel for the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) due to its easy storage and transportation compared with hydrogen.,Thermo-electrochemical modelling of high temperature methanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116832
2,4847,"As no thermo-electrochemical modelling study has been conducted on methanolfuelled SOFC, a 2D model is developed to simulate the methanol decomposition reaction, water gas shift reaction, electrochemical reactions, heat and mass transfer processes in the methanol-fuelled SOFC.",Thermo-electrochemical modelling of high temperature methanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116832
3,4847,"After model validation, parametric simulations are performed to investigate the effects of the operating potential, steam to carbon ratio, the inlet temperature and fuel/air flow rates on the performance of SOFCs.",Thermo-electrochemical modelling of high temperature methanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116832
4,4847,"At 1073 K, the peak power density of methanol-fuelled SOFC is higher than 10000 W m- 2 with the steam to carbon ratio of 1.",Thermo-electrochemical modelling of high temperature methanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116832
5,4847,"In addition, the temperature distribution in SOFC could be remarkably affected by the working conditions due to the chemical/electrochemical reactions and overpotential losses.",Thermo-electrochemical modelling of high temperature methanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116832
6,4847,Large temperature variation (nearly 180 K) between the inlet and outlet of the SOFC is observed mainly due to greatly improved current density at low operating potential.,Thermo-electrochemical modelling of high temperature methanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116832
7,4847,"Also, temperature reduction can be achieved by increasing the steam to carbon ratio and gas flow rates (higher than 170 SCCM for air and 0.1 ml min-1 for fuel mixture, respectively), which could improve the long-term stability from the perspective of the thermal stress but inevitably lower the efficiency of the SOFC.",Thermo-electrochemical modelling of high temperature methanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116832
8,4847,"Meanwhile, higher inlet temperature not only enhances the power output, but improves the uniformity of the cell temperature distribution.",Thermo-electrochemical modelling of high temperature methanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116832
9,4847,"Overall, the investigations of the present study could serve as a solid guidance to understand the thermal characteristics of solid oxide fuel cells running on mixture of the steam and methanol.",Thermo-electrochemical modelling of high temperature methanol-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116832
