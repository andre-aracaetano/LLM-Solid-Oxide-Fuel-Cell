2,2487,"At a given Zn content, the (Y0.5In0.5) BaCo4-xZnxO7 compositions exhibit superior phase stability compared to YBaCo4-xZnxO7 and InBaCo4-xZnxO7 at the operating temperatures of SOFC (600-800 degrees C).","(Y0.5In0.5)Ba(Co,Zn)4O7 cathodes with superior high-temperature phase stability for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.050
3,2487,"In the (Y0.5In0.5)Ba(Co4-xZnx)O-7 system, the x = 1 sample offers a combination of good electrochemical performance, low thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), and enhanced chemical stability against Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC) electrolyte while demonstrating good phase stability at 600-800 degrees C for 100 h. Optimum cathode performance could be obtained by employing (Y0.5In0.5)BaCo3ZnO7 + GDC (50:50 wt.%) composite cathodes attached at 850 degrees C for 3 h as evidenced by ac-impedance spectroscopy, and the fuel cell performance of this composite cathode was evaluated using anode-supported single cells.","(Y0.5In0.5)Ba(Co,Zn)4O7 cathodes with superior high-temperature phase stability for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.050
