1,9502,"One of the remaining challenges for the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology is decreasing its operation temperature to the 500-800 degrees C range in a cost-effective way without diminishing the cell performance, In this work, we studied a symmetrical cell composed of Sr0.6La0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LSCFO) cathodes deposited on a Ce0.8Y0.2O2-delta (CYO) substrate by the simple, cost-effective and scalable spin coating technique.",Improved Sr0.6La0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ/Ce0.8Y0.2O2-δ interface for IT-SOFC applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.11.031

3,9502,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis indicates that electrolyte grain boundary conductivity strongly depends on the cathode nature.,Improved Sr0.6La0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ/Ce0.8Y0.2O2-δ interface for IT-SOFC applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.11.031
4,9502,The detailed high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) characterization of the LSCFO/CYO interface reveals that the LSCFO cathode is well adhered to the CYO electrolyte.,Improved Sr0.6La0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ/Ce0.8Y0.2O2-δ interface for IT-SOFC applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.11.031
5,9502,"The improved nano/microstructure of the cathodes and the cathode/electrolyte interface yields to cathode area specific resistance (ASR) values as low as 0.4 Omega cm(2) at 550 degrees C, being these values even lower than those previously reported in literature for cathodes in optimized LSCFO/CYO/YSZ/CYO/LSCFO cells.",Improved Sr0.6La0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ/Ce0.8Y0.2O2-δ interface for IT-SOFC applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.11.031
