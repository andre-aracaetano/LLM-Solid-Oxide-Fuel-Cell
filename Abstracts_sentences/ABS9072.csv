3,9072,"cm2, the maximum power density (MPD) of single cell is 1180 mW cm-2, and the corresponding open circuit voltage (OCV) is 1.04 V. By reconstructing the microstructure of cobalt-free cathode, the electrochemical performance of H+-SOFC prepared by La0.7Sr0.3FeO3-8-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-8 (LSF-SDC) composite cathode has been greatly improved, which provides an effective method for obtaining porous nanocathodes as well as low-cost, high-performance H+-SOFC.",Nanofibrous La0.7Sr0.3FeO3-8-SDC cobalt-free composite cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.133687
