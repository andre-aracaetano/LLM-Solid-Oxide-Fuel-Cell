6,20554,Additional oxygen adsorption was attempted at several adsorption temperatures but no discrete oxygen desorption peaks were observed before the onset of reduction.,Temperature Programmed Oxygen Desorption of the Perovskites Series Ln0.65Sr0.3Mn0.8Co0.2O3 (Ln = La-Gd),10.1007/BF02375474
7,20554,"Pr0.65Sr0.3Mn0.8Co0.2O3 was found to have the lowest reduction activation energy (149 +/- 19 kJ/mol) and the lowest temperature, T-R, for onset of reduction (750 K).",Temperature Programmed Oxygen Desorption of the Perovskites Series Ln0.65Sr0.3Mn0.8Co0.2O3 (Ln = La-Gd),10.1007/BF02375474
8,20554,On the other hand Gd0.65Sr0.3Mn0.8Co0.2O3 was found to have the highest reduction activation energy (232 +/- 38 kJ/mol) while the TR was about 850 K.
