1,18071,Compact CaZr0.9Y0.1O3-delta (CZY) film on a porous SrTi0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (STF) support is obtained using the technique of deposition from solutions of inorganic salts in ethanol.,"Synthesis, Microstructure, and Electric Properties of CaZr0.9Y0.1O3-δ Films Obtained on Porous SrTi0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Supports",10.1134/S1023193516110033
2,18071,"According to the data of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the film has a nanoporous granular structure with the grain size of 0.2 to 1 mu m.","Synthesis, Microstructure, and Electric Properties of CaZr0.9Y0.1O3-δ Films Obtained on Porous SrTi0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Supports",10.1134/S1023193516110033
3,18071,The thickness of the CZY film on the STF support is about 3 mu m after 15-fold solution application.,"Synthesis, Microstructure, and Electric Properties of CaZr0.9Y0.1O3-δ Films Obtained on Porous SrTi0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Supports",10.1134/S1023193516110033
4,18071,The results of studying the elemental composition showed that elements of the support diffuse into the film in the course of synthesis.,"Synthesis, Microstructure, and Electric Properties of CaZr0.9Y0.1O3-δ Films Obtained on Porous SrTi0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Supports",10.1134/S1023193516110033
5,18071,Analysis of the data of impedance spectroscopy shows that conductivity of the CZY film is limited the grain bulk.,"Synthesis, Microstructure, and Electric Properties of CaZr0.9Y0.1O3-δ Films Obtained on Porous SrTi0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Supports",10.1134/S1023193516110033
6,18071,It is assumed that the comparatively low conductivity activation energy of the film (50.3 kJ/mol) is due to diffusion of elements of the STF support that results in variation of the film composition and properties.,"Synthesis, Microstructure, and Electric Properties of CaZr0.9Y0.1O3-δ Films Obtained on Porous SrTi0.8Fe0.2O3-δ Supports",10.1134/S1023193516110033
