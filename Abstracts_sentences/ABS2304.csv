1,2304,The three-phase boundaries (TPBs) in the electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have different activity because of the distributed nature of the electrochemical reactions.,Electrochemically Active Thickness of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes: Effectiveness Model Prediction,10.1002/bkcs.11116
2,2304,The electrochemically active thickness ( EAT) is a good measure to evaluate the extension of the active reaction zone into the electrode and the effective utilization of TPBs.,Electrochemically Active Thickness of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes: Effectiveness Model Prediction,10.1002/bkcs.11116
3,2304,"In this study, an electrochemical reaction/charge conduction problem is formulated based on the Butler-Volmer reaction kinetics and then numerically solved to determine the EATs for the active electrode layers of SOFCs with various microstructural, dimensional, and property parameters.",Electrochemically Active Thickness of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes: Effectiveness Model Prediction,10.1002/bkcs.11116
4,2304,"Thus, the EAT data and correlations presented in this study are expected to provide useful information for designing efficient electrodes of SOFCs.",Electrochemically Active Thickness of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes: Effectiveness Model Prediction,10.1002/bkcs.11116
