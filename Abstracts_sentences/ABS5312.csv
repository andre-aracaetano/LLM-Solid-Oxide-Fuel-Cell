2,5312,"In this paper, we successfully synthesize a series of Nb-doped LaBaFe(2-x)NbxO(6-)(delta) (x = 0, 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1) cathode materials and present a systematic investigation on their physical and electrochemical properties.",Novel cobalt-free layered perovskite LaBaFe2-xNbxO6-δ (x=0-0.1) as cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227875
3,5312,"In comparison to the parent LaBaFe2O6-delta material, the Nb-doped materials greatly improve the electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical performance, while possessing a suitable thermal expansion coefficient and excellent electrode stability.",Novel cobalt-free layered perovskite LaBaFe2-xNbxO6-δ (x=0-0.1) as cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227875
4,5312,"Among the series of samples, the LaBaFe1.925Nb0.075O6-delta cathode exhibits the lowest polarization resistance of 0.056 Omega cm(2) and the largest power densities of 553 mWcm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Additionally, the cells still maintain a favorable electrode stability without obvious electrochemical performance degradation after a test period of 50 h.",Novel cobalt-free layered perovskite LaBaFe2-xNbxO6-δ (x=0-0.1) as cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227875
5,5312,"According to the analysis result of the distribution of relaxation times, the oxygen partial pressure dependence studies indicate that the major determining step of the whole oxygen reduction reaction processes under lower oxygen partial pressures is the adsorption process of oxygen molecules on the electrode surface.",Novel cobalt-free layered perovskite LaBaFe2-xNbxO6-δ (x=0-0.1) as cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227875
