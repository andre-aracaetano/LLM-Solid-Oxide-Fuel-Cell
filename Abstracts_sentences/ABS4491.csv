3,4491,"We observe the formation of Ba3Nb10O28 crystalline phase in the Nb2O5-doped glass, leading to significantly enhanced crack-resistant and self-healing abilities of the glass.",A robust glass-ceramic sealing material for solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of Ba3Nb10O28 phase,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.12.001
4,4491,"In addition, we demonstrate long-term thermal and chemical stability at the sealing interface between the Nb2O5-doped glass-ceramics and Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte after heat-treatment at 700 degrees C for 1000 h. The possible mechanism for the improved crack-resistant and self-healing properties is discussed.",A robust glass-ceramic sealing material for solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of Ba3Nb10O28 phase,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.12.001
