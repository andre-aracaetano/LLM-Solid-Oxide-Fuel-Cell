1,2454,In this work we demonstrate that the experimentally measured area specific resistance and oxygen surface exchange of solid oxide fuel cell cathode perovskites are strongly correlated with the first-principles calculated oxygen p-band center and vacancy formation energy.,Prediction of solid oxide fuel cell cathode activity with first-principles descriptors,10.1039/c1ee02032c
2,2454,These quantities are therefore descriptors of catalytic activity that can be used in the first-principles design of new SOFC cathodes.,Prediction of solid oxide fuel cell cathode activity with first-principles descriptors,10.1039/c1ee02032c
