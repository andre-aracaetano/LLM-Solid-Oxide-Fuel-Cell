4,20242,"For mass production and upscaling, we have thus far focused on the vapor-phase synthesis of c-axis-oriented apatite-type LSO and successfully grew polycrystals of highly c-axis-oriented boron-substituted apatite-type lanthanum silicate (c-LSBO) using B2O3 vapor.",Crystal Growth Mechanism of Highly c-Axis-Oriented Apatite-Type Lanthanum Borosilicate Using B2O3 Vapor,10.1021/acsomega.0c04846
5,20242,"Here, we investigated the mechanism of c-LSBO crystal growth to determine why the utilization of B2O3 vapor resulted in such a strong c-axis crystal orientation.",Crystal Growth Mechanism of Highly c-Axis-Oriented Apatite-Type Lanthanum Borosilicate Using B2O3 Vapor,10.1021/acsomega.0c04846
6,20242,"The synthesis of c-LSBO by the B2O3 vapor-phase method results in crystal growth accompanied by the diffusion of B2O3 supplied from another new compound that formed on the surface of the La2SiO5 disk, LaBO3.",Crystal Growth Mechanism of Highly c-Axis-Oriented Apatite-Type Lanthanum Borosilicate Using B2O3 Vapor,10.1021/acsomega.0c04846
