1,6057,"Here, a nanoporous Sm0.95Ce0.05FeO3-delta (SCFO) perovskite-type oxide is assessed in regard to its possible use as an electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells.",A new family of Ce-doped SmFeO3 perovskite for application in symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.069
2,6057,It is found that SCFO has a good redox stability after characterizing the sample which is calcined at 850 degrees C in 5% H-2/N-2 for 10 h. Optimized electrochemical performances are obtained in both the nanoporous anode and cathode which are mainly due to the high catalytic activity of SCFO for redox reaction.,A new family of Ce-doped SmFeO3 perovskite for application in symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.069
3,6057,"The peak power density of SCFO vertical bar YSZ vertical bar SCFO symmetrical cell is as high as 130 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C using pure, humidified H-2 as the fuel.",A new family of Ce-doped SmFeO3 perovskite for application in symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.069
4,6057,"Moreover, the maximum power density of 193 mW cm(-2) can be obtained for the SCFO:YSZ(7:3)vertical bar YSZ vertical bar SCFO:YSZ(7:3) symmetrical cell under the same conditions.",A new family of Ce-doped SmFeO3 perovskite for application in symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.069
