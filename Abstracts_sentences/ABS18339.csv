1,18339,"The lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrites (LSCF) are a well-known family of mixed oxygen-ionic/electronic conductors that are of interest for use in high-temperature electrochemical devices, such as solid oxide fuel cells and oxygen separation membranes.",Joining mixed conducting oxides using an air-fired electrically conductive braze,10.1149/1.1764782
2,18339,"One of the challenges however in developing these types of devices is joining the constituent metallic and ceramic components, particularly with a technique that is compatible with the electrochemically active membrane materials.",Joining mixed conducting oxides using an air-fired electrically conductive braze,10.1149/1.1764782
3,18339,A new joining process has been developed which employs a silver-copper oxide braze material.,Joining mixed conducting oxides using an air-fired electrically conductive braze,10.1149/1.1764782
4,18339,"In the present study, we found that braze compositions containing between 1.4 and 16 mol % CuO offer the best combination of wettability, joint strength, and electrical conductivity.",Joining mixed conducting oxides using an air-fired electrically conductive braze,10.1149/1.1764782
5,18339,Our results indicate that the wettability of the Ag-CuO brazes on LSCF substrates increases with CuO content and that electrical conductivity through the joint remains high as long as the silver content is greater than 66 mol %.,Joining mixed conducting oxides using an air-fired electrically conductive braze,10.1149/1.1764782
6,18339,"Results from long-term, high-temperature resistance experiments confirmed the latter finding, as minimal degradation in conductivity was observed in the various test joints over 500 h of testing at 750 degreesC. Data obtained from three-point bend testing showed that joints formed with a braze composition of 1.4 and 16 mol % CuO displayed maximal average flexural strength.",Joining mixed conducting oxides using an air-fired electrically conductive braze,10.1149/1.1764782
