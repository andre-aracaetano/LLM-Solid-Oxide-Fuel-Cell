1,10686,Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) without the need for the geometry of two electrode compartments has been developed using partial oxidation of methane.,SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL WHICH CAN WORK IN UNIFORM-GAS PHASE USING PARTIAL OXIDATION OF METHANE,10.1246/nikkashi.1994.600
2,10686,"When a gaseous mixture of methane and air (methane : O2 mole ratio = 2:1) was introduced into Pt\yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)\Au or Pt\ SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-alpha\Au cell at 950-degrees-C at a rate of 210 ml min-1, methane was oxidized to H-2 and CO over the Pt electrode, but inactive to O2 over the Au electrode.",SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL WHICH CAN WORK IN UNIFORM-GAS PHASE USING PARTIAL OXIDATION OF METHANE,10.1246/nikkashi.1994.600
3,10686,"This situation led to a large difference in oxygen or hydrogen concentration between two electrodes, resulting in an electromotive force in these cells: 200 mV in Pt\YSZ\Au cell and 700 mV in Pt\SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-alpha\Au cell.",SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL WHICH CAN WORK IN UNIFORM-GAS PHASE USING PARTIAL OXIDATION OF METHANE,10.1246/nikkashi.1994.600
4,10686,The current could be drawn from these cells.,SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL WHICH CAN WORK IN UNIFORM-GAS PHASE USING PARTIAL OXIDATION OF METHANE,10.1246/nikkashi.1994.600
5,10686,"The maximum power output of Pt\SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3-alpha\Au cell was 0.021 W cm-2, which was about 100 times that obtained from Pt\YSZ\Au cell.",SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL WHICH CAN WORK IN UNIFORM-GAS PHASE USING PARTIAL OXIDATION OF METHANE,10.1246/nikkashi.1994.600
6,10686,The difference in SOFC characteristic between these cells was studied by various electrochemical techniques.,SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELL WHICH CAN WORK IN UNIFORM-GAS PHASE USING PARTIAL OXIDATION OF METHANE,10.1246/nikkashi.1994.600
