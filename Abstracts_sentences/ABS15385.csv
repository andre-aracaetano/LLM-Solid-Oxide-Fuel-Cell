3,15385,Numerous modelling studies show that distortion to the electrochemical impedance measurement of electrode reactions on thin electrolyte cells is not avoidable due to the misalignment of working and counter electrodes (WE and CE) and the differences in their electrochemical characteristics.,"Placement of Reference Electrode, Electrolyte Thickness and Three-Electrode Cell Configuration in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Brief Review and Update on Experimental Approach",10.1149/2.1331707jes
4,15385,"This has been verified experimentally that the asymmetric contact at the electrode/electrolyte interface can cause the shift of equipotential line/surface away from the electrolyte region, leading to the significant distortion in the polarization measurements.","Placement of Reference Electrode, Electrolyte Thickness and Three-Electrode Cell Configuration in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Brief Review and Update on Experimental Approach",10.1149/2.1331707jes
5,15385,"However, the distortion effect of misalignment on the equipotential line/surface depends strongly on the electrolyte thickness.","Placement of Reference Electrode, Electrolyte Thickness and Three-Electrode Cell Configuration in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Brief Review and Update on Experimental Approach",10.1149/2.1331707jes
6,15385,"In the case of SOFCs with model La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode and Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet anode, the threshold for YSZ electrolyte thickness with equal partitioning of the cell resistance is similar to 250 mu m. In conclusion, for reliable and accurate polarization and impedance measurements in electrolyte-supported cells, it is suggested that minimum YSZ electrolyte thickness should be 250 mu m for plate cells with electrode areas of similar to 10 cm(2) and 500 mu m for button cells with electrode areas less than 1 cm(2) for symmetric 3-electrode cell configurations with RE positioned on the inactive surface of electrolyte.","Placement of Reference Electrode, Electrolyte Thickness and Three-Electrode Cell Configuration in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Brief Review and Update on Experimental Approach",10.1149/2.1331707jes
