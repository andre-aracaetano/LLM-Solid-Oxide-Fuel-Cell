3,19435,Therefore advanced materials are needed.,"Identification, size classification and evolution of Laves phase precipitates in high chromium, fully ferritic steels",10.1016/j.micron.2017.07.010
4,19435,"The present study focuses on a new concept of high chromium, fully ferritic steels.","Identification, size classification and evolution of Laves phase precipitates in high chromium, fully ferritic steels",10.1016/j.micron.2017.07.010
5,19435,"These steels, originally designed for solid oxide fuel cell applications, provide favourable steam oxidation resistance, creep and thermomechanical fatigue behaviour in comparison to conventional ferritic-martensitic steels.","Identification, size classification and evolution of Laves phase precipitates in high chromium, fully ferritic steels",10.1016/j.micron.2017.07.010
6,19435,The strength of this type of steel is achieved by a combination of solid-solution hardening and precipitation strengthening by intermetallic Laves phase particles.,"Identification, size classification and evolution of Laves phase precipitates in high chromium, fully ferritic steels",10.1016/j.micron.2017.07.010
7,19435,The effect of alloy composition on particle composition was measured by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and partly verified by thermodynamic modelling results.,"Identification, size classification and evolution of Laves phase precipitates in high chromium, fully ferritic steels",10.1016/j.micron.2017.07.010
8,19435,"Generally the Laves phase particles demonstrated high thermodynamic stability during longterm annealing up to 40,000 h at 600 degrees C. Variations in chemical alloy composition influence Laves phase particle formation and consequently lead to significant changes in creep behaviour.","Identification, size classification and evolution of Laves phase precipitates in high chromium, fully ferritic steels",10.1016/j.micron.2017.07.010
9,19435,For this reason particle size distribution evolution was analysed in detail and associated with the creep performance of several trial alloys.,"Identification, size classification and evolution of Laves phase precipitates in high chromium, fully ferritic steels",10.1016/j.micron.2017.07.010
