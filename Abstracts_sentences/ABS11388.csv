7,11388,"Experimentally, the electrochemical impedance spectra results indicate that both K and F doping led to a reduction in the value of polarization resistance, which decreased by over 20% at 800 degrees C. Regarding the output performance, both K and F doping resulted in a substantial increase in the output power from 670.05 to 825.88 and 796.76 mW center dot cm(-2) respectively, at 800 degrees C. However, co-doping with F and K led to a notable reduction in polarization impedance and output power, possibly due to the formation of heterogeneous phases during testing.",Monovalent ion doping to enhance the performance of cobalt-free Sm0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ cathode for YSZ fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.171967
8,11388,"The results indicate that enhancing the electrochemical performance of SSF can be achieved through the doping of K cations and F anions, but co-doping leads to a decreased performance.",Monovalent ion doping to enhance the performance of cobalt-free Sm0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ cathode for YSZ fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.171967
