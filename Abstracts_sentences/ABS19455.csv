1,19455,"Anodic performance and power generating properties of the cell using various oxide composites consisting of Mn, Fe co-doped CeO2 and perovskite oxide were investigated by using La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.15Co0.05O3 electrolyte.","Oxide Composite of Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 and La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3 for Anode of Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte",10.1149/1.3500979
2,19455,"It was found that the theoretical open circuit voltage and reasonably high power density were achieved on the cell using oxide composites consisting of Ce(Mn,Fe)O-2-La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O-3 for anode.","Oxide Composite of Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 and La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3 for Anode of Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte",10.1149/1.3500979
3,19455,"The maximum power density was achieved for values of similar to 1.0, 0.3, and 0.05 W/cm(2) at 1273, 1073, and 873 K, respectively.","Oxide Composite of Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 and La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3 for Anode of Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte",10.1149/1.3500979
4,19455,Oxidation tolerance was also studied and it was found that the power density was slightly improved after exposure to reoxidation treatment.,"Oxide Composite of Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 and La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3 for Anode of Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte",10.1149/1.3500979
5,19455,This study demonstrated that the cell using CeO2 and LaFeO3 based oxide composite for anode is highly tolerant against reoxidation treatment.,"Oxide Composite of Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 and La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3 for Anode of Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte",10.1149/1.3500979
6,19455,"An increase in in the power density by reoxidation treatment was observed and this could be attributed to the improved contact of Ce(Mn,Fe)O-2-La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O-3 composite powder.","Oxide Composite of Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 and La(Sr)Fe(Mn)O3 for Anode of Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte",10.1149/1.3500979
