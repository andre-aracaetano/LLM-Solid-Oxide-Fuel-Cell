1,14969,"Time-dependent events during operation of SOFCs, i.e., performance enhancement and/or deterioration, can be readily observed for the cell composed of strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) cathode and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, concomitant with the change in interfacial structure of LSM/YSZ.","Influence of (La,Sr)MnO3+δ cathode composition on cathode/electrolyte interfacial structure during long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.162
2,14969,The influence of LSM composition on the electrochemical properties and microstructure of LSM/YSZ interface during prolonged operation was investigated.,"Influence of (La,Sr)MnO3+δ cathode composition on cathode/electrolyte interfacial structure during long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.162
3,14969,"Four different LSM cathodes were used and the change in microstructure, especially TPB-length, was evaluated quantitatively by a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM).","Influence of (La,Sr)MnO3+δ cathode composition on cathode/electrolyte interfacial structure during long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.162
4,14969,"For LSM cathodes with A-site deficient compositions, the change in TPB-length had a minor contribution to the performance enhancement after 20 h of galvanostatic operation.","Influence of (La,Sr)MnO3+δ cathode composition on cathode/electrolyte interfacial structure during long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.162
5,14969,"On the other hand, for 100 h duration an increase in cathode overpotential was confirmed, accompanied with the formation of thin layer of LSM over YSZ electrolyte.","Influence of (La,Sr)MnO3+δ cathode composition on cathode/electrolyte interfacial structure during long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.162
6,14969,A series of phenomena were triggered by the change in oxygen nonstoichiometry of LSM under polarized states.,"Influence of (La,Sr)MnO3+δ cathode composition on cathode/electrolyte interfacial structure during long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.162
7,14969,The mechanism for microstructural change was proposed and the long-term stability of LSM/YSZ interface was discussed.,"Influence of (La,Sr)MnO3+δ cathode composition on cathode/electrolyte interfacial structure during long-term operation of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.162
