1,974,"Proper converter design can allow solid oxide fuel cells operated as distributed generators to mutually benefit both the load and the electric utility during steady-state conditions, but dynamic load variations still present challenges.",Load-Following Strategies for Evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Into Model Citizens of the Grid,10.1109/TEC.2009.2025336
2,974,"Unlike standard synchronous generators, fuel cells lack rotating inertia and their output power ramp rate is limited by design.",Load-Following Strategies for Evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Into Model Citizens of the Grid,10.1109/TEC.2009.2025336
3,974,Two strategies are herein investigated to mitigate the impact of a large load perturbation on the electric utility grid: 1) external use of ultracapacitor electrical storage connected through a dc-dc converter and 2) internal reduction of steady-state fuel utilization in the fuel cell to enable faster response to output power perturbations.,Load-Following Strategies for Evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Into Model Citizens of the Grid,10.1109/TEC.2009.2025336
4,974,Both strategies successfully eliminate the impact of a load perturbation on the utility grid.,Load-Following Strategies for Evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Into Model Citizens of the Grid,10.1109/TEC.2009.2025336
5,974,The external ultracapacitor strategy requires more capital investment while the internal fuel utilization strategy requires higher fuel use.,Load-Following Strategies for Evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Into Model Citizens of the Grid,10.1109/TEC.2009.2025336
6,974,This success implies that there is substantial flexibility for designing load-following fuel cell systems that are model citizens.,Load-Following Strategies for Evolution of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Into Model Citizens of the Grid,10.1109/TEC.2009.2025336
