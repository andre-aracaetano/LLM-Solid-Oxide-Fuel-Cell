1,14910,"The effect of Pr doping on the crystal structure and site occupancy was studied for the nominally synthesized BaCe1 - xPrxO3- (delta) (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8) perovskites using anomalous X-ray powder diffraction (AXRD) data and Rietveld analysis.",Anomalous X-ray diffraction study of Pr-substituted BaCeO3 - δ,10.1107/S2052520615010203
2,14910,"Crystal structure parameters were accurately determined using 10 000 eV photons, and the Pr occupancy was refined using data collected with 5962 eV photons, close to the Pr L-III absorption edge.",Anomalous X-ray diffraction study of Pr-substituted BaCeO3 - δ,10.1107/S2052520615010203

4,14910,"Pr cations are mainly located at the Ce sites (perovskites B site), but a small fraction of them increasingly substitute some of the Ba ions at the A site as Pr content increases.",Anomalous X-ray diffraction study of Pr-substituted BaCeO3 - δ,10.1107/S2052520615010203
5,14910,The Pr doping introduces electronic defects (Pr+3/Pr+4) and oxygen vacancies needed for H2O incorporation and H-ionic conductivity.,Anomalous X-ray diffraction study of Pr-substituted BaCeO3 - δ,10.1107/S2052520615010203
6,14910,A decrease in the orthorhombic distortion would produce the opposite effects on the electronic and ionic mobility.,Anomalous X-ray diffraction study of Pr-substituted BaCeO3 - δ,10.1107/S2052520615010203
7,14910,"The electronic mobility should increase due to an improvement in the overlap of the (Ce/Pr)4f-O2p orbital, while the proton mobility should decrease as a consequence of a larger hopping distance.",Anomalous X-ray diffraction study of Pr-substituted BaCeO3 - δ,10.1107/S2052520615010203
