2,11359,The conductivity of Pr1.2Sr0.8NiO4+delta cathodes reaches the max values and then decreases the continuous increase of Mo amount in all the Mo doped cathodes.,Mo doped Ruddlesden-Popper Pr1.2Sr0.8NiO4+δ oxide as a novel cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167557
3,11359,Results of elec-trochemical impedance spectroscopy show that the Pr1.2Sr0.8Ni0.950Mo0.050O4+delta has the lowest polarization resistance of 0.110 Omega cm2 at 750 degrees C among PSNMO cathodes.,Mo doped Ruddlesden-Popper Pr1.2Sr0.8NiO4+δ oxide as a novel cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167557
4,11359,"And results of electrical conductivity relaxation and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that Mo-doping improves the oxygen surface exchange properties of PSNMO cathodes, which can be mainly ascribed to co-interaction of oxygen vacancy and interstitial oxygen in PSNO cathodes after Mo-doping.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Mo doped Ruddlesden-Popper Pr1.2Sr0.8NiO4+δ oxide as a novel cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167557
