2,13847,This article describes a method to manufacture SOFC seals by coating a compressible sealing material (Thermiculite 866) with glass to obtain good sealing performance even at compression stresses as low as 0.1 MPa.,Glass coated compressible solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.085
3,13847,"Glass layer can be coated using an organic carrier consisting of terpineol, ethanol and ethyl cellulose.",Glass coated compressible solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.085
4,13847,"The coated seals can be heat treated by simply ramping the temperature up to operating temperature at 60 Kh(-1) and therefore no extra steps, which are typical to glass seals, are required.",Glass coated compressible solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.085
