1,8206,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with samaria-doped ceria (SDC) electrolytes were prepared with anodes made from either Cu, ceria, and SDC or Au, ceria, and SDC.",A comparison of Cu-ceria-SDC and Au-ceria-SDC composites for SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.1608003
2,8206,These cells were tested in H-2 and n-butane fuels at 650degreesC. The similarity of performance (V-I) curves and impedance results for cells made with Au and Cu suggests that both metals are simply electronic conductors in the anode and that Cu does not play a catalytic role in direct-oxidation anodes made with Cu.,A comparison of Cu-ceria-SDC and Au-ceria-SDC composites for SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.1608003
3,8206,"The addition of ceria is shown to play an important role in improving anode performance, either through improved catalytic activity or mixed ion-electronic conductivity.",A comparison of Cu-ceria-SDC and Au-ceria-SDC composites for SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.1608003
