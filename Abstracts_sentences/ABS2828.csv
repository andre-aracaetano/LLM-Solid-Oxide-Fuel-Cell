1,2828,"This work aimed to set new guidelines for the quantification of Cr accumulation in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes after operation, and enabled to pinpoint a diffusion-controlled tolerance to Cr-poisoning for increased cathode thickness; the additional cathode material decreases the deposition rate from Cr vapor species in the active layer.",Cathode thickness-dependent tolerance to Cr-poisoning in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2010.09.024
2,2828,"These experimentally based findings were obtained by direct comparison of cathode performances measured on a segmented test arrangement enabling the independent control of four cathodes, with different thicknesses, on an anode-support.",Cathode thickness-dependent tolerance to Cr-poisoning in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2010.09.024
3,2828,The cathode thickness-dependent performance degradation was correlated to deliberate poisoning by volatile Cr species stemming from the test arrangement.,Cathode thickness-dependent tolerance to Cr-poisoning in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2010.09.024
