9,13863,"It is also shown that, in the direction of stack height, gaseous advection is a key pathway through which the heat released from a unit-cell is transferred, and conductive heat transfer through metallic interconnects contributes to the overall heat transfer rate at the top and bottom of the stack.",Thermal analysis of a 1-kW hydrogen-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stack by three-dimensional numerical simulation,10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113213
10,13863,"As the gaseous advective cooling in the direction of stack height is reduced, the heat transfer rates towards the gas inlets and outlets within a repeating unit by interconnect conduction and gaseous advection, respectively, are also lowered, which is compensated by conductive heat transfer between repeating units.",Thermal analysis of a 1-kW hydrogen-fueled solid oxide fuel cell stack by three-dimensional numerical simulation,10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113213
