2,20171,"A Kinetic Lattice Monte Carlo (KLMC) model of vacancy diffusion in GPDC has been developed, which uses activation energies obtained from DFT-calculations for vacancy migration in gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) and praseodymium-doped ceria (PDC) as input.",In search of enhanced electrolyte materials: a case study of doubly doped ceria,10.1039/c1jm14417k
3,20171,"In order to identify the optimal composition of electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells, three different classes of GPDC were studied; (i)",In search of enhanced electrolyte materials: a case study of doubly doped ceria,10.1039/c1jm14417k
