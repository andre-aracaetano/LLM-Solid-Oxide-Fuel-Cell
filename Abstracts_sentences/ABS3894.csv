3,3894,Hot gases can be introduced into one channel (single-channel heating) or two channels (dual-channel heating).,"Simulation study to select optimal solid oxide fuel cells heat-up pattern from single, dual co-flow, and dual counter-flow alternatives",10.1080/15567036.2023.2298284
4,3894,Dual-channel heating can have co- and counter-flow patterns.,"Simulation study to select optimal solid oxide fuel cells heat-up pattern from single, dual co-flow, and dual counter-flow alternatives",10.1080/15567036.2023.2298284
5,3894,"Despite the existence of several heating patterns in the literature, a comparative analysis of these patterns has not been conducted.","Simulation study to select optimal solid oxide fuel cells heat-up pattern from single, dual co-flow, and dual counter-flow alternatives",10.1080/15567036.2023.2298284
6,3894,"This study uses a numerical approach to compare various heating patterns, focusing on the objectives of heat-up time, temperature gradient, and energy consumption.","Simulation study to select optimal solid oxide fuel cells heat-up pattern from single, dual co-flow, and dual counter-flow alternatives",10.1080/15567036.2023.2298284
7,3894,The findings indicate that the co-flow pattern demonstrates superior performance in terms of temperature gradient and heat-up time.,"Simulation study to select optimal solid oxide fuel cells heat-up pattern from single, dual co-flow, and dual counter-flow alternatives",10.1080/15567036.2023.2298284
8,3894,"However, the counter-flow pattern is more favorable in terms of energy consumption.","Simulation study to select optimal solid oxide fuel cells heat-up pattern from single, dual co-flow, and dual counter-flow alternatives",10.1080/15567036.2023.2298284
9,3894,"Upon considering all the objectives concurrently through a multi-objective planning approach, the co-flow pattern, characterized by a temperature increase rate of 1 K s-1 and a gas velocity of 10 m s-1, emerges as the most optimal heat-up plan.","Simulation study to select optimal solid oxide fuel cells heat-up pattern from single, dual co-flow, and dual counter-flow alternatives",10.1080/15567036.2023.2298284
10,3894,"This particular plan results in a heat-up time of 685 s, a temperature gradient of 337 K cm-1, and an energy consumption of 3856 J.","Simulation study to select optimal solid oxide fuel cells heat-up pattern from single, dual co-flow, and dual counter-flow alternatives",10.1080/15567036.2023.2298284
