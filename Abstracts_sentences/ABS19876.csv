3,19876,The results show that LSM-YSZ is net-porous composite powder while YSZ and LSM do not react with each other during synthesis process.,Preparation of LSM-YSZ composite powder for anode of solid oxide electrolysis cell and its activation mechanism,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.132
4,19876,The electrochemical test of the single button cells indicates that the in-situ LSM-YSZ powder shows better electrolysis performance and lower discharging capability than traditionally direct mixture LSM and YSZ oxygen electrode.,Preparation of LSM-YSZ composite powder for anode of solid oxide electrolysis cell and its activation mechanism,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.132
5,19876,"When operating in SOEC mode with constant current electrolysis at a Current density of 0.33 Acm(-2) and 900 C, the electrolytic voltage decreases from 1.21 V to 1.02 V, which indicates that LSM-YSZ electrode has an activation process at the initial testing stage.",Preparation of LSM-YSZ composite powder for anode of solid oxide electrolysis cell and its activation mechanism,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.132
6,19876,A mechanism which involves the incorporation of SrO segregated on the surface into the LSM lattice and the generation of oxygen vacancies in the LSM electrode is proposed for the activation process with O2- oxidation on LSM electrodes.,Preparation of LSM-YSZ composite powder for anode of solid oxide electrolysis cell and its activation mechanism,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.132
