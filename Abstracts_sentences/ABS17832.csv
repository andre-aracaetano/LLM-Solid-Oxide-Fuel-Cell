6,17832,"Going from high to low frequency, these processes are (i), (ii) two geometry-related contributions interpreted as transport across LSM/YSZ interfaces and through the YSZ of the composite, (iii) a process reflecting competitive reaction steps such as bond breaking and surface diffusion, (iv) gas diffusion in a stagnant gas layer above the electrode structure, and (v) an activation process (inductive) presumably located at the triple phase boundary of electrode, electrolyte, and gas phase.",Impedance of solid oxide fuel cell LSM/YSZ composite cathodes,10.1149/1.1360203
