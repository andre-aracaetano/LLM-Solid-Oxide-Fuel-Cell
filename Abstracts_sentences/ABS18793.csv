4,18793,"For cathodes prepared following this procedure the optimum sintering temperature is 1000 degrees C. Analysis of the impedance spectra shows clearly a Gerischer dispersion (chemical impedance), with an activation energy of 124 kJ mol(-1) for the exchange rate parameter K-G. The addition of a dense LNO layer between electrolyte and porous electrode lowers the ASR by similar to 35%, showing a significant change in the oxygen transfer mechanism.",Influence of configuration and microstructure on performance of La2NiO4+δ intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.192
