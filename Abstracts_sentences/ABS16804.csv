1,16804,"In this work, a novel iron chemical conversion coating process has been applied to deposit a composite Cu-LaFeO3 perovskite coating layer on a commercial 18Cr ferritic stainless steel for application as Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC) interconnect.",Composite Cu-LaFeO3 Conversion Coatings on a 18Cr Ferritic Stainless Steel for IT-SOFC Interconnects: An Investigation on Structure and Formation Mechanism,10.1149/2.1601707jes
2,16804,"The conversion process is carried out at 600 degrees C under a CO2 gas atmosphere in a binary eutectic lithium-sodium molten carbonate bath containing lanthanum, magnesium and copper additions in form of their respective oxides.",Composite Cu-LaFeO3 Conversion Coatings on a 18Cr Ferritic Stainless Steel for IT-SOFC Interconnects: An Investigation on Structure and Formation Mechanism,10.1149/2.1601707jes
3,16804,"Multi-layer coatings are obtained, with a surface composite layer formed by a dense perovskite polycrystalline thick film with metallic copper particles encased in the perovskite grains grown on a Fe-rich spinel sublayer.",Composite Cu-LaFeO3 Conversion Coatings on a 18Cr Ferritic Stainless Steel for IT-SOFC Interconnects: An Investigation on Structure and Formation Mechanism,10.1149/2.1601707jes
4,16804,"Copper oxide additions significantly promote the formation of the LaFeO3 perovskite layer, and the experimental results suggest that galvanic coupling phenomena between the alloy elements and copper take place during the coating formation process.",Composite Cu-LaFeO3 Conversion Coatings on a 18Cr Ferritic Stainless Steel for IT-SOFC Interconnects: An Investigation on Structure and Formation Mechanism,10.1149/2.1601707jes
5,16804,"Chemical stability and Cr diffusion barrier properties of the composite coating have been evaluated in air exposure experiments at 700 degrees C for 200 h. The perovskite phase shows high stability after the high temperature exposure, with no detectable sign of Cr diffusion in the layer.",Composite Cu-LaFeO3 Conversion Coatings on a 18Cr Ferritic Stainless Steel for IT-SOFC Interconnects: An Investigation on Structure and Formation Mechanism,10.1149/2.1601707jes
