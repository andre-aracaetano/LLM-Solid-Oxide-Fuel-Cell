1,2091,Chemical deposition is widely used to enhance the performance of perovskite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,"A-site deficient perovskite: the parent for in situ exsolution of highly active, regenerable nano-particles as SOFC anodes",10.1039/c5ta01733e
2,2091,"However, the anodes thus produced still have unsatisfactory activity and experience reproducibility problems.","A-site deficient perovskite: the parent for in situ exsolution of highly active, regenerable nano-particles as SOFC anodes",10.1039/c5ta01733e
3,2091,"For the first time, this paper reports that the in situ exsolution of nano-Ni could be facilitated on Ni-doped (La0.7Sr0.3)CrO3 (LSCNi) anodes with A-site deficiency, showing a maximum power density of 460 mW cm(-2) in 5000 ppm H2S-H-2 compared to only 135 mW cm(-2) of fuel cells with stoichiometric LSCNi.","A-site deficient perovskite: the parent for in situ exsolution of highly active, regenerable nano-particles as SOFC anodes",10.1039/c5ta01733e
4,2091,"Besides, the fuel cell also demonstrates desirable redox stability in sour fuel.","A-site deficient perovskite: the parent for in situ exsolution of highly active, regenerable nano-particles as SOFC anodes",10.1039/c5ta01733e
5,2091,"The introduction of A-site deficiency can help the formation of highly mobile oxygen vacancies and remarkably enhance the reducibility of Ni nano-particles, thus significantly increasing electronic conductivity and catalytic activity simultaneously.","A-site deficient perovskite: the parent for in situ exsolution of highly active, regenerable nano-particles as SOFC anodes",10.1039/c5ta01733e
6,2091,Such fabricated perovskite has the potential to be decorated with diverse nano-active particles for a wide range of applications in industrial fields.,"A-site deficient perovskite: the parent for in situ exsolution of highly active, regenerable nano-particles as SOFC anodes",10.1039/c5ta01733e
