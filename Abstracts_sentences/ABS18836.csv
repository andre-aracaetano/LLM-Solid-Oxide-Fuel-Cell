4,18836,A cell with a 40 wt% GDC decorated PBCC electrode achieves a peak power density of 1.74 W cm(-2) at 750 ? and an electrolysis current density of 1.77 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V with excellent durability for 200 h. The combined decoration and direct assembly approach provides a unique and general pathway to develop a new class of nanostructured air electrodes for efficient and durable solid oxide cells.,Development of intertwined nanostructured multi-phase air electrodes for efficient and durable reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.121056
