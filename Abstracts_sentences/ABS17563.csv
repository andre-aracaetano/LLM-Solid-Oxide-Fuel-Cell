3,17563,This ambiguity was removed by the collection of orientation-dependent Raman spectra that could only be consistent with P6(3)/m.,Structural Study of the Apatite Nd8Sr2Si6O26 by Laue Neutron Diffraction and Single-Crystal Raman Spectroscopy,10.1021/ic501558r
4,17563,"The composition of Nd8Sr2Si6O26 was independently verified by powder X-ray diffraction in combination with electron probe microanalysis, with the latter confirming a homogeneous distribution of Sr and the absence of chemcial zonation commonly observed in apatites.",Structural Study of the Apatite Nd8Sr2Si6O26 by Laue Neutron Diffraction and Single-Crystal Raman Spectroscopy,10.1021/ic501558r
