3,20565,"The DFT energetics demonstrate that Ga-V-O-Ga (V-O = oxygen vacancy) environments are favored (vs Ga-V-O-Mg, Mg-V-O-Mg and Mg-O-Mg-V-O-Ga) across a range y = 0.0625, 0.125, and 0.25 of fractional Mg contents in LaGa1-yMgyO3-y/2.","Defects in Doped LaGaO3 Anionic Conductors: Linking NMR Spectral Features, Local Environments, and Defect Thermodynamics",10.1021/ja2053557
4,20565,"The results are interpreted in terms of doping and mean phase formation energies (relative to binary oxides) and are compared with previous calculations and experimental calorimetry, data Experimental multinuclear NMR data reveal that while Mg sites remain six fold coordinated across the range of phase stoichiometries, albeit with significant structural disorder, a stoichiometry dependent minority of the Ga sites resonate at a shift consistent with Ga-V coordination, demonstrating that O vacancies preferentially locate in the first anion coordination shell of Ga.","Defects in Doped LaGaO3 Anionic Conductors: Linking NMR Spectral Features, Local Environments, and Defect Thermodynamics",10.1021/ja2053557
