1,19564,Thin metallic Mn50Co50 coatings (0.3 and 1 mu m) were deposited by magnetron cosputtering on bare and on 100 h preoxidized ZMG232L stainless steel substrates for application as protective coatings for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) interconnects.,Thermally Oxidized Mn-Co Thin Films as Protective Coatings for SOFC Interconnects,10.1149/1.3240597
2,19564,The coatings on bare steel were oxidized for different times of up to 101 h at 800 degrees C in ambient air.,Thermally Oxidized Mn-Co Thin Films as Protective Coatings for SOFC Interconnects,10.1149/1.3240597
3,19564,"After 1 h heat-treatment, the metallic films had already converted to (Mn, Co)(3)O-4 oxide with a spinel structure.",Thermally Oxidized Mn-Co Thin Films as Protective Coatings for SOFC Interconnects,10.1149/1.3240597
4,19564,"With increasing oxidation time, a Mn2O3 phase was also detected, independent of the thickness of the coatings.",Thermally Oxidized Mn-Co Thin Films as Protective Coatings for SOFC Interconnects,10.1149/1.3240597
5,19564,This phase formation was attributed to Mn ion enrichment in the coating.,Thermally Oxidized Mn-Co Thin Films as Protective Coatings for SOFC Interconnects,10.1149/1.3240597
6,19564,Cr diffusion and stresses in the thin coatings were also observed.,Thermally Oxidized Mn-Co Thin Films as Protective Coatings for SOFC Interconnects,10.1149/1.3240597
7,19564,"Bare steel samples were also preoxidized for different durations to determine a suitable oxidation time to form a stable (Mn, Cr)(3)O-4/Cr2O3 oxide scale on their surface.",Thermally Oxidized Mn-Co Thin Films as Protective Coatings for SOFC Interconnects,10.1149/1.3240597
8,19564,Steel samples preoxidized for 100 h and coated with Mn50Co50 were subjected to time-dependent area specific resistance (ASR) measurements for 500 h. The ASR values obtained were 15 and 17 m Omega cm(2) for the substrate coated with 0.3 and 1 mu m,Thermally Oxidized Mn-Co Thin Films as Protective Coatings for SOFC Interconnects,10.1149/1.3240597
9,19564,"Mn50Co50, respectively.",Thermally Oxidized Mn-Co Thin Films as Protective Coatings for SOFC Interconnects,10.1149/1.3240597
10,19564,"Also, no Mn2O3 phase was present, and no Cr diffusion was detected in the thicker coating.",Thermally Oxidized Mn-Co Thin Films as Protective Coatings for SOFC Interconnects,10.1149/1.3240597
