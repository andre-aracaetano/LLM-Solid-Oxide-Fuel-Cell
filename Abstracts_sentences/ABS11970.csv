1,11970,Interconnected networks of 10-30 nm yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) nanoparticles dramatically enhance both the electrocatalytic activity and bulk charge transport of commercial lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM)-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes.,"Enhancing Activity, Charge Transport, Power Production, and Stability of Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Nanoparticles",10.1149/1945-7111/ab6eed
2,11970,The improvement in both electrode functions increases the maximum power density of the commercial SOFC by 90%.,"Enhancing Activity, Charge Transport, Power Production, and Stability of Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Nanoparticles",10.1149/1945-7111/ab6eed
3,11970,"In comparison, modifying cathodes with lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) and praseodymium barium cobaltite (PBC) nanoparticles, highly active catalysts with mixed ionic-electronic conductivity (MIEC), only enhances electrocatalytic activity.","Enhancing Activity, Charge Transport, Power Production, and Stability of Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Nanoparticles",10.1149/1945-7111/ab6eed
4,11970,"The combination of dual enhanced electrode functions with nanoYSZ results in a maximum power density that is 50% and 11% higher than LSCF and PBC, respectively.","Enhancing Activity, Charge Transport, Power Production, and Stability of Commercial Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Nanoparticles",10.1149/1945-7111/ab6eed
