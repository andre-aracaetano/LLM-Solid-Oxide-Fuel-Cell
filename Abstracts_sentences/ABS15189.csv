1,15189,The transfer of chromium from metallic components into the cathode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) can severely degrade its performance and is known as 'chromium poisoning'.,Effect of Chromium on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.099306jes
2,15189,"In this study we investigate the relationship between the amount of chromium introduced into La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta, LSCF (6428), cathodes and their electrochemical performance, and clarify further the poisoning mechanism.",Effect of Chromium on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.099306jes
3,15189,LSCF cathodes were screen printed onto Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolyte pellets and infiltrated with Cr(NO3)(3) solutions to different Cr levels up to 2 wt%.,Effect of Chromium on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.099306jes
4,15189,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at 500-800 degrees C showed that even very low levels of Cr give a significant increase in cathode polarization resistance, which increases with Cr concentration.",Effect of Chromium on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.099306jes
5,15189,"The impedance response was analyzed using the model of Adler, Lane and Steele to extract oxygen self-diffusion (D-O) and surface exchange (k(O)) parameters for the LSCF.",Effect of Chromium on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.099306jes
6,15189,"The results show that Cr reduces both D-O and k(O), the latter being the more affected.",Effect of Chromium on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.099306jes
7,15189,"However, the activation energies for polarization resistance, D-O and k(O) are not significantly affected by Cr content.",Effect of Chromium on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.099306jes
8,15189,This indicates that the Cr poisoning mechanism involves the de-activation of sites for oxygen exchange on the LSCF surface and that the cathode's residual activity is by means of remaining active sites.,Effect of Chromium on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/2.099306jes
