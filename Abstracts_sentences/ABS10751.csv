1,10751,"In this study sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming (SE-SMR) in fixed beds is investigated by means of 1D numerical modelling, and the model is validated with the data reported in the literature.",Modelling of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.10.101
2,10751,"Isothermal conditions (973 K) are considered, and the equilibrium between the carbonation and calcination stages is shifted by a pressure swing: 3.5.10(6)Pa and 1013 Pa, respectively.",Modelling of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.10.101
3,10751,"The results showed that under these operating conditions at least 8 reactors in parallel are required to continuously produce a high-purity stream of H-2, and a separated stream of concentrated CO2.",Modelling of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.10.101
4,10751,"The average H-2 purity is 0.92, whilst the average H-2 yield and selectivity are 2.9 mol(H2) mol(CH4)(-1) and 90%, respectively.",Modelling of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.10.101
5,10751,"A thermodynamic analysis was performed, which highlighted that, by using a portion of the produced H-2 (about 0.4 mol(H2) mol(CH4)(-1)), it is possible to fully cover heat and power demands of the process, making it completely energy self-sufficient.",Modelling of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.10.101
6,10751,"In the case when the proposed SE-SMR is integrated with a solid oxide fuel cell, net power generation at the scale of similar to 950 kW(el) can be achieved with a net efficiency of the entire system of 51%, with the important feature that CO2 is concentrated.",Modelling of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.10.101
