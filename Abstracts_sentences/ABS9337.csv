1,9337,Activation losses at solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrodes have been widely attributed to charge transfer at the electrode surface.,Electric Fields and Charge Separation for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c02468
2,9337,"The electrostatic nature of electrode-gas interactions allows us to study these phenomena by simulating an electric field across the electrode-gas interface, where we are able to describe the activation overpotential using density functional theory (DFT).",Electric Fields and Charge Separation for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c02468
3,9337,The electrostatic responses to the electric field are used to approximate the behavior of an electrode under electrical bias and have found a correlation with experimental data for three different reduction reactions at mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) electrode surfaces (H2O and CO2 on CeO2; O-2 on LaFeO3).,Electric Fields and Charge Separation for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c02468
