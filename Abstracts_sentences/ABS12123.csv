1,12123,The electrode performance of solid oxide fuel cell anode with Pd nanoparticles at the interface of ScYSZ electrolyte and Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3 (STN) electrode introduced in the form of metal functional layer have been investigated at temperatures below 600 degrees C. A metal functional layer consisting of Pd was deposited by magnetron sputtering.,Improved ceramic anodes for SOFCs with modified electrode/electrolyte interface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.110
