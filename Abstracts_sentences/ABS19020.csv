1,19020,Crystal structure and thermal expansion of the third-order Ruddlesden-Popper phase Pr-4(Ni0.9Co0.1)(3)O10-delta (PNCO) were determined by high temperature X-ray powder diffraction (HT-XRD) and Rietveld analysis in the temperature range 25-600 degrees C in air.,Crystal structure and oxygen nonstoichiometry of the third-order Ruddlesden-Popper phase Pr4(Ni0.9Co0.1)3O10-δ,10.1016/j.oceram.2021.100094
2,19020,The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of PNCO is smaller compared with first-order Ruddlesden-Popper phases and in excellent agreement with values of common electrolytes of solid oxide cells.,Crystal structure and oxygen nonstoichiometry of the third-order Ruddlesden-Popper phase Pr4(Ni0.9Co0.1)3O10-δ,10.1016/j.oceram.2021.100094
3,19020,"HT-XRD, thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry showed a reversible phase transition at 600-650 degrees C. A single monoclinic (P2(1)/a) phase occurs at 25-600 degrees C, while a mixture of monoclinic and tetragonal (I4/mmm) phases is found at 650-900 degrees C.",Crystal structure and oxygen nonstoichiometry of the third-order Ruddlesden-Popper phase Pr4(Ni0.9Co0.1)3O10-δ,10.1016/j.oceram.2021.100094
