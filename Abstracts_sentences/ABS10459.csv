1,10459,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) directly fed with iso-octane are expected to be power sources for mobile devices and automobiles.,A high-performance Ni-CeO2/Ni/Ni-Y2O3•ZrO2 three-layer anode for direct iso-octane feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1098/rsos.220227
2,10459,"However, the conventional anode catalysts nickel (Ni) or cerium oxide (CeO2) used for direct feeding of iso-octane do not suppress carbon deposition or generate high power.",A high-performance Ni-CeO2/Ni/Ni-Y2O3•ZrO2 three-layer anode for direct iso-octane feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1098/rsos.220227
3,10459,"In this study, we investigated the Ni-CeO2/Ni/Ni-yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) three-layer anode to establish the suppression of carbon deposition and high-power generation in the SOFC.",A high-performance Ni-CeO2/Ni/Ni-Y2O3•ZrO2 three-layer anode for direct iso-octane feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1098/rsos.220227
4,10459,"The anode consists of a Ni-CeO2 catalyst layer as the top layer, an Ni catalyst layer as the second layer, and a Ni-YSZ catalyst layer as the third layer on top of the electrolyte.",A high-performance Ni-CeO2/Ni/Ni-Y2O3•ZrO2 three-layer anode for direct iso-octane feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1098/rsos.220227
5,10459,"The concept of the three-layer anode is as follows: fuel reforming occurs in the Ni-CeO2 layer, the reformed H-2 or CO is electrochemically oxidized in the Ni-YSZ catalyst layer, and the Ni catalyst middle layer prevents the reaction between YSZ and CeO2.",A high-performance Ni-CeO2/Ni/Ni-Y2O3•ZrO2 three-layer anode for direct iso-octane feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1098/rsos.220227
