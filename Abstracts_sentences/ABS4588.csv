1,4588,"We demonstrate that the highly active but unstable nanostructured intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathode, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSCo), can retain its high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with exceptional stability for 4000 h at 700 degrees C by overcoating its surfaces with a conformal layer of nanoscale ZrO2 films through atomic layer deposition (ALD).",Stabilizing Nanostructured Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode with Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1021/nl402138w
2,4588,"The benefits from the presence of the nanoscale ALD-ZrO2 overcoats are remarkable: a factor of 19 and 18 reduction in polarization area-specific resistance and degradation rate over the pristine sample, respectively.",Stabilizing Nanostructured Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode with Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1021/nl402138w
3,4588,"The unique multifunctionality of the ALD-derived nanoscaled ZrO2 overcoats, that is, possessing porosity for O-2 access to LSCo, conducting both electrons and oxide-ions, confining thermal growth of LSCo nanoparticles, and suppressing surface Sr-segregation is deemed the key enabler for the observed stable and active nanostructured cathode.",Stabilizing Nanostructured Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode with Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1021/nl402138w
