1,10999,"The pursuit of highly reactive cathodes promotes the improvement of the electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), while the side reaction between the cathode and the zirconia electrolyte produces a high-resistance phase impeding interfacial ionic transport.",Self-assembled cathode induced by polarization for high-performance solid oxide fuel cell,10.1039/d2ta08525a
2,10999,"To address this issue, we designed an unsintered composite LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3-delta-Er0.4Bi1.6O3 (LCN-ESB) cathode via self-assembly onto a Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) electrolyte under in situ current polarization to fabricate a porous cathode layer and a cathode/electrolyte interface with good contact.",Self-assembled cathode induced by polarization for high-performance solid oxide fuel cell,10.1039/d2ta08525a
3,10999,"An area-specific resistance (ASR) of 0.205 omega cm(2) and a peak power density (PPD) of 0.788 W cm(-2) can be achieved by a single cell with LCN-ESB cathode at 650 degrees C using hydrogen as fuel, and the cell runs stably for over 100 h without severe degradation.",Self-assembled cathode induced by polarization for high-performance solid oxide fuel cell,10.1039/d2ta08525a
4,10999,The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the self-assembled LCN-ESB cathode is competitive among intermediate-temperature (IT) SOFC cathodes.,Self-assembled cathode induced by polarization for high-performance solid oxide fuel cell,10.1039/d2ta08525a
