3,17088,"Using LSFN as the oxygen electrode for a reversible solid oxide cell, the button cell exhibited a peak power density of 0.79Wcm(-2) in H-2 and an electrolysis current density of 0.89 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V in 50% CO2/50% H-2 at 800 degrees C. A large fraction of Fe2+ was found in LSFN, resulting in the improved performance.","Molten salt synthesis of Nb-doped (La, Sr) FeO3 as the oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells",10.1016/j.matlet.2019.02.116
