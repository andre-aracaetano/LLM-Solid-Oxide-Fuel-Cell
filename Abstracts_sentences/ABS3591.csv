1,3591,"Porous x wt.% Cu-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (x Cu-SDC, x = 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30) cermet anodes were prepared and investigated by mechanical mixing method for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).",Preparation and characterization of Cu-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.04.143
2,3591,Results showed that the porosity of anodes remarkably increased with the Cu content.,Preparation and characterization of Cu-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.04.143
3,3591,"The optimal electrochemical performance of cermet anodes was obtained when the amount of Cu increased up to 20 wt.% sintered at 1000 degrees C for 2 h. The lowest area-specific resistance and anodic overpotential of 20Cu-SDC were 0.043 Omega cm(2) and 8.8 mV at a current density of 0.2 A cm(2) at 600 degrees C in wet H-2, respectively.",Preparation and characterization of Cu-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.04.143
4,3591,The thermal expansion was linear for all samples and the thermal expansion coefficients slightly decreased with the Cu content.,Preparation and characterization of Cu-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.04.143
5,3591,The flexural strength also decreased with the Cu content and was about 53 MPa for 20Cu-SDC anode.,Preparation and characterization of Cu-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.04.143
