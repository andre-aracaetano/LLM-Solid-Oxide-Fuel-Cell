2,8750,"For this purpose, cells with 1 cm(2), 9 cm(2), 16 cm(2), 81 cm(2) and 150 cm(2) active areas are manufactured and tested under different external compression pressures.",Investigation of external compression in scaling up of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.064
3,8750,"Maximum power densities of 0.486 W/cm(2), 0.308 W/cm(2) and 0.231 W/cm(2) are obtained from the cells with an active area of 1 cm(2), 9 cm(2) and 16 cm(2), respectively, under the same contact pressure.",Investigation of external compression in scaling up of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.064
4,8750,"When the impedance results are considered, it is seen that under the same compression pressure, the cell resistance increases nonlinearly with the cell size.",Investigation of external compression in scaling up of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.064
5,8750,"However, when the pressure is adjusted according to the active area, a similar power density of approximately 0.4 W/cm(2) is obtained from these three cells.",Investigation of external compression in scaling up of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.064
6,8750,"Moreover, very similar performances are measured from all cells when a portion of cells with 1 cm(2) active is cut and tested under the same contact pressure of 0.2 MPa.",Investigation of external compression in scaling up of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.064
7,8750,"The overall results indicate that the external load should be adjusted according to the cell size, but there is no linear relationship between the active area and the applied external pressure.",Investigation of external compression in scaling up of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.064
