1,16054,The present work focuses on the study of different Ruddlesden-Popper based cathode materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells at Intermediate Temperature (IT-SOFC).,Tailoring La2-xAxNi1-yByO4+δ cathode performance by simultaneous A and B doping for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.150
2,16054,"The partial substitution of La and Ni by Pr and Co, respectively, were studied in the La(2-x)A(x)Ni(1-y)ByO(4+delta) system, with the purpose of enhancing their mixed ionic-electronic conductivity and the electrocatalytic activity for the O-2-reduction while the crystal structure was preserved.",Tailoring La2-xAxNi1-yByO4+δ cathode performance by simultaneous A and B doping for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.150
3,16054,"All synthesized compounds were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), DC conductivity measurements, X-Ray diffraction (XRD), iodometric titration and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",Tailoring La2-xAxNi1-yByO4+δ cathode performance by simultaneous A and B doping for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.150
4,16054,"XRD analyses by Rietveld refinement revealed the influence of the ionic radius on the crystalline phase for the different dopants, i.e., variation of the cell parameters and M-O bond lengths.",Tailoring La2-xAxNi1-yByO4+δ cathode performance by simultaneous A and B doping for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.150
5,16054,"The substitution in both La and Ni sites improves La2NiO4+delta electrochemical properties as IT-SOFC cathode, since higher conductivity and lower polarization resistance were obtained.",Tailoring La2-xAxNi1-yByO4+δ cathode performance by simultaneous A and B doping for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.150
6,16054,"Finally, La1.5Pr0.5Ni0.8Co0.2O4+delta cathode exhibited the lowest electrode polarization resistance and activation energy values in the temperature range of 450-900 degrees C. La1.5Pr0.5Ni0.8Co0.2O4+delta was applied on an anode supported cell and a maximum power density of similar to 400 mW cm(-2) was obtained at 700 degrees C using pure hydrogen and air.",Tailoring La2-xAxNi1-yByO4+δ cathode performance by simultaneous A and B doping for IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.150
