1,4510,This study explored CO as a primary fuel in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) of both tubular and planar geometries.,Carbon monoxide-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.020
2,4510,Tubular single cells with active areas of 24 cm(2) generated power up to 16W. Open circuit voltages for various CO/CO2 mixture compositions agreed well with the expected values.,Carbon monoxide-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.020
3,4510,"In flowing dry CO, power densities up to 0.67 W cm(-2) were achieved at 1 A cm(-2) and 850 degrees C.",Carbon monoxide-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.020
4,4510,This performance compared well with 0.74 W cm(-2) measured for pure H-2 in the same cell and under the same operating conditions.,Carbon monoxide-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.020
5,4510,Performance stability of tubular cells was investigated by long-term testing in flowing CO during which no carbon deposition was observed.,Carbon monoxide-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.020
6,4510,"At a constant current of 9.96 A (or, 0.414 A cm(-2)) power output remained unchanged over 375 h of continuous operation at 850 degrees C.",Carbon monoxide-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.020
7,4510,"In addition, a 50-cell planar SOFC stack was operated at 800 degrees C on 95% CO (balance CO2), which generated 1176W of total power at a power density of 224 mW cm(-2).",Carbon monoxide-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.020
8,4510,The results demonstrate that CO is a viable primary fuel for SOFCs.,Carbon monoxide-fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.020
