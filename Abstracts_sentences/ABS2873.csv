1,2873,Too high stack temperature and insufficient reactant gas flow may lead to severe and irreversible damages in a real solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) power system.,Fault Diagnosis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on a Supervised Self-Organization Map Model,10.1115/1.4029070
2,2873,"Thus, fault monitoring and diagnosis technology is indispensable to improve the SOFC system reliability.",Fault Diagnosis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on a Supervised Self-Organization Map Model,10.1115/1.4029070
3,2873,A supervised self-organization map (SOM) model is proposed to diagnose the faults of the SOFC system in this paper.,Fault Diagnosis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on a Supervised Self-Organization Map Model,10.1115/1.4029070
4,2873,"Using the supervised SOM model, the multidimensional testing data of the SOFC is mapped into a two-dimensional map, and the different region in the out map is represented for one fault mode.",Fault Diagnosis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on a Supervised Self-Organization Map Model,10.1115/1.4029070
5,2873,"The method is evaluated using the data obtained from an SOFC mathematical model, and the results show that the supervised SOM analysis contributes on a very efficient way to the faults diagnosis of the SOFC system.",Fault Diagnosis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on a Supervised Self-Organization Map Model,10.1115/1.4029070
