1,10148,"In this work, we present the combination of two characteristics that are beneficial for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodic performance in one material.","Nanostructured LnBaCo2O6-δ (Ln = Sm, Gd) with layered structure for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1063/1.4981901
2,10148,"We developed and evaluated for the first time nanostructured layered perovskites of formulae LnBaCo(2)O(6-d) with Ln = Sm and Gd (SBCO and GBCO, respectively) as SOFC cathodes, finding promising electrochemical properties in the intermediate temperature range.","Nanostructured LnBaCo2O6-δ (Ln = Sm, Gd) with layered structure for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1063/1.4981901
3,10148,We obtained those nanostructures by using porous templates to confine the chemical reagents in regions of 200-800 nm.,"Nanostructured LnBaCo2O6-δ (Ln = Sm, Gd) with layered structure for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1063/1.4981901
4,10148,The performance of nanostructured SBCO and GBCO cathodes was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique under different operating conditions using Gd2O3-doped CeO2 as electrolyte.,"Nanostructured LnBaCo2O6-δ (Ln = Sm, Gd) with layered structure for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1063/1.4981901
5,10148,"We found that SBCO cathodes displayed lower area-specific resistance than GBCO ones, because bulk diffusion of oxide ions is enhanced in the former.","Nanostructured LnBaCo2O6-δ (Ln = Sm, Gd) with layered structure for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1063/1.4981901
6,10148,We also found that cathodes synthesized using smaller template pores exhibited better performance.,"Nanostructured LnBaCo2O6-δ (Ln = Sm, Gd) with layered structure for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1063/1.4981901
