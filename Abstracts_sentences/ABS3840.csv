1,3840,"In this paper, an application of a nonlinear predictive controller based on a self recurrent wavelet network (SRWN) model for a direct internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell (DIR-SOFC) is presented.",Predictive control of a direct internal reforming SOFC using a self recurrent wavelet network model,10.1631/jzus.A0800887
2,3840,"As operating temperature and fuel utilization are two important parameters, the SOFC is identified using an SRWN with inlet fuel flow rate, inlet air flow rate and current as inputs, and temperature and fuel utilization as outputs.",Predictive control of a direct internal reforming SOFC using a self recurrent wavelet network model,10.1631/jzus.A0800887
3,3840,"To improve the operating performance of the DIR-SOFC and guarantee proper operating conditions, the nonlinear predictive control is implemented using the off-line trained and on-line modified SRWN model, to manipulate the inlet flow rates to keep the temperature and the fuel utilization at desired levels.",Predictive control of a direct internal reforming SOFC using a self recurrent wavelet network model,10.1631/jzus.A0800887
4,3840,"Simulation results show satisfactory predictive accuracy of the SRWN model, and demonstrate the excellence of the SRWN-based predictive controller for the DIR-SOFC.",Predictive control of a direct internal reforming SOFC using a self recurrent wavelet network model,10.1631/jzus.A0800887
