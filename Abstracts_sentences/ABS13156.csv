1,13156,Thick (similar to 5 mu m) conducting perovskite LaNiO(3) films were deposited on ferritic stainless steel (SS) by aerosol deposition (AD) for use as an oxidation resistance coating layer in the metallic interconnector of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Ni-Containing Conducting Ceramic as an Oxidation Protective Coating on Metallic Interconnects by Aerosol Deposition,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03646.x
2,13156,The microstructural evolution and electrical resistivity of the LaNiO(3)-coated SS at the SOFC operating temperature (800 degrees C) were examined.,Ni-Containing Conducting Ceramic as an Oxidation Protective Coating on Metallic Interconnects by Aerosol Deposition,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03646.x
3,13156,"The coated oxide layers were fairly dense without pores or cracks, and good adhesion was maintained, even after oxidation at 800 degrees C for 1000 h. The interface oxides formed between LaNiO(3) and SS consisted of Ni and Mn-containing spinel and a Cr-rich oxide layer.",Ni-Containing Conducting Ceramic as an Oxidation Protective Coating on Metallic Interconnects by Aerosol Deposition,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03646.x
4,13156,"The initial area specific resistance (ASR) of the LaNiO(3)-coated SS was 2.68 m center dot cm2, which was increased to 7.34 m center dot cm2 after post heat treatment at 800 degrees C for 1000 h. The ASR of the LaNiO(3)-coated SS was similar to 30% lower than that of the (La(0.8)Sr(0.2))MnO(3)-coated SS post heat treated for the same time.",Ni-Containing Conducting Ceramic as an Oxidation Protective Coating on Metallic Interconnects by Aerosol Deposition,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03646.x
5,13156,"Ni2+ substitution for Mn3+ in the octahedral sites of the spinel structures appears to decrease the resistivity of the interface oxide layer, and increase the long-term stability of the ASR at high temperatures.",Ni-Containing Conducting Ceramic as an Oxidation Protective Coating on Metallic Interconnects by Aerosol Deposition,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03646.x
