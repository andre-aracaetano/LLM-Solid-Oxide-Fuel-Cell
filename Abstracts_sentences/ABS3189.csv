1,3189,A BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY)-NiO anode functional layer was added between the BZCY electrolyte and the BZCY-NiO anode substrate to investigate its effect on the performance of single cells.,Effect of anode functional layer on the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.elecom.2011.12.023
2,3189,"With BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY) as the electrolyte and composite BZCY-Ba0.5Sr0.5(Co0.8Fe0.2)(0.9)Ti0.1O3-delta as the cathode material, anode-supported electrolyte fuel cells were fabricated and tested.",Effect of anode functional layer on the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.elecom.2011.12.023
3,3189,"The single cell without an anode functional layer generated maximum power densities of 181, 138, 116, 77, and 49 mW cm-(2) at 700, 650, 600, 550, and 500 degrees C, respectively, whereas those for the single cell with an anode functional layer significantly improved up to 281, 243, 194, 145, and 95 mW cm(-2) at the same temperatures, almost doubling the power output.",Effect of anode functional layer on the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.elecom.2011.12.023
4,3189,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for these two cells revealed that the addition of the anode functional layer reduced the contact resistance as well as the polarization resistance for the cell, resulting thus in the improved cell performance.",Effect of anode functional layer on the performance of proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.elecom.2011.12.023
