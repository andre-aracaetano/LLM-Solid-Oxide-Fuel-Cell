2,19151,"BBP fit was found to be effective in lowering the sintering temperature of LBCO cathode by about 200 degrees C and in improving its electrochemical performance within the intermediate-temperature range of 600-800 degrees C. LBCO with 5 wt.% BBP frit cathode based on Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 electrolyte showed the best electrochemical performance, i.e., the lowest area-specific resistance (ASR) and cathodic overpotential.",Effect of B2O3-Bi2O3-PbO frit on the performance of LaBaCo2O5+δ cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.043
