1,19052,Strontium-doped lanthanum manganite is a widely used cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells.,Dynamic behavior of impurities and native components in model LSM microelectrodes on YSZ,10.1039/c5ra18042b
2,19052,"Segregation phenomena can have a critical impact on performance and durability, especially when they cause active interfaces to degrade.",Dynamic behavior of impurities and native components in model LSM microelectrodes on YSZ,10.1039/c5ra18042b
3,19052,"The segregation behavior in polarized and non-polarized strontium-doped lanthanum manganite ((La0.75Sr0.25)(0.95)MnO3) microelectrodes with a diameter of 100 mm and a thickness of similar to 500 nm on an yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte were analyzed post-mortem after similar to 200 h at temperatures up to 850 degrees C. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry was used to study the dynamic behavior of the native components (La, Sr, Mn) and selected impurities (Si, K, Na) both laterally and in-depth.",Dynamic behavior of impurities and native components in model LSM microelectrodes on YSZ,10.1039/c5ra18042b
4,19052,Manganese was found to be especially mobile and showed both segregation onto the electrolyte as a result of temperature and polarization and dissolution into the electrolyte below the microelectrodes.,Dynamic behavior of impurities and native components in model LSM microelectrodes on YSZ,10.1039/c5ra18042b
5,19052,"All native components showed a complex in-depth dynamic behavior, and a nanoscale in-depth analysis of the electrode-electrolyte interface revealed the formation of a well-defined lanthanum zirconate layer.",Dynamic behavior of impurities and native components in model LSM microelectrodes on YSZ,10.1039/c5ra18042b
6,19052,The selected impurities segregated to the electrolyte and microelectrode surfaces and Na- and K-rich layers formed at different depths.,Dynamic behavior of impurities and native components in model LSM microelectrodes on YSZ,10.1039/c5ra18042b
