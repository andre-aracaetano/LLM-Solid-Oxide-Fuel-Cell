1,3275,"Oxygen-electrode-supported solid oxide cells (OESCs) have potential advantages over fuel-electrode-supported cells, including reduced fuel-electrode concentration polarization, better oxygen electrode current collection, and flexibility in the fuel electrode choice.",Characteristics of Oxygen Electrode Supported Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abfa58
2,3275,"However, there are serious drawbacks including the difficulty of co-firing the oxygen electrode and electrolyte, and oxygen electrode concentration polarization.",Characteristics of Oxygen Electrode Supported Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abfa58
3,3275,"This paper explores the characteristics of OESCs with La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta -Zr0.92Y0.16O2-delta (LSM-YSZ) electrode-support enhanced by SrTi0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3-delta (STFC) infiltration, thin YSZ electrolyte, and SrTi0.3Fe0.7O3-delta (STF) fuel electrodes.",Characteristics of Oxygen Electrode Supported Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abfa58
4,3275,The STFC infiltration increases fuel cell maximum power density by >1.5 times and electrolysis current density (at 1.3 V) by >2 times.,Characteristics of Oxygen Electrode Supported Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abfa58
5,3275,"Cell performance in pure oxygen is compared to that in air, exploring a possible reversible solid oxide cell system configuration where oxygen produced during electrolysis is stored and subsequently used during fuel cell operation.",Characteristics of Oxygen Electrode Supported Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abfa58
6,3275,"The fuel cell maximum power density is increased from 0.88 W cm(-2) in air to 1.37 W cm(-2) in oxygen, with limiting current increased from 1.7 to >5.6 A cm(-2); the electrolysis performance is essentially unchanged, probably because the electrode air becomes enriched with oxygen during electrolysis.",Characteristics of Oxygen Electrode Supported Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abfa58
