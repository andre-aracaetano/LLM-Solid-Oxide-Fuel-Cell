5,14716,"The peak power density of the cell is reached 0.97 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C in the fuel cell (FC) mode and no notable degradation is observed after undergoing 30 thermal cycles at 0.75 V. Furthermore, the cell demonstrates a current density of 1.00 A cm(-2) when operated in electrolysis cell (EC) mode with 90% H2O at 800 degrees C and 1.3 V, and no obvious degradation is observed on the cell alternating between FC mode and EC mode alternately for 80 h. These results show the improvement of mechanical strength and mass transfer, and strengthen the application ability of 3YSZ | NiO-SSZ bilayer finger-like porous structure in RSOCs.",High strength bilayer finger-like ceramic supported reversible solid oxide cells via phase inversion tape-casting technology,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234232
