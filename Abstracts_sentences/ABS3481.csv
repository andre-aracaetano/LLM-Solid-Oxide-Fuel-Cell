2,3481,"In this study, we successfully synthesized a series of cathode ma-terials by introducing Ti into La0.6Ba0.4Ni0.2Fe0.8-xTixO3-delta(x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and conducted a comprehensive investigation of their physical and electrochemical characteristics.",Cobalt-free perovskite La0.6Ba0.4Ni0.2Fe0.8-xTixO3-δ(x=0-0.3) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.10.028
3,3481,Our research revealed that the introduction of Ti into these materials led to a significant improvement in electrocatalytic activity and overall electrochemical performance.,Cobalt-free perovskite La0.6Ba0.4Ni0.2Fe0.8-xTixO3-δ(x=0-0.3) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.10.028
4,3481,"Importantly, these enhancements were achieved while maintaining an optimal thermal expansion coefficient and exceptional electrode stability.",Cobalt-free perovskite La0.6Ba0.4Ni0.2Fe0.8-xTixO3-δ(x=0-0.3) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.10.028
5,3481,"Among the various samples examined, the La0.6Ba0.4Ni0.2Fe0.7-Ti0.1O3-delta cathode material stood out with the lowest polarization resistance recorded at 0.153 omega cm2 and the highest power density achieved at 800 degrees C, reaching an impressive 1068 mW/cm2.",Cobalt-free perovskite La0.6Ba0.4Ni0.2Fe0.8-xTixO3-δ(x=0-0.3) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.10.028
6,3481,"Furthermore, our long-term stability tests demonstrated that these cells exhibited remarkable electrode stability, with no significant dete-rioration in electrochemical performance observed over a testing period of 50 h. Based on these findings, we propose that La0.6Ba0.4Ni0.2Fe0.7Ti0.1O3-delta holds great promise as a potential cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells.",Cobalt-free perovskite La0.6Ba0.4Ni0.2Fe0.8-xTixO3-δ(x=0-0.3) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.10.028
