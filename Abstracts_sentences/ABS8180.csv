1,8180,"A 6-mu m-thick, dense, and uniform yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin-film electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell was able to be formed, via aqueous electrophoretic deposition, onto a porous Ni-YSZ cermet anode, which was made via attrition mill, pressure casting, and pressureless sintering.",Aqueous electrophoretic deposition of YSZ electrolyte layers for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-007-0458-2
2,8180,"Nonconductive yet suitably porous substrates could be used for electrophoretic deposition, with the help of an auxiliary electrode.",Aqueous electrophoretic deposition of YSZ electrolyte layers for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-007-0458-2
3,8180,"Ni/YSZ cermet presintered at 1,200 degrees C and reduced at 700 degrees C, on the other hand, behaved like a metal electrode and required no more the use of such an auxiliary electrode.",Aqueous electrophoretic deposition of YSZ electrolyte layers for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-007-0458-2
4,8180,It was also found that the deposition rate increased with increasing current density and with decreasing NH4-polyacrylate concentration.,Aqueous electrophoretic deposition of YSZ electrolyte layers for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-007-0458-2
