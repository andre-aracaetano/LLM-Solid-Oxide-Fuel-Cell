1,6952,"To simulate the electrochemical properties of acceptor-doped lanthanum chromites as interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cells, theoretical analyses of the distribution of oxygen chemical potential, ionic leak current density, and area specific resistance are given.",Electrochemical properties of doped lanthanum chromites as interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1836683
2,6952,"The results of the calculations using previously reported fundamental properties such as electrical conductivity as a function of oxygen partial pressure (P-o2), an equilibrium constant of a defect reaction for oxygen vacancy formation, and the diffusion coefficient of oxygen vacancies have shown that materials with a small amount of dopant can preferably be used from the viewpoint of energy conversion efficiency.",Electrochemical properties of doped lanthanum chromites as interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1836683
3,6952,The area specific resistance of interconnectors based on doped lanthanum chromites has been found to be sufficiently low for all the compositions and temperatures considered in the present study which include commonly used compositions and typical operating temperatures.,Electrochemical properties of doped lanthanum chromites as interconnectors for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1836683
