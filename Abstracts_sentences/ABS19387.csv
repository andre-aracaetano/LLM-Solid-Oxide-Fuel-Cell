4,19387,"Three-dimensional (3D) tomographic analysis using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) showed negligible changes due to the ageing, suggesting that the observed resistance increase was not caused by electrode morphological evolution.","Mechanisms of Performance Degradation of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes",10.1149/2.0031607jes
5,19387,"However, an increased amount, by a factor of 3, of a water-soluble Sr rich surface phase on the aged LSCF electrode was detected by an etching procedure coupled with inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).","Mechanisms of Performance Degradation of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes",10.1149/2.0031607jes
6,19387,"The electrochemical analysis in combination with the microstructural parameters determined by FIB-SEM was used to examine the effect of Sr segregation on the rate of oxygen surface exchange, based on the Adler-Lane-Steele (ALS) model.","Mechanisms of Performance Degradation of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes",10.1149/2.0031607jes
