4,18936,"The peak intensity variations for as-grown major crystal planes, post-growth polished crystal planes, and a post-growth polished non-crystallographic plane are directly linked to crystallographic orientation and crystal rotation, and agree with computed models.",Identifying crystallographic faces of the fluorites urania and thoria with rotational polarized Raman spectroscopy,10.1002/jrs.6236
5,18936,"In particular, the parallel polarized peak intensity results are directly correlated with metal-oxygen-metal chains in the fluorite structure and can be used to determine both orientation and rotational alignment of a given crystal face if sufficiently small rotational steps are applied.",Identifying crystallographic faces of the fluorites urania and thoria with rotational polarized Raman spectroscopy,10.1002/jrs.6236
