1,16733,"Subsolidus phase equilibrium of the LaMnO3 +/- delta-SrMnO3-delta-LaAlO3 system were studied in air at 1300 degreesC. Based on experimental results obtained by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), four distinct areas were found in the LaMnO3 +/- delta-SrMnO3-delta-LaAlO3 system, namely, the single phase perovskite La1-ySryMn1-xAlxO3 area, two phase mixtures of LaMnO3 +/- delta and LaAlO3 solid solutions, a mixture of perovskite La1-ySryMn1-xAlxO3 and SrMnO3, and a mixture of perovskite La1-ySryMn1-xAlxO3 and SrAl2O3.",Phases in the LaMnO3±δ-SrMnO3-δ-LaAlO3 system,10.1016/S0025-5408(00)00463-3
