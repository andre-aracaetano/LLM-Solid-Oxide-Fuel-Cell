2,17691,"In the current study, electrical conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, and linear expansion coefficient of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) and La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) are measured in a wide temperature range, including room temperature and below.",Transitions of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ and La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ,10.1016/j.matlet.2014.06.093
3,17691,"The properties of BSCF reveal a quite complex behaviour, exhibiting five transitions around 200, 350, 500, 800, and 1050 K, which can be related to the respective valence state and the spin-state of B-site cations as well as the oxygen non-stoichiometry, whereas those of LSCF has a simple temperature dependence, exhibiting two transitions around 250 and 800 K.
