1,1297,"To better understand the effects of infiltration on local electrochemistry and transport in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFCs) electrodes, high-throughput, high-performance finite element simulations are presented within dozens of SOFC cathodes containing synthetically generated nanoscale infiltrates.",High performance finite element simulations of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathode microstructures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231652
2,1297,"The computational approach retains the complex microstructural morphologies of cathodes, including those of the three backbone phases (gas, ion, and electron conductors) and the infiltrates (an electron conductor), in meshed domains and computes distributions of local electrochemical quantities within the domains.",High performance finite element simulations of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathode microstructures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231652
3,1297,"Simulations were implemented on a supercomputer and converged for 48 distinct microstructural subvolumes, with varying backbone heterogeneities and infiltrate loadings.",High performance finite element simulations of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathode microstructures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231652
4,1297,"Analyzing both the ensemble (averaged over subvolumes) and the local (evaluated within subvolumes) performance metrics indicate that infiltration of an electron conductor significantly improves the electrochemical performance of each backbone in a linear fashion with the increase of triple phase boundary content, but the essential ionic transport pathways of the backbone are unchanged.",High performance finite element simulations of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathode microstructures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231652
5,1297,These results shed into the and fabrication of electrodes in fuel cells.,High performance finite element simulations of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell cathode microstructures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231652
