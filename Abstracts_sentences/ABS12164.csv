1,12164,"The oxidation behaviour and the phase transformations associated with high temperature exposure of a commercial ferritic interconnect steel, Crofer 22 H, was studied in a simulated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode atmosphere at 700 degrees C. Special emphasis was placed on the formation of the intermetallic sigma phase.",Oxidation behaviour and phase transformations of an interconnect material in simulated anode environment of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1080/09603409.2016.1244373
2,12164,No sigma phase was detected in the bulk alloy after 500 h of exposure of bare specimens.,Oxidation behaviour and phase transformations of an interconnect material in simulated anode environment of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1080/09603409.2016.1244373
3,12164,"However, specimens which were pre-coated with a layer of nickel showed formation of an interdiffusion zone after as little as 2 h of exposure and sigma phase formation occurred after 10 h.",Oxidation behaviour and phase transformations of an interconnect material in simulated anode environment of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1080/09603409.2016.1244373
4,12164,"The presence of the nickel layer, which simulates the contact between ferritic steel interconnects and a nickel mesh in a SOFC results in the formation of an austenitic zone and accelerated formation of a sigma-phase rich layer at the ferrite/austenite interface.",Oxidation behaviour and phase transformations of an interconnect material in simulated anode environment of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1080/09603409.2016.1244373
5,12164,"The ferritic steel is transformed into austenite due to the inward diffusion of nickel, s-phase started to nucleate at the transformed austenite grain boundaries.",Oxidation behaviour and phase transformations of an interconnect material in simulated anode environment of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1080/09603409.2016.1244373
6,12164,"The nucleation is enhanced by an increased Cr/Fe-ratio at that interface due to more pronounced diffusion of Fe, compared to Cr, in the direction of the Ni-layer.",Oxidation behaviour and phase transformations of an interconnect material in simulated anode environment of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1080/09603409.2016.1244373

8,12164,The experimental results led to the conclusion that sigma nucleates in the austenite and grows following an isothermal eutectoid-like decomposition.,Oxidation behaviour and phase transformations of an interconnect material in simulated anode environment of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1080/09603409.2016.1244373
9,12164,The kinetics of sigma-phase formation and the depth of the interdiffusion zone were found to follow a traditional diffusion relationship.,Oxidation behaviour and phase transformations of an interconnect material in simulated anode environment of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1080/09603409.2016.1244373
10,12164,"It was observed that as the Ni-concentration increases the sigma-phase re-dissolves and thus the zone which, contains sigma phase moves deeper into the ferritic steel with exposure time.",Oxidation behaviour and phase transformations of an interconnect material in simulated anode environment of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1080/09603409.2016.1244373
11,12164,Interdiffusion processes between the nickel layer and the ferritic steel result not only in accelerated formation of sigma-phase but also in the formation of Cr-rich oxides within the nickel layer.,Oxidation behaviour and phase transformations of an interconnect material in simulated anode environment of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1080/09603409.2016.1244373
