3,14002,"Compared with graphite pore-former, flour pore-former shows a more severe sintering shrinkage and easily introduces some bigger pores which are very detrimental to the mechanical strength of the anode supports.",Electrochemical properties analysis of tubular NiO-YSZ anode-supported SOFCs fabricated by the phase-inversion method,10.1016/j.memsci.2009.06.012
4,14002,"Experimental results show that the porosity should be less than 55%, otherwise, it will severely affect the resistance of the anode.",Electrochemical properties analysis of tubular NiO-YSZ anode-supported SOFCs fabricated by the phase-inversion method,10.1016/j.memsci.2009.06.012
5,14002,"Four single cells were fabricated at different locations on the same 15cm long tubular NiO-YSZ anode-support; the maximum power output of the cells depended on their distance from the anode current collecting point (848, 774, 680 and 645 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C, using wet hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant).",Electrochemical properties analysis of tubular NiO-YSZ anode-supported SOFCs fabricated by the phase-inversion method,10.1016/j.memsci.2009.06.012
