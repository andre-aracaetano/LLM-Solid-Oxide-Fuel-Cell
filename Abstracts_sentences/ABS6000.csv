1,6000,"The goal of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) FutureGen project initiative is to develop and demonstrate technology for ultra clean 21st century energy plants that effectively remove environmental concerns associated with the use of fossil fuels for producing electricity, and simultaneously develop highly efficient and cost-effective power plants.",Sensitivity analysis of a Vision 21 coal based zero emission power plant,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.015
2,6000,The design optimization of an advanced FutureGen plant consisting of an advanced transport reactor (ATR) for coal gasification to generate syngas to fuel an integrated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) combined cycle is presented.,Sensitivity analysis of a Vision 21 coal based zero emission power plant,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.015
3,6000,The overall plant analysis of a baseline system design is performed by identifying the major factors effecting plant performance; these major factors being identified by a strategy consisting of the application of design of experiments (DOEx).,Sensitivity analysis of a Vision 21 coal based zero emission power plant,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.015
4,6000,"A steady state simulation tool is used to perform sensitivity analysis to verify the factors identified through DOEx, and then to perform parametric analysis to identify optimum values for maximum system efficiency.",Sensitivity analysis of a Vision 21 coal based zero emission power plant,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.015
5,6000,Modifications to baseline system design are made to attain higher system efficiency and to lower the negative impact of reducing the SOFC operating pressure on system efficiency.,Sensitivity analysis of a Vision 21 coal based zero emission power plant,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.015
