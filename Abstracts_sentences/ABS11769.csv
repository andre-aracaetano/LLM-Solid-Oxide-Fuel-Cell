1,11769,World-wide a number of activities are concerned with the optimisation and development of cell materials and microstructures with the aim of reducing the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating temperature.,Intermediate temperature SOFC - a promise for the 21st century,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02789-4
2,11769,Advantages for reduced operating temperatures are considered to be longer life time and reduced costs of the total system.,Intermediate temperature SOFC - a promise for the 21st century,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02789-4
3,11769,"Conventional zirconia based electrolyte cells with highly optimised electrodes have produced 500 mA/cm(2) at 700 mV and 800 degrees C. At a similar temperature and cell potential, small scale, co-fired, electrode supported thin-electrolyte cells have produced 700 mA/cm(2).",Intermediate temperature SOFC - a promise for the 21st century,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02789-4
4,11769,For SOFC operation at temperatures below 750 degrees C the conventional 8 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte is replaced with either Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (10GCO) or La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (LSGM) electrolytes.,Intermediate temperature SOFC - a promise for the 21st century,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02789-4
5,11769,Up-scaled 10 x 10 cm(2) or 12 cm circular 10GCO and LSGM cells have been manufactured and the initial results of cell tests are very promising.,Intermediate temperature SOFC - a promise for the 21st century,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02789-4
