1,19926,Scandium is a metal with specific industrial applications and its importance is expected to grow significantly in future.,"Scandium distribution in the world-class Li-Sn-W Cinovec greisen-type deposit: Result of a complex magmatic to hydrothermal evolution, implications for scandium valorization",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104433
2,19926,For its use in high-tech alloys and solid oxide fuel cells it is regarded as a strategic metal.,"Scandium distribution in the world-class Li-Sn-W Cinovec greisen-type deposit: Result of a complex magmatic to hydrothermal evolution, implications for scandium valorization",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104433
3,19926,"The world-class Li-Sn-W Cinovec/Zinnwald greisen-type deposit contains significant amount of Sc which could be an interesting by-product in anticipated production of Li, Sn and W. We conducted systematic study of Sc abundances and mineralogical controls of its fractionation during magmatic and post-magmatic evolution of the Cinovec granite cupola and its greisen deposits.","Scandium distribution in the world-class Li-Sn-W Cinovec greisen-type deposit: Result of a complex magmatic to hydrothermal evolution, implications for scandium valorization",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104433
4,19926,"From the main accessory minerals found in (partially to strongly) metasomatized granites, the highest concentrations of Sc2O3 were found in columbite (<= 3.0 wt%), zircon (<= 2.5 wt%), and Nb-rutile (<= 0.3 wt%) which are supplemented by wolframite (<= 1.0 wt%), ixiolite (<= 4.9 wt%) and cassiterite (<= 0.3 wt%) in greisens and quartz-zinnwaldite veins.","Scandium distribution in the world-class Li-Sn-W Cinovec greisen-type deposit: Result of a complex magmatic to hydrothermal evolution, implications for scandium valorization",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104433
5,19926,"However, the major Sc-carrier in most rock types and especially in greisens is the common zinnwaldite (typically 40-85 ppm Sc) hosting up to 93% of the total Sc.","Scandium distribution in the world-class Li-Sn-W Cinovec greisen-type deposit: Result of a complex magmatic to hydrothermal evolution, implications for scandium valorization",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104433
6,19926,Younger fluids causing zinnwaldite muscovitization and rare sulfidic overprint were significantly depleted in Sc and caused mobilization of Sc and/or its redistribution into secondary minerals.,"Scandium distribution in the world-class Li-Sn-W Cinovec greisen-type deposit: Result of a complex magmatic to hydrothermal evolution, implications for scandium valorization",10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104433
