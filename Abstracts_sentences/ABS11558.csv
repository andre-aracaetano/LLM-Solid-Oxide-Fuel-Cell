2,11558,"These different qualities of biogas (mixture of CH4 and CO2 with minor chemically neutral impurities), as they are presented here, refer to real life scenarios produced by different raw materials through the anaerobic digestion process.",The Effect of Biogas Origin on the Electricity Production by Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/app11073112
3,11558,"This work simulates electricity production in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)-based power plant, fed by biogas of various compositions.",The Effect of Biogas Origin on the Electricity Production by Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/app11073112
4,11558,Steam reforming of the gas feed stream is used to produce the required supply for the SOFC.,The Effect of Biogas Origin on the Electricity Production by Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/app11073112
5,11558,"Given the constraints of the feed stream compositions, resulting from the origin of biogas, i.e., by the biomass from which the biogas has been produced as well as by the operating conditions selected for its production, the overall plant performance is modelled in terms of energy and exergy.",The Effect of Biogas Origin on the Electricity Production by Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/app11073112
6,11558,"The model provides results on the efficiency, power output and thermal behavior of the system, thus presenting the potential to offer great advantages in generating electricity from biogas and reducing the environmental impact.",The Effect of Biogas Origin on the Electricity Production by Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/app11073112
7,11558,"This research study presents the efficiency of such a system in terms of energy and exergy, by considering several values of the operational parameters (extensions of reactions that take place in the apparatus, temperatures, feed stream compositions, etc.).",The Effect of Biogas Origin on the Electricity Production by Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/app11073112
8,11558,"It is found that moving towards a methane richer fuel, the energy and exergy efficiency can remain almost constant at high levels (around 70%), while in absolute value the electric energy can increase up to 35% according to the system's needs.",The Effect of Biogas Origin on the Electricity Production by Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/app11073112
