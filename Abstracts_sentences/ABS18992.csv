1,18992,"This study develops a high-efficiency dual-input interleaved dc-dc converter for reversible power sources, e. g., reversible solid-oxide fuel cell and rechargeable battery.",High-Efficiency Dual-Input Interleaved DC-DC Converter for Reversible Power Sources,10.1109/TPEL.2013.2275663
2,18992,"The proposed converter can convert low-voltage reversible power sources to a high-voltage dc bus individually or simultaneously by the phase-shift control, and also can step down the high-voltage dc bus to charge the power sources.",High-Efficiency Dual-Input Interleaved DC-DC Converter for Reversible Power Sources,10.1109/TPEL.2013.2275663
3,18992,"Moreover, the reversible power sources can charge each other.",High-Efficiency Dual-Input Interleaved DC-DC Converter for Reversible Power Sources,10.1109/TPEL.2013.2275663
4,18992,"According to various situations, the operational states of the proposed converter can be divided into four states including a single-input step-up state, a dual-input step-up state, a dual-output step-down state, and a dual power source step-up/step-down state.",High-Efficiency Dual-Input Interleaved DC-DC Converter for Reversible Power Sources,10.1109/TPEL.2013.2275663
5,18992,"In addition, the inductors in the proposed converter are designed to operate in synchronous conduction mode for achieving turn-on zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) of all switches.",High-Efficiency Dual-Input Interleaved DC-DC Converter for Reversible Power Sources,10.1109/TPEL.2013.2275663
6,18992,"Furthermore, the effectiveness of the designed circuit topology and the ZVS properties are verified by experimental results of a 5-kW-level prototype, and the goal of high-efficiency conversion can be obtained.",High-Efficiency Dual-Input Interleaved DC-DC Converter for Reversible Power Sources,10.1109/TPEL.2013.2275663
