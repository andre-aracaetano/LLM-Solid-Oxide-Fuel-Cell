3,17403,Here we report the thermal evolution of the phase formation and ionic conductivity of the composition x = 0.2.,Phase formation and conductivity degradation of Sr1-xKxSiO3-0.5x ionic conductors,10.1039/c6ta00666c
4,17403,"The results disclose the co-existence of crystalline and amorphous phases in the material at room temperature, and the amorphous phase would crystallize into K2SiO3 and SiO2 on heating at similar to 650 degrees C and return to the amorphous state at a temperature >= 1020 degrees C. Both the VT-XRD and conductivity data revealed that firing at a temperature above 1100 degrees C is favourable for maintaining the amorphous phase at ambient temperature.",Phase formation and conductivity degradation of Sr1-xKxSiO3-0.5x ionic conductors,10.1039/c6ta00666c

6,17403,"A K2Si2O5 glass was prepared in this work, and a high ionic conductivity was observed for this material, which was most likely responsible for the high ionic conductivity in Sr1-xKxSiO3-0.5x (x = 0.2).",Phase formation and conductivity degradation of Sr1-xKxSiO3-0.5x ionic conductors,10.1039/c6ta00666c
7,17403,"However, both the Sr1-xKxSiO3-0.5x (x = 0.2) and K2Si2O5 did not show strong evidence of oxide ion conduction.",Phase formation and conductivity degradation of Sr1-xKxSiO3-0.5x ionic conductors,10.1039/c6ta00666c
