1,15338,"Novel integration of in situ near infrared (NIR) thermal imaging, vibrational Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared emission spectroscopy (FTIRES) coupled with traditional electrochemical measurements has been used to probe chemical and thermal properties of Ni-based, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes operating with methane and simulated biogas fuel mixtures at 800 degrees C. Together, these three non-invasive optical techniques provide direct insight into the surface chemistry associated with device performance as a function of cell polarization.",In situ optical studies of methane and simulated biogas oxidation on high temperature solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1039/c3cp53278j
