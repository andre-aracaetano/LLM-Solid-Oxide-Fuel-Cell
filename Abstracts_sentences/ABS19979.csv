4,19979,"It is found that the use of metal foam can significantly enhance the heat transfer process and achieve an even temperature distribution in the CA-SOEC, where the peak temperature difference can be decreased from 57.0 to 21.5 K. As a result, the maximum thermo-mechanical stress is decreased by 69.9 % with the adoption of metal foam.",Towards feasible temperature management and thermo-mechanical stability of carbon-assisted solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116483
