1,5863,Liquid infiltration of NiO followed by reduction to form Ni nanoparticle catalysts in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) can produce a high density of electrochemical reaction sites.,Improving intermediate temperature performance of Ni-YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells by liquid infiltration of nickel nanoparticles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.027
2,5863,"In recent years, electrode architectures utilizing porous oxide substrates with ionic conductivity or mixed ionic-electronic conductivity and connected networks of nickel produced by liquid infiltration have become a popular approach to improve SOFC anode catalytic performance, especially for operating temperatures less than 800 degrees C. However, infiltrated nickel structures suffer from poor durability, demonstrating significant loss in performance during the first 100 h of use.",Improving intermediate temperature performance of Ni-YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells by liquid infiltration of nickel nanoparticles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.027

4,5863,"However, Ni-YSZ cermet anodes have micron sized structures, and consequently have a significantly lower density of electrochemical reaction site density than infiltrated nickel structures, which have dimensions of around 100 nm.",Improving intermediate temperature performance of Ni-YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells by liquid infiltration of nickel nanoparticles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.027
5,5863,"In this study, the performance impact of liquid phase infiltration of nickel nanoparticles into NiYSZ cermet anode supported SOFCs is studied by measuring the electrochemical behavior of infiltrated cells at 800 degrees C, 700 degrees C, and 600 degrees C, and comparing them to the performance of an uninfiltrated cell.",Improving intermediate temperature performance of Ni-YSZ cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells by liquid infiltration of nickel nanoparticles,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.027
