2,16212,Gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) is a promising electrolyte for developing intermediate- and low-temperature (IT and LT) SOFCs.,A benzoate coprecipitation route for synthesizing nanocrystalline GDC powder with lowered sintering temperature,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.04.011
3,16212,"However, the conventional sintering temperature for GDC is usually above 1200 degrees C unless additives are used.",A benzoate coprecipitation route for synthesizing nanocrystalline GDC powder with lowered sintering temperature,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.04.011
4,16212,"In this work, a nanocrystalline powder of GDC, (10 mol% Gd dopant, Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95) with low-sintering temperature has been synthesized using ammonium benzoate as a novel, environmentally friendly and cost-effective precursor/precipitant.",A benzoate coprecipitation route for synthesizing nanocrystalline GDC powder with lowered sintering temperature,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.04.011
5,16212,"The synthesized benzoate powders (termed washed- and non-washed samples) were calcined at a relatively low temperature of 500 degrees C for 6 h. Physicochemical characteristics were determined using thermal analysis (TG/ DTA), Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR, SEM/EDX, XRD, nitrogen absorptiometry, and dilatometry.",A benzoate coprecipitation route for synthesizing nanocrystalline GDC powder with lowered sintering temperature,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.04.011
6,16212,"Dilatometry showed that the newly synthesized GDC samples (washed and non-washed routes) start to shrink at temperatures of 500 and 600 degrees C (respectively), reaching their maximum sintering rate at 650 and 750 degrees C. Sintering of pelletized electrolyte substrates at the sintering onset temperature for commercial GDC powder (950 degrees C) for 6 h, showed densification of washed- and non-washed samples, obtaining 97.48 and 98.43% respectively, relative to theoretical density.",A benzoate coprecipitation route for synthesizing nanocrystalline GDC powder with lowered sintering temperature,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.04.011
7,16212,"The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis for the electrolyte pellets sintered at 950 degrees C showed a total electrical conductivity of 3.83 x 10-2 and 5.90 x 10-2 S cm- 1 (under air atmosphere at 750 degrees C) for washed- and non-washed samples, respectively.",A benzoate coprecipitation route for synthesizing nanocrystalline GDC powder with lowered sintering temperature,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.04.011
8,16212,"This is the first report of a GDC synthesis, where a considerable improvement in sinterability and electrical conductivity of the product GDC is observed at 950 degrees C without additives addition.",A benzoate coprecipitation route for synthesizing nanocrystalline GDC powder with lowered sintering temperature,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.04.011
