1,14010,"In this study, electrolyte-supported (Cell A) and anode-supported (Cell B) micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on the La9.8Si5.7Mg0.3O26 +/-delta (LSMO) electrolyte is built through an extrusion and dip-coating processes.",Design and characterization of apatite La9.8Si5.7Mg0.3O26±δ-based micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228072
2,14010,The formulations and process conditions for these cells are established and optimized.,Design and characterization of apatite La9.8Si5.7Mg0.3O26±δ-based micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228072
3,14010,"Both cell configurations show no visible delamination or cracking, and reaction zones and inter-diffusion of any species are absent at the interfaces of the multilayer structures.",Design and characterization of apatite La9.8Si5.7Mg0.3O26±δ-based micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228072
4,14010,The micro-tubes LSMO and LSMO-NiO have a high flexural strength of similar to 70 MPa.,Design and characterization of apatite La9.8Si5.7Mg0.3O26±δ-based micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228072
5,14010,"Cell B with a 3.33 mm outer diameter, a 12 mu m LSMO electrolyte layer, a similar to 300 mu m LSMO-NiO functional anode layer, a 9 mu m NiO current-collector layer, and a 44 mu m La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta cathode layer has superior electrochemical performances than does Cell A.",Design and characterization of apatite La9.8Si5.7Mg0.3O26±δ-based micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228072
6,14010,"The polarization resistance (R-p) value for Cell B accounts for 67.6% and 50.5% of the total resistance (R-t) value at 700 degrees C and 895 degrees C, respectively, suggesting that R-p dominates at low temperatures and ohmic resistance (R-o) and R-p values are equally important at high temperatures.",Design and characterization of apatite La9.8Si5.7Mg0.3O26±δ-based micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228072
7,14010,Cell B's open-circuit voltages (OCVs) are slightly below the theoretical value due to poor sealing of cells.,Design and characterization of apatite La9.8Si5.7Mg0.3O26±δ-based micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228072
8,14010,"The maximum power densities (MPDs) of Cell B, increase with increasing operating temperature and are 0.12, 0.24, and 0.27 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, 850 degrees C, and 895 degrees C, respectively.",Design and characterization of apatite La9.8Si5.7Mg0.3O26±δ-based micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228072
9,14010,"Compared to Cell A, Cell B displays lower OCV values but higher MPD (0.27 W cm(-2) vs. 0.06 W cm(-2) at 895 degrees C) due to its significantly lower R-o value, mainly due to the thin layer of LSMO electrolytes.",Design and characterization of apatite La9.8Si5.7Mg0.3O26±δ-based micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228072
