1,16415,"Crofer can be considered as the reference interconnect material in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) working under 800 degrees C. Thanks to its thermal expansion coefficient, it is suitable to replace ceramic components, such as the interconnect and the metal support, and it can be cost effective.",Influence of Different Aspects of the SOFC Anode Environment on the Oxidation Behavior of Porous Samples Made of Crofer,10.1115/1.4001764
2,16415,"Several research groups, including Ikerlan, have used porous substrates with the same composition as Crofer (PM from H. C. Starck GmbH, Goslar, Germany) as the metal support for their SOFC cells.",Influence of Different Aspects of the SOFC Anode Environment on the Oxidation Behavior of Porous Samples Made of Crofer,10.1115/1.4001764
3,16415,"The aim of this study is to determine the effect of certain variables (time, temperature, vapor content, cycling, porosity, and current flow), while other aspects are constant (sample composition and particle size and shape).",Influence of Different Aspects of the SOFC Anode Environment on the Oxidation Behavior of Porous Samples Made of Crofer,10.1115/1.4001764
