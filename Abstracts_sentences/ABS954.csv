3,954,We present a fully coupled two-dimensional multiphysics model that accounts for all transport processes and the chemical/electrochemical reactions in a working H2S SOFC including H2S dissociation kinetics in the fuel channels and heat transfer in the entire fuel cell assembly.,A Fully Coupled Multiphysics Model for a H2S SOFC,10.1149/1.3298453
4,954,A key aspect of the model developed in this work is the ability to model the coupled transport and reaction processes with thermodynamically consistent rate equations for the chemistry and electrochemistry.,A Fully Coupled Multiphysics Model for a H2S SOFC,10.1149/1.3298453
