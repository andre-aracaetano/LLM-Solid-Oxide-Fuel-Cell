1,18457,Reduction of H2O and CO2 as well as oxidation of H-2 and CO was studied in a Ni/YSZ electrode supported Solid Oxide Cell (SOC) produced at DTU Energy conversion (former Riso DTU).,Co-Electrolysis of Steam and Carbon Dioxide in Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/2.076208jes
2,18457,"Even though these Ni/YSZ based SOCs were developed and optimized for fuel cell use, they can work as reversible SOCs in mixtures of H2O, H-2, CO2 and CO.",Co-Electrolysis of Steam and Carbon Dioxide in Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/2.076208jes
3,18457,"From polarization (i-V) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic characterization, it is evident that, electrochemical reduction of both CO2 and H2O occurs during coelectrolysis of H2O and CO2 in these Ni/YSZ based SOC.",Co-Electrolysis of Steam and Carbon Dioxide in Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/2.076208jes
4,18457,"During co-electrolysis, the equilibrium of the water gas shift reaction is reached, and CO is therefore produced via the water gas shift reaction also.",Co-Electrolysis of Steam and Carbon Dioxide in Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/2.076208jes
5,18457,Significant differences during oxidation/reduction in H2O - H-2 and CO2 - CO mixtures were observed implying that different reaction mechanisms apply for the mixtures.,Co-Electrolysis of Steam and Carbon Dioxide in Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/2.076208jes
