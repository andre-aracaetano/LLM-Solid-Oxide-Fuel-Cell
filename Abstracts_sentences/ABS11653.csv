1,11653,The aim of this work is to study the reactivity of a Ni-YSZ-based solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) fueled with gaseous mixtures having the same composition as the syngas issued from a fixed-bed downdraft and staged gasification pilot.,Electricity production from lignocellulosic biomass by direct coupling of a gasifier and a nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cell: influence of the H2S content of the syngas onto performances and aging,10.1007/s10008-018-3961-8
2,11653,"The syngas issued from the gasifier contains some ppm(v) of H2S, and in order to adapt the purification process, the influence of this compound on the Ni-YSZ-based SOFCs is evaluated at 600 and 850 A degrees C.",Electricity production from lignocellulosic biomass by direct coupling of a gasifier and a nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cell: influence of the H2S content of the syngas onto performances and aging,10.1007/s10008-018-3961-8

4,11653,"In H-2-N-2 mixtures and only at 600 A degrees C, a significant decrease of cell performances is observed for H2S > 4.5 ppm(v).",Electricity production from lignocellulosic biomass by direct coupling of a gasifier and a nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cell: influence of the H2S content of the syngas onto performances and aging,10.1007/s10008-018-3961-8
5,11653,"For H-2-CO-CO2-N-2 mixtures, the influence is more important since a small decrease of performance can be observed for 1 ppm(v) of H2S even at 850 A degrees",Electricity production from lignocellulosic biomass by direct coupling of a gasifier and a nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cell: influence of the H2S content of the syngas onto performances and aging,10.1007/s10008-018-3961-8

7,11653,"Nevertheless, at 600 A degrees C, it is possible to avoid damage by limiting the current density.",Electricity production from lignocellulosic biomass by direct coupling of a gasifier and a nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cell: influence of the H2S content of the syngas onto performances and aging,10.1007/s10008-018-3961-8
8,11653,"Aging experiments, realized at 750 A degrees C, show that the influence of 1 and 2 ppm(v) of H2S is more important during the first 20 h and is reversible: at this temperature, after poisoning with 1 ppm(v) of H2S during 72 h, the cell recovers 91% of its initial power density after 100 h in pure hydrogen, and after subsequent poisoning with 2 ppm(v) of H2S during 77 h, the cell recovers 94% of its initial power density after 168 h in pure hydrogen.",Electricity production from lignocellulosic biomass by direct coupling of a gasifier and a nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cell: influence of the H2S content of the syngas onto performances and aging,10.1007/s10008-018-3961-8
