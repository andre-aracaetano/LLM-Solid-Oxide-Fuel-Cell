2,8977,The goal of this study is to improve the properties of LSM cathodes working in the range of 500-800 degrees C by the addition of YFe0.5Co0.5O3 (YFC).,Improvement of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Addition of YFe0.5Co0.5O3,10.3390/ma15020642
3,8977,"Monophasic YFC is synthesized and sintered at 950 degrees C. Composite cathodes are prepared on Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolyte disks using pastes containing YFC and LSM powders mixed in 0:1, 1:19, and 1:1 weight ratios denoted LSM, LSM1, and LSM1, respectively.",Improvement of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Addition of YFe0.5Co0.5O3,10.3390/ma15020642
4,8977,"X-ray diffraction patterns of tested composites reveal the presence of pure perovskite phases in samples sintered at 950 degrees C and the presence of Sr4Fe4O11, YMnO3, and La0.775Sr0.225MnO3.047 phases in samples sintered at 1100 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that polarization resistance increases from LSM1, by LSM, to LSM2.",Improvement of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Addition of YFe0.5Co0.5O3,10.3390/ma15020642
5,8977,"Differences in polarization resistance increase with decreasing operating temperatures because activation energy rises in the same order and equals to 1.33, 1.34, and 1.58 eV for LSM1, LSM, and LSM2, respectively.",Improvement of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Addition of YFe0.5Co0.5O3,10.3390/ma15020642
6,8977,The lower polarization resistance of LSM1 electrodes is caused by the lower resistance associated with the charge transfer process.,Improvement of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Addition of YFe0.5Co0.5O3,10.3390/ma15020642
