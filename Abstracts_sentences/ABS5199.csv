1,5199,"With the aim to maintain the advantage of symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells (SSOFCs), quasi-SSOFC with the interstitial oxygen conducting electrode is fabricated by the in situ forming method.",Tailoring an interstitial oxygen conducting electrode by in situ fabrication for quasi-symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-020-03790-4
2,5199,"The in situ fabrication process is performed by reducing perovskite typed Pr1-xSrxFeO3-delta(x = 0.4 and 0.5) in hydrogen at 800 degrees C for 10 h. After the reduction treatment, Pr0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta(PSF64) is decomposed to (Pr0.6Sr0.4)(3)Fe2O7, (Pr0.6Sr0.4)(2)FeO4, and Fe nanoparticles, while Pr0.5Sr0.5FeO3-delta(PSF55) is decomposed to (Pr0.6Sr0.4)(2)FeO(4)and Fe nanoparticles.",Tailoring an interstitial oxygen conducting electrode by in situ fabrication for quasi-symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-020-03790-4
3,5199,"Results show that the formation of RP-typed layered structure (Pr0.6Sr0.4)(3)Fe(2)O(7)in reducing atmosphere can accelerate the oxygen ion transport rate, which leads to the enhancement of R(p)value from 0.36 to 0.16 omega cm(2)at 800 degrees C and the improvement of power density from 418 to 502 mW/cm(2).",Tailoring an interstitial oxygen conducting electrode by in situ fabrication for quasi-symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-020-03790-4
4,5199,It is believed that introducing the interstitial oxygen conducting electrode to a quasi-symmetrical oxide fuel cell is an efficient approach to enhance the performance.,Tailoring an interstitial oxygen conducting electrode by in situ fabrication for quasi-symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-020-03790-4
