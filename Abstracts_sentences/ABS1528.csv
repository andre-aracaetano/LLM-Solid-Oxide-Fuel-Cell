1,1528,In this paper are analysed the ecological aspects in regard of the application of binary co-generative power plants with solid oxide fuel cells (BCFC).,BINARY CO-GENERATION POWER PLANT WITH SOFC - ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS,
2,1528,"The BCFC are combined co-generative power plants with fuel cells, gas and steam co-generative power plants, which are considered as high efficiency power plants.",BINARY CO-GENERATION POWER PLANT WITH SOFC - ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS,
3,1528,It is proposed optimisation methodology according to which is developed and verified an optimisation software.,BINARY CO-GENERATION POWER PLANT WITH SOFC - ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS,
4,1528,As leading optimisation criteria is chosen the maximal efficiency of the analysed power plant.,BINARY CO-GENERATION POWER PLANT WITH SOFC - ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS,
5,1528,"In the paper are presented many calculation results from the software which are relating to energy, ecological and economical characteristics for this kind of power plants.",BINARY CO-GENERATION POWER PLANT WITH SOFC - ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS,
6,1528,The obtained results are analysed in regard of ecological aspects such as pollutant emissions depending from the fuel type.,BINARY CO-GENERATION POWER PLANT WITH SOFC - ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS,
7,1528,Comparison is performed between the results (ecological parameters) of BCFC with and without fuel cells.,BINARY CO-GENERATION POWER PLANT WITH SOFC - ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS,
8,1528,"According the analyses of the results, conclusions are drawn which justifies the advantages in implementation on this kind of power plants.",BINARY CO-GENERATION POWER PLANT WITH SOFC - ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS,
