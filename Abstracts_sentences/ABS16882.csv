2,16882,"Sol-gel combustion facilitates molecular mixing of the precursors and substitution of the large Bi3+ cations into the fluorite structure, considerably reducing the sintering temperature.",Improved microstructure and sintering temperature of bismuth nano-doped GDC powders synthesized by direct sol-gel combustion,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.165
3,16882,Adding Bi2O3 as a dopant increases the GDC densification to above 99.7% and reduces its traditional sintering temperature by 300 C. Impedance analyses show that the addition of bismuth enhances the conductivity (3.110(-2)-1.7.\10(-1) Scm(-1) in the temperature range 600-800 degrees C) and improves the performance of the solid electrolyte in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Improved microstructure and sintering temperature of bismuth nano-doped GDC powders synthesized by direct sol-gel combustion,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.165
