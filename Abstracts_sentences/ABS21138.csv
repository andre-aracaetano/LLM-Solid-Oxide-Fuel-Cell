2,21138,"In this study, the thermal evolution of the structure, oxygen nonstoichiometry, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of La2NiO4+delta, Nd2NiO4+delta, La3Ni2O7-delta, La4Ni3O10-delta, Pr4Ni3O10-delta and Nd4Ni3O10-delta are investigated.","Structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = La, Pr and Nd; n=1, 2 and 3)",10.1039/d0ta06731h
3,21138,Phase transitions involving a disruption of the cooperative tilting of the perovskite layers in the low-temperature structure thereby transforming it to a more symmetric structure are observed in several of the materials upon heating in air.,"Structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = La, Pr and Nd; n=1, 2 and 3)",10.1039/d0ta06731h
4,21138,Pr4Ni3O10-delta and Nd4Ni3O10-delta show no phase transition from room temperature up to 1000 degrees C. High density ceramics (>96%) are obtained after sintering at 1300 degrees C and (for n = 2 and n = 3 members) post-sintering annealing at reduced temperatures.,"Structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = La, Pr and Nd; n=1, 2 and 3)",10.1039/d0ta06731h
5,21138,Data for the electrical conductivity measurements on these specimens indicate itinerant behaviour of the charge carriers in the RP nickelates.,"Structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = La, Pr and Nd; n=1, 2 and 3)",10.1039/d0ta06731h
6,21138,The increase in p-type conductivity with the order n of the RP phase is interpreted as arising from the concomitant increase in the formal valence of Ni.,"Structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = La, Pr and Nd; n=1, 2 and 3)",10.1039/d0ta06731h
7,21138,"The observations can be interpreted in terms of a simple energy band scheme, showing that electron holes are formed in the sigma x(2)-y(2)up arrow band upon increasing the oxidation state of Ni.","Structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = La, Pr and Nd; n=1, 2 and 3)",10.1039/d0ta06731h
8,21138,Electrical conductivity relaxation measurements reveal remarkable similarities between the surface exchange coefficients (k(chem)) of the different RP phases despite the differences in the order parameter n and the nature of the lanthanide ion.,"Structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = La, Pr and Nd; n=1, 2 and 3)",10.1039/d0ta06731h
9,21138,"Calculation of the oxygen self-diffusion coefficients (D-s) from the experimental values of the chemical diffusion coefficients (D-chem), using the corresponding data of oxygen non-stoichiometry from thermogravimetry measurements, shows that these are strongly determined by the order parameter n.","Structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = La, Pr and Nd; n=1, 2 and 3)",10.1039/d0ta06731h
10,21138,"The value of D-s decreases almost one order of magnitude on going from the n = 1 members La2NiO4+delta and Nd2NiO4+delta to the n = 2 member La3Ni2O7-delta, and again one order of magnitude on going to the n = 3 members La4Ni3O10-delta, Pr4Ni3O10-delta and Nd4Ni3O10-delta.","Structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = La, Pr and Nd; n=1, 2 and 3)",10.1039/d0ta06731h
11,21138,The results confirm that oxygen-ion transport in the investigated RP nickelates predominantly occurs via an interstitialcy mechanism within the rock-salt layer of the structures.,"Structure, electrical conductivity and oxygen transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = La, Pr and Nd; n=1, 2 and 3)",10.1039/d0ta06731h
