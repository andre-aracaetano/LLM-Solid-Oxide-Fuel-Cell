1,2262,"The effect of partial substitution of alkaline earth (AE) ions, Sr2+ and Ca2+, for the rare earth (RE) ions, La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, and Sm3+, on the physical properties of REVO4 compounds were investigated.","Physical and electrochemical properties of alkaline earth doped, rare earth vanadates",10.1016/j.jssc.2012.01.065
2,2262,The use of the Pechini method to synthesize the vanadates allowed for high levels of AE substitution to be obtained.,"Physical and electrochemical properties of alkaline earth doped, rare earth vanadates",10.1016/j.jssc.2012.01.065
3,2262,"Coulometric titration was used to measure redox isotherms for these materials and showed that the addition of the AE ions increased both reducibility and electronic conductivity under typical solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode conditions, through the formation of compounds with mixed vanadium valence.","Physical and electrochemical properties of alkaline earth doped, rare earth vanadates",10.1016/j.jssc.2012.01.065
4,2262,"In spite of their high electronic conductivity, REVO4-yttira stabilized zirconia (YSZ) composite anodes exhibited only modest performance when used in SOFCs operating with H-2 fuel at 973 K due to their low catalytic activity.","Physical and electrochemical properties of alkaline earth doped, rare earth vanadates",10.1016/j.jssc.2012.01.065
5,2262,"High performance was obtained, however, after the addition of a small amount of catalytically active Pd to the anode.","Physical and electrochemical properties of alkaline earth doped, rare earth vanadates",10.1016/j.jssc.2012.01.065
