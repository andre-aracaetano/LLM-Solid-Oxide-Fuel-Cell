2,15050,The results show that all of the components of SOFC reveal compressive residual stress after plasma spraying.,Evaluations of the residual strains in the plasma sprayed multi-layer electrodes of the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2013.09.027
3,15050,"However, the stress states of these components become complicated and irregular after the redox treatments.",Evaluations of the residual strains in the plasma sprayed multi-layer electrodes of the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2013.09.027
4,15050,The strain state of both LSCM (La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta) buffer layer and anode was changed from compressive to tensile.,Evaluations of the residual strains in the plasma sprayed multi-layer electrodes of the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2013.09.027
5,15050,We also found that the original stress state was changed when the upper component was deposited.,Evaluations of the residual strains in the plasma sprayed multi-layer electrodes of the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2013.09.027
6,15050,"For example, the original stress state was 0.78% in compressive; after the NiO/LDC (Ce0.55La0.45O3-delta) anode deposited on the LSCM buffer, the anode side of LSCM revealed the compressive strain with 3.34% and the matrix side of LSCM revealed the tensile strain with 10.65%.",Evaluations of the residual strains in the plasma sprayed multi-layer electrodes of the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2013.09.027
7,15050,Two kinds of strain states coexisted in an electrode coating resulted in the electrode failure occurred in the reverse position of stress states.,Evaluations of the residual strains in the plasma sprayed multi-layer electrodes of the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2013.09.027
8,15050,"Therefore, the redox treatments indeed affect the strain state of the SOFC components and the influences on the cell durability should not be ignored.",Evaluations of the residual strains in the plasma sprayed multi-layer electrodes of the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2013.09.027
