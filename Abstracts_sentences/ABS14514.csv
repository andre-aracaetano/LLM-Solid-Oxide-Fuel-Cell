1,14514,"In this paper, we report the chemical stability of a highly proton conducting Sm+Zr-codoped BaCe0.85-xZrxSm0.15O3-delta (BCZS) (0.01 < x < 0.3) in H2O vapor and CO2, and their electrical conductivity in air, N-2 + 3% H2O, H-2 + 3% H2O and N-2 + 3% D2O.","BaCe0.85-xZrxSm0.15O3-δ (0.01 < x < 0.3) (BCZS): Effect of Zr Content in BCZS on Chemical Stability in CO2 and H2O Vapor, and Proton Conductivity",10.1149/2.029301jes
2,14514,"All the prepared BCZS was found to be structurally stable against reaction with pure CO2 at 400 degrees C for 24 h, showing a positive role of Zr in providing chemical stability.","BaCe0.85-xZrxSm0.15O3-δ (0.01 < x < 0.3) (BCZS): Effect of Zr Content in BCZS on Chemical Stability in CO2 and H2O Vapor, and Proton Conductivity",10.1149/2.029301jes
3,14514,"However, at 600 degrees C for 24 h, BCZS (0 < x < 0.2) showed the formation of BaCO3, while x = 0.3 remained stable at 20% CO2 in N-2.","BaCe0.85-xZrxSm0.15O3-δ (0.01 < x < 0.3) (BCZS): Effect of Zr Content in BCZS on Chemical Stability in CO2 and H2O Vapor, and Proton Conductivity",10.1149/2.029301jes
4,14514,"Upon exposure to H2O vapor at 90 degrees C, Ba(OH)(2)center dot xH(2)O formation was observed for all the investigated BCZS whereas at 600 degrees C all were found to be chemically stable.","BaCe0.85-xZrxSm0.15O3-δ (0.01 < x < 0.3) (BCZS): Effect of Zr Content in BCZS on Chemical Stability in CO2 and H2O Vapor, and Proton Conductivity",10.1149/2.029301jes
5,14514,"A maximum conductivity of 5 x 10(-3) Scm(-1) is obtained for x = 0.3 member, which is about 40% of its Zr-free parent compound BaCe0.85Sm0.15O3-delta (BCS).","BaCe0.85-xZrxSm0.15O3-δ (0.01 < x < 0.3) (BCZS): Effect of Zr Content in BCZS on Chemical Stability in CO2 and H2O Vapor, and Proton Conductivity",10.1149/2.029301jes
6,14514,"Current work shows that despite the drop in conductivity, Zr doping in BCS provides stability under pure CO2, especially considering the goal of decreasing operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) below 500 degrees C.
