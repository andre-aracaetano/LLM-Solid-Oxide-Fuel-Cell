1,8588,"A three-electrode system configuration was applied to an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell where the anode to cathode surface area ratio was similar to 7.9, and Ni/YSZ Was used as the anode, LSM as the cathode, Pt as the reference electrode, and thin YSZ film as the electrolyte.",Polarization measurements of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells studied by incorporation of a reference electrode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.04.088
2,8588,"The cell was polarized potentiostatically at -0.2, -0.4, -0.6 and -0.8 V versus Open Circuit voltage (OCV) and the potential change versus a reference electrode were recorded to ascertain the relative electrode polarization contributions.",Polarization measurements of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells studied by incorporation of a reference electrode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.04.088
3,8588,"The results Of these studies suggested that, while the anode contributions to cell polarization were less significant than that observed for the cathode, they were not negligible.",Polarization measurements of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells studied by incorporation of a reference electrode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.04.088
