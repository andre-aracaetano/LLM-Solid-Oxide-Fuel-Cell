1,11563,The development of direct methane solid oxide fuel cells is greatly impeded by the problem of carbon deposition on conventional Ni-based anodes.,An in situ formed MnO-Co composite catalyst layer over Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anodes for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta10473h
2,11563,"Here, we report a MnO-Co composite catalyst layer, formed by the in situ reduction of Mn1.5Co1.5O4 spinel, over Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x (SDC) anodes for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",An in situ formed MnO-Co composite catalyst layer over Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anodes for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta10473h
3,11563,Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results demonstrate that Co beads are extracted from the Mn1.5Co1.5O4 structure and distributed over the MnO surface after reduction in H-2.,An in situ formed MnO-Co composite catalyst layer over Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anodes for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta10473h
4,11563,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that the intensity of surface hydroxyl groups/absorbed oxygen species is almost the same as that of lattice oxygen species due to the Co enrichment on the MnO-Co composite surface.,An in situ formed MnO-Co composite catalyst layer over Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anodes for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta10473h
5,11563,"With the addition of the MnO-Co catalyst layer, the stability of Ni-SDC anode-supported SOFCs is improved in wet methane (similar to 3 mol% H2O in methane), but their electrochemical performance is worsened due to the increase of mass transport resistance.",An in situ formed MnO-Co composite catalyst layer over Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anodes for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta10473h
6,11563,"However, with the addition of the SDC promoter to the MnO-Co catalyst layer, not only is the excellent stability retained but also the electrochemical performance is improved.",An in situ formed MnO-Co composite catalyst layer over Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anodes for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta10473h
7,11563,"The performance of the MnO-Co-SDC catalyst layer is also compared with that of 2MnO-Co-SDC and MnO-2Co-SDC catalyst layers in wet methane at 650 degrees C. The SOFC with the MnO-Co-SDC catalyst layer exhibits the biggest maximum power density and the smallest polarization resistance, and operates stably for over 900 min at 0.2 A cm(-2).",An in situ formed MnO-Co composite catalyst layer over Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anodes for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta10473h
8,11563,"The maximum power densities of SOFCs with the MnO-Co-SDC catalyst layer were 361, 701 and 849 mW cm(-2) at 600, 650 and 700 degrees C in wet methane, respectively.",An in situ formed MnO-Co composite catalyst layer over Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anodes for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta10473h
