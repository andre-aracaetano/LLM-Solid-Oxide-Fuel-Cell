3,14302,To get deeper insight into the mixed conduction mechanism of oxygen ions and electrons from atomistic and electronic level viewpoints we have applied first-principles density functional theory (DFT + U method).,A concerted migration mechanism of mixed oxide ion and electron conduction in reduced ceria studied by first-principles density functional theory,10.1039/c2cp00020b
4,14302,"The calculation results show that oxygen vacancies strongly attract localized electrons, forming associates between them.",A concerted migration mechanism of mixed oxide ion and electron conduction in reduced ceria studied by first-principles density functional theory,10.1039/c2cp00020b
5,14302,The migration energy of an oxygen vacancy in such an associate is substantially lowered compared to the unassociated case due to the simultaneous positional rearrangement of localized electrons during the ionic jump process.,A concerted migration mechanism of mixed oxide ion and electron conduction in reduced ceria studied by first-principles density functional theory,10.1039/c2cp00020b
6,14302,"Accordingly, we propose a concerted migration mechanism of oxygen vacancies and localized electrons in reduced ceria; this mechanism results in an increased diffusivity of oxygen vacancies supported by localized electrons compared with that in pure oxide ion conductors.",A concerted migration mechanism of mixed oxide ion and electron conduction in reduced ceria studied by first-principles density functional theory,10.1039/c2cp00020b
