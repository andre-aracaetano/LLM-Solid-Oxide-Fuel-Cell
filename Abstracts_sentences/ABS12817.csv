1,12817,"Doped ceria is commonly used to promote the performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) cathode, but the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity on the interface between LSM and doped ceria is not conclusive due to the complexity of the cathode and problematic analysis of the impedance spectra.",Insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on the LSM|GDC interface of solid oxide fuel cells through impedance spectroscopy analysis,10.1039/c5cy02232k
2,12817,"Here, to elucidate the role of the LSM vertical bar GDC interface in the ORR, we constructed a simple LSM vertical bar GDC interface and analyzed the impedance data using a method based on the calculation of the distribution function of relaxation times (DRT).",Insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on the LSM|GDC interface of solid oxide fuel cells through impedance spectroscopy analysis,10.1039/c5cy02232k
3,12817,DRT analysis demonstrates that the ORR on the LSM vertical bar GDC interface possesses similar activation energies for oxygen dissociation and the subsequent oxygen atom reduction but involves an easier oxygen incorporation process in comparison with the LSM vertical bar YSZ interface.,Insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on the LSM|GDC interface of solid oxide fuel cells through impedance spectroscopy analysis,10.1039/c5cy02232k
4,12817,Addition of the GDC interlayer causes a decrease in cell performance because poor LSM vertical bar GDC interfaces lead to depressed dominant electrode processes of oxygen dissociation and the subsequent oxygen atom reduction.,Insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on the LSM|GDC interface of solid oxide fuel cells through impedance spectroscopy analysis,10.1039/c5cy02232k
5,12817,"These results provide useful insight into the ORR on the LSM vertical bar GDC interface, favoring the design of a high-performance doped ceria-enhanced LSM cathode.",Insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on the LSM|GDC interface of solid oxide fuel cells through impedance spectroscopy analysis,10.1039/c5cy02232k
