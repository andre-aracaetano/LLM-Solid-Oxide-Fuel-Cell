1,1766,Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) micro tubular electrolyte membranes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were prepared via the combined wet phase inversion and sintering technique.,Preparation of electrolyte membranes for micro tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11426-008-0068-6
2,1766,The as-derived YSZ micro tubes consist of a thin dense skin layer and a thick porous layer that can serve as the electrode of fuel cells.,Preparation of electrolyte membranes for micro tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11426-008-0068-6
3,1766,"The dense and the porous electrolyte layers have the thickness of 3-5 mu m and 70-90 mu m, respectively, while the inner surface porosity of the porous layer is higher than 28.1%.",Preparation of electrolyte membranes for micro tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11426-008-0068-6
4,1766,The two layers are perfectly integrated together to preclude the crack or flake of electrolyte film from the electrode.,Preparation of electrolyte membranes for micro tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11426-008-0068-6
5,1766,"The presented method possesses distinct advantages such as technological simplicity, low cost and high reliability, and thus provides a new route for the preparation of micro tubular SOFCs.",Preparation of electrolyte membranes for micro tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11426-008-0068-6
