1,13269,New anode materials based on Fe-doped CaTiO3 and ruthenium were examined to enhance the fuel flexibility of SOFCs.,Novel anode materials for multi-fuel applicable solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.179
2,13269,"An optimum weight ratio between NiO and Ca(Fe)TiO3, RuO2 and YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) was determined for Ni-Ca(Fe)TiO3 and Ru-YSZ anodes, respectively, and sintering temperature was investigated to achieve high power generation characteristics.",Novel anode materials for multi-fuel applicable solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.179
3,13269,"The Ni-Ca(Fe)TiO3 anode of NiO:Ca(Fe)TiO3 = 4:1 sintered at 1300 degrees C showed better current-voltage characteristics than those sintered at 1200 and 1400 degrees C, which was comparable to Ni-YSZ anode.",Novel anode materials for multi-fuel applicable solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.179
4,13269,"When a constant current of 200 mA/cm(2) was applied by feeding a gas mixture of methane, H2O, and N-2 at steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio of 1.6 at 1000 degrees C, terminal voltage over SOFCs with the Ni-Ca(Fe)TiO3 and Ru-YSZ anode was stable in 20 h, whereas that over Ni-YSZ decreased significantly.",Novel anode materials for multi-fuel applicable solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.179
5,13269,The catalytic activity of the anode materials for carbon formation was evaluated by methane decomposition rate measurements.,Novel anode materials for multi-fuel applicable solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.179
6,13269,"Carbon deposition rates over the Ni-Ca(Fe)TiO3 and Ru-YSZ were found to be lower than that over Ni-YSZ, possibly leading to the stable power generation at the low S/C ratio.",Novel anode materials for multi-fuel applicable solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.12.179
