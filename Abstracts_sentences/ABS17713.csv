1,17713,"Oxygen isotope diffusion coefficients were determined for La1-xCaxCrO3-delta (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) via bulk and via grain-boundary diffusion as functions of calcium content (x), temperatures from 1073 to 1273 K, and oxygen partial pressures from p(O-2) = 10(-9) to 10(4) Pa at T = 1273 K. Both bulk and grain-boundary diffusion coefficients increased with calcium content.",Oxygen transport properties of La1-xCaxCrO3-δ as an interconnect material of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1393880
