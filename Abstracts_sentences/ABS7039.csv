5,7039,"From thermal gravimetric analysis, the ash content of the ash-free coal was found to be nearly zero, but its volatile matter content was 38.34 wt.%.",Feasibility of using ash-free coal in a solid-oxide-electrolyte direct carbon fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.162
6,7039,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and visualization tests were carried out for characterization of the interface of the ash-free coal; the results showed that the ash-free coal was in a liquid-like phase at high temperatures because the volatile matter in the coal produced by solvent extraction could help maintain carbon in the liquid-like state on the anode at high temperatures.,Feasibility of using ash-free coal in a solid-oxide-electrolyte direct carbon fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.162
