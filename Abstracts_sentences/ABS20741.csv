2,20741,A series of electrolyte/AFL/anode triple-layer hollow fibres with controllable AFL thicknesses (16.9-52.7 mu m) have been fabricated via a single-step phase-inversion assisted co-extrusion technique.,Co-extrusion of electrolyte/anode functional layer/anode triple-layer ceramic hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells-electrochemical performance study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.004
3,20741,Both robustness of the cell and gas-tightness of the electrolyte layer are considerably improved by introducing the AFL of this type.,Co-extrusion of electrolyte/anode functional layer/anode triple-layer ceramic hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells-electrochemical performance study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.004
4,20741,The fracture force of the sample with the thickest AFL (9.67 N) almost doubles when compared to the electrolyte/anode dual-layer counterpart (5.24 N).,Co-extrusion of electrolyte/anode functional layer/anode triple-layer ceramic hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells-electrochemical performance study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.004
5,20741,Gas-tightness of the electrolyte layer is also considerably increased as AFL contributes to better-matched sintering behaviours between different components.,Co-extrusion of electrolyte/anode functional layer/anode triple-layer ceramic hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells-electrochemical performance study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.004
6,20741,"Moreover, the formation of an AFL simultaneously with electrolyte and anode significantly improves the cell performances.",Co-extrusion of electrolyte/anode functional layer/anode triple-layer ceramic hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells-electrochemical performance study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.004
7,20741,"The sample with the thinnest AFL (approximately 16.9 mu m, 6% of the total anode thickness) leads to a 30% (from 0.89 to 1.21 W cm(-2))",Co-extrusion of electrolyte/anode functional layer/anode triple-layer ceramic hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells-electrochemical performance study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.004
8,20741,"increase in maximum power density, due to increased triple-phase boundaries (TPB).",Co-extrusion of electrolyte/anode functional layer/anode triple-layer ceramic hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells-electrochemical performance study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.004
9,20741,"However, further increase in TPB from a thicker AFL is less effective for improving the cell performance, due to the substantially increased fuel diffusion resistance and subsequently higher concentration polarization.",Co-extrusion of electrolyte/anode functional layer/anode triple-layer ceramic hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells-electrochemical performance study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.004
10,20741,This indicates that the control over the AFL thickness is critically important in avoiding offsetting the benefits of extended TPB and consequently decreased cell performances.,Co-extrusion of electrolyte/anode functional layer/anode triple-layer ceramic hollow fibres for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells-electrochemical performance study,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.004
