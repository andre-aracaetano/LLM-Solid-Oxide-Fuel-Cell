1,9702,The viability of cooling a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) during air exposure is investigated as a possible solution to the mechanical damage caused by inadvertent 'redox cycling' (cyclic exposure to air and then to H-2) of Ni-based anode-supported cells at high temperatures.,A possible solution to the mechanical degradation of Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells due to redox cycling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.043
2,9702,"In order to prevent electrolyte (and cell) cracking, it is shown that cooling the anode-supported Ni-YSZ samples during air exposure from 800 degrees C to <600 degrees C at rates >3 degrees C min(-1) significantly slows down the oxidation of Ni.",A possible solution to the mechanical degradation of Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells due to redox cycling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.043
