1,15730,"In order to improve the sinterability of LaCrO3, which is one of candidate materials for interconnector of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell, the effect of sintering in reducing atmosphere and Ti substitution of Cr on the sinterability was investigated.",Effect of Ti substitution and atmosphere on sintering properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.113.353
2,15730,"Judging from the sintering temperature dependence of density, both of sintering in reducing atmosphere and Ti substitution of Cr improved the sinterability of LaCrO3.",Effect of Ti substitution and atmosphere on sintering properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.113.353
3,15730,"Compared with the sample sintered in air, sinterability of the samples sintered in reducing atmosphere was most promoted in a case of small amount of Ti substitution.",Effect of Ti substitution and atmosphere on sintering properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.113.353
4,15730,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the surface of the sample revealed an existence of Cr6+ ion in LaCrO3 sintered in air.,Effect of Ti substitution and atmosphere on sintering properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.113.353
5,15730,"On the contrary, Cr6+ ion was not obviously observed in LaCrO3 sintered in reducing atmosphere as well as LaCr0.7Ti0.3O3 sintered in air and in reducing atmosphere.",Effect of Ti substitution and atmosphere on sintering properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.113.353
6,15730,"Therefore, Ti substitution of Cr and sintering in reducing atmosphere have the same effect on suppression of CrO3 generation, which is harmful for sintering of LaCrO3.",Effect of Ti substitution and atmosphere on sintering properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.113.353
7,15730,"Microstructure observation revealed that grain growth of LaCrO3 sintered in air was pronounced, while that of LaCrO3 sintered in reducing atmosphere and LaCr0.8Ti0.2O3 sintered in air was negligible.",Effect of Ti substitution and atmosphere on sintering properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.113.353
8,15730,"Activation energy for shrinkage of LaCrO3 and LaCr0.95Ti0.05O3 sintered in reducing atmosphere was 262 kJ center dot mol(-1) and 153 kJ center dot mol(-1), While that of LaCr0.8Ti0.2O3 sintered in air was greater than those of LaCrO3 and LaCr0.95Ti0.05O3 sintered in reducing atmosphere.",Effect of Ti substitution and atmosphere on sintering properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.113.353
9,15730,The effect of Ti substitution on sintering of LaCrO3 should be different in rate controlling process from the effect of sintering under reducing atmosphere.,Effect of Ti substitution and atmosphere on sintering properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.113.353
