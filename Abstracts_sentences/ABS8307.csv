1,8307,"A short stack composed of six micro-tubular fuel cells was fabricated in order to study its electrochemical performance under different electrical connection configurations (parallel, series and parallel-series) at intermediate temperatures.",Electrochemical performance of a short tubular solid oxide fuel cell stack at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.179
2,8307,"Two cells were in the Ni-YSZ/YSZ/Pr2NiO4-YSZ system and four were in the Ni-YSZ/YSZ/Nd2NiO4-YSZ configuration, of which one failed following testing at 600 degrees C. Overall, individual cells had similar performance delivering 202, 302 and 340 mW/cm(2) at 600, 650 and 700 degrees C, respectively.",Electrochemical performance of a short tubular solid oxide fuel cell stack at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.179
3,8307,"The stack delivered a maximum of 7.40, 1032 and 11.56 W at these temperatures.",Electrochemical performance of a short tubular solid oxide fuel cell stack at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.179
4,8307,No significant differences were found among different arrangements.,Electrochemical performance of a short tubular solid oxide fuel cell stack at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.179
5,8307,"However, as expected, the stack performance was most affected by the malfunctioning cell under a series arrangement at 600 degrees C.",Electrochemical performance of a short tubular solid oxide fuel cell stack at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.179
6,8307,"Since the parallel-series configuration delivers an intermediate voltage and current and similar power to the parallel or series connections, it can be more suitable for stack assembly.",Electrochemical performance of a short tubular solid oxide fuel cell stack at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.179
7,8307,Such an arrangement also offers the possibility of replacement of a stack module in case a cell fails in that module during operation.,Electrochemical performance of a short tubular solid oxide fuel cell stack at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.179
8,8307,"A repairable fuel cell stack eliminates the negative economic impacts caused by a malfunctioning cell which, in extreme cases, can lead to the complete loss of the valuable energy conversion device.",Electrochemical performance of a short tubular solid oxide fuel cell stack at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.179
