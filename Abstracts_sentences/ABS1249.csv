3,1249,"Their sintering behavior (linear shrinkage, resulting porosity) and high temperature properties (oxidation resistance, electrical conductivity) were evaluated.",Stainless Steel/Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Composite Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003994
4,1249,Based on those results the best composition for composite supports was selected and fuel cells were fabricated.,Stainless Steel/Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Composite Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003994
5,1249,"Thin YSZ electrolytes were deposited on one side of the support and sintered at 1350 degrees C in pure hydrogen, while LNF (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3) cathodes were deposited on the top of the electrolyte and fired in situ at 800 degrees C.",Stainless Steel/Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Composite Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003994
6,1249,The fuel cells provided power density of about 80 mWcm(-2) at 800 degrees C.,Stainless Steel/Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Composite Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003994
7,1249,"It is worth noting that this performance was achieved without adding any catalytically active phases into composite support, while at the same time the supports exhibited relatively low porosity.",Stainless Steel/Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Composite Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003994
8,1249,This demonstrates that stainless steel can serve as an anode active material.,Stainless Steel/Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Composite Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003994
9,1249,"Degradation of this fuel cell was fast (12%/h), nonetheless its performance seems interesting for further investigation.",Stainless Steel/Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Composite Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4003994
