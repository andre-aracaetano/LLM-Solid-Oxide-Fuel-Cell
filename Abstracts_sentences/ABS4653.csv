4,4653,"The structure of the 20 wt% diopside doped silicate glass is stable at high temperatures with leakage rates less than 0.004 sccm center dot cm(-1), and no crystal except for diopside is found in XRD analysis after heating at 750 degrees C for 100 h. Excellent interface compatibility between the sealant and SUS430 interconnect was proved by SEM at 750 degrees C for 100 h. The above results prove the possibility of using glass-diopside composite sealing material for SOFC applications.",Glass-diopside composite sealing material for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.10.270
