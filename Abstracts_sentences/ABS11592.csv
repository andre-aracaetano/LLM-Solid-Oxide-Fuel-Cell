3,11592,"In this method a base layer of La0.8Sr0.2CrO3-delta was screen printed on NiO-YSZ substrate and a top layer of CaCrO4 was then coated and co-sintered at 1400 degrees C. CaCrO4 not only melts and fills the open pores in the base layer, but it also dissolves in it forming La1-x-ySrxCayCrO3-delta as a single layer.",In situ fabrication mechanism of a dense Sr and Ca doped lanthanum chromite interconnect on Ni-YSZ anode of a solid oxide fuel cell during co-sintering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.08.029
