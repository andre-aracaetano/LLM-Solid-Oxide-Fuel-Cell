1,1457,"The direct use of sulfur-containing coke to generate electricity has been studied by a transient approach that involves feeding a batch of coke samples to a Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode solid oxide fuel cell operating at 750 degrees C in flowing He, measuring the fuel cell performance, and monitoring the concentration of the exhaust gases with a mass spectrometer (MS) and a gas chromatograph (GC).",Direct Use of Sulfur-Containing Coke on a Ni-Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ef1016363
2,1457,"Feeding coke to the fuel cell produced current densities as high as 261 mA/cm(2) at a load of 0.56 V with the concomitant evolution of CO2, giving an energy efficiency (i.e., the ratio of the electric energy produced to the enthalpy of consumed fuel) of 52.9%, nearly 3 times higher than the efficiency resulting from feeding H-2 fuel.",Direct Use of Sulfur-Containing Coke on a Ni-Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ef1016363
3,1457,The volumetric three-phase boundary (TPB) length available at the Ni-YSZ anode for electrochemical oxidation of H-2 was estimated to be 4.1 x 10(12),Direct Use of Sulfur-Containing Coke on a Ni-Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ef1016363

5,1457,"Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the Ni-YSZ anode after the experiments in coke showed the absence of sulfur compounds, indicating that the sulfur-containing coke did not transfer any sulfur species that could cause poisoning to the anode surface.",Direct Use of Sulfur-Containing Coke on a Ni-Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ef1016363
6,1457,The fuel cell performance and energy efficiency results support the feasibility of direct power generation from coke in a Ni-YSZ anode solid oxide fuel cell.,Direct Use of Sulfur-Containing Coke on a Ni-Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ef1016363
