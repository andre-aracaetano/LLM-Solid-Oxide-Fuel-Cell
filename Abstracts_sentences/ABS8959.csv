1,8959,"This work aims to compare the effect of combined chromium and sulfur contaminating conditions to the Cr contamination alone on the Cr poisoning mechanisms in (La,Sr)MnO3-(Zr,Y)O-2 solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes.",Combined Cr and S poisoning in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.123
2,8959,"Whereas Cr2O3 and (Cr,Mn)(3)O-4 are found at active triple phase boundaries under the Cr-poisoning condition, the formation of SrCrO4 is promoted under combined Cr and S contaminating conditions, where Cr accumulations act as getters incorporating sulfur, to form Sr(Cr,S)O-4 compounds.",Combined Cr and S poisoning in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.123
3,8959,The identification of this phase is validated on the synthesized and simulated species by scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) techniques; its possible formation is predicted by thermodynamic analysis of the stability of perovskite compounds in the presence of combined Cr and S polluting conditions.,Combined Cr and S poisoning in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.123
4,8959,"In contrast, sulfur alone is not found to poison active sites in these composite cathodes.",Combined Cr and S poisoning in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.123
5,8959,"These findings suggest that the Cr poisoning degradation mechanism is altered when (La,Sr)MnO3 is exposed to Cr vapors in the presence of sulfur contamination; the access to electrochemical active sites may be hindered by the formation of Sr(Cr,S)O-4 in a similar manner to a Cr-getter effect in (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O-3 cathodes.",Combined Cr and S poisoning in solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.123
