1,2689,"One- and two-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) fed by an air-methane mixture (AMM) were studied at 550-700 degreesC. (Y2O3)(0.04)(Sc2O7)(0.06)(ZrO2)(0.9) was used as a solid electrolyte, ceria-doped Ni-YSZ-cermet (CNC) and SrO-doped LaMnO3 (LSM) were used as electrodes.",Zirconia-based SOFC with non-noble electrodes fed by air-methane mixture,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00395-7
2,2689,"In the experiments with the two-chamber cell, it was stated that the LSM-electrode did not catalyse methane partial oxidation and its potential was close to the potential of free oxygen mixed with methane and nitrogen.",Zirconia-based SOFC with non-noble electrodes fed by air-methane mixture,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00395-7
