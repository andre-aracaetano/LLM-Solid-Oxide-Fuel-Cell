1,18431,"A differential desorption technique, called intermittent temperature-programmed desorption (ITPD), was used to give new insights into the properties of La1-xSrxCo0.8Fe0.2O3 perovskites as a contribution to improve their performances with respect to various important application fields such as catalysis, electrocatalysis and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).",Intermittent temperature-programmed desorption study of perovskites used for catalytic purposes,10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.12.054
2,18431,"Both ITPD and interrupted TPD (carried out at different heating rates) evidenced two distinct oxygen adsorbed states, desorbing at temperatures lower than 400 degrees C, corresponding to less than 5% of a compact monolayer of oxide ions.",Intermittent temperature-programmed desorption study of perovskites used for catalytic purposes,10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.12.054
3,18431,"The first one, for low desorption temperatures (lower than 290 degrees C) exhibits a heat of adsorption (Delta H) distribution from 101 to 121 kJ mol(-1).",Intermittent temperature-programmed desorption study of perovskites used for catalytic purposes,10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.12.054
4,18431,"The second one, for higher desorption temperatures (between 290 and 400 degrees C) corresponds to Delta H = 146 +/- 4 kJ mol(-1).",Intermittent temperature-programmed desorption study of perovskites used for catalytic purposes,10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.12.054
5,18431,"Additionally, for temperatures higher than 400 degrees C, we observed a continuous desorption of oxygen species, probably originating from the subsurface or semi-bulk, with an associated activation energy of desorption >= 175 kJ mol(-1).",Intermittent temperature-programmed desorption study of perovskites used for catalytic purposes,10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.12.054
