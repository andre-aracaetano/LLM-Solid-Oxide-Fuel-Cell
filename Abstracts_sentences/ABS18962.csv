1,18962,The long-term stability was investigated at the porous La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d cathode/La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8 electrolyte interface by AC impedance under cathodic polarization at 800 degreesC. The interface resistance at La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d/La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8 increased with an operation duration time under a cathodic polarization of -0.033 V (applied voltage of -0.3 V).,Stability at La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d cathode/La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8 electrolyte interface under current flow for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00705-0
