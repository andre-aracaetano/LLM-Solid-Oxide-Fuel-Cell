1,19255,We report the durability of a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) with a record low initial area specific resistance (ASR) and a record low degradation rate.,Durability of high performance Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia supported solid oxide electrolysis cells at high current density,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.133
2,19255,"The cell consists of a Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cermet as support and active fuel electrode, a YSZ electrolyte, a gadolinia doped ceria (CGO) inter-diffusion barrier, and a strontium doped lanthanum cobaltite (LSC)-CGO composite oxygen electrode.",Durability of high performance Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia supported solid oxide electrolysis cells at high current density,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.133
3,19255,"The cell was tested at 800 degrees C and -1 A cm(-2) converting 31% of a 0.1:0.45:0.45 mixture of H-2:H2O:CO2 for approximately 2700 h, demonstrating an initial ASR of 200 m Omega cm(2) and a steady degradation rate of <= 12 mV (or 0.9%) per 1000 h. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study in situ changes in the electrochemical response of the cell and the retrieved data was treated to deconvolute resistive contributions from the physiochemical processes occurring within the cell.",Durability of high performance Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia supported solid oxide electrolysis cells at high current density,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.133
