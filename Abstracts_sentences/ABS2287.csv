3,2287,"In the same method, the oxygen ion conducting fuel cells with the yttria-stabilized zirconia as an electrolyte (YSZ cell) were also fabricated.",A high-performance ceramic composite anode for protonic ceramic fuel cells based on lanthanum strontium vanadate,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.219
4,2287,"At 973 K, the non-ohmic area specific resistance (ASR) of PCFC (0.09 Omega cm(2)) was much smaller than that of the YSZ cell (0.28 Omega cm(2)) although the protonic conductivity of BCZY-Zn was slightly smaller than the oxygen ion conductivity of YSZ.",A high-performance ceramic composite anode for protonic ceramic fuel cells based on lanthanum strontium vanadate,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.219
5,2287,"According to the analysis of the symmetric cells with BCZY-Zn as an electrolyte, the LSV-composite anode showed better performance than the LSF-composite cathode at low temperatures.",A high-performance ceramic composite anode for protonic ceramic fuel cells based on lanthanum strontium vanadate,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.03.219
