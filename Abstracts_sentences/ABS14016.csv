1,14016,Durability of a nickel and scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anode against toluene in hydrogen was evaluated in this paper.,A tolerance criterion for tar concentration in a model wood gas for a nickel/scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anode in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.005
2,14016,Anode deterioration was judged by the loss of elemental nickel from a surface of an anode.,A tolerance criterion for tar concentration in a model wood gas for a nickel/scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anode in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.005
3,14016,"Elemental nickel loss was observed when the toluene concentration was 3 or 10 g/Nm(3), steam to carbon ratio was 1, and current density was 0.5 A/cm(2) at both temperatures: 1073 K and 1173 K.",A tolerance criterion for tar concentration in a model wood gas for a nickel/scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anode in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.005
4,14016,Therefore the tolerance criterion must be less than 3 g/Nm(3) in hydrogen in the experimental conditions.,A tolerance criterion for tar concentration in a model wood gas for a nickel/scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anode in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.005
5,14016,"However, the deterioration can be mitigated to some extent by increasing the operating temperature, steam-to-carbon ratio, or current density.",A tolerance criterion for tar concentration in a model wood gas for a nickel/scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anode in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.005
6,14016,Anode deterioration was also mitigated when hydrogen concentration in the fuel gas was nearly identical to that of wood gas.,A tolerance criterion for tar concentration in a model wood gas for a nickel/scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anode in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.005
7,14016,The influence of hydrogen concentration in the fuel gas on deterioration may be substantial.,A tolerance criterion for tar concentration in a model wood gas for a nickel/scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anode in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.005
8,14016,The loss of elemental nickel could not be detected instantaneously by electrochemical diagnosis.,A tolerance criterion for tar concentration in a model wood gas for a nickel/scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anode in a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.005
