2,18859,"But when HTSE is coupled with different types of nuclear reactors, the coupled modes and materials selection of SOEC must be considered in order to achieve high overall thermal-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency.",Efficiency evaluation of high-temperature steam electrolytic systems coupled with different nuclear reactors,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.024
3,18859,"In this paper, we proposed two possible coupled modes between HTSE systems and the nuclear reactors.",Efficiency evaluation of high-temperature steam electrolytic systems coupled with different nuclear reactors,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.024
4,18859,"As for the nuclear reactor with high outlet temperature, the direct-coupled mode is a suitable choice while for the nuclear reactor with the outlet temperature of reactor lower than 650 degrees C an assistant electricity-heating mode could be adopted.",Efficiency evaluation of high-temperature steam electrolytic systems coupled with different nuclear reactors,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.024
5,18859,"To compare the overall thermal-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of two coupled modes, the simple energy flow charts for the water splitting cycle were presented and discussed.",Efficiency evaluation of high-temperature steam electrolytic systems coupled with different nuclear reactors,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.04.024
