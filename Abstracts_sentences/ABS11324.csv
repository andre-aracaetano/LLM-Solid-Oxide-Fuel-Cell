1,11324,"A series of strontium titanates-vanadates (STVN) with nominal cation composition Sr1-xTi1-y-zVyNizO3-delta (x = 0-0.04, y = 0.20-0.40 and z = 0.02-0.12) were prepared by a solid-state reaction route in 10% H-2-N-2 atmosphere and characterized under reducing conditions as potential fuel electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells.","Development of Ni-Sr(V,Ti)O3-δ Fuel Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/ma15010278
2,11324,Detailed phase evolution studies using XRD and SEM/EDS demonstrated that firing at temperatures as high as 1200 degrees C is required to eliminate undesirable secondary phases.,"Development of Ni-Sr(V,Ti)O3-δ Fuel Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/ma15010278
3,11324,"Under such conditions, nickel tends to segregate as a metallic phase and is unlikely to incorporate into the perovskite lattice.","Development of Ni-Sr(V,Ti)O3-δ Fuel Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/ma15010278
4,11324,"Ceramic samples sintered at 1500 degrees C exhibited temperature-activated electrical conductivity that showed a weak p(O-2) dependence and increased with vanadium content, reaching a maximum of ~17 S/cm at 1000 degrees C. STVN ceramics showed moderate thermal expansion coefficients (12.5-14.3 ppm/K at 25-1100 degrees C) compatible with that of yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ).","Development of Ni-Sr(V,Ti)O3-δ Fuel Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/ma15010278
5,11324,Porous STVN electrodes on 8YSZ solid electrolytes were fabricated at 1100 degrees C and studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at 700-900 degrees C in an atmosphere of diluted humidified H-2 under zero DC conditions.,"Development of Ni-Sr(V,Ti)O3-δ Fuel Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/ma15010278
6,11324,"As-prepared STVN electrodes demonstrated comparatively poor electrochemical performance, which was attributed to insufficient intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and agglomeration of metallic nickel during the high-temperature synthetic procedure.","Development of Ni-Sr(V,Ti)O3-δ Fuel Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/ma15010278
7,11324,Incorporation of an oxygen-ion-conducting Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta phase (20-30 wt.%) and nano-sized Ni as electrocatalyst (>= 1 wt.%) into the porous electrode structure via infiltration resulted in a substantial improvement in electrochemical activity and reduction of electrode polarization resistance by 6-8 times at 900 degrees C and >= one order of magnitude at 800 degrees C.,"Development of Ni-Sr(V,Ti)O3-δ Fuel Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/ma15010278
