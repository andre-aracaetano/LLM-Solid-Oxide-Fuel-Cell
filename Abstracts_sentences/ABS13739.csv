2,13739,"To understand the oxidation/corrosion behavior of metals and alloys under the dual exposures and assess their suitability, selected metals and alloys, including nickel, Fe-Cr and Ni-Cr based chromia forming alloys, alumina forming Fecralloy((R)), were investigated.",High temperature oxidation/corrosion behavior of metals and alloys under a hydrogen gradient,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.056
3,13739,It was found that the oxidation/corrosion behavior of metals and alloys in the presence of dual environment can be significantly different in terms of scale structure and/or chemistry from their exposure in a single oxidizing or reducing atmosphere.,High temperature oxidation/corrosion behavior of metals and alloys under a hydrogen gradient,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.056
4,13739,The anomalous oxidization/corrosion is attributed to the presence of hydrogen diffusion flux from the fuel side to the air side under the influence of a hydrogen gradient across the metallic substrates.,High temperature oxidation/corrosion behavior of metals and alloys under a hydrogen gradient,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.056
