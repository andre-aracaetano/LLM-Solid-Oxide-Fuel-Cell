1,444,"The paper reviews the state of the art of hydrogen storage systems based on magnesium hydride, emphasizing the role of thermal management, whose effectiveness depends on the effective thermal conductivity of the hydride, but also depends of other limiting factors such as wall contact resistance and convective exchanges with the heat transfer fluid.",Hydrogen storage systems based on magnesium hydride: from laboratory tests to fuel cell integration,10.1007/s00339-016-9646-1
2,444,"For daily cycles, the use of phase change material to store the heat of reaction appears to be the most effective solution.",Hydrogen storage systems based on magnesium hydride: from laboratory tests to fuel cell integration,10.1007/s00339-016-9646-1
3,444,"The integration with fuel cells (1 kWe proton exchange membrane fuel cell and solid oxide fuel cell) highlights the dynamic behaviour of these systems, which is related to the thermodynamic properties of MgH2.",Hydrogen storage systems based on magnesium hydride: from laboratory tests to fuel cell integration,10.1007/s00339-016-9646-1
4,444,This allows for self-adaptive systems that do not require control of the hydrogen flow rate at the inlet of the fuel cell.,Hydrogen storage systems based on magnesium hydride: from laboratory tests to fuel cell integration,10.1007/s00339-016-9646-1
