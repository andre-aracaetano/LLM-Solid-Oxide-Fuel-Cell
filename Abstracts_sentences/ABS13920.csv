1,13920,"Master sintering curves (MSCs) were constructed for tape cast NiO, YSZ and NiO/YSZ composite materials using apparent activation energies obtained through dilatometry experiments.",Determination of the Activation Energy and Master Sintering Curve for NiO/YSZ Composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1111/jace.13405
2,13920,A rule of mixtures approach was demonstrated to be a useful analysis tool in understanding the activation energy of the NiO/YSZ composites since NiO and YSZ do not affect the sintering of the other phase.,Determination of the Activation Energy and Master Sintering Curve for NiO/YSZ Composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1111/jace.13405
3,13920,Prediction of the 48vol% NiO composite was less accurate because of competing sintering modes near the percolation threshold.,Determination of the Activation Energy and Master Sintering Curve for NiO/YSZ Composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes,10.1111/jace.13405
