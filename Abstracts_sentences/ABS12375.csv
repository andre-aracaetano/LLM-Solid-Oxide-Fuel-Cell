1,12375,"Intermediate and low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operated below 800 degrees C have attracted tremendous interest for their low component cost, preferable chemical compatibility of the components and considerable stability.",A promising Ruddlesden-Popper oxide cathode for both proton-conducting and oxygen ionic-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2re00213b
2,12375,"In this paper, a Ruddlesden-Popper oxide with the composition of Nd1.8La0.2Ni0.74Cu0.21Ga0.05O4+delta (NLNCG) is developed as a cathode for intermediate and low-temperature SOFCs.",A promising Ruddlesden-Popper oxide cathode for both proton-conducting and oxygen ionic-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2re00213b
3,12375,NLNCG exhibits good chemical compatibility with both protonic electrolyte (BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb)) and oxygen ionic electrolyte (Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (GDC)).,A promising Ruddlesden-Popper oxide cathode for both proton-conducting and oxygen ionic-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2re00213b
4,12375,"Also, NLNCG can be applied as a cathode with low polarization resistance in both O-SOFCs based on GDC electrolyte and H-SOFCs based on BZCYYb electrolyte.",A promising Ruddlesden-Popper oxide cathode for both proton-conducting and oxygen ionic-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2re00213b
5,12375,"In particular, the peak power density (PPD) of the cell NiO-BZCYYb|BZCYYb|NLNCG with an anode-supported configuration is 1.264 W cm(-2) and the polarization resistance is 0.045 omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Therefore, NLNCG is a promising cathode for intermediate and low-temperature SOFCs.",A promising Ruddlesden-Popper oxide cathode for both proton-conducting and oxygen ionic-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d2re00213b
