1,3654,"Solid Oxide Cells (SOC) are the kind of electrochemical devices that provide reversible, dual mode operation, where electricity is generated in a fuel cell mode and fuel is produced in an electrolysis mode.",Fabrication and Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/en15103536
2,3654,"Our current work encompasses the design, fabrication, and performance analysis of a micro-tubular reversible SOC that is prepared through a single dip-coating technique with multiple dips using conventional materials.",Fabrication and Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/en15103536
3,3654,"Electrochemical impedance and current-voltage responses were monitored from 700 to 800 degrees C. Maximum power densities of the cell achieved at 800, 750, and 700 degrees C, was 690, 546, and 418 mW cm(-2), respectively.",Fabrication and Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/en15103536
4,3654,"The reversible, dual mode operation of the SOC was evaluated by operating the cell using 50% H2O/H-2 and ambient air.",Fabrication and Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/en15103536
5,3654,"Accordingly, when the SOC was operated in the electrolysis mode at 1.3 V (the thermo-neutral voltage for steam electrolysis), current densities of -311, -487 and -684 mA cm(-2) at 700, 750 and 800 degrees C, respectively, were observed.",Fabrication and Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/en15103536
6,3654,Hydrogen production rate was determined based on the current developed in the cell during the electrolysis operation.,Fabrication and Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/en15103536
7,3654,"The stability of the cell was further evaluated by performing multiple transitions between fuel cell mode and electrolysis mode at 700 degrees C for a period of 500 h. In the stability test, the cell current decreased from 353 mA cm(-2) to 243 mA cm(-2) in the fuel cell mode operation at 0.7 V, while the same decreased from -250 mA",Fabrication and Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Cells,10.3390/en15103536
