1,18688,La2NiO4+delta-based materials with a layered perovskite structure have attracted significant attention as air-electrode materials for use in solid oxide fuel cells.,Effects of Ca substitution on the local structure and oxide-ion behavior of layered perovskite lanthanum nickelate,10.3389/fmats.2022.954729
2,18688,"In particular, Ca-substituted materials, La2-xCaxNiO4+delta, have been investigated, as the partial substitution of La with Ca can improve oxide-ion conduction in crystals.",Effects of Ca substitution on the local structure and oxide-ion behavior of layered perovskite lanthanum nickelate,10.3389/fmats.2022.954729
3,18688,"However, the local structures around the conducting oxide ion and Ca dopant are not been well understood because their distributions cannot be characterized by a general structure analysis only using Bragg peaks.",Effects of Ca substitution on the local structure and oxide-ion behavior of layered perovskite lanthanum nickelate,10.3389/fmats.2022.954729
4,18688,"Therefore, we examine the atomic structure of La1.75Ca0.25NiO4+delta by a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and a reverse Monte Carlo modeling using the Faber-Ziman structure factor, real-space function, and the Bragg profile simultaneously.",Effects of Ca substitution on the local structure and oxide-ion behavior of layered perovskite lanthanum nickelate,10.3389/fmats.2022.954729
5,18688,The results indicate that conducting oxide ions are introduced into rocksalt layers in the crystal and are present around La but not Ca.,Effects of Ca substitution on the local structure and oxide-ion behavior of layered perovskite lanthanum nickelate,10.3389/fmats.2022.954729
6,18688,"Furthermore, it is found that ionic diffusion is accompanied by a change in the rocksalt layer volume, which can be suppressed by the partial substitution with Ca.",Effects of Ca substitution on the local structure and oxide-ion behavior of layered perovskite lanthanum nickelate,10.3389/fmats.2022.954729
7,18688,This can be regarded as a major reason why Ca substitution improves oxide-ion diffusion in the La2NiO4+delta layered perovskite.,Effects of Ca substitution on the local structure and oxide-ion behavior of layered perovskite lanthanum nickelate,10.3389/fmats.2022.954729
