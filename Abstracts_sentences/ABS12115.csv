1,12115,"Thr performance of a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was studied between 350 and 900 degrees C in flowing mixtures of methane, ethane, propane, or liquefied petroleum gas and air with a fuel/air volume ratio of one, where their oxidation proceeded safely without explosion.",Single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures with various hydrocarbon-air mixtures,10.1149/1.1393621
2,12115,"Among all tested electrode materials, Ni-Ce(0.8)Sm(0.2)O(1.9) cermet and Sm(0.5)Sr(0.5)CoO(3) oxide functioned best as the anode and cathode, respectively, in various gas mixtures.",Single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures with various hydrocarbon-air mixtures,10.1149/1.1393621
3,12115,A cell constructed from a La(0.9)Sr(0.1)Ga(0.8)Mg(0.2)O(3) electrolyte with the two electrodes generated >900 mV in a methane-air mixture between 600 and 800 degrees C and in an ethane-air mixture between 450 and 650 degrees C. A small electrode reaction resistance resulted in increasing power density with decreasing electrolyte thickness.,Single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells at intermediate temperatures with various hydrocarbon-air mixtures,10.1149/1.1393621
