2,14714,bilayers were fabricated by removing NiO with a reduction-acid leaching method using NiO-YSZ/10ScSZ-1CeO(2) half cells that were prepared by dry-pressing.,Fabrication and Performance of Direct Methane SOFC with a Cu-CeO2-Based Anode,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20100323
3,14714,"By allowing Cc and Cu nitrate solutions to infiltrate the porous YSZ matrix, single cells of Cu-CeO2-YSZ/10ScSZ-1CeO(2)/LSCF (LSCF: La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta) were fabricated.",Fabrication and Performance of Direct Methane SOFC with a Cu-CeO2-Based Anode,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20100323
4,14714,The cell's structure was characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM).,Fabrication and Performance of Direct Methane SOFC with a Cu-CeO2-Based Anode,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20100323
5,14714,"Results showed that the porous YSZ matrix of the YSZ/10ScSZ-1CeO(2) bilayers prepared by the reduction-acid leaching method was of high porosity (more than 64%) and it was highly connected, which was beneficial for the introduction of Cc and Cu nitrate by infiltration.",Fabrication and Performance of Direct Methane SOFC with a Cu-CeO2-Based Anode,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20100323
6,14714,"The 10ScSZ-1CeO(2), electrolyte film with a thickness of 30 mu m was dense and pinhole-free.",Fabrication and Performance of Direct Methane SOFC with a Cu-CeO2-Based Anode,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20100323
7,14714,"A single cell composed of Cu-CeO2-YSZ/10ScSZ-1CeO(2)/LSCF showed excellent generation performance with maximum power densities of 0.29 and 0.09 W.cm(-2) at 650 degrees C, as well as 0.48 and 0.21 W.cm(-2) at 700 degrees C using moist hydrogen and methane as fuel, respectively.",Fabrication and Performance of Direct Methane SOFC with a Cu-CeO2-Based Anode,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20100323
8,14714,"This excellent performance is attributed to the electrolyte's small ohmic resistance, small cathode polarization resistance, and favorable anode microstructure.",Fabrication and Performance of Direct Methane SOFC with a Cu-CeO2-Based Anode,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20100323
