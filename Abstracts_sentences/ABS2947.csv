1,2947,The aim of this study is the development and testing of a control system for solid oxide fuel cell hybrid systems through dynamic simulations.,Solid oxide fuel cell hybrid system: Control strategy for stand-alone configurations,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.029
2,2947,"Due to the complexity of these cycles, several parameters, such as the turbine rotational speed, the temperatures within the fuel cell, the differential pressure between the anodic and the cathodic side and the Steam-To-Carbon Ratio need to be monitored and kept within safe limits.",Solid oxide fuel cell hybrid system: Control strategy for stand-alone configurations,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.029
3,2947,"Furthermore, in stand-alone conditions the system response to load variations is required to meet the global plant power demand at any time, supporting global load variations and avoiding dangerous or unstable conditions.",Solid oxide fuel cell hybrid system: Control strategy for stand-alone configurations,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.029
4,2947,The plant component models and their integration were carried out in previous studies.,Solid oxide fuel cell hybrid system: Control strategy for stand-alone configurations,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.029
5,2947,"This paper focuses on the control strategy required for managing the net electrical power from the system, avoiding malfunctions or damage.",Solid oxide fuel cell hybrid system: Control strategy for stand-alone configurations,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.029
6,2947,"Once the control system was developed and tuned, its performance was evaluated by simulating the transient behaviour of the whole hybrid cycle: the results for several operating conditions are presented and discussed.",Solid oxide fuel cell hybrid system: Control strategy for stand-alone configurations,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.029
