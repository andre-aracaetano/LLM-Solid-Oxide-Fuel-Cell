2,12498,The LSV-based anodes are chemically and electrochemically stable under SOFC operating conditions.,A solid oxide fuel cell operating on hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur-containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.03.061
3,12498,"Furthermore, they appear to be active towards the preferential oxidation of H2S over hydrogen, as suggested by open circuit voltage, impedance spectra, and cell performance measurements using various H2S and H-2 fuel mixtures.",A solid oxide fuel cell operating on hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur-containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.03.061
4,12498,A system with configuration LSV/YSZ/LSM-YSZ showed a maximum power density of 90 mW/cm(2) at 220 mA/cm(2) with a 5% H2S-95% N-2 fuel mixture at 1273 K.,A solid oxide fuel cell operating on hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur-containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.03.061
5,12498,This same cell configuration showed a maximum power density of 135mW/cm(2) at 280mA/cm(2) when the fuel was a 5% H2S-95% H-2 mixture at 1273K. Cell performances were stable and showed no significant deterioration during a 48 h period.,A solid oxide fuel cell operating on hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur-containing fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.03.061
