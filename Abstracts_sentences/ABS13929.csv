1,13929,"Eight (8) mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), an electrolyte material for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), has been deposited onto porous non-conducting NiO-YSZ substrate using electrophoretic deposition technique (EPD) from a stable non-aqueous suspension of YSZ.",Electrophoretic Deposition of Thin Film Zirconia Electrolyte on Non-conducting NiO-YSZ Substrate,10.1080/0371750X.2014.922701
2,13929,"Normally, EPD cannot be performed on a non-conducting substrate, but, in this present study, YSZ particulate film has been successfully deposited on a non-conducting NiO-YSZ substrate following two different EPD approaches:(a) using a conducting metallic plate on the reverse side of the porous NiO-YSZ anode substrate and (b) using a conducting polymer coated NiO-YSZ substrate.",Electrophoretic Deposition of Thin Film Zirconia Electrolyte on Non-conducting NiO-YSZ Substrate,10.1080/0371750X.2014.922701

5,13929,"La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM), a cathode for SOFC, is then screen-printed onto the electrolyte layer of such sintered half cells (anode+electrolyte) prepared by both the above approaches to construct SOFC single cells.",Electrophoretic Deposition of Thin Film Zirconia Electrolyte on Non-conducting NiO-YSZ Substrate,10.1080/0371750X.2014.922701
6,13929,A maximum output power density of 0.37 W.cm(-2) is obtained using single cells prepared by conducting metallic plate assisted EPD compared to that of 0.73 W.cm(-2) for polymer coated at 800 degrees C using H-2 as fuel and O-2 as oxidant.,Electrophoretic Deposition of Thin Film Zirconia Electrolyte on Non-conducting NiO-YSZ Substrate,10.1080/0371750X.2014.922701
