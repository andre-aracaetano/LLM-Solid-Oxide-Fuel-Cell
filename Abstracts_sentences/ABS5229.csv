1,5229,The kinetics of catalytic steam reforming of methane over an Ni-YSZ anode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) have been investigated with the cell placed in a stack configuration.,Methane Steam Reforming over an Ni-YSZ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode in Stack Configuration,10.1155/2014/710391
2,5229,"In order to decrease the degree of conversion, a single cell stack with reduced area was used.",Methane Steam Reforming over an Ni-YSZ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode in Stack Configuration,10.1155/2014/710391
3,5229,Measurements were performed in the temperature range 600-800 degrees C and the partial pressures of all reactants and products were varied.,Methane Steam Reforming over an Ni-YSZ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode in Stack Configuration,10.1155/2014/710391
4,5229,The obtained rates could be well fitted with a power law expression (r proportional to P-CH4(0.7)).,Methane Steam Reforming over an Ni-YSZ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode in Stack Configuration,10.1155/2014/710391
5,5229,A simple model is presented which is capable of predicting the methane conversion in a stack configuration from intrinsic kinetics of the anode support material.,Methane Steam Reforming over an Ni-YSZ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode in Stack Configuration,10.1155/2014/710391
6,5229,"The predictions are compared with the stack measurements presented here, and good agreement is observed.",Methane Steam Reforming over an Ni-YSZ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode in Stack Configuration,10.1155/2014/710391
