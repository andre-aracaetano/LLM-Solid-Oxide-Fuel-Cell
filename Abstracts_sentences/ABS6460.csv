2,6460,"A layer (<100 mu m) of GDC electrolyte powders was first spread on a circular piece of filter paper cut at the die punch diameter size, then put on a relatively thick, porous NiO-GDC anode powder before CSP.",Effect of cold sintering on the sintering shrinkage matching of NiO-GDC anode with GDC electrolytes in making anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116512
3,6460,"The bi-layer was first cold-sintered at room temperature (RT), a very rare case in the literature, and then post-sintered at 1100 degrees C, which was much lower than the ones reported in the literature by using conventional furnaces.",Effect of cold sintering on the sintering shrinkage matching of NiO-GDC anode with GDC electrolytes in making anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2024.116512
