1,17942,Electrochemical behavior of the oxygen reduction reaction on La0.72Sr0.18MnO3/Y2O3-ZrO2 (LSM/YSZ) composite and Gd-doped CeO2 (GDC)-impregnated LSM electrodes was investigated in the absence and presence of a Fe-Cr alloy at 900 degrees C in air.,"Transition behavior for O2 reduction reaction on (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ composite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2357712
2,17942,"The results indicate that for the O-2 reduction on the LSM-based composite electrodes there is an electrochemical transition from a dominant electronic conducting LSM electrode to that of the mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) oxide such as (La, Sr)(Co, Fe)O-3 (LSCF) as the YSZ content in the LSM/YSZ composites increases.","Transition behavior for O2 reduction reaction on (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ composite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2357712
3,17942,Such a transition occurs at a YSZ content well below the percolation limit of the ionic connectivity of the LSM/YSZ composites.,"Transition behavior for O2 reduction reaction on (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ composite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2357712
4,17942,This indicates that addition/impregnation of ionic conducting phases such as YSZ and GDC not only enhances the three phase boundary but also significantly promotes the surface exchange processes for the O-2 reduction reaction on the LSM-based composite cathodes.,"Transition behavior for O2 reduction reaction on (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ composite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.2357712
