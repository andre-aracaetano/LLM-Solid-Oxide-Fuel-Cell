1,15478,"Mesoporous ceria loaded with 0.06-0.93 wt% iridium was synthesized in one step by the ambient air combustion of an aqueous solution of ceric ammonium nitrate, ammonium hexachloroiridate, and glycine fuel.",Ultrastable iridium-ceria nanopowders synthesized in one step by solution combustion for catalytic hydrogen production,10.1039/c4ta04820b
2,15478,"The structural properties of the powders, and the influence of such parameters as Ir loading and thermochemical post-treatments, were investigated combining aberration-corrected HRTEM, SEM, in situ XRD, XPS, DRIFTS, and Raman spectroscopy.",Ultrastable iridium-ceria nanopowders synthesized in one step by solution combustion for catalytic hydrogen production,10.1039/c4ta04820b
3,15478,"The materials, which appeared spongy at the micrometer scale, exhibited ca.",Ultrastable iridium-ceria nanopowders synthesized in one step by solution combustion for catalytic hydrogen production,10.1039/c4ta04820b
4,15478,30 nm-sized ceria crystallites with a layered structure at the nanoscale.,Ultrastable iridium-ceria nanopowders synthesized in one step by solution combustion for catalytic hydrogen production,10.1039/c4ta04820b
5,15478,"After reducing treatments, Ir nanoparticles anchored at the surface of ceria grains were identified, and their size (ca.",Ultrastable iridium-ceria nanopowders synthesized in one step by solution combustion for catalytic hydrogen production,10.1039/c4ta04820b
6,15478,"2 nm) did not evolve upon further heating at up to 900 degrees C. A detailed picture of the Ir-CeO2 interface could be established, with the presence of Irx(+)-O2--Ce3+ entities along with oxygen vacancies.",Ultrastable iridium-ceria nanopowders synthesized in one step by solution combustion for catalytic hydrogen production,10.1039/c4ta04820b
7,15478,"The powders loaded with only 0.1 wt% Ir were successfully employed as catalysts for the production of hydrogen from methane and water in low-steam conditions at 750 degrees C. Due to their higher Ir dispersion and stronger Ir-CeO2 interaction, the combustion-synthesized materials outperformed their conventionally prepared counterparts in terms of activity and stability, making them promising as active catalytic layers for solid-oxide fuel cells integrating the gradual internal reforming concept.",Ultrastable iridium-ceria nanopowders synthesized in one step by solution combustion for catalytic hydrogen production,10.1039/c4ta04820b
