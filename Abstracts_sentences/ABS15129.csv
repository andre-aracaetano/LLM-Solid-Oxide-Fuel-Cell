6,15129,The catalyst bed is considered as porous material with chemical reactions as internal source terms of species transport equations and energy transport equation.,Heat transfer analysis of a tube-in-tube steam reformer for the application of MGT-SOFC hybrid process,10.1080/10407782.2024.2323169
7,15129,"Since the heat transfer into the reformer tubes in the real operating environment is subject to different mechanisms (predominantly convection) than that in a furnace (predominantly thermal radiation), only the parameters on the side of the catalyst bed tuned by the single-tube experiment could be retained for the numerical model of the tube-in-tube concept, which leads to a semi-validated model.",Heat transfer analysis of a tube-in-tube steam reformer for the application of MGT-SOFC hybrid process,10.1080/10407782.2024.2323169
8,15129,"Based on this semi-validated model, the performance (such as temperature distribution, conversion rate of the products, etc.) and the applicability of a tube-in-tube reformer concept, considering the variation of boundary conditions, were investigated and evaluated.",Heat transfer analysis of a tube-in-tube steam reformer for the application of MGT-SOFC hybrid process,10.1080/10407782.2024.2323169
