2,8909,LCA is a technique assessing the environmental aspects associated with a system during its entire life cycle.,Environmental impact assessment of a solid-oxide fuel-cell-based combined-heat-and-power-generation system,10.1016/j.energy.2014.11.035
3,8909,"To calculate the environmental impact of the analyzed system, a commercial software package, SimaPro version 73.3., was used; the ReCiPe method, endpoint approach, and the hierarchist's perspective were selected for calculating the values.",Environmental impact assessment of a solid-oxide fuel-cell-based combined-heat-and-power-generation system,10.1016/j.energy.2014.11.035
4,8909,"The calculation results reveal that the manufacturing stage and the disposal stage have small contributions to the total environmental impact, which just cover 2.1%-9.5% and 0.1%-0.6% of the total, respectively, depending on the assumption made for the lifetime of the SOFC stack and the overall system.",Environmental impact assessment of a solid-oxide fuel-cell-based combined-heat-and-power-generation system,10.1016/j.energy.2014.11.035
5,8909,The SOFC stack is a dominant contributor to the environmental impact associated with manufacturing; 72% of the total environmental impact of manufacturing comes from the SOFC stack; the remaining balance-of-plant (BOP) components account for 28% of the total environmental impact.,Environmental impact assessment of a solid-oxide fuel-cell-based combined-heat-and-power-generation system,10.1016/j.energy.2014.11.035
