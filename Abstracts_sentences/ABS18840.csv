3,18840,Dense SDC films were deposited on porous NiO-SDC substrates by a dry-pressing technique followed by co-firing at 1400 degrees C for 5 h. Hydrogen permeability of the asymmetric micron-scale thick SDC films was evaluated for the first time.,Considerable Hydrogen Permeation Behavior through a Dense Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ (SDC) Asymmetric Thick Film,10.1149/2.073306jes
4,18840,"The dependence of the hydrogen permeation flux on film thickness, operating temperature and hydrogen chemical gradient was investigated.",Considerable Hydrogen Permeation Behavior through a Dense Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ (SDC) Asymmetric Thick Film,10.1149/2.073306jes
5,18840,It was found that bulk diffusion is the rate-limiting factor for hydrogen permeation through the SDC film.,Considerable Hydrogen Permeation Behavior through a Dense Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ (SDC) Asymmetric Thick Film,10.1149/2.073306jes
6,18840,"The proton conductivity of the SDC film was also estimated according to Wagner equation, and varied from 3.03 x 10(-6) to 1.09 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) at 950 degrees C with the feed gas ranging from 20% H-2/N-2 to 80% H-2/N-2.",Considerable Hydrogen Permeation Behavior through a Dense Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ (SDC) Asymmetric Thick Film,10.1149/2.073306jes
