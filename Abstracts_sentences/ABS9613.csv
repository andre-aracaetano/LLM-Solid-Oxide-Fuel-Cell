1,9613,"The 3-D backbones with ionic conductivity are first built by sintering Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 silks, then Ca3Co2O6 nanoparticles as electrocatalyst are filled in by infiltrating ionic solution, as a result, a hybrid electrode with hierarchical structure is constructed as the cathode of solid oxide fuel cells.",A HIERARCHICAL HYBRID ELECTRODE FOR RAPID OXYGEN REDUCTION REACTION BELOW 800 째C,10.2298/TSCI2004455L
2,9613,"Compared with the single-phase Ca3Co2O6 bulk cathode and common Ca3Co2O6-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite one, this hybrid electrode is very active for oxygen reduction reaction.",A HIERARCHICAL HYBRID ELECTRODE FOR RAPID OXYGEN REDUCTION REACTION BELOW 800 째C,10.2298/TSCI2004455L
3,9613,"At 800 degrees C, area specific resistance with this cathode is reduced to 0.062 Omega cm(2), and power density peak with the electrolyte-supported single-cell is promoted to 760 mW/cm(2).",A HIERARCHICAL HYBRID ELECTRODE FOR RAPID OXYGEN REDUCTION REACTION BELOW 800 째C,10.2298/TSCI2004455L
4,9613,The superior catalytical activity is attributed to the enlarged area for surface oxygen exchange kinetics and enhanced ionic transport behaviour.,A HIERARCHICAL HYBRID ELECTRODE FOR RAPID OXYGEN REDUCTION REACTION BELOW 800 째C,10.2298/TSCI2004455L
