1,5518,Glass-ceramic sealants are commonly used as joining materials for planar solid oxide fuel cells stacks.,Reinforced composite sealants for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.002
2,5518,"Several requirements need to be fulfilled by these materials: beside of electrical insulation and appropriate thermal expansion, a good adhesion on the ceramic and metallic components of a SOFC stack is necessary to form a gas-tight joint.",Reinforced composite sealants for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.002
3,5518,"Even though the joining process might have been successful, failures and leaks often occur during the stack operation due to fracture of the brittle material under thermal stresses or during thermal cycling of the components.",Reinforced composite sealants for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.002
4,5518,"This study focusses on composite materials consisting of a glass matrix based on the system of BaO-CaO-SiO2 and various filler materials, e.g. yttria-stabilized zirconia fibres or particles and silver particles.",Reinforced composite sealants for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.002
5,5518,"In order to evaluate a possible reinforcing influence of the filler material of the composite, tensile strength tests were carried out on circular butt joints.",Reinforced composite sealants for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.002
6,5518,"The highest strength values were found for the composite material with addition of silver particles, followed by the glass matrix itself without any filler addition and the lowest values were measured for the composite with YSZ particles.",Reinforced composite sealants for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.002
7,5518,SEM investigations of cross-sections of the joints elucidated these results by the microstructure of the glass-ceramic sealants.,Reinforced composite sealants for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.002
