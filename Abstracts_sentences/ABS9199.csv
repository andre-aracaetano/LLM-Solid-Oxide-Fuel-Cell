1,9199,Cerium oxide catalysts for fuel cells application were synthesized via precipitation and modified precipitation routes where the effect of H2O2 and/or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) addition in the precipitation step has been investigated.,Dry reforming of methane on ceria prepared by modified precipitation route,10.1016/j.apcata.2015.01.024
2,9199,"Microstructure and reduction-reoxidation properties of the oxides were analyzed by XRD, adsorption-desorption isotherms of N-2 at -196 degrees C, TG-DTA, Raman, SEM, TPR-H-2, TPR-CH4 and TPO.",Dry reforming of methane on ceria prepared by modified precipitation route,10.1016/j.apcata.2015.01.024
3,9199,The catalytic properties of CeO2 samples were investigated in dry reforming of methane (DRM) between 750 and 900 degrees C under both stoichiometric (CH4 and CO2 in equal amounts) and oxidizing (excess of CO2 with respect to CH4) conditions.,Dry reforming of methane on ceria prepared by modified precipitation route,10.1016/j.apcata.2015.01.024
4,9199,A material exploitable for applications in catalysis and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was obtained by modifying the precipitation route via the addition of H2O2 (CeO2_H2O2).,Dry reforming of methane on ceria prepared by modified precipitation route,10.1016/j.apcata.2015.01.024
5,9199,"Compared to materials synthesized conventionally or by using CTAB, CeO2_H2O2 exhibited the best thermal stability, least surface loss under high temperatures operation (e.g. 900 degrees C), superior stability with respect to bulk redox properties when alternating between oxidizing and reducing treatments,,and highest catalytic activity and resistance to deposition of graphitic carbon.",Dry reforming of methane on ceria prepared by modified precipitation route,10.1016/j.apcata.2015.01.024
