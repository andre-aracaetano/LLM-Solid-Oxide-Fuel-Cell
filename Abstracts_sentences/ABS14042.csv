1,14042,"This paper describes self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) of an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel (SOFC), in comparison to a conventional solid-state reaction method (SRM).",Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3-δ for electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.05.003
2,14042,"Doped-lanthanum gallate: La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM9182) and LSGM9173 as the SOFC electrolyte, was prepared by the SHS and sintered at different temperatures, for measuring the electrical conductivity of the sintered LSGM and the power generating performance at 1073 K, in comparison to the SRM.",Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3-δ for electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.05.003
3,14042,"In the SHS, the LSGM powders with smaller size were obtained and easily sintered at the 100 K-lower temperature, 1673 K, than in the SRM.",Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3-δ for electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.05.003
4,14042,"Most significantly, the electrical conductivity of the sintered LSGM9182 was as high as 0.11 S cm(-1) and its maximum power density was a value of 245 mW cm(-2) in the cell configuration of Ni/LSGM9182 (0.501 mm in thickness)/Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3.",Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3-δ for electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.05.003
5,14042,"The conclusion was that the proposed SHS-sintering method with many benefits of minimizing the energy requirement and the processing time in the production, easing temperature restriction for the sintering, and improving the electrolyte performance up to a conventional level is practicable for producing the LSGM-electrolyte of SOFC at an intermediate-temperature application.",Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of La(Sr)Ga(Mg)O3-δ for electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.05.003
