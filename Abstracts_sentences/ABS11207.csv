3,11207,"In this study, we have examined the carbon formed in-situ under operating conditions, and investigated the effects of current density, time, and anode thickness on both the amount and type of carbon formed at 1073 K using temperature programmed oxidation and scanning electron microscopy.",Effect of anodic polarization on carbon deposition on Ni/YSZ anodes exposed to methane,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.12.039
4,11207,The carbon formed under operating conditions was more reactive and contained hydrogen compared to the carbon formed at open circuit potential that did not contain hydrogen.,Effect of anodic polarization on carbon deposition on Ni/YSZ anodes exposed to methane,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.12.039
5,11207,"When the current density was increased less carbon was deposited, but the characteristics of the carbon did not change.",Effect of anodic polarization on carbon deposition on Ni/YSZ anodes exposed to methane,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.12.039
6,11207,"With increasing time and/or anode thickness, the carbon deposits became more difficult to remove and decreased in hydrogen content.",Effect of anodic polarization on carbon deposition on Ni/YSZ anodes exposed to methane,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.12.039
