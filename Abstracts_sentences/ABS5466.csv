1,5466,"Ni-LnO(x) (Ln = Dy, Ho, Er, Yb and Tb) cermets are investigated as the anodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells using ceria-based electrolyte to seek insights into the properties and electrocatalytic activity of these lanthanide oxides, whose oxygen ion conductivity is negligible.","Ni-LnOx (Ln = Dy, Ho, Er, Yb and Tb) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2011.05.117
2,5466,"They have displayed similar electrochemical activity which is comparable to, if not higher than, those of the commonly Ni-doped ceria cermets.","Ni-LnOx (Ln = Dy, Ho, Er, Yb and Tb) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2011.05.117
3,5466,The anode performance has been found to depend strongly on cermet composition and porosity.,"Ni-LnOx (Ln = Dy, Ho, Er, Yb and Tb) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2011.05.117
4,5466,"Temperature programmed reduction study and EIS analysis under different hydrogen partial pressure suggest that the catalytic activity of the Ni-LnO(x) cermets might be originated from the hydrogen adsorption ability on the LnO(x) surface, promoting hydrogen spillover process, and consequently enhancing the electrochemical oxidation of the fuel.","Ni-LnOx (Ln = Dy, Ho, Er, Yb and Tb) cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2011.05.117
