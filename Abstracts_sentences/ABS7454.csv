1,7454,Layered perovskite-related GdBaFe2O5+delta (GBF) and GdBaFeCoO5+delta (GBFC) oxides are systematically studied as advanced air electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,"A highly operating stability, oxygen reduction reaction active and CO2/Cr tolerance perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166119
2,7454,"The characterizations of the samples are gauged with the assistance of a variety of techniques, involving X-ray diffractometer (XRD), O-2-temperature programmed desorption (O-2-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR).","A highly operating stability, oxygen reduction reaction active and CO2/Cr tolerance perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166119
3,7454,"Results of XRD demonstrate that GBFC has the exact same crystal structure as that of GBF, which displays slight lattice shrinkage.","A highly operating stability, oxygen reduction reaction active and CO2/Cr tolerance perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166119
4,7454,"Substitution of Co for Fe increases the TEC from 9.87 x 10(-6) K-1 and 16.6 x 10(-6) K-1 at 150-700 degrees C. GBFC shows the highest conductivity of 500 S cm(-1) at 520 degrees C, which complies with the requirement for the cathode of the fuel cell.","A highly operating stability, oxygen reduction reaction active and CO2/Cr tolerance perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166119
5,7454,"The polarization resistance (R-p) values of GBF and GBFC are 0.33 omega cm(2) and 0.07 omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C, respectively.","A highly operating stability, oxygen reduction reaction active and CO2/Cr tolerance perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166119
6,7454,"Moreover, a single cell based on Sm0.8Ce0.2O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte-supported is indicative of a peak power density of 0.28 W cm(-2) for GBFC cathode at 700 degrees C.","A highly operating stability, oxygen reduction reaction active and CO2/Cr tolerance perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166119
7,7454,"This single cell also exhibits a superior operational stability utilizing dry hydrogen fuel at 600 degrees C during the tested 220 h. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and relaxation time distribution (DRT) results are suggestive of the slowly decreasing oxygen reduction kinetics of GBFC cathode with the introduction of CO2 or gaseous Cr species, which may be connected with the formation of carbonate or Cr depositions.","A highly operating stability, oxygen reduction reaction active and CO2/Cr tolerance perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166119
8,7454,"Compared to classic materials, GBFC cathode shows very good electrochemical stability and CO2/Cr tolerance.","A highly operating stability, oxygen reduction reaction active and CO2/Cr tolerance perovskite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166119
