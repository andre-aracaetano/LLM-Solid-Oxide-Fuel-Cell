1,5560,The double-perovskite Sr2NiMoO6-delta (SNMO) was investigated as an anode material of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Sr2NiMoO6-δ as anode material for LaGaO3-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.07.005
2,5560,"With a 300 mu m thick La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-sigma (LSGM) disk as electrolyte and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta as the cathode, the SNMO anode showed power densities of 819 mW cm(-2) in hydrogen at 1123 K.",Sr2NiMoO6-δ as anode material for LaGaO3-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.07.005
3,5560,"Moreover, there was no buffer layer between anode and electrolyte, which would reduce design techniques and save design cost.",Sr2NiMoO6-δ as anode material for LaGaO3-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.07.005
4,5560,After test no chemical reaction was discovered between anode and electrolyte.,Sr2NiMoO6-δ as anode material for LaGaO3-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.07.005
5,5560,The anode exhibited good conductivity and the value was around 60 S cm(-1) in H-2.,Sr2NiMoO6-δ as anode material for LaGaO3-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.07.005
6,5560,"Also it had almost linear thermal expansion from room temperature to 1253 K and the average thermal expansion coefficient was about 12.14 x 10(-6) K-1, which was quite close to that of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 (12.17 x 10(-6) K-1) electrolyte.",Sr2NiMoO6-δ as anode material for LaGaO3-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.07.005
