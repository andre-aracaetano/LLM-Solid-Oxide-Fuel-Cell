1,12971,Due to the high operating temperatures (900-1000-degrees-C) the material demands upon Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) components are quite stringent.,ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF STABILIZED ZIRCONIA AND INTERCONNECTION MATERIALS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(91)90229-5
2,12971,"Preferably lower operating temperatures (700-800-degrees-C) are desired so that gas feed lines, heat exchanges, and structure components can be fabricated from relatively cheap stainless steel components.",ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF STABILIZED ZIRCONIA AND INTERCONNECTION MATERIALS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(91)90229-5
3,12971,"Typically, the materials used in a SOFC are yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the solid electrolyte, nickel-zirconia cermet as the anode, strontium-doped lanthanum manganite as the cathode, and magnesium-doped lanthanum chromite as the interconnection material.",ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF STABILIZED ZIRCONIA AND INTERCONNECTION MATERIALS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(91)90229-5
4,12971,"The electrolyte and interconnect are difficult to fabricate, because they need to be gas tight, yet thin (30-50 microns) and mechanically stable.",ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF STABILIZED ZIRCONIA AND INTERCONNECTION MATERIALS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(91)90229-5
5,12971,Due to the high volatility of CrO3 the densification of LaCrO3 into thin layers is a more demanding challenge than the fabrication of the electrolyte.,ELECTROCHEMICAL VAPOR-DEPOSITION OF STABILIZED ZIRCONIA AND INTERCONNECTION MATERIALS FOR SOLID OXIDE FUEL-CELLS,10.1016/0167-2738(91)90229-5
