5,17489,"The thermal and conductivity behavior of the prepared samples were studied using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and impedance analyzer, respectively.","Influence of Al3+ doping for V5+ on the structural, optical, thermal and electrical properties of V2-xAlxO5-δ (x=0-0.20) ceramics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.12.188
6,17489,All the prepared ceramics exhibit good DC conductivity (0.22-0.36 Sm-1) at 400 degrees C. These materials can be considered for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC)/battery applications due to their good conductivity and good thermal stability.,"Influence of Al3+ doping for V5+ on the structural, optical, thermal and electrical properties of V2-xAlxO5-δ (x=0-0.20) ceramics",10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.12.188
