1,16886,Electrical current flow is one of the important factors influencing high-temperature oxidation of SOFC interconnects.,Effect of Electrical Current on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Metallic Interconnect Oxidation in Syngas,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02430.x
2,16886,"To understand the effect of electric current on corrosion behavior, Crofer 22 APU and Haynes 230//SS430 clad coupons were exposed to a simulated coal syngas at 800 degrees C with a current density of 0.5 A/cm2, for 500 h. It was found that the scale formed on the positive side was thicker than that formed on the negative side.",Effect of Electrical Current on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Metallic Interconnect Oxidation in Syngas,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02430.x
3,16886,"In particular, for Crofer 22 APU, the morphology of the scale formed on the positive side was whisker-like while the scale formed on the negative side was predominantly cubic-shaped crystals.",Effect of Electrical Current on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Metallic Interconnect Oxidation in Syngas,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02430.x
4,16886,"For Haynes 230//SS430 clad sample, some grain-shaped crystals appeared on SS 430 (negative) side due to the breakaway oxidation.",Effect of Electrical Current on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Metallic Interconnect Oxidation in Syngas,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02430.x
