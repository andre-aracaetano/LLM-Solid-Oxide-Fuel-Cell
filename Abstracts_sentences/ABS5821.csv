1,5821,"In La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3.delta (LSCF) cathode/Gd-doped ceria (GDC)/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-electrolyte based solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), one of the key issues affecting performance and long-term stability is the apparent deactivation of LSCF cathode by the presence of secondary phases such as SrZrO3 at the interfaces.",Enhanced stability of solid oxide fuel cells by employing a modified cathode-interlayer interface with a dense La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin film,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.12.010
2,5821,"Herein, we report that by modifying the cathode-interlayer interface with a dense LSCF thin film, the severe cation interdiffusion is suppressed especially the fast gas or surface diffusion of Sr into adjacent GDC-interlayer/YSZ-electrolyte resulting in the significant reduction of SrZrO3 formation at the interfaces improving cell stability.",Enhanced stability of solid oxide fuel cells by employing a modified cathode-interlayer interface with a dense La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ thin film,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.12.010
