1,1803,A feasibility study and techno-economic analysis for a hybrid power system intended for vehicular traction applications has been performed.,Feasibility study and techno-economic analysis of an SOFC/battery hybrid system for vehicle applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.049
2,1803,"The hybrid consists of an intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) operating at 500-800 degrees C and a sodium-nickel chloride (ZEBRA) battery operating at 300 degrees C. Such a hybrid system has the benefits of extended range and fuel flexibility (due to the IT-SOFC), high power output and rapid response time (due to the battery).",Feasibility study and techno-economic analysis of an SOFC/battery hybrid system for vehicle applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.049
3,1803,"The above hybrid has been compared to a fuel cell-only, a battery-only and an ICE vehicle.",Feasibility study and techno-economic analysis of an SOFC/battery hybrid system for vehicle applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.049
4,1803,"It is shown that the capital cost associated with a fuel cell-only vehicle is still much higher than that of any other power source option and that a battery-only option would potentially encounter weight and volume limitations, particularly for long drive times.",Feasibility study and techno-economic analysis of an SOFC/battery hybrid system for vehicle applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.049
5,1803,It is concluded that increasing drive time per day decreases substantially the payback time in relation to an ICE vehicle running on gasoline and thus that the hybrid vehicle is an economically attractive option for commercial vehicles with long drive times.,Feasibility study and techno-economic analysis of an SOFC/battery hybrid system for vehicle applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.049
6,1803,In the case where the battery has reached volume production prices at 70 pound kWh(-1) and current fuel duty values remain unchanged then a payback time < 2 years is obtained.,Feasibility study and techno-economic analysis of an SOFC/battery hybrid system for vehicle applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.049
7,1803,"For a light delivery van operating with 6 h drive time per day, a fuel cell system model predicted a gasoline equivalent fuel economy of 25.1 km L-1, almost twice that of a gasoline fuelled ICE vehicle of the same size, and CO2 emissions of 71.6 g km(-1), well below any new technology target set so far.",Feasibility study and techno-economic analysis of an SOFC/battery hybrid system for vehicle applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.049
8,1803,It is therefore recommended that a SOFC/ZEBRA demonstration be built to further explore its viability.,Feasibility study and techno-economic analysis of an SOFC/battery hybrid system for vehicle applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.049
