1,3450,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with Nio-ScSZ and Ni0.9Mg0.1O-ScSZ-based anodes were operated by directly feeding a fuel mixture of CH4, CO2 and N-2 (CH4 to CO2 ratio of 3:2).",NiO-ScSZ and Ni0.9Mg0.1O-ScSZ-based anodes under internal dry reforming of simulated biogas mixtures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.001
2,3450,Stable operation under constant current load (200 mA cm(-2)) was achieved with a NiO-ScSZ type anode during 200h operating hours at 900 degrees C. Less stable operation occurred with a Ni0.9Mg0.1O-ScSZ type anode.,NiO-ScSZ and Ni0.9Mg0.1O-ScSZ-based anodes under internal dry reforming of simulated biogas mixtures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.03.001
