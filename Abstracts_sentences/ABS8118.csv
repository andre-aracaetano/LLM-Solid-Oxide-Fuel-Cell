1,8118,The aim of this work was to experimentally assess the feasibility of feeding real biomass product gas to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) for efficient and clean power production.,"Integrating biomass gasification with solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of real product gas tars, fluctuations and particulates on Ni-GDC anode",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.020
2,8118,The impact of tars on Ni-GDC anode was the main focus of the experiments.,"Integrating biomass gasification with solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of real product gas tars, fluctuations and particulates on Ni-GDC anode",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.020
3,8118,Planar SOFC membranes were operated at two gasification sites: (a) autothermal fixed-bed downdraft gasifier and (b) allothermal bubbling fluidized bed gasifier.,"Integrating biomass gasification with solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of real product gas tars, fluctuations and particulates on Ni-GDC anode",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.020
4,8118,"In all cases the gas was hot-cleaned from particulates, HCl and H2S. SOFC membranes were tested up to one day on different product gas tar loads (0-3000 mg N m(-3)) with stable performance.","Integrating biomass gasification with solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of real product gas tars, fluctuations and particulates on Ni-GDC anode",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.020
5,8118,SEM/EDS examination of the SOFCs revealed intact anodes; no carbon deposition or other impurities were detected.,"Integrating biomass gasification with solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of real product gas tars, fluctuations and particulates on Ni-GDC anode",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.020
6,8118,"During testing on high fuel utilization conditions and high steam content, the SOFC lost performance due to anode nickel oxidation.","Integrating biomass gasification with solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of real product gas tars, fluctuations and particulates on Ni-GDC anode",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.020
7,8118,"In another extreme case where producer gas particulates reached the SOFC, SEM examination identified secondary tubular shaped carbon structures formed inside the functional layer of the anode.","Integrating biomass gasification with solid oxide fuel cells: Effect of real product gas tars, fluctuations and particulates on Ni-GDC anode",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.020
