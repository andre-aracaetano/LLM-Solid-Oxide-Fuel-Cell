1,20986,"combination of operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, operando electrochemical-impedance spectroscopy, and moisture-sorption measurements has been exploited to study the adsorption and conduction behavior of H2O and D2O on the technologically important ceramic oxides YSZ (8 mol % Y2O3), ZrO2, and Y2O3.","Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Physisorbed and Chemisorbed Water Layers on the Ceramic Oxides Y2O3, YSZ, and ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.6b03566
2,20986,"Because the characterization of the chemisorbed and physisorbed water layers is imperative to a full understanding of (electro-)catalytically active doped oxide surfaces and their application in technology, the presented data provide the specific reactivity of these oxides toward water over a pressure-and temperature parameter range extending up to, e.g., solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-relevant conditions.","Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Physisorbed and Chemisorbed Water Layers on the Ceramic Oxides Y2O3, YSZ, and ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.6b03566
3,20986,The characteristic changes of the related infrared bands could directly be linked to the associated conductivity and moisture-sorption data.,"Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Physisorbed and Chemisorbed Water Layers on the Ceramic Oxides Y2O3, YSZ, and ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.6b03566
4,20986,"For YSZ, a sequential dissociative water (ice-like layer) and polymeric chained water (liquid-like) water-adsorption model for isothermal and isobaric conditions over a pressure range of 10(-5) to 24 mbar and a temperature range from room temperature up to 1173 K could be experimentally verified.","Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Physisorbed and Chemisorbed Water Layers on the Ceramic Oxides Y2O3, YSZ, and ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.6b03566
5,20986,"On pure monoclinic ZrO2, in contrast to highly hydroxylated YSZ and Y2O3, a high surface concentration of OH groups from water chemisorption is absent at any temperature and pressure.","Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Physisorbed and Chemisorbed Water Layers on the Ceramic Oxides Y2O3, YSZ, and ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.6b03566
6,20986,"Thus, the ice-like and following molecular water layers exhibit no measurable protonic conduction.","Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Physisorbed and Chemisorbed Water Layers on the Ceramic Oxides Y2O3, YSZ, and ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.6b03566
7,20986,"We show that the water layers, even under these rather extreme experimental conditions, play a key role in understanding the function of these materials.","Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Physisorbed and Chemisorbed Water Layers on the Ceramic Oxides Y2O3, YSZ, and ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.6b03566
8,20986,"Furthermore, the reported data are supposed to provide an extended basis for the further investigation of close-to-real gas adsorption or catalyzed heterogeneous reactions.","Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Physisorbed and Chemisorbed Water Layers on the Ceramic Oxides Y2O3, YSZ, and ZrO2",10.1021/acsami.6b03566
