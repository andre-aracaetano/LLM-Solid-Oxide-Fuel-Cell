4,4677,"The average particle size was about 50 nm and specific surface area was 10 m(2) g(-1), when the powder was fired at 900degreesC for 2 h. NiO-SDC cermets were prepared by firing the composites at 1350degreesC. The electrical conductivities and porosities of the cermets were measured, for example, 360 S cm(-1) at 600degreesC for a cermet with 30% porosity, 35 vol.% Ni, and 35 vol.% SDC.",Gel-cast NiO-SDC composites as anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.01.017
