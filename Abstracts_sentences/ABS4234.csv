1,4234,We demonstrate ultra-fast fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using microwave-assisted sintering technology.,Ultra-fast fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells via microwave-assisted sintering technology,10.1007/s11814-020-0578-2
2,4234,"Due to the nature of microwaves that transfers heat directly into the material, the SOFC sintering process was completed within 8 h, similar to six times faster compared to a conventional sintering process (similar to 47 h).",Ultra-fast fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells via microwave-assisted sintering technology,10.1007/s11814-020-0578-2
3,4234,"Despite extremely rapid processing time, the microstructure of the SOFC fabricated by microwave-assisted sintering (M-SOFC) was almost identical to that of the conventionally sintered SOFC.",Ultra-fast fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells via microwave-assisted sintering technology,10.1007/s11814-020-0578-2
4,4234,"Moreover, the electrochemical performance of the M-SOFC at 750 degrees C was 0.52 W/cm(2)in peak power density, which is even higher than that of the conventionally sintered sample (0.49W/cm(2)).",Ultra-fast fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells via microwave-assisted sintering technology,10.1007/s11814-020-0578-2
5,4234,"Thus, our results demonstrate that the ultra-fast microwave-assisted sintering process is a highly effective and practically promising technology for fabricating high performance SOFCs.",Ultra-fast fabrication of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells via microwave-assisted sintering technology,10.1007/s11814-020-0578-2
