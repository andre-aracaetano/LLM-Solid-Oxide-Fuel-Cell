1,2938,The sintering of (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 (LSM-20) solid oxide fuel cell cathodes (in the temperature range of 1050-1200 degrees C) on anode-supported cells utilizing a Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode and a thin YSZ electrolyte (< 10 mu m thickness) revealed the need for a protective ceria interlayer to prevent a detrimental interaction between the YSZ and the LSM.,Electrochemical Performance and Stability of the Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells II. Role of Ni diffusion on LSM Performance,10.1149/1.3321829
2,2938,"The interaction, however, was not the typically assumed formation of insulating La- and Sr-zirconate, but rather the result of Ni diffusion from the anode through the YSZ electrolyte and into the LSM, resulting in coarsening and increased densification of the LSM microstructure.",Electrochemical Performance and Stability of the Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells II. Role of Ni diffusion on LSM Performance,10.1149/1.3321829
3,2938,The protective Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 layers at the cathode/electrolyte interface were effective in blocking the Ni diffusion.,Electrochemical Performance and Stability of the Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells II. Role of Ni diffusion on LSM Performance,10.1149/1.3321829
4,2938,"As an alternative to the use of a protective ceria interlayer, the presence of YSZ in the cathode material was able to suppress the coarsening of LSM, thereby significantly improving the electrochemical performance.",Electrochemical Performance and Stability of the Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells II.
