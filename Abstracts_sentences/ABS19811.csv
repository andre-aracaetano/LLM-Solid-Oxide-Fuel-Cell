2,19811,"In this study, Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) anode was subjected to thermal cycles with redox treatments (thermal-redox cycles: repetition of oxidation in cooling and reduction in heating processes).",Microstructural Evolution of Ni-YSZ Cermet Anode under Thermal Cycles with Redox Treatments,10.1149/2.0311504jes

4,19811,The decrement in the active triple phase boundary (TPB) length caused by sintering and agglomeration of Ni particles was correlated with the performance deterioration.,Microstructural Evolution of Ni-YSZ Cermet Anode under Thermal Cycles with Redox Treatments,10.1149/2.0311504jes
5,19811,"Furthermore, it was found that the onset temperature of reduction treatment in the heating process was one of the critical factors for the microstructural evolution of anode; the agglomeration of Ni particles was promoted significantly under the reduction started from 500 degrees C, while no notable change was confirmed for the case of 900 degrees C.
