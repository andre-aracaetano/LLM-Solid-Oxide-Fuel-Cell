1,16178,Optimized boro-galliosilicate viscous glass sealants were successfully tested against SOFC electrolytes and interconnect materials for up to 1500 h.,Galliosilicate glasses for viscous sealants in solid oxide fuel cell stacks: Part II: Interactions with yttria stabilized zirconia and stainless steel coated with alumina,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.138
2,16178,The glasses exhibit glass transition temperatures near 620 degrees C and thus offer viscous sealing at temperatures as low as 650 degrees C.,Galliosilicate glasses for viscous sealants in solid oxide fuel cell stacks: Part II: Interactions with yttria stabilized zirconia and stainless steel coated with alumina,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.138
3,16178,"No interaction of the selected glasses occurred at 650 degrees C after 500 h, though testing at 850 degrees C against both 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) and alumina coated stainless steel (Al-SS) results in partial bulk and interfacial crystallization.",Galliosilicate glasses for viscous sealants in solid oxide fuel cell stacks: Part II: Interactions with yttria stabilized zirconia and stainless steel coated with alumina,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.138
4,16178,"The glasses penetrate into the grain boundaries of 8YSZ, but the penetration depth remains less than 10 gm from the original interface even after 1500 h at 850 degrees C. Dissolved 8YSZ completely inhibits bulk nucleation and crystallization in the interfacial region within 20-100 mu m of the 8YSZ surface.",Galliosilicate glasses for viscous sealants in solid oxide fuel cell stacks: Part II: Interactions with yttria stabilized zirconia and stainless steel coated with alumina,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.138
5,16178,"Glasses with 25 and 30 mol% SrO and no CaO form dendritic SrZrO3 crystal phases at the interface, while a glass with 20 mol% SrO and 10 mol% CaO retains an amorphous interface even after 1500 h at 850 degrees C. Complex K-Ga-Si-O crystals are formed at the interface with Al-SS, and test vehicles of 8YSZ/glass/Al-SS remain intact on cooling from 850 degrees C to room temperature and without Cr diffusion into the glass.",Galliosilicate glasses for viscous sealants in solid oxide fuel cell stacks: Part II: Interactions with yttria stabilized zirconia and stainless steel coated with alumina,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.138
