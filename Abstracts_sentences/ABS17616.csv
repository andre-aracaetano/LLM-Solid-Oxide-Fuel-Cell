2,17616,"The effect of pore formers sizes, morphologies and their amounts, was investigated on the volume fraction of porosities, which can be created during sintering of BZCY7 electrolytes and on the morphologies of the formed porosities.",Effect of pore formers characteristics and melt infiltration parameters on microstructure and electrical properties of BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-δ-carbonate composite electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.11.067
3,17616,"The effect of created pores morphologies, sizes, their volume fractions and also infiltration's temperature and time on the degree of infiltration and electrical conductivity of the fabricated composite electrolytes were also studied.",Effect of pore formers characteristics and melt infiltration parameters on microstructure and electrical properties of BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-δ-carbonate composite electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.11.067
4,17616,"The results proved that by using 20 wt% of each type of the used pore formers, same amount of porosities in the range of 40-45 vol.% would be created during sintering of BZCY7 compound at 1400 degrees C for 5 h. By using pore formers more than 20 wt%, the amount of created porosities did not change or just increased a little and soon after it nearly became saturated.",Effect of pore formers characteristics and melt infiltration parameters on microstructure and electrical properties of BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-δ-carbonate composite electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.11.067
5,17616,"Optimum temperature and time for infiltration of melt carbonate phase was determined in the range of 530-570 degrees C for 2 h. Based on the four probe electrical conductivity measurements as a function of temperature, it was shown that for the composite electrolytes the Arrhenius conductivity curves is divided, at the melting point of carbonate phase, to two regions with two different slopes.",Effect of pore formers characteristics and melt infiltration parameters on microstructure and electrical properties of BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-δ-carbonate composite electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.11.067
6,17616,"The results also proved that at temperatures higher and lower than the melting point of carbonate phase, electrical conductivity of the composite electrolytes were higher and lower than what determined for dense BZCY7 based electrolyte, respectively.",Effect of pore formers characteristics and melt infiltration parameters on microstructure and electrical properties of BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-δ-carbonate composite electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.11.067
