1,18064,Nanocrystalline La1-xSrxCoO3-delta (LSC) thin films with a nominal Sr-content of x = 0.4 were deposited on Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolyte substrates using a low temperature sol-gel process.,Microstructure of Nanoscaled La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aenm.201000036
2,18064,"The structural and chemical properties of the LSC thin films were studied after thermal treatment, which included a calcination step and a variable, extended annealing time at 700 degrees C or 800 degrees C. Transmission electron microscopy combined with selected-area electron diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and scanning transmission electron microscopy tomography was applied for the investigation of grain size, porosity, microstructure, and analysis of the local chemical composition and element distribution on the nanoscale.",Microstructure of Nanoscaled La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aenm.201000036
3,18064,"The area specific resistance (ASR) values of the thin film LSC cathodes, which include the lowest ASR value reported so far (ASR(chem) = 0.023 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C) can be interpreted on the basis of the structural and chemical characterization.",Microstructure of Nanoscaled La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/aenm.201000036
