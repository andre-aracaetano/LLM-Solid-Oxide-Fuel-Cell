1,8312,H-2 oxidation has been studied for Pt and Ni electrodes for different H-2/H2O ratios at 1000 degrees C in solid oxide fuel cells using yttria-tetragonal zirconia electrolyte by galvanostatic current interruption and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.,Hydrogen oxidation at the nickel and platinum electrodes on yttria-tetragonal zirconia electrolyte,10.1149/1.1838091
2,8312,"The results clearly indicate that the mechanism and kinetics of the H-2 oxidation reaction are strongly dependent on the catalytic activities of electrode materials, electronic conductivity of the electrolyte surface, and the water content in H-2 gas.",Hydrogen oxidation at the nickel and platinum electrodes on yttria-tetragonal zirconia electrolyte,10.1149/1.1838091
3,8312,The effect of water vapor in H-2 gas on the reaction kinetics is very much dependent on the electrode materials and is related to the partial pressure of oxygen.,Hydrogen oxidation at the nickel and platinum electrodes on yttria-tetragonal zirconia electrolyte,10.1149/1.1838091
4,8312,A reaction mechanism with two rate-limiting steps has been proposed and discussed.,Hydrogen oxidation at the nickel and platinum electrodes on yttria-tetragonal zirconia electrolyte,10.1149/1.1838091
