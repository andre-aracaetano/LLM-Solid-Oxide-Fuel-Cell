1,13308,"The oxygen reduction reaction can only proceed at locations where gas, electronic conductor, and an oxygen ion conductor meet.",Extended reaction zone of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.020
2,13308,"Although the extension of the reaction zone beyond the traditional so-called triple-phase-boundary (TPB) is widely accepted for a mixed ionically and electronically conductive cathode, work in this area has yet to reach a consensus on how far the reaction zone can be extended.",Extended reaction zone of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.020
3,13308,"In this study, anode-supported fuel cells with a variety of LSCF cathode thicknesses were fabricated and tested in two cathode environments, flowing oxygen and flowing air.",Extended reaction zone of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.020
4,13308,"In flowing oxygen, the cell performance increased with LSCF cathode thickness over the entire range investigated (from 5 to 33 mu m) because of the increased number of reaction sites.",Extended reaction zone of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.020
5,13308,"In flowing air, the cell performance also increased with the LSCF cathode thickness from 5 to 13 mu m, but then remained almost constant with further increase in cathode thickness due to depletion of oxygen beyond a certain thickness.",Extended reaction zone of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.020
