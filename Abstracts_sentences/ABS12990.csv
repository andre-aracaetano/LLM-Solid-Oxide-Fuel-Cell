1,12990,The cobalt-free cathode materials with high activity is critical to the commercial application of medium temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC).,"Novel cobalt-free Pr2Ni1-xNbxO4 (x=0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15) perovskite as the cathode material for IT-SOFC",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.045
2,12990,"Herein, a series of cobalt-free Nb-doped Pr2Ni1-xNbxO4 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15) perovskite oxides were successfully prepared, and the effects of Nb-doping on the structure, thermal stability and electrochemical properties of the cathode material are studied in detail.","Novel cobalt-free Pr2Ni1-xNbxO4 (x=0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15) perovskite as the cathode material for IT-SOFC",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.045
3,12990,The Pr2Ni1-xNbxO4 exhibits a K2NiF4 type structure with Fmmm space group.,"Novel cobalt-free Pr2Ni1-xNbxO4 (x=0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15) perovskite as the cathode material for IT-SOFC",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.045
4,12990,"The Nb5+ cations that doped into Pr2NiO4 replaces the Ni site, which increases the surface oxygen content, then effectively eliminates the phase transition of Pr2NiO4 and significantly improves the ORR catalytic activity.","Novel cobalt-free Pr2Ni1-xNbxO4 (x=0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15) perovskite as the cathode material for IT-SOFC",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.045
5,12990,"The Pr2Ni0.9Nb0.1O4 was found to occupy the lowest polarization resistance of 0.057 U cm(2), and the peak power density of single cells supported by the electrolyte is 0.576 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, which has good long-term stability.","Novel cobalt-free Pr2Ni1-xNbxO4 (x=0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15) perovskite as the cathode material for IT-SOFC",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.045
