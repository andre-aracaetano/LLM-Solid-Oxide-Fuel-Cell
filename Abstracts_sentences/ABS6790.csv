1,6790,The effect of operating temperature on durability was investigated for direct butane utilization using microtubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Effect of Operating Temperature on Durability for Direct Butane Utilization of Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.81.86
2,6790,"At 710 degrees C, the performance of the Ni-Gd doped ceria (Ni-GDC) anode deteriorated rapidly for less than 2 h in butane fuel with relatively low steam/carbon (S/C) ratio at 0.044 because of a large amount of carbon deposition by butane cracking.",Effect of Operating Temperature on Durability for Direct Butane Utilization of Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.81.86
3,6790,"The carbon nanofiber grew up from catalysis in the Ni-GDC anode after direct butane utilization at 660 degrees C for 15 h. The carbon deposition rate in wet butane was slower than that in dry butane below 660 degrees C on the Ni-GDC composite, because the oxidation of deposited carbon was also promoted by catalysis in the presence of water.",Effect of Operating Temperature on Durability for Direct Butane Utilization of Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.81.86
4,6790,The electric power could be generated continuously for more than 24 h in butane at S/C = 0.044 and relatively low operating temperature at 610 degrees C using the Ni-GDC anode.,Effect of Operating Temperature on Durability for Direct Butane Utilization of Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.81.86
5,6790,Decrease in the operating temperature realized high durability against carbon deposition for direct butane utilization of SOFCs using the Ni-GDC anode.,Effect of Operating Temperature on Durability for Direct Butane Utilization of Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.81.86
