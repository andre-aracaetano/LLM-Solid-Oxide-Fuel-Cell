1,747,Structure stability and electrical conductivity of LaSr2Fe2CrO9-delta were investigated in air and in hydrogen to explore its potential applications as symmetrical electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells.,Evaluation of LaSr2Fe2CrO9-δ as a Potential Electrode for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.04.104
2,747,X-Ray diffraction measurements showed that LaSr2Fe2CrO9-delta was essentially stable despite the presence of minor LaSrFeO4 impurities after heat-treated in humidified hydrogen at 800 degrees C. LaSr2Fe2CrO9-delta-based symmetrical fuel cells fabricated on LSGM electrolyte substrates via screen printing achieved a maximum power density of 224 mW cm(-2).,Evaluation of LaSr2Fe2CrO9-δ as a Potential Electrode for Symmetrical Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.04.104
