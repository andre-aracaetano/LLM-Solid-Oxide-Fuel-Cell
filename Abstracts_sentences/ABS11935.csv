5,11935,"The high densification of the film sintered at 1300 degrees C led to the better electrical conductivity of 16.38 S cm(-1) than the 4.86 S cm(-1) of the film sintered at 900 degrees C at an operating temperature of 800 degrees C. For the electrochemical performance, the SrFe0.5Ti0.5O3-delta film sintered at 1300 degrees C gained a low area specific resistance (ASR) value of 38.70 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C.",Effects of sintering temperature on the structural and electrochemical properties of SrFe0.5Ti0.5O3-δ perovskite cathode,10.1111/ijac.12825
6,11935,The ASR further decreased to 0.99 Omega cm(2) for the thicker film sintered at the same temperature.,Effects of sintering temperature on the structural and electrochemical properties of SrFe0.5Ti0.5O3-δ perovskite cathode,10.1111/ijac.12825
