1,3238,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) reduce CO2 emissions due to their high-energy-conversion efficiency.,Influence of the Crystal Structure of Titanium Oxide on the Catalytic Activity of Rh/TiO2 in Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/chem.201800936
2,3238,"Although SOFCs can convert LPG directly, coking occurs easily by decomposition of hydrocarbons, including C-C bonds on the electrode of fuel cell stacks.",Influence of the Crystal Structure of Titanium Oxide on the Catalytic Activity of Rh/TiO2 in Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/chem.201800936
3,3238,"It is therefore necessary to develop an active steam pre-reforming catalyst that eliminates the hydrocarbons at low temperature, in which waste heat of SOFCs is used.",Influence of the Crystal Structure of Titanium Oxide on the Catalytic Activity of Rh/TiO2 in Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/chem.201800936
4,3238,"Herein, we show that the crystal structure of the TiO2 that anchors Rh particles is crucial for catalytic activity of Rh/TiO2 catalysts for propane pre-reforming.",Influence of the Crystal Structure of Titanium Oxide on the Catalytic Activity of Rh/TiO2 in Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/chem.201800936
5,3238,Our experimental results revealed that strong metal support interaction (SMSI) induced during H-2 pre-reduction were optimized over Rh/TiO2 with a rutile structure; this catalyst catalyzed the reaction much more effectively than conventional Rh/-Al2O3.,Influence of the Crystal Structure of Titanium Oxide on the Catalytic Activity of Rh/TiO2 in Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/chem.201800936
6,3238,"In contrast, the SMSI was too strong for Rh/TiO2 with an anatase structure, and the surface of the Rh particles was therefore covered mostly with partially reduced TiO2.",Influence of the Crystal Structure of Titanium Oxide on the Catalytic Activity of Rh/TiO2 in Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/chem.201800936
7,3238,The result was very low activity.,Influence of the Crystal Structure of Titanium Oxide on the Catalytic Activity of Rh/TiO2 in Steam Reforming of Propane at Low Temperature,10.1002/chem.201800936
