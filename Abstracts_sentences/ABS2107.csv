1,2107,Modification of the double perovskite Sr2MgMoO6-delta by La substitution has shown that Sr2-xLaxMgMoO6-delta with 0.6 <= x <= 0.8 has better performance as the anode of a solid oxide fuel cell.,Electrochemical performance of La-doped Sr2MgMoO6-δ in natural gas,10.1016/j.elecom.2007.04.006
2,2107,"With a Sr-2La0.8MgMoO6-delta, anode, LSGM electrolyte, SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta cathode, and a La0.5Ce0.4O1.7-delta buffer layer between the anode and the electrolyte, a maximum power density of 550 mW/cm(2) has been obtained for a SOFC operating on wet methane (3%H2O) at 800 degrees C.",Electrochemical performance of La-doped Sr2MgMoO6-δ in natural gas,10.1016/j.elecom.2007.04.006
3,2107,"The performance of the SOFC using C2H6 fuel, like that of CH4, changes little on switching from dry C2H6 to 3% H2O/C2H6, but improvement with Wet C3H8 shows that some steam will need to be added to a moderately desulfurized natural-gas fuel.",Electrochemical performance of La-doped Sr2MgMoO6-δ in natural gas,10.1016/j.elecom.2007.04.006
