1,20556,"This work demonstrates, for the first time, that a variety of disparate and technologically-relevent thermal, mechanical, and electrochemical oxygen-exchange material properties can all be obtained from in situ, current-collector-free wafer curvature measurements.","Mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical properties of Pr doped ceria from wafer curvature measurements",10.1039/c8cp04802a
2,20556,"Specifically, temperature or oxygen partial pressure induced changes in the curvature of 230 nm thick (100)-oriented Pr0.1Ce0.9O1.95-x (10PCO) films atop 200 m thick single crystal yttria stabilized zirconia or magnesium oxide substrates were used to measure the biaxial modulus, Young's modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, thermo-chemical expansion coefficient, oxygen nonstoichiometry, chemical oxygen surface exchange coefficient, oxygen surface exchange resistance, thermal stress, chemical stress, thermal strain, and chemical strain of the model mixed ionic electronic conducting material 10PCO.","Mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical properties of Pr doped ceria from wafer curvature measurements",10.1039/c8cp04802a
3,20556,"The (100)-oriented thin film 10PCO thermal expansion coefficient, thermo-chemical expansion coefficient, oxygen nonstoichiometry, and Young's modulus (which is essentially constant, at approximate to 200 MPa, over the entire 280-700 degrees C temperature range in air) measured here were similar to those from other bulk and thin film 10PCO studies.","Mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical properties of Pr doped ceria from wafer curvature measurements",10.1039/c8cp04802a
4,20556,"In addition, the measured PCO10 oxygen surface coefficients were in agreement with those reported by other in situ, current-collector-free techniques.","Mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical properties of Pr doped ceria from wafer curvature measurements",10.1039/c8cp04802a
5,20556,"Taken together, this work highlights the advantages of using a sample's mechanical response, instead of the more traditional electrical response, to probe the electrochemical properties of the ion-exchange materials used in solid oxide fuel cell, solid oxide electrolysis cell, gas-sensing, battery, emission control, water splitting, water purification, and other electrochemically-active devices.","Mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical properties of Pr doped ceria from wafer curvature measurements",10.1039/c8cp04802a
