1,3348,"Herein, a new ceramic-based catalyst with exsolved CoFe nanoparticles anchored on the support of a Ruddlesden-Popper structure (La1.2Sr0.8Co0.12Fe0.88O4) is synthesized, and various physicochemical analyses are conducted to investigate its applicability as an anode of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide (La0.6Sr0.4)2(Co,Fe)O4 with Exsolved CoFe Nanoparticles for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst",10.1002/ente.202100116
2,3348,"The catalyst is fabricated by reducing La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 in an atmosphere of a 10% H-2/N-2 gas mixture at 800 degrees C, whose condition is much milder than the typical synthesis method of Ruddlesden-Popper materials.","Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide (La0.6Sr0.4)2(Co,Fe)O4 with Exsolved CoFe Nanoparticles for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst",10.1002/ente.202100116
3,3348,The single cell exhibits a good electrochemical performance with a maximum power density value of 729 mW cm(-2) at a temperature of 800 degrees C.,"Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide (La0.6Sr0.4)2(Co,Fe)O4 with Exsolved CoFe Nanoparticles for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst",10.1002/ente.202100116
4,3348,The presence of oxygen vacancies and the low synthesis temperature should be responsible for its good catalytic activity.,"Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide (La0.6Sr0.4)2(Co,Fe)O4 with Exsolved CoFe Nanoparticles for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst",10.1002/ente.202100116
5,3348,"Moreover, exsovled CoFe nanoparticles could provide additional chemisorption and activation sites for the H-2 electrooxidation reaction, leading to the improved electrochemical performance.","Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide (La0.6Sr0.4)2(Co,Fe)O4 with Exsolved CoFe Nanoparticles for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst",10.1002/ente.202100116
6,3348,"Therefore, this Ruddlesden-Popper material with exsolved CoFe nanoparticles could be a potential anode material for SOFCs.","Ruddlesden-Popper Oxide (La0.6Sr0.4)2(Co,Fe)O4 with Exsolved CoFe Nanoparticles for a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst",10.1002/ente.202100116
