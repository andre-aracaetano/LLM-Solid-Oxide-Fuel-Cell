1,19728,"A two-dimensional mathematical model is developed for a single-cell based on the planar configuration and validated by relevant experimental data, with an aim to describe the coupling phenomena of the multiphysics transport processes and the meso-scale elementary reactions.",Analysis of effects of meso-scale reactions on multiphysics transport processes in rSOFC fueled with syngas,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116379
2,19728,"It is revealed that desorption and adsorption reactions in the electrode mostly take place near the electrolyte and the channel, respectively; the distribution of the surface species depends on the gas diffusion in the porous electrode affected by the thickness and microstructure of the electrode.",Analysis of effects of meso-scale reactions on multiphysics transport processes in rSOFC fueled with syngas,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116379
3,19728,The electrochemical reactions are centralized in about 100 mu m thick electrode from the electrolyte.,Analysis of effects of meso-scale reactions on multiphysics transport processes in rSOFC fueled with syngas,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116379
4,19728,Ni-s and COs are the major surface species in both fuel cell (FC) and electrolysis cell (EC) modes.,Analysis of effects of meso-scale reactions on multiphysics transport processes in rSOFC fueled with syngas,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116379
5,19728,"O-s is higher in the FC mode, particularly near the electrolyte due to the desorption and charge transfer reactions; The microscopic structure properties, including average porosity, tortuosity and particle size, are also influential on the elementary reactions due to the gas diffusion through the tortuous pathways and the active sites on the catalyst surfaces.",Analysis of effects of meso-scale reactions on multiphysics transport processes in rSOFC fueled with syngas,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116379
6,19728,"It is also found that the performance predicted in the global models is often overestimated, because the limitations of the local elementary reactions are not considered in the global model.",Analysis of effects of meso-scale reactions on multiphysics transport processes in rSOFC fueled with syngas,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116379
