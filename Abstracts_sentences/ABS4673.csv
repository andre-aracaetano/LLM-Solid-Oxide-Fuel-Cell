1,4673,Single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) experiments have been carried out at temperatures below 900 degreesC with methane-air mixtures.,Evaluation of the actual working temperature of a single-chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1645352
2,4673,Our study confirms previous results obtained by Hibino and co-workers with conventional materials like La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 for the cathode and a NiO-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cermet for the anode.,Evaluation of the actual working temperature of a single-chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1645352
3,4673,"In addition, special attention has been paid both to the gas flow and to the actual operating temperatures.",Evaluation of the actual working temperature of a single-chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1645352
4,4673,Platinum meshes and wires upon the electrodes would greatly influence their actual operating temperature and they have been systematically avoided for the working cells within this study.,Evaluation of the actual working temperature of a single-chamber SOFC,10.1149/1.1645352
