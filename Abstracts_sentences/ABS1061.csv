3,1061,"The temperature, steam to acetic acid ratio, and to a lesser extent pressure affect significantly the equilibrium product distribution due to their influence on steam reforming, thermal decomposition and water-gas shift reaction.",Thermodynamic analysis of acetic acid steam reforming for hydrogen production,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.012
4,1061,"The study shows that steam reforming of acetic acid with a steam to acetic acid ratio of 2 to 1 is thermodynamically feasible with hydrogen, carbon monoxide and water as the main products at the equilibrium at temperatures higher than 700 degrees C, and achieving CO/CO2 ratios higher than I. Thus, it can be concluded that within the operation temperature range of solid oxide fuel cells between 700 degrees C and 1000 degrees C - the production of a gas rich in hydrogen and carbon monoxide is promoted.",Thermodynamic analysis of acetic acid steam reforming for hydrogen production,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.012
