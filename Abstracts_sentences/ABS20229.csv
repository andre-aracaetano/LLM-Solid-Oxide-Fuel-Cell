1,20229,"A Pd doped perovskite La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.9Ni0.05Pd0.05O3 (LSCNP) was investigated as a candidate for a metal-free anode material of solid oxide fuel cell in comparison with La0.85Sr0.15Cr0.9Ni0.1O3, (LSCN).",Self-Regeneration Pd-Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE161
2,20229,"The performance of anodes of LSCNP and LSCN with and without mixing Sin doped Ceria (SDC) was measured using H-2, and dry-CH4, as fuel.",Self-Regeneration Pd-Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE161
3,20229,"The maximum current density of the cell in H-2, increased approximately twofold by the doping of Pd for the anode with or without SDC.",Self-Regeneration Pd-Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE161
4,20229,"The rate of the anodic reaction in H-2, was enhanced mainly by the catalytic activity of LSCNP and additionally by SDC.",Self-Regeneration Pd-Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE161
5,20229,"When dry-CH4, was used as the fuel, the cell with LSCNP-SDC anode was the only cell which was able to perform power generation.",Self-Regeneration Pd-Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE161
6,20229,Both the doping of Pd to the perovskite and the mixing of SDC contributed to the ability to operate SOFC in dry CH4.,Self-Regeneration Pd-Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE161
7,20229,"The anode reaction did not occur when SDC was not in the anode, indicating that the supply of oxide ion was the rate determining step.",Self-Regeneration Pd-Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE161
8,20229,"Pd, which is considered to deposit from LSCNP in reducing atmosphere, seemed to be the reaction site of the electrochemical methane oxidation since the reaction rate was low for LSCN-SDC.",Self-Regeneration Pd-Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE161
9,20229,"Although slight indication of carbon deposition was observed, Pd doped perovskite would be a good candidate for metal-free SOFC anode.",Self-Regeneration Pd-Perovskite Anode for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE161
