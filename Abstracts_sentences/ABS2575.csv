1,2575,"High-temperature interactions between glass-ceramic sealants and Cr-containing ferritic interconnects used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) lead to the formation of detrimental chromate interfacial phases, such as BaCrO4 or SrCrO4, which can cause mechanical failure of the SOFC.",Chromate formation at the interface between a solid oxide fuel cell sealing glass and interconnect alloy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.043
