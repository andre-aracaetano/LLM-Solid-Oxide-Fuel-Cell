2,15331,"XRD measurements indicated that the perovskite structures were formed following calcination at 850 degrees C, at which temperature the LNF and LSNF form small particles that coat the YSZ pores.",Solid oxide fuel cell cathodes prepared by infiltration of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and La0.91Sr0.09Ni0.6Fe0.4O3 in porous yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.046
3,15331,Heating to 1100 degrees C causes the particles to form a dense film over the YSZ but caused no solid-state reaction.,Solid oxide fuel cell cathodes prepared by infiltration of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and La0.91Sr0.09Ni0.6Fe0.4O3 in porous yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.046
4,15331,"Calcination of an LNF-YSZ composite to 1200 degrees C led to an expansion of the LNF lattice, suggesting introduction of Zr(IV) into the perovskite; further heating to 1300 degrees C caused the formation of La2Zr2O7.",Solid oxide fuel cell cathodes prepared by infiltration of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and La0.91Sr0.09Ni0.6Fe0.4O3 in porous yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.046
5,15331,"For 850 degrees C calcination, the electrode performance of both LNF-YSZ and LSNF-YSZ composites was similar to that reported for composites of YSZ and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSF), with a current-independent impedance of approximately 0.1 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air.",Solid oxide fuel cell cathodes prepared by infiltration of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and La0.91Sr0.09Ni0.6Fe0.4O3 in porous yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.046
