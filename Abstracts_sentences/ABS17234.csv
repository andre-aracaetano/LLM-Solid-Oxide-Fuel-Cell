Besides, doping of Fe in B-site can effectively reduce the thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of the Pr0.5Gd0.5BaCo2O5+d ceramics at 30-1 000(degrees)C. And the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) results show that the PGBCF-y|GDC| PGBCF-y symmetric cells have acceptable low area specific polarization resistances.","Doping strategy on improving the overall cathodic performance of double perovskite LnBaCo2O5+δ (Ln=Pr, Gd) as potential SOFC cathode materials",10.1016/j.jmat.2023.02.004
