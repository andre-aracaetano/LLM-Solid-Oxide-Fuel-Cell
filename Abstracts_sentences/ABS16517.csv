1,16517,The presented work describes a process for producing a mixed-conducting SOFC cermet anode through the in situ reduction of a ternary oxide.,In situ formation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cermet anode by NiWO4 reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.011
2,16517,"A porous nickel tungstenate (NiWO4) was screen-printed and bonded onto an yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte-supported SOFC by treatment at 1000 degrees C for 1 h. An (La,sr)MnO3/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2(LSM/GDC) was utilized as the cathode with the NiWO4 acting as the anode for the SOFC.",In situ formation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cermet anode by NiWO4 reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.011
3,16517,"The similar to 1-cm diameter fuel cell with a similar to 100-mu m thick YSZ electrolyte was tested in H-2 fuel at 800 degrees C. During the insertion of the H-2 fuel, the NiWO4 was reduced to form a Ni/WOx cermet composite that consisted of a fine mixture of Ni-nanoparticles dispersed over the porous WO, support structure.",In situ formation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cermet anode by NiWO4 reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.011
4,16517,"A maximum power density of similar to 104 mW cm(-2) was attained for the reduced NiWO4 anode, even with an un-optimized and dense microstructure, on an electrolyte-supported cell.",In situ formation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cermet anode by NiWO4 reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.011
5,16517,The power density was increased to similar to 165 mW cm(-2) with the incorporation of GDC powder into the NiWO4 anode.,In situ formation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cermet anode by NiWO4 reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.011
6,16517,The same NiWO4/GDC composite was tested within a fuel stream of H-2 containing 10 ppm PH3.,In situ formation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cermet anode by NiWO4 reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.011
7,16517,"The cell's degradation rate was 0.006 V h(-1) for 5 h at 750 degrees C, which is similar to that observed for conventional Nil YSZ cermets.",In situ formation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cermet anode by NiWO4 reduction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.011
