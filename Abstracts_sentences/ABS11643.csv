1,11643,The commercialization of the Co-free solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode was hindered due to its insufficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.,"Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite B-site doped Ln (Nd, Sm) as cathode for high performance Co-free intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.06.124
2,11643,"In this paper, the ORR activity of the cathode material is effectively increased by doping a small amount of low-valence Ln(3+) (Nd3+, Sm3+) ions at the B-site of Fe-based perovskite Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3- delta (BSF).","Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite B-site doped Ln (Nd, Sm) as cathode for high performance Co-free intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.06.124
3,11643,"Nd3+ increases the free volume (V-free) per unit cell of perovskite due to its larger ionic radius, thus increasing the oxygen vacancy concentration of Bi0.5Sr0.5Fe0.95Nd0.05O3- delta(BSFN).","Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite B-site doped Ln (Nd, Sm) as cathode for high performance Co-free intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.06.124
4,11643,"Compared with BSF, BSFN has greatly improved the surface oxygen exchange and volume diffusion rate through the electronic conductivity relaxation (ECR) method.","Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite B-site doped Ln (Nd, Sm) as cathode for high performance Co-free intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.06.124
5,11643,"At 700 degrees C, the area-specific resistance (ASR) of BSFN reached 0.062 Omega cm(-2), which was 65% lower than that of BSF (0.177 Omega cm(-2)), and the peak power density (PDD) of BSFN-based single cell reached 1.10 W cm (-2,) which was 1.7 times higher than that of BSF-based single cell (0.64 W cm (-2)).","Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite B-site doped Ln (Nd, Sm) as cathode for high performance Co-free intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.06.124
6,11643,"Through DRT analysis, it is concluded that BSFN can accelerate the adsorption/dissociation process of oxygen due to its higher oxygen vacancy concentration compared with BSF, so that ORR is not limited to the three-phase interface but extends to the entire cathode surface.","Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite B-site doped Ln (Nd, Sm) as cathode for high performance Co-free intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.06.124
7,11643,"In addition, in the 80 h long-term stability test at 600 degrees C, the BSFN-based single cell has better long-term stability because the thermal expansion coefficient of BSFN (14.1 x 10 (-6) K (-1)) is lower than that of BSF (14.4 x 10 (-6) K (-1)).","Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite B-site doped Ln (Nd, Sm) as cathode for high performance Co-free intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.06.124
8,11643,"In general, BSFN is expected to become a Co-free base high-performance intermediate temperature SOFC cathode.","Bi0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite B-site doped Ln (Nd, Sm) as cathode for high performance Co-free intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.06.124
