2,19558,The materials were prepared by a solid-state reaction method and revealed the expected cubic perovskite structure.,"Effect of sintering temperature on electrochemical performance of porous SrTi1-xFexO3-δ (x=0.35, 0.5, 0.7) oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1007/s10008-020-04534-0
3,19558,"After milling, the powders were characterised by a sub-micrometre particle size with high sinter-activity.","Effect of sintering temperature on electrochemical performance of porous SrTi1-xFexO3-δ (x=0.35, 0.5, 0.7) oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1007/s10008-020-04534-0
4,19558,"It was shown that the lowest area specific resistance was achieved after sintering SrTi0.65Fe0.35O3 electrodes at 1000 degrees C, and SrTi0.5Fe0.5O3 and SrTi0.30Fe0.70O3 electrodes at 800 degrees C, which can be considered to be a relatively low temperature.","Effect of sintering temperature on electrochemical performance of porous SrTi1-xFexO3-δ (x=0.35, 0.5, 0.7) oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1007/s10008-020-04534-0
5,19558,"In general, EIS measurements showed that increasing the Fe content results in lowered electrode polarisation and a decrease of the series resistance.","Effect of sintering temperature on electrochemical performance of porous SrTi1-xFexO3-δ (x=0.35, 0.5, 0.7) oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1007/s10008-020-04534-0
6,19558,"Even though the studied materials have much lower total conductivities than state-of-the-art electrode materials (e.g. (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O-3), the polarisation resistances obtained in this work can be considered low.","Effect of sintering temperature on electrochemical performance of porous SrTi1-xFexO3-δ (x=0.35, 0.5, 0.7) oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells",10.1007/s10008-020-04534-0
