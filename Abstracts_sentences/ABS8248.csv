1,8248,An innovative cogeneration system based on a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and copper chlorine cycle is being investigated.,Electricity and hydrogen production by integrating two kinds of fuel cells with copper chlorine thermo-chemical cycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234520
2,8248,"Instead of directly making electricity by any thermodynamic cycle or thermoelectric generator, the waste heat from SOFC should be used to make hydrogen through the copper-chlorine cycle (Cu-Cl).",Electricity and hydrogen production by integrating two kinds of fuel cells with copper chlorine thermo-chemical cycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234520
3,8248,A portable polymer exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has been suggested due to its compatibility with portable and non-portable applications.,Electricity and hydrogen production by integrating two kinds of fuel cells with copper chlorine thermo-chemical cycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234520
4,8248,"The obtained results reveal that increasing the current density of SOFC results in higher methane consumption, output power, overpotentials, and hydrogen production.",Electricity and hydrogen production by integrating two kinds of fuel cells with copper chlorine thermo-chemical cycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234520
5,8248,"Furthermore, temperature variation does not have as much influence on power generation and efficiency as current density, where the system efficiency, when operating at 0.7 A/cm2 and SOFC operating temperature of 900-1200 K, varies between 40.4 % and 46.3 %.",Electricity and hydrogen production by integrating two kinds of fuel cells with copper chlorine thermo-chemical cycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234520
6,8248,"Regarding the methane flow rate, as it increases, the output power increases as well, but the efficiency falls.",Electricity and hydrogen production by integrating two kinds of fuel cells with copper chlorine thermo-chemical cycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234520
7,8248,"The system's greatest power output is 677.5 kW and occurs at a methane flow rate of 2.13 mol/s, although the system efficiency is just 39.7 % at that point.",Electricity and hydrogen production by integrating two kinds of fuel cells with copper chlorine thermo-chemical cycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234520
8,8248,"Most importantly, SOFC generates nearly 65 % of the total power, while PEMFC generates around 35 %.",Electricity and hydrogen production by integrating two kinds of fuel cells with copper chlorine thermo-chemical cycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234520
9,8248,"Therefore, the percentage of additional power that PEMFC can produce is around 55 %.",Electricity and hydrogen production by integrating two kinds of fuel cells with copper chlorine thermo-chemical cycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234520
