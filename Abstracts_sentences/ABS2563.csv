1,2563,"Due to the importance of Ni diffusion into the electrolyte of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) during the co-sintering process, we have studied the effects of Ni diffusion on the conductivity degradation and phase change of ceria-doped scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) films.",Effects of Ni diffusion on the accelerated conductivity degradation of scandia-stabilized zirconia films under a reducing atmosphere,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2016.02.007
2,2563,"To fabricate Ni-diffused ScSZ films, ScSZ tapes have been sintered by placing porous NiO plates on both sides of the tape at 1450 degrees C for 10 h. The time-dependent aging behavior of the Ni-diffused ScSZ film (thickness similar to 27 mu m) under reducing conditions has been investigated.",Effects of Ni diffusion on the accelerated conductivity degradation of scandia-stabilized zirconia films under a reducing atmosphere,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2016.02.007
