1,794,"Co-ionic (H+/O2-) electrolytes are fabricated by compositing both proton conductor (BaZr0.85Y0.15O3-delta, BZY) and oxygen-ion conductor (Nd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta, NDC) for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Electrical and physical properties of composite BaZr0.85Y0.15O3-d-Nd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ electrolytes for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.005
2,794,This hybrid electrolyte decreases the electronic loss of NDC under reducing atmospheres and improves the poor sinterability of BZY.,Electrical and physical properties of composite BaZr0.85Y0.15O3-d-Nd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ electrolytes for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.005
3,794,"The electronic conduction caused by the NDC reduction is effectively blocked by the BZY in the composite electrolyte, thus offering both advantages of BZY with its high OCV and more rigid electro-chemo-mechanical property.",Electrical and physical properties of composite BaZr0.85Y0.15O3-d-Nd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ electrolytes for intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.005
