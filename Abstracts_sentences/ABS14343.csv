2,14343,In this study nanometer scaled and nanoporous La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSC) was derived from metal-organic precursors as thin film cathodes of about 200 nm thickness with mean grain sizes ranging from 17 to 90 nm and porosities of up to 45%.,Nanoscaled La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathode: Microstructure and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.147
3,14343,"These microstructures resulted from different processing parameters such as heating rate, calcination temperature and post calcination annealing, and made it possible to study the influence of the electrode microstructure on the electrochemical performance.",Nanoscaled La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathode: Microstructure and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.147
4,14343,"Microstructural characteristics were analyzed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and the performance was evaluated in terms of area specific polarization resistance by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a temperature range of 400-600 degrees C. Polarization resistances as low as 0.023 Omega cm(2) were measured at 600 degrees C, facilitated by a substantial increase of the inner surface area of the nanoscaled microstructure, resulting from low temperature processing at <= 800 degrees C, and by enhanced catalytic properties determined for nanoscaled La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta prepared by metal organic deposition.",Nanoscaled La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathode: Microstructure and electrochemical performance,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.147
