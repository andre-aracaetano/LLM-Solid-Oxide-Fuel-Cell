1,2827,The layer-structure transition-metal oxides have good triple H+/O2-/e(-) charge transport which can promote redox reactions and enhance fuel cell performance.,Ionic Conducting Properties and Fuel Cell Performance Developed by Band Structures,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11914
2,2827,This work has developed ionic transport property based on the layer-structure LiCoO2 (LCO) by tuning the energy band structure with Mg doping also applied for the electrolyte in high-performance low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).,Ionic Conducting Properties and Fuel Cell Performance Developed by Band Structures,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11914
3,2827,Mg-doped LiCoO2 exhibited a hexagonal-layered structure with the R3m space group.,Ionic Conducting Properties and Fuel Cell Performance Developed by Band Structures,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11914
4,2827,"By doping LiCoO2, its band gap was reduced from 2.65 to 2.24 eV. Electrochemical impedance analysis revealed that Mg-doped LCO (LMCO) significantly reduces the polarization loss (charge-transfer resistance) from 0.85 to 0.5 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C; the power output of the fuel cell devices improved from 0.5 to 0.7 W/cm(2), resulting also in better operation durability.",Ionic Conducting Properties and Fuel Cell Performance Developed by Band Structures,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11914
5,2827,Various characterizations on structural and electrochemical properties were conducted.,Ionic Conducting Properties and Fuel Cell Performance Developed by Band Structures,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11914
6,2827,The mechanism was further discussed in relation with the band structure.,Ionic Conducting Properties and Fuel Cell Performance Developed by Band Structures,10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b11914
