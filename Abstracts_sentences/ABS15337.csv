2,15337,Single double perovskite structures could be obtained up to x = 0.9 in syntheses at ambient atmosphere.,"Electrical, Chemical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double Perovskite Oxides Sr2Mg1-xNixMoO6-δ as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp502503e
3,15337,"However, after reduction at 800 degrees C, trace amounts of impurities were detected in the sample with x = 0.9, suggesting that the upper limit for the Ni content (x) in SMNM is less than 0.9 under SOFC operating conditions.","Electrical, Chemical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double Perovskite Oxides Sr2Mg1-xNixMoO6-δ as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp502503e
4,15337,"The electrical conductivity of SMNM increases with increasing Ni content because of the increase in the concentration of electronic defects, [Mo-Mo6+(5+)], and the decreased band gap energy, as revealed by first-principles calculations.","Electrical, Chemical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double Perovskite Oxides Sr2Mg1-xNixMoO6-δ as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp502503e
5,15337,"The substitution of Ni can facilitate the charge-transfer process of the electrode reaction, decrease the polarization resistance, and thus increase the power density of a single cell.","Electrical, Chemical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double Perovskite Oxides Sr2Mg1-xNixMoO6-δ as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp502503e
6,15337,Xray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction measurements were used to explain the reason for the performance improvement.,"Electrical, Chemical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double Perovskite Oxides Sr2Mg1-xNixMoO6-δ as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp502503e
7,15337,SMNM showed good chemical compatibility with Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) but a slight reactivity with the electrolyte La0.8SrO2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta (LSGM) at 1300 degrees C.,"Electrical, Chemical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double Perovskite Oxides Sr2Mg1-xNixMoO6-δ as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp502503e
8,15337,"The use of an SDC buffer layer could avoid the interface reaction between the SMNM anode and the LSGM electrolyte, resulting in better cell performance.","Electrical, Chemical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double Perovskite Oxides Sr2Mg1-xNixMoO6-δ as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp502503e
9,15337,"The Sr2Mg0.3Ni0.7MoO6-delta electrode exhibited a maximal power density of 160 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C with an electrolyte (LSGM, 400 mu m)-supported cell configuration.","Electrical, Chemical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double Perovskite Oxides Sr2Mg1-xNixMoO6-δ as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1021/jp502503e
