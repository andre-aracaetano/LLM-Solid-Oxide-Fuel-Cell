1,14081,Strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) nanoparticles are deposited onto porous yttria-stabilized zirconia frameworks via an ion impregnation/infiltration process.,Electrical performance of nanostructured strontium-doped lanthanum manganite impregnated onto yttria-stabilized zirconia backbone,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.074
2,14081,"The apparent conductivity of the impregnated LSM nanostructure is investigated regarding the fabricating parameters including LSM loading, heat treatment temperature, heating rate, and annealing at 750 degrees C for 400 h. Besides, the conductivity, the intrinsic conductivity as well as Bruggeman factor of the impregnated LSM is estimated from the apparent conductivity using the analytical model for the three-dimensional impregnate network.",Electrical performance of nanostructured strontium-doped lanthanum manganite impregnated onto yttria-stabilized zirconia backbone,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.074
3,14081,"The conductivity increases with LSM loading while the interfacial polarization resistance exhibits the lowest value at an optimal loading of about 5 vol.%, which corresponds to the largest threephase boundary as predicted using the numerical infiltration methodology.",Electrical performance of nanostructured strontium-doped lanthanum manganite impregnated onto yttria-stabilized zirconia backbone,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.074
4,14081,"At the optimal loading, the area specific ohmic resistance of the impregnated LSM is about 0.032 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C for a typical impregnated cathode of 30 mu M thick.",Electrical performance of nanostructured strontium-doped lanthanum manganite impregnated onto yttria-stabilized zirconia backbone,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.074
5,14081,"It is only 5.5% of the cathode interfacial polarization resistance and 3.3% of the total resistance for a single cell consisting of a Ni-YSZ support, a 10 mu m thick electrolyte and a 30 mu m thick cathode, demonstrating that the ohmic resistance is negligible in the LSM impregnated cathode for SOFCs.",Electrical performance of nanostructured strontium-doped lanthanum manganite impregnated onto yttria-stabilized zirconia backbone,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.074
