1,10951,"The microstructure, lattice parameters, morphology, mechanical properties, and conductivity of BaCe0.9M0.1O2.95 (M=Gd, Nd, Sm, Y) were systematically investigated under different atmospheres (in air and in wet 5%H-2-95%Ar).","Effect of rare-earth ions doped in BaCeO3 on chemical stability, mechanical properties, and conductivity properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.069
2,10951,"The XRD results indicated that all of the specimens sintered in air have orthorhombic symmetry, whereas BaCeO3 and BaCe0.9Gd0.1O2.95 decomposed into CeO2 and BaCO3 in their specimens.","Effect of rare-earth ions doped in BaCeO3 on chemical stability, mechanical properties, and conductivity properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.069

4,10951,"The maximum conductivity (sigma(total,800 degrees c) =6.46 x 10(-3) S/cm) and minimum activation energy (E-a=52.3 kJ/mol) measured in air were observed for BaCe0.9Y0.1O2.95 among the BaCeO3-based specimens, Whereas in wet 5%H-2-95%Ar, the maximum conductivity (sigma(total,800 degrees c)=9.20 x 10(-3) S/cm) and minimum activation energy (E-a=55.6 k.T/mol) were measured.","Effect of rare-earth ions doped in BaCeO3 on chemical stability, mechanical properties, and conductivity properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.069
5,10951,The difference in conductivity between the air and wet reducing atmosphere can be explained by the chemical stability.,"Effect of rare-earth ions doped in BaCeO3 on chemical stability, mechanical properties, and conductivity properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.069
6,10951,"The mechanical properties of BaCe0.9M0.1O2.95 significantly depended on the doping element with the rareearth oxide dopants affecting the structure stability, grain size, conductivity, thermal expansion, and the mechanical properties.","Effect of rare-earth ions doped in BaCeO3 on chemical stability, mechanical properties, and conductivity properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.069
7,10951,"Based on a comprehensive evaluation, BaCe0.9Y0.1O2.95 revealed good chemical stability and high conductivity and thus it is a promising candidate for a proton-conducing electrolyte for intennediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).","Effect of rare-earth ions doped in BaCeO3 on chemical stability, mechanical properties, and conductivity properties",10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.03.069
