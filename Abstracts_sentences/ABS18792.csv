4,18792,"No evidence of phase instability of substituted materials was detected in the course of the electrical and thermogravimetric studies down to oxygen partial pressures as low as 10(-19) atm at 950 degrees C. (Gd1-xCax)(2)(Ti1-yMoy)(2)O7-delta ceramics possess moderate thermal expansion coefficients compatible with solid electrolytes, (10.5-10.7) x 10(-6) K-1 at 25-1100 degrees C in air, and demonstrate remarkable dimensional stability with nearly zero chemical expansion down to p(O-2)",Mixed ionic-electronic conductivity and thermochemical expansion of Ca and Mo co-substituted pyrochlore-type Gd2Ti2O7,10.1039/c6ra14600g
