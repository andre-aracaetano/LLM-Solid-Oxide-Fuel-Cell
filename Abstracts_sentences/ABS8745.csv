1,8745,Two anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been connected by a co-sintered ceramic interconnector to form a stack.,Performance of an anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells stack with two single cells connected by a co-sintered ceramic interconnector,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.084
2,8745,"This novel bilayered ceramic interconnector consists of La-doped SrTiO(3) (La(0.4)Sr(0.6)TiO(3)) and Sr-doped lanthanum manganite (La(0.8)Sr(0.2)MnO(3)), which is fabricated by co-sintering with green anode at 1380 degrees C for 3 h. La(0.4)Sr(0.6)TiO(3) (LST) acts as a barrier avoiding the outward diffusion of H(2) to the cathode; while La(0.8)Sr(0.2)MnO(3) (LSM) prevents O(2) from diffusing inward to the anode.",Performance of an anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells stack with two single cells connected by a co-sintered ceramic interconnector,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.084

4,8745,The resistances between anode and LST/LSM interconnector at different temperatures are determined by AC impedance spectra.,Performance of an anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells stack with two single cells connected by a co-sintered ceramic interconnector,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.084
5,8745,The results have showed that the bilayered LST/LSM is adequate for SOFC interconnector application.,Performance of an anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells stack with two single cells connected by a co-sintered ceramic interconnector,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.084
6,8745,The active area is 2 cm(2) for interconnector and 16 cm(2) for the total cathode of the stack.,Performance of an anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells stack with two single cells connected by a co-sintered ceramic interconnector,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.084
7,8745,"When operating at 900 degrees C, 850 degrees C, 800 degrees C with H(2) as fuel and O(2) as oxidant, the maximum power density of the stack are 353 mW cm(-2), 285 mW cm(-2) and 237.5 mW cm(-2), respectively, i.e., approximately 80% power output efficiency can be achieved compared with the total of the two single cells.",Performance of an anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells stack with two single cells connected by a co-sintered ceramic interconnector,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.084
