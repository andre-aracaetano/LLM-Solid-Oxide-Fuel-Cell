3,18207,The simulations found that step changes in the average current density cause the stack temperature to alter during both exothermic and endothermic operation.,Hydrogen production through steam electrolysis: Model-based dynamic behaviour of a cathode-supported intermediate temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.02.026
4,18207,"However, the temperature control, by the variation of the air flow through the stack, was predicted to be capable of returning the stack temperature to the initial value.",Hydrogen production through steam electrolysis: Model-based dynamic behaviour of a cathode-supported intermediate temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.02.026
5,18207,"Furthermore, the proposed control strategy is observed to reduce the interim temperature excursions between the initial and final steady states, suggesting that such a control strategy has a good potential to prevent the issues of cell component fracture, and transitions in stack operating mode, which are related to the temperature fluctuations during dynamic operation of an SOEC stack.",Hydrogen production through steam electrolysis: Model-based dynamic behaviour of a cathode-supported intermediate temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.02.026
