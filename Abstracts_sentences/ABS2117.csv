1,2117,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack concept is described which comprises condensed-tubes like extruded honeycomb sections of ceramic electrolyte (ZrO2-based) and interconnectors of nickel sheet as key elements.,Solid oxide fuel cell stacks using extruded honeycomb type elements,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00289-X
2,2117,"According to this concept, well known and extensively tested construction principles can be realised in a low-cost production.",Solid oxide fuel cell stacks using extruded honeycomb type elements,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00289-X
3,2117,The cells are self-supported with in-plane conduction.,Solid oxide fuel cell stacks using extruded honeycomb type elements,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00289-X
4,2117,"A demonstrator model stack of five honeycomb elements and six nickel sheet seals/interconnectors was built and operated for 860 h at 1000 degrees C. Volumetric power densities of 160 kW/m(3) were obtained with H-2 vs. air, of close to 200 kW/m(3) with H-2 VS. O-2.",Solid oxide fuel cell stacks using extruded honeycomb type elements,10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00289-X
