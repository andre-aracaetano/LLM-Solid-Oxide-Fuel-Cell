1,16698,The objective of this effort is to synthesize and characterize a series of lanthanum-(La) doped Sr2MgMoO6 (SMMO) and La-doped Sr2MgNbO6 (SMNO) anode materials which can be used in combination with lanthanum-containing electrolytes to mitigate the effects of lanthanum poisoning in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Sr2-XLaXMgMoO6 and Sr2-XLaXMgNbO6 for Use as Sulfur-Tolerant Anodes Without a Buffer Layer,10.1111/jace.13208
2,16698,"Currently, an La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 (LDC) buffer layer is used with many perovskite-based anode materials to prevent La diffusion into the anode from the La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.8 (LSGM) electrolyte which can create a resistive La species that impedes electrochemical performance.",Sr2-XLaXMgMoO6 and Sr2-XLaXMgNbO6 for Use as Sulfur-Tolerant Anodes Without a Buffer Layer,10.1111/jace.13208
