1,19751,Hydrogen production via water electrolysis using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) has attracted considerable attention because of its favorable thermodynamics and kinetics.,3D Self-Architectured Steam Electrode Enabled Efficient and Durable Hydrogen Production in a Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell at Temperatures Lower Than 600 °C,10.1002/advs.201800360
2,19751,It is considered as the most efficient and low-cost option for hydrogen production from renewable energies.,3D Self-Architectured Steam Electrode Enabled Efficient and Durable Hydrogen Production in a Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell at Temperatures Lower Than 600 °C,10.1002/advs.201800360
3,19751,"By using proton-conducting electrolyte (H-SOECs), the operating temperature can be reduced from beyond 800 to 600 degrees C or even lower due to its higher conductivity and lower activation energy.",3D Self-Architectured Steam Electrode Enabled Efficient and Durable Hydrogen Production in a Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell at Temperatures Lower Than 600 °C,10.1002/advs.201800360
4,19751,"Technical barriers associated with the conventional oxygen-ion conducting SOECs (O-SOECs), that is, hydrogen separation and electrode instability that is primarily due to the Ni oxidation at high steam concentration and delamination associated with oxygen evolution, can be remarkably mitigated.",3D Self-Architectured Steam Electrode Enabled Efficient and Durable Hydrogen Production in a Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell at Temperatures Lower Than 600 °C,10.1002/advs.201800360
5,19751,"Here, a self-architectured ultraporous (SAUP) 3D steam electrode is developed for efficient H-SOECs below 600 degrees C.",3D Self-Architectured Steam Electrode Enabled Efficient and Durable Hydrogen Production in a Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell at Temperatures Lower Than 600 °C,10.1002/advs.201800360
6,19751,"At 600 degrees C, the electrolysis current density reaches 2.02 A cm(-2) at 1.6 V. Instead of fast degradation in most O-SOECs, performance enhancement is observed during electrolysis at an applied voltage of 1.6 V at 500 degrees C for over 75 h, attributed to the bridging effect originating from reorganization of the steam electrode.",3D Self-Architectured Steam Electrode Enabled Efficient and Durable Hydrogen Production in a Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell at Temperatures Lower Than 600 °C,10.1002/advs.201800360
7,19751,"The H-SOEC with SAUP steam electrode demonstrates excellent performance, promising a new prospective for next-generation steam electrolysis at reduced temperatures.",3D Self-Architectured Steam Electrode Enabled Efficient and Durable Hydrogen Production in a Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell at Temperatures Lower Than 600 °C,10.1002/advs.201800360
