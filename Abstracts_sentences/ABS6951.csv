1,6951,Compatibility of mica glass-ceramics as gas-sealing material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) has been investigated.,Compatibility of mica glass-ceramics as gas-sealing materials for SOFC,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.575
2,6951,Thermal expansion behavior and refractoriness were roughly suitable for SOFC constituent materials.,Compatibility of mica glass-ceramics as gas-sealing materials for SOFC,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.575
3,6951,"The mica glass-ceramics joined solid electrolyte (8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia, 8YSZ) to separator (calcium doped lanthanum chromite, La0.8Ca0.22CrO3) in the temperature range of about 1000 to 1300 degrees C. The mica glass-ceramics are chemically stable to electrolyte and a serious chemical reaction was not observed through the connected interface between mica glass-ceramics and electrolyte.",Compatibility of mica glass-ceramics as gas-sealing materials for SOFC,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.575
4,6951,The joining between mica glass-cermics and separator was caused by the melting of residual glass matrix and an intermediate layer was formed by chemical reactions at the interface.,Compatibility of mica glass-ceramics as gas-sealing materials for SOFC,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.575
5,6951,A single cell unit consisted of a single cell and two separators was made using this mica glass-ceramics.,Compatibility of mica glass-ceramics as gas-sealing materials for SOFC,10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.64.575
