1,3425,"The compound Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35, a typical Aurivillius-type fast oxygen ion conductor, was evaluated as a possible cathode material for single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cells operated under mixed propane and oxygen.",Evaluation of Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35-an Aurivillius-Type Conducting Oxide-as a Cathode Material for Single-Chamber Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182729
2,3425,The material was found to be structurally stable under various C3H8 + O-2 environments over a wide temperature range and furthermore displayed low catalytic activity for propane oxidation.,Evaluation of Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35-an Aurivillius-Type Conducting Oxide-as a Cathode Material for Single-Chamber Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182729
3,3425,"However, at temperatures above 650 degrees C, detrimental reactions between the cathode and the ceria electrolyte occurred, producing low conductivity interfacial phases.",Evaluation of Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35-an Aurivillius-Type Conducting Oxide-as a Cathode Material for Single-Chamber Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182729
4,3425,"At these high temperatures the cathode additionally underwent extensive sintering and loss of porosity and, thus, stable fuel cell operation was limited to furnace temperatures of <600 degrees C. Even under such conditions, however, the partial oxidation occurring at the anode (a ceria nickel cermet) resulted in cell temperatures as much as 70-110 degrees C higher than the gas-phase temperature.",Evaluation of Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35-an Aurivillius-Type Conducting Oxide-as a Cathode Material for Single-Chamber Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182729
5,3425,This explains the sharp decrease in fuel cell performance with time during operation at a furnace temperature of 586 degrees C.,Evaluation of Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35-an Aurivillius-Type Conducting Oxide-as a Cathode Material for Single-Chamber Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182729
6,3425,"Under optimized conditions, a peak power density of similar to 60 mW/cm(2) was obtained, which does not compete with recent values obtained from higher activity cathodes.",Evaluation of Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35-an Aurivillius-Type Conducting Oxide-as a Cathode Material for Single-Chamber Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182729
7,3425,"Thus, the poor electrochemical activity of Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35, combined with its chemical instability at higher temperatures, discourages further consideration of this material as a cathode in single-chamber fuel cells.",Evaluation of Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35-an Aurivillius-Type Conducting Oxide-as a Cathode Material for Single-Chamber Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.3182729
