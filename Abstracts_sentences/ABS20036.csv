2,20036,with a double layer coating of 10 nm cerium (inner layer) and 630 nm cobalt was investigated and in addition the uncoated material was exposed for comparison.,Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Evolution of electrical properties,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.029
3,20036,The main purpose of this investigation was the development of a suitable ASR characterization method.,Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Evolution of electrical properties,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.029
4,20036,"The material was exposed to a simulated cathode atmosphere of air with 3% water at 850 degrees C and the samples were exposed for up to 1500 h. We compared two methods of ASR measurements, an in-situ method where samples were measured with platinum electrodes for longer exposure times and an ex-situ method where pre-oxidized samples were measured for only very short measurement times.",Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Evolution of electrical properties,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.029
5,20036,It was found that the ASR of ex-situ characterized samples could be linked to the mass gain and the electrical properties could be linked to the evolving microstructure during the different stages of exposure.,Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Evolution of electrical properties,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.029
6,20036,Both the degradation of the electric performance and the oxygen uptake (mass gain) followed similar trends.,Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Evolution of electrical properties,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.029
7,20036,After about 1500 h of exposure an ASR value of about 15 m Omega cm(2) was reached.,Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Evolution of electrical properties,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.029
8,20036,The in-situ measured samples suffered from severe corrosion attack during measurement.,Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Evolution of electrical properties,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.029
9,20036,After only 500 h of exposure already a value of 35 m Omega cm(2) was obtained.,Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Evolution of electrical properties,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.029
