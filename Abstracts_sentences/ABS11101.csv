4,11101,"NNO-CGO composite cathodes were successfully sintered on YSZ electrolyte at 1000 degrees C. By using La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (delta) (LSC) as current collector, the cell with 70NNO-30CGO composite cathode sintered at 1000 degrees C exhibited the highest power density of 620 mW cm (2) (at 0.7 V) and the lowest polarization resistance of 0.302 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Short-term durability studies revealed that the degradation of cell performance was attributed to the crack formation on the LSC current collector layer and the delamination between NNO-CGO cathode layer and LSC current collector layer.",Fabrication and electrochemical characterizations of Nd2NiO4+δ-Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ composite cathodes for anode-supported intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.034
