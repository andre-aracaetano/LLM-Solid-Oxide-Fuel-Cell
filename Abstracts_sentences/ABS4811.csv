1,4811,"Currently used ferritic stainless steel interconnects are unsuitable for practical applications in solid oxide fuel cells operated at intermediate temperatures due to chromium volatility, poisoning of the cathode material, rapidly decreasing electrical conductivity and a low oxidation resistance.",LaCrO3-based coatings deposited by high-energy micro-arc alloying process on a ferritic stainless steel interconnect material,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.023
2,4811,"To overcome these problems, a novel, simple and cost-effective high-energy micro-arc alloying (HEMAA) process is proposed to prepare LaCrO3-based coatings for the type 430 stainless steel interconnects.",LaCrO3-based coatings deposited by high-energy micro-arc alloying process on a ferritic stainless steel interconnect material,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.023
3,4811,"However, it is much difficult to deposit an oxide coating by HEMAA than a metallic coating due to the high brittleness of oxide electrodes for deposition.",LaCrO3-based coatings deposited by high-energy micro-arc alloying process on a ferritic stainless steel interconnect material,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.023
4,4811,"Therefore, a Cr-alloying layer is firstly obtained on the alloy surface by HEMAA using a Cr electrode rod, followed by a LaCrO3-based coating using an electrode rod of LaCrO3-20 wt.%Ni, with a metallurgical bonding between the coating and the substrate.",LaCrO3-based coatings deposited by high-energy micro-arc alloying process on a ferritic stainless steel interconnect material,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.023
5,4811,"The preliminary oxidation tests at 850 degrees C in air indicate that the LaCrO3-based coatings showed a three-layered microstructure with a NiFe2O4 outer layer, a thick LaCrO3 sub-layer and a thin Cr2O3-rich inner layer, which thereby possesses an excellent protectiveness to the substrate alloy and a low electrical contact resistance.",LaCrO3-based coatings deposited by high-energy micro-arc alloying process on a ferritic stainless steel interconnect material,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.023
