1,5099,"Thermal cycle characteristics of electrolyte plate, positive electrode/electrolyte/negative electrode(PEN), and single cell with alumina gas manifold in planar solid oxide fuel cell have been studied as a function of cooling and heating rates in the range of 2 to 8 degrees C/min.",Thermal cycle characteristics of electrolyte and single cell in planar solid oxide fuel cell,
2,5099,"After thermal cycle test, no cracks in both electrolyte plate and PEN were observed in the whole range of heating and cooling rates.",Thermal cycle characteristics of electrolyte and single cell in planar solid oxide fuel cell,
3,5099,"On the other hand, the single cell caused cracking at the thermal cycle condition of 3 degrees C/min and above, which is due to difference in the thermal expansion coefficients between the PEN plate and alumina gas manifold.",Thermal cycle characteristics of electrolyte and single cell in planar solid oxide fuel cell,
4,5099,"Also, thermal cycle effect on single cell performance was examined.",Thermal cycle characteristics of electrolyte and single cell in planar solid oxide fuel cell,
5,5099,"After thermal cycle, the cell performance and the open circuit voltage decreased considerably.",Thermal cycle characteristics of electrolyte and single cell in planar solid oxide fuel cell,
6,5099,These results were discussed as related to the electrochemical and material aspects of the electrodes and electrolyte.,Thermal cycle characteristics of electrolyte and single cell in planar solid oxide fuel cell,
