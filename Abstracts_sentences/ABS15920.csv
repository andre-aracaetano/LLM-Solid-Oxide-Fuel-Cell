1,15920,"The effect of composition on the structure of the new solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) perovskite (La1-xSrx)(Cr0.85Fe0.05Co0.05Ni0.05) O3-delta is studied using x-ray diffractometry, pycnometry, and Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy.",Structural study of a sol-gel derived novel solid oxide fuel cell perovskite:: (La1-xSrx)(Cr0.85Fe0.05Co0.05Ni0.05)O3-δ,10.1088/0953-8984/19/19/196209
2,15920,"Samples were synthesized using the Pechini method via doping the La site with Sr2+, to a composition with x = 0-0.4 mole fraction, and at the Cr site with 0.05 mol of Co2+, Fe2+ and Ni2+, and the structural results were compared with those for orthorhombic LaCrO3.",Structural study of a sol-gel derived novel solid oxide fuel cell perovskite:: (La1-xSrx)(Cr0.85Fe0.05Co0.05Ni0.05)O3-δ,10.1088/0953-8984/19/19/196209
3,15920,The samples were orthorhombic perovskite of the Pnma space group.,Structural study of a sol-gel derived novel solid oxide fuel cell perovskite:: (La1-xSrx)(Cr0.85Fe0.05Co0.05Ni0.05)O3-δ,10.1088/0953-8984/19/19/196209
4,15920,"A second phase, monoclinic SrCrO4, was also observed, whose content increased linearly with increasing x.",Structural study of a sol-gel derived novel solid oxide fuel cell perovskite:: (La1-xSrx)(Cr0.85Fe0.05Co0.05Ni0.05)O3-δ,10.1088/0953-8984/19/19/196209
5,15920,"A large decrease in the lattice and hence volume was observed for the sample with x = 0.1, which was accompanied by a sharp decrease in the Cr-O bond length, tilt angle and crystallite size.",Structural study of a sol-gel derived novel solid oxide fuel cell perovskite:: (La1-xSrx)(Cr0.85Fe0.05Co0.05Ni0.05)O3-δ,10.1088/0953-8984/19/19/196209
6,15920,"The structural parameters were almost invariant for x = 0.1-0.4, probably due to an increase in content of the high valence cations of smaller ionic radii, as suggested by an increase in the intensity of the defect band (similar to 515 cm(-1), IR).",Structural study of a sol-gel derived novel solid oxide fuel cell perovskite:: (La1-xSrx)(Cr0.85Fe0.05Co0.05Ni0.05)O3-δ,10.1088/0953-8984/19/19/196209
7,15920,"The octahedral CrO6 stretching, bending and tilting modes were found shifted accordingly.",Structural study of a sol-gel derived novel solid oxide fuel cell perovskite:: (La1-xSrx)(Cr0.85Fe0.05Co0.05Ni0.05)O3-δ,10.1088/0953-8984/19/19/196209
8,15920,A mechanism employing a partial-charge model was proposed to explain the results.,Structural study of a sol-gel derived novel solid oxide fuel cell perovskite:: (La1-xSrx)(Cr0.85Fe0.05Co0.05Ni0.05)O3-δ,10.1088/0953-8984/19/19/196209
