1,15299,"La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta-Y0.16Zr0.84O2-delta (LSM-YSZ) composites have been widely used as the oxygen electrodes in solid oxide cells (SOCs), however, their poor activities for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions result in relatively low cell performance.",Impregnated LSM-YSZ electrodes with RuO2/SDC nanocomposites for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.354
2,15299,A common method to promote electrocatalytic activities of LSM-YSZ composites is to tailor the microstructure by impregnation.,Impregnated LSM-YSZ electrodes with RuO2/SDC nanocomposites for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.354
3,15299,"In this study, nanocomposite catalysts are developed by one-pot infiltration, where nano scale particles of RuO2 and Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) are highly dispersed to achieve a uniform distribution with reduced particle sizes.",Impregnated LSM-YSZ electrodes with RuO2/SDC nanocomposites for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.354
4,15299,Impedance measurements of symmetrical oxygen electrode cells reveal that modifying LSM-YSZ electrodes with SDC and RuO2/SDC can substantially promote their activities for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR).,Impregnated LSM-YSZ electrodes with RuO2/SDC nanocomposites for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.354
5,15299,"The measured polarization resistances at 750 degrees C in air are 2.23, 0.24 and 0.14 Omega cm2 for the blank, SDC and RuO2/SDC modified LSM-YSZ electrodes, respectively.",Impregnated LSM-YSZ electrodes with RuO2/SDC nanocomposites for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.354
6,15299,"Compared to pure SDC, RuO2/SDC composites show higher ORR promotion, which can be correlated with their more surface oxygen vacancies.",Impregnated LSM-YSZ electrodes with RuO2/SDC nanocomposites for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.354
7,15299,"Solid oxide cells with thin YSZ electrolytes, RuO2/SDC impregnated LSM-YSZ oxygen electrode substrates and thin fuel electrodes of La0.3Sr1.55Fe1.5Ni0.1Mo0.4O6 achieve a peak power density of 0.7 W cm-2 at 750 degrees C in the fuel cell mode and a steam electrolysis current density of 2.31 A cm-2 at 1.3 V and 800 degrees C in the electrolysis mode.",Impregnated LSM-YSZ electrodes with RuO2/SDC nanocomposites for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.354
