1,16933,Pyrolysis experiments of n-hexane were performed and the product distribution and fuel consumption were measured as a function of temperature.,Hydrocarbon fuel effects in solid-oxide fuel cell operation:: an experimental and modeling study of n-hexane pyrolysis,10.1039/b702860a
2,16933,"The experimental temperatures ranged from 550-675 degrees C, with a pressure of similar to 1 atm, and residence times of similar to 5 s. N-Hexane was used as a model compound to represent the linear alkanes that might be found in practical hydrocarbon fuels.",Hydrocarbon fuel effects in solid-oxide fuel cell operation:: an experimental and modeling study of n-hexane pyrolysis,10.1039/b702860a
3,16933,"Under these conditions, high fuel conversion was observed at the higher temperatures and a wide range of products were formed.",Hydrocarbon fuel effects in solid-oxide fuel cell operation:: an experimental and modeling study of n-hexane pyrolysis,10.1039/b702860a
4,16933,The experimental observations were compared to predictions from a plug-flow model using a reaction mechanism consisting of 205 species and 1403 reactions.,Hydrocarbon fuel effects in solid-oxide fuel cell operation:: an experimental and modeling study of n-hexane pyrolysis,10.1039/b702860a

6,16933,The only model modification was adjustment of the A-factor of the initiation rates to match conversion at one temperature.,Hydrocarbon fuel effects in solid-oxide fuel cell operation:: an experimental and modeling study of n-hexane pyrolysis,10.1039/b702860a
7,16933,This model was able to successfully predict the observed trends in both product selectivities as well as fuel conversion over the temperature range.,Hydrocarbon fuel effects in solid-oxide fuel cell operation:: an experimental and modeling study of n-hexane pyrolysis,10.1039/b702860a
8,16933,The mechanism was also used to capture the trends previously observed in n-butane pyrolysis under similar experimental conditions.,Hydrocarbon fuel effects in solid-oxide fuel cell operation:: an experimental and modeling study of n-hexane pyrolysis,10.1039/b702860a
9,16933,Significant differences in the sensitivity coefficients for the hexane and butane systems are discussed in terms of the competition between P-scission and isomerization of the initial radicals formed.,Hydrocarbon fuel effects in solid-oxide fuel cell operation:: an experimental and modeling study of n-hexane pyrolysis,10.1039/b702860a
10,16933,The kinetic model predicts that n-hexane will be completely converted within 0.1 s in the higher temperature environment (similar to 800 degrees C of the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Hydrocarbon fuel effects in solid-oxide fuel cell operation:: an experimental and modeling study of n-hexane pyrolysis,10.1039/b702860a
11,16933,"This result clearly illustrates the need to explicitly account for gas-phase reactions in SOFC models for those cases where hydrocarbons, especially those larger than methane, are fed directly to an SOFC.",Hydrocarbon fuel effects in solid-oxide fuel cell operation:: an experimental and modeling study of n-hexane pyrolysis,10.1039/b702860a
