1,11222,"The effect of polarization treatment on the interface between (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSM) cathode and Y2O3-ZrO2 (YSZ) electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells has been studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy.","Effect of polarization on the interface between (La,Sr) MnO3 electrode and Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte",10.1149/1.1847689
2,11222,It has been found that the polarization has a significant effect not only on the electrocatalytic activities of the LSM electrode but also on the topography and morphology of the interface between the LSM electrode and YSZ electrolyte.,"Effect of polarization on the interface between (La,Sr) MnO3 electrode and Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte",10.1149/1.1847689
3,11222,The formation of a convex ring on the YSZ electrolyte surface and its subsequent broadening under various polarization treatments indicate that O-2 reduction and oxidation reactions most likely occur at the O-2/LSM/YSZ three-phase boundary areas.,"Effect of polarization on the interface between (La,Sr) MnO3 electrode and Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte",10.1149/1.1847689
4,11222,The width of the three-phase boundary was estimated to be 0.15 +/- 0.05 mum.,"Effect of polarization on the interface between (La,Sr) MnO3 electrode and Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte",10.1149/1.1847689
