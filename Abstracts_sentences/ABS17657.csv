4,17657,"Based on the example of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9, mechanical structures built from these materials should exhibit exceptional mechanical stability and are therefore very attractive for use as components of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) or other devices subjected to large and frequent temperature variations.",Practical applications of the chemical strain effect in ionic and mixed conductors,10.1007/s00706-009-0122-x
5,17657,The ability of these materials to withstand large strain without accumulating large stress also makes them potentially useful as flexible elements in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).,Practical applications of the chemical strain effect in ionic and mixed conductors,10.1007/s00706-009-0122-x
