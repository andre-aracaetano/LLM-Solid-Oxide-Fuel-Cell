2,7065,This research evaluated the role of pore former loading in the anode layer to optimize the trade-off between cell performance and flatness.,Optimization of SOFC Anode Microstructure for Performance and Highly Scalable Cells Through Graded Porosity,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3ad5
3,7065,It was found that intermediate levels of organic loading through pore former resulted in the highest performance while also the greatest degree of curvature.,Optimization of SOFC Anode Microstructure for Performance and Highly Scalable Cells Through Graded Porosity,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3ad5
4,7065,Grading the porosity such that it decreases towards the electrolyte improved the performance at lower temperatures and fuel ratios.,Optimization of SOFC Anode Microstructure for Performance and Highly Scalable Cells Through Graded Porosity,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3ad5
5,7065,"Graded anodes only improved flatness when larger loadings of pore former were used, but this resulted in a loss of performance.",Optimization of SOFC Anode Microstructure for Performance and Highly Scalable Cells Through Graded Porosity,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3ad5
6,7065,"When considering both flatness and curvature, graded anodes resulted in cells that were flat and had decent but not the highest performance.",Optimization of SOFC Anode Microstructure for Performance and Highly Scalable Cells Through Graded Porosity,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3ad5
7,7065,"Based on our results, the anode microstructure closest to the electrolyte strongly affects performance, while the microstructure towards the fuel affects flatness.",Optimization of SOFC Anode Microstructure for Performance and Highly Scalable Cells Through Graded Porosity,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3ad5
