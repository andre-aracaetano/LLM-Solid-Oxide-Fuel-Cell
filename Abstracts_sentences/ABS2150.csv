1,2150,"This work presents a novel integrated system for the multigeneration of power, space heating, freshwater, and ammonium bicarbonate as a useful chemical commodity with a geothermal-based carbon capturing system.",A novel multigeneration ammonia-based carbon capturing system powered by a geothermal power plant for cleaner applications,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129017
2,2150,A thermodynamic model based on energy and exergy analyses is developed for this integrated system.,A novel multigeneration ammonia-based carbon capturing system powered by a geothermal power plant for cleaner applications,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129017
3,2150,The results from the model show that the new carbon capturing unit that is based on an electrochemical ammonia synthesizer requires 13.3% less energy to capture the carbon dioxide released from the solid-oxide fuel cell subsystem than using a combination of proton-exchange membrane electrolyzer and a Haber-Bosch process.,A novel multigeneration ammonia-based carbon capturing system powered by a geothermal power plant for cleaner applications,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129017
4,2150,"Also, the present integrated system produces ammonium bicarbonate sufficiently at a rate of 0.634 kg s(-1), when the fuel cell produces 2010 kW of electric power.",A novel multigeneration ammonia-based carbon capturing system powered by a geothermal power plant for cleaner applications,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129017
5,2150,"In addition, the energy and exergy efficiencies of the solid-oxide fuel cell subsystem are found to be 44.5%, and 50.5%, respectively.",A novel multigeneration ammonia-based carbon capturing system powered by a geothermal power plant for cleaner applications,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129017
6,2150,"Then, parametric studies are conducted to see how this integrated system behaves under varying conditions.",A novel multigeneration ammonia-based carbon capturing system powered by a geothermal power plant for cleaner applications,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129017
7,2150,It is found that the geothermal fluid and the faradaic efficiency of the electrochemical ammonia synthesizer have major effects on the performance of the geothermal-based carbon capturing system and they can lower the energy requirements of the carbon capturing to as low as 8.28 MJ kg(-1) of carbon dioxide.,A novel multigeneration ammonia-based carbon capturing system powered by a geothermal power plant for cleaner applications,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129017
