1,5579,"In solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks, the volatile boron species present in the sealing glass often react with the lanthanum-containing cathode, degrading the activity of the cathode (this phenomenon is known as boron poisoning).",Controlling the reaction between boron-containing sealing glass and a lanthanum-containing cathode by adding Nb2O5,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.075
2,5579,"In this work, we report that this detrimental reaction can be effectively reduced by doping bismuth-containing borosilicate sealing glass-ceramic with a niobium dopant The addition of Nb2O5 not only condenses the [SiO4] structural units in the glass network, but also promotes the conversion of [BO3] to [BO4].",Controlling the reaction between boron-containing sealing glass and a lanthanum-containing cathode by adding Nb2O5,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.075
3,5579,"Moreover, the Nb2O5 dopant enhances the formation of boron containing phases (Ca3B2O6 and CaB2Si2O8), which significantly reduces the volatility of boron compounds in the sealing glass, suppressing the formation of LaBO3 in the reaction couple between the glass and the cathode.",Controlling the reaction between boron-containing sealing glass and a lanthanum-containing cathode by adding Nb2O5,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.075
