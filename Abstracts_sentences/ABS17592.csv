1,17592,A novel BaCe0.7In0.05Ta0.05Y0.1O3-delta (BCITY) electrolyte membrane was fabricated on a NiO-BCITY (mass ratio: 6:4) composite anode by combing solid state reaction and Pechini method.,"High performance In, Ta and Y-doped BaCeO3 electrolyte membrane for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2018.04.021
2,17592,"The BCITY membrane exhibits high sintering activity, conductivity and apparently improved chemical stability in boiled water or 100% CO2 at 600 degrees C. Using the mixture of La0.7Sr0.3FeO3-delta (LSF) and BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY) with mass ratio of 7:3 as the composite cathode, a single cell with BCITY electrolyte generated the maximum power densities of 315, 303, 274, 200, and 116 mW/cm(2) at 750, 700, 650, 600, and 550 degrees C, respectively.","High performance In, Ta and Y-doped BaCeO3 electrolyte membrane for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2018.04.021
3,17592,No detectable variations of open circuit voltage and power density were observed for the cell worked at 600 degrees C for 100 h. The interface resistance of the cell was also studied under open circuit condition.,"High performance In, Ta and Y-doped BaCeO3 electrolyte membrane for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2018.04.021
