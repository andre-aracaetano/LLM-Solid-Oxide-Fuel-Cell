1,10015,NiO-La0.3Ce1.1O2-delta(LDC30) novel anode was investigated for IT-SOFCs( Intermediate Temperature-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells) with LaGaO3-based electrolyte.,Investigation of novel anode NiO-La0.3Ce0.7O2-δ of IT-SOFC with LSGM-based electrolyte,
2,10015,"The results showed that LDC30 has a suitable chemical compatibility with NiO and NiO-LDC30 has a good thermal expansion matching with LDC30 interlayer and LSGM(La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta) electrolyte, so NiO-LDC30/LDC30 was considered as a feasible and novel anode system.",Investigation of novel anode NiO-La0.3Ce0.7O2-δ of IT-SOFC with LSGM-based electrolyte,
3,10015,It was also shown that NiO content plays a key role on polarization performance and morphology of the anode.,Investigation of novel anode NiO-La0.3Ce0.7O2-δ of IT-SOFC with LSGM-based electrolyte,
4,10015,"When the content of NiO was 60% (mass fraction), the polarization loss of anode was the lowest.",Investigation of novel anode NiO-La0.3Ce0.7O2-δ of IT-SOFC with LSGM-based electrolyte,
5,10015,Next we will optimize the porosity and sintering procedure to modify the microstructure and performance of the anode.,Investigation of novel anode NiO-La0.3Ce0.7O2-δ of IT-SOFC with LSGM-based electrolyte,
