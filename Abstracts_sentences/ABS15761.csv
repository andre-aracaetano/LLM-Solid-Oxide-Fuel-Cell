1,15761,The durability and electro-catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) cathode often suffer from severe degradation due to poisoning effects such as Cr from interconnectors.,Enhanced Cr-tolerance of an SOFC cathode by an efficient electro-catalyst coating,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104704
2,15761,"Here we report our findings in the development of a Cr-tolerant catalyst, BaCoO3-x (BCO) nano-particles, which can dramatically enhance the ORR activity and durability of a state-of-the-art La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x (LSCF) cathode exposed to Crofer 22APU.",Enhanced Cr-tolerance of an SOFC cathode by an efficient electro-catalyst coating,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104704
3,15761,"For example, the polarization resistance (R-p) of a bare LSCF cathode increases from similar to 0.4 to similar to 1.5 Omega cm(2) after 100 hs exposure to Cr in air with 3% H2O at 750 degrees C.",Enhanced Cr-tolerance of an SOFC cathode by an efficient electro-catalyst coating,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104704
4,15761,"In contrast, R-p of a BCO-coated LSCF cathode remains to be similar to 0.05 Omega cm(2) under the same condition, suggesting that BCO is catalytically active to ORR but inert to Cr-poisoning.",Enhanced Cr-tolerance of an SOFC cathode by an efficient electro-catalyst coating,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104704
5,15761,"At 700 degrees C, the single cells with the BCO-coated LSCF cathode show an excellent peak power density of similar to 0.514 Wcm(-2) and significantly enhanced durability (degradation rate of 0.086 %h(-1) at 0.8 V), much better than those of cells with a bare LSCF cathode (similar to 0.448 Wcm(-2) and degradation rate of 0.31 % h(-1) at 0.8 V).",Enhanced Cr-tolerance of an SOFC cathode by an efficient electro-catalyst coating,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104704
6,15761,"Raman analysis indicated that the presence of the BCO catalyst coating greatly reduced the amount of Cr accumulated on the cathode surface, thus alleviating the formation of SrCrO4.",Enhanced Cr-tolerance of an SOFC cathode by an efficient electro-catalyst coating,10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104704
