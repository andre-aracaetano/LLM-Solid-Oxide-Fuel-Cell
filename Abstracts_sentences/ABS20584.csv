1,20584,"Pr0.4Sr0.6(Co0.2Fe0.8)(1-x)MoxO3-sigma (PSCFMx, x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2), which obtained by doping molybdenum at the B site of Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3-sigma (PSCF) cathode, have been synthesized by a solid state reaction method and studied towards the application as symmetrical electrode materials for symmetrical SOFCs (SSOFCs) in this study.","B-site Mo-doped perovskite Pr0.4Sr0.6 (Co0.2Fe0.8)1-xMoxO3-σ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2) as electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.141
2,20584,"It is found that cubic perovskite phase of PSCFM in the Pm/3 m space group is formed after sintered at 1100 degrees C for PSCFMx (x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1) samples, and the main phase is converted to K2NiF4 structure identified as SrPrFeO4 in the 14/m space group, and some new phases of Pr2O3 and CoFe-alloy appear after PSCFMx is heat-treated in dry H-2 at 900 degrees C for 2 h. The K2NiF4 structure SrPrFeO4 can be transferred to a pure cubic structure of PSCFMx again by calcining it in air at 900 degrees C.","B-site Mo-doped perovskite Pr0.4Sr0.6 (Co0.2Fe0.8)1-xMoxO3-σ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2) as electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.141
3,20584,"The maximum power densities of a single SSOFC based on the PSCFM0.05 symmetrical electrode, which shows the lowest polarization resistances (R-p), are 493 and 160 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C in H-2 and CH4, respectively.","B-site Mo-doped perovskite Pr0.4Sr0.6 (Co0.2Fe0.8)1-xMoxO3-σ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2) as electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.141
