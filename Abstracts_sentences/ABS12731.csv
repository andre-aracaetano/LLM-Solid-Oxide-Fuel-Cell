1,12731,High operating temperatures of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) require that the sealant must function at a high temperature between 600 degrees C and 900 degrees C and in the oxidizing and reducing environments of fuel and air.,Experimental Study of the Aging and Self-Healing of the Glass/Ceramic Sealant Used in SOFCs,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02417.x
2,12731,"This paper describes tests to investigate the temporal evolution of the volume fraction of ceramic phases, the evolution of micro-damage, and the self-healing behavior of the glass-ceramic sealant used in SOFCs.",Experimental Study of the Aging and Self-Healing of the Glass/Ceramic Sealant Used in SOFCs,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02417.x
3,12731,"It was found that after the initial sintering process, further crystallization of the glass-ceramic sealant does not stop, but slows down and reduces the residual glass content while boosting the ceramic crystalline content.",Experimental Study of the Aging and Self-Healing of the Glass/Ceramic Sealant Used in SOFCs,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02417.x
4,12731,"Under a long-term operating environment, distinct fibrous and needle-like crystals in the amorphous phase disappeared, and smeared/diffused phase boundaries between the glass phase and ceramic phase were observed.",Experimental Study of the Aging and Self-Healing of the Glass/Ceramic Sealant Used in SOFCs,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02417.x
5,12731,"Meanwhile, the micro-damage was induced by the cooling down process from the operating temperature to room temperature, which can potentially degrade the mechanical properties of the glass/ceramic sealant.",Experimental Study of the Aging and Self-Healing of the Glass/Ceramic Sealant Used in SOFCs,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02417.x
6,12731,"The glass/ceramic sealant exhibited self-healing upon reheating to the SOFC operating temperature, which can restore the mechanical performance of the glass/ceramic sealant.",Experimental Study of the Aging and Self-Healing of the Glass/Ceramic Sealant Used in SOFCs,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2009.02417.x
