2,205,"It is possible to run the SOFC on biogas, even at remarkably low levels of methane, at which conventional heat engines would not work.",Implications for using biogas as a fuel source for solid oxide fuel cells: internal dry reforming in a small tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1023/A:1016000519280
3,205,"The power output varies with methane content, with maximum power production occurring at 45% methane, corresponding to maximal production of H-2 and CO through internal dry reforming.",Implications for using biogas as a fuel source for solid oxide fuel cells: internal dry reforming in a small tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1023/A:1016000519280
4,205,Direct electrocatalytic oxidation of methane does not contribute to the power output of the cell.,Implications for using biogas as a fuel source for solid oxide fuel cells: internal dry reforming in a small tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1023/A:1016000519280
5,205,"At higher methane contents methane decomposition becomes significant, leading to increased H-2 production, and hence transiently higher power production, and deleterious carbon deposition and thus eventual cell deactivation.",Implications for using biogas as a fuel source for solid oxide fuel cells: internal dry reforming in a small tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1023/A:1016000519280
