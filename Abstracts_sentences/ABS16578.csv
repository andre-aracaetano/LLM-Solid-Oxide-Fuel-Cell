1,16578,"A sol-gel auto-ignited synthesis, which is a hybrid of sol-gel and auto-ignited techniques, was applied to preparation of homogeneous and stoichiometric BaCe0.8Y0.2O2.9 nanocrystalline ceramic powder as solid electrolyte used in solid oxide fuel cells at 1000degreesC. Optimal pH value for the mixed citrate-nitrate solutions was determined by calculation.",Synthesis and characterization of BaCe0.8Y0.2O2.9 nanopowder by sol-gel auto-ignited method,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.280-283.661
