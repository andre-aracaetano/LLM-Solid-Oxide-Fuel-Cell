1,3915,"Perovskite oxide La1-xSrxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-d (LSCF) with x = 0.3-0.5, an excellent mixed-ionic conductor that can be used as cathode material for the intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) has been developed using the sol-gel method.",Microstructure Characterization of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC),
2,3915,The resulting powder was characterised using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) which showed that pure crystals of perovskite were fully formed after calcination at 900 degrees C.,Microstructure Characterization of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC),
3,3915,The effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure was observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis.,Microstructure Characterization of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC),
4,3915,The results showed that the LSCF perovskite have the optimum porosity of 30% after sintered at 900 degrees C and thus enable the oxygen reduction occurred easily.,Microstructure Characterization of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC),
5,3915,FTIR results revealed that only Fe-O bond exists in the LSCF powder and no impurities detected.,Microstructure Characterization of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC),
