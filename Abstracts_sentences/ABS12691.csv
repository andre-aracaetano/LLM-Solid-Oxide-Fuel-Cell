2,12691,"Here, we report an anode-supported SOFC with a three-layer Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (gadolinia-doped-ceria [GDC])/Y0.148Zr0.852O1.926 (8YSZ)/GDC electrolyte system.",Boosting intermediate temperature performance of solid oxide fuel cells via a tri-layer ceria-zirconia-ceria electrolyte,10.1111/jace.18482
3,12691,"The first dense GDC electrolyte is fabricated by co-sintering a thin, screen-printed GDC layer with the anode support (NiO-8YSZ substrate and NiO-GDC anode) at 1400 degrees C for 5 h. Subsequently, two electrolyte layers are deposited via physical vapor deposition.",Boosting intermediate temperature performance of solid oxide fuel cells via a tri-layer ceria-zirconia-ceria electrolyte,10.1111/jace.18482
4,12691,"The total electrolyte thickness is less than 5 mu m in an area of 5 x 5 cm(2), enabling an area-specific ohmic resistance as low as 0.125 omega cm(-)(2) at 500 degrees C (under open circuit voltage), and contributing to a power density as high as 1.2 W cm(-)(2) at 650 degrees C (at an operating cell voltage of 0.7 V, using humidified [10 vol.% H2O] H-2 as fuel and air as oxidant).",Boosting intermediate temperature performance of solid oxide fuel cells via a tri-layer ceria-zirconia-ceria electrolyte,10.1111/jace.18482
5,12691,This work provides an effective strategy and shows the great potential of using GDC as an electrolyte for high-performance SOFC at intermediate temperature.,Boosting intermediate temperature performance of solid oxide fuel cells via a tri-layer ceria-zirconia-ceria electrolyte,10.1111/jace.18482
