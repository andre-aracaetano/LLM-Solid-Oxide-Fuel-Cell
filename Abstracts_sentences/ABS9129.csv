1,9129,"In this study, a series of Sr2MMoO6-delta double perovskite solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode materials (where 0 <= delta <= 0.041 and M = Fe, Co, or Ni) were synthesized, and the changes in their morphologies under relevant SOFC operating conditions were explored.",In Situ Structural and Electrical Conductivity Characterization of Sr2MMoO6-δ Double Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c00376
2,9129,"Ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) were used to determine changes in the microstructures and phase compositions of the anode materials at high temperatures and under a reducing atmosphere.",In Situ Structural and Electrical Conductivity Characterization of Sr2MMoO6-δ Double Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c00376
3,9129,"The stability of the double perovskite structure was found to be highly dependent on the identity of the cation M, such that when M = Fe, the material remained stable over the course of the experiments.",In Situ Structural and Electrical Conductivity Characterization of Sr2MMoO6-δ Double Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c00376
4,9129,"However, when M = Co or Ni, significant changes in the microstructure and phase composition were observed.",In Situ Structural and Electrical Conductivity Characterization of Sr2MMoO6-δ Double Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c00376
5,9129,"An in situ study of the M = Co sample, in which electrical conductivity and USAXS/SAXS/WAXS measurements were conducted simultaneously, revealed the structural degradation mechanisms and electrical conductivity changes over a range of temperatures.",In Situ Structural and Electrical Conductivity Characterization of Sr2MMoO6-δ Double Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c00376
6,9129,"To conduct these measurements, a cell was developed that allowed for a sample mounted on Pt wires to be placed in the X-ray beam and heated under gas flow comprising 4% mass H-2 and 96% mass N-2.",In Situ Structural and Electrical Conductivity Characterization of Sr2MMoO6-δ Double Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c00376
7,9129,"The resulting measurements allowed for the direct comparison of the electrical and morphological changes occurring in the material under operating conditions, such that increases in conductivity could be attributed to the growth of new phases.",In Situ Structural and Electrical Conductivity Characterization of Sr2MMoO6-δ Double Perovskite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Materials,10.1021/acsaem.0c00376
