1,2526,"In this work, we prepare an efficient and durable electrolyte-support solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with perovskite type Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (SFM) anode to verify the integrated system consisting of a SOFC and coal gasification unit.",An efficient and durable solid oxide fuel cell integrated with coal gasification system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.104
2,2526,"The cell exhibits a considerable high output power density of 0.188 Wcm(-2) and good short-term stability at 800 degrees C when exposing the anode and cathode to CO-CO2(2:1) and ambient air, respectively, which is attributed to its good electrocatalytic activity and intrinsic property against carbon coking.",An efficient and durable solid oxide fuel cell integrated with coal gasification system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.104
3,2526,"In addition, the rate-limiting step is determined by recording the electrochemical impedance spectra and their corresponding distribution of relaxation times analysis results.",An efficient and durable solid oxide fuel cell integrated with coal gasification system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.104
4,2526,"It is found that the electrode reaction process is limited by the low-frequency gas adsorption, dissociation, and conversion.",An efficient and durable solid oxide fuel cell integrated with coal gasification system,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.09.104
