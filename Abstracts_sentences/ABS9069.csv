1,9069,Formic acid is investigated as a fuel for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) for the first time.,Coke-free direct formic acid solid oxide fuel cells operating at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.137
2,9069,Thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that carbon deposition is avoidable above 600 degrees C. The carbon deposition properties are also investigated experimentally by first treating a nickel plus yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) anode material in particle form under a formic acid-containing atmosphere for a limited time at 500-800 degrees C and then analyzing the particles by O-2-TPO.,Coke-free direct formic acid solid oxide fuel cells operating at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.137
3,9069,"This analysis confirms that carbon deposition on Ni-YSZ is weak above 600 degrees C. We further treat half-cells composed of YSZ electrolyte and Ni-YSZ anode under formic acid-containing atmosphere at 600, 700 and 800 degrees C; the anodes maintain their original geometric shape and microstructure and show no obvious weight gain.",Coke-free direct formic acid solid oxide fuel cells operating at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.137
4,9069,It suggests that formic acid can be directly fed into SOFCs constructed with conventional nickel-based cermet anodes.,Coke-free direct formic acid solid oxide fuel cells operating at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.137
5,9069,I-V tests show that the cell delivers a promising peak power density of 571 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C.,Coke-free direct formic acid solid oxide fuel cells operating at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.137

7,9069,The results indicate that formic acid is highly promising as a direct fuel for SOFCs without the need for cell material modifications.,Coke-free direct formic acid solid oxide fuel cells operating at intermediate temperatures,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.137
