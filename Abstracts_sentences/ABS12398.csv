1,12398,"Four oxides belonging to the perovskite series of nominal stoichiometry LaNi1-xMoxO3, x = 0.10, 0. 15, 0.20, 0.25 (LNMO), have been tested as cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).",Defective Ni Perovskites as Cathode Materials in Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells: A Structure-Properties Correlation,10.1021/cm9020518
2,12398,The electrodes were supported on a 300-mu m-thick pellet of the electrolyte La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta (LSGM) with Sr2MgMoO6 (SMMO) as the anode and LNMO as the cathode.,Defective Ni Perovskites as Cathode Materials in Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells: A Structure-Properties Correlation,10.1021/cm9020518
3,12398,The test fuel cells gave a maximum power density of 660 mW/cm(2) at 850 degrees C and 565 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C for the x = 0.25 cathode material and exhibited high cyclability and low cathodic overpotential losses with pure H-2 as fuel.,Defective Ni Perovskites as Cathode Materials in Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells: A Structure-Properties Correlation,10.1021/cm9020518
4,12398,All the cathode materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrical conductivity measurements while the test fuel cell cross-section was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).,Defective Ni Perovskites as Cathode Materials in Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells: A Structure-Properties Correlation,10.1021/cm9020518
5,12398,"The X-ray data indicate that all the cathode materials exhibit a perovskite phase with an additional impurity phase present in LNMO x = 0.20, 0.25 materials.",Defective Ni Perovskites as Cathode Materials in Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells: A Structure-Properties Correlation,10.1021/cm9020518
6,12398,"Molybdenum (Mo)-poor LNMO x = 0.10 exhibits a purely metallic behavior in the 120-800 degrees C temperature range, while Mo-rich LNMO, x = 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25, are semiconducting.",Defective Ni Perovskites as Cathode Materials in Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells: A Structure-Properties Correlation,10.1021/cm9020518
7,12398,"Additionally, analysis of in situ temperature-dependent neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data from LNMO x = 0.20 at 25 and 800 degrees C in air reveal that it possesses a rhombohedral structure (R3 (c) over bar space group) with a crystallographic formula La0.98(1)Ni0.88(3)MoO0.12(3)O2.78(3) and a nominal oxidation state for Ni of 2.16+, which points to the presence of a Ni(III)/Ni(II) redox couple in the cathode materials at the working temperature of the cell (800 degrees C).",Defective Ni Perovskites as Cathode Materials in Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells: A Structure-Properties Correlation,10.1021/cm9020518
8,12398,"The Ni(III)/Ni(II) redox energy at the top of the O 2p bands accounts for a good electronic conductivity of polaronic nature of approximately 30 S.cm(-1) at 800 degrees C. NPD data also showed a measurable oxygen deficiency of approximately 0.2 oxygen atoms per formula unit exhibiting large thermal factors, which accounts for the good oxygen mobility expected in a mixed ion-electronic conductor (MIEC) oxide.",Defective Ni Perovskites as Cathode Materials in Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells: A Structure-Properties Correlation,10.1021/cm9020518
9,12398,"The excellent properties of LaNi1-xMoxO3-delta cathodes, especially for x = 0.25, with long-term stability and low cathodic overpotential losses make them potential electrode materials for the First generation of cobalt-free intermediate-temperature SOFCs, with power densities exceeding the target of 500 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C in pure H-2 as a fuel.",Defective Ni Perovskites as Cathode Materials in Intermediate-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells: A Structure-Properties Correlation,10.1021/cm9020518
