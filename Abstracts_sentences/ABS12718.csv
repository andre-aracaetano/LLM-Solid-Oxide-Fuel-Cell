1,12718,This study was aimed at developing a novel integrated fabrication process for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with hybrid plasma spraying (HYPS).,Integrated fabrication process for solid oxide fuel cells using hybrid plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v1.i1.30
2,12718,"HYPS makes it possible to obtain not only very dense yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) films as solid electrolytes, but also porous Ni-YSZ cermets as fuel electrodes and porous La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSMO) films as air electrodes.",Integrated fabrication process for solid oxide fuel cells using hybrid plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v1.i1.30
3,12718,The quality of each film was examined individually and the electrical conductivity of the Ni-YSZ and LSMO electrodes was measured.,Integrated fabrication process for solid oxide fuel cells using hybrid plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v1.i1.30
4,12718,The fabrication of the entire SOFC by using exclusively HYPS was then demonstrated.,Integrated fabrication process for solid oxide fuel cells using hybrid plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v1.i1.30
5,12718,"Initially, a 2 mm thick fuel electrode of Ni-YSZ cermet was formed on a boron-nitride substrate, which could be easily removed after deposition.",Integrated fabrication process for solid oxide fuel cells using hybrid plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v1.i1.30
6,12718,The electrolyte (YSZ) and the air electrode (LSMO) were then successively deposited on the self-supporting cermet.,Integrated fabrication process for solid oxide fuel cells using hybrid plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v1.i1.30
7,12718,"By this method the sintering step necessary in the conventional SOFC processing can be omitted, and SOFC cells can be fabricated using only spraying process.",Integrated fabrication process for solid oxide fuel cells using hybrid plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v1.i1.30
8,12718,The technical feasibility of the novel SOFC processing was clearly demonstrated by an excellent cell performance.,Integrated fabrication process for solid oxide fuel cells using hybrid plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v1.i1.30
9,12718,It showed an open circuit voltage(O.C.V.) value of 1.01 V and a power density of 7.3 x 10(3) W/m(2).,Integrated fabrication process for solid oxide fuel cells using hybrid plasma spraying,10.1615/HighTempMatProc.v1.i1.30
