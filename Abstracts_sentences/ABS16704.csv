1,16704,"Suppression of carbon deposition and sulfur poisoning without sacrificing electrochemical performance is crucial for operating solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), especially at intermediate temperatures (IT).","Novel carbon and sulfur-tolerant anode material FeNi3@PrBa(Fe,Ni)1.9Mo0.1O5+δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta07027c
2,16704,"In this work, nickel-doped A-site deficient perovskite oxides (PrBa)(0.95)Fe1.9-xNixMo0.1O6-delta (PBFMNix, x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) were synthesized and investigated as potential anodes for IT-SOFCs.","Novel carbon and sulfur-tolerant anode material FeNi3@PrBa(Fe,Ni)1.9Mo0.1O5+δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta07027c
3,16704,"With increased amounts of Ni2+, the ratios of Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mo5+/Mo6+ in as-prepared PBFMNix continuously decreased under a charge-compensating mechanism, which simultaneously depressed the formation of the impurity phase (BaMoO4).","Novel carbon and sulfur-tolerant anode material FeNi3@PrBa(Fe,Ni)1.9Mo0.1O5+δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta07027c
4,16704,"Interestingly, the substitution of Ni2+ benefits the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ and Mo6+ to Mo5+, and small portions of Fe and Ni elements are exsolved from the parent oxides, forming FeNi3 alloy nano-particles that greatly accelerate the chemical adsorption and surface reaction kinetics of H-2, and thus improve the electrochemical performances of oxide-based anodes.","Novel carbon and sulfur-tolerant anode material FeNi3@PrBa(Fe,Ni)1.9Mo0.1O5+δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta07027c
5,16704,Transformation of the electrical conduction from p-type to n-type after reduction was also observed.,"Novel carbon and sulfur-tolerant anode material FeNi3@PrBa(Fe,Ni)1.9Mo0.1O5+δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta07027c
6,16704,A very small polarization resistance of 0.028 omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C was achieved for the cell with the PBFMNi0.3 anode.,"Novel carbon and sulfur-tolerant anode material FeNi3@PrBa(Fe,Ni)1.9Mo0.1O5+δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta07027c
7,16704,"Importantly, fueled with syngas with 50 ppm H2S, the maximum power density of a button cell based on the PBFMNi0.3 anode and an Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte-supporting configuration can reach 498 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, and long-term stability over 100 hours can be demonstrated with negligible performance decay.","Novel carbon and sulfur-tolerant anode material FeNi3@PrBa(Fe,Ni)1.9Mo0.1O5+δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta07027c
8,16704,All these results indicate that PBFMNi0.3 is a promising high-performance anode material with good coking resistance and sulfur tolerance in intermediate temperatures.,"Novel carbon and sulfur-tolerant anode material FeNi3@PrBa(Fe,Ni)1.9Mo0.1O5+δ for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c9ta07027c
