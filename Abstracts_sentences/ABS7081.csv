1,7081,A detailed three-dimensional model of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is established to explore its performance under special requirements in the aviation SOFC - gas turbine hybrid system.,Numerical performance analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell for aviation hybrid power system,10.1016/j.energy.2023.129665
2,7081,"In this context, the SOFC has the distinction of pressurization, lightweight and low pressure loss compared to its conventional independent application.",Numerical performance analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell for aviation hybrid power system,10.1016/j.energy.2023.129665
3,7081,"Based on this, the SOFC performance is fully investigated in terms of different operating conditions and geometric dimensions, and in addition to typical electrochemical parameters, the power-to-weight ratio is also considered as evaluation indicator.",Numerical performance analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell for aviation hybrid power system,10.1016/j.energy.2023.129665
4,7081,"The results indicate that high operating pressure is beneficial for improving SOFC electrochemical performance, but the performance enhancement becomes slow when pressure exceeds 0.5 MPa.",Numerical performance analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell for aviation hybrid power system,10.1016/j.energy.2023.129665
5,7081,The inlet velocities of fuel and air both affect fuel utilization and power density of SOFC.,Numerical performance analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell for aviation hybrid power system,10.1016/j.energy.2023.129665
6,7081,"And the high air velocity is favorable to reduce the SOFC temperature and temperature gradient, but it also increases the pressure drop.",Numerical performance analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell for aviation hybrid power system,10.1016/j.energy.2023.129665
7,7081,"Therefore, the air inlet velocity of 2 m/s-15 m/s is more suitable under comprehensive consideration.",Numerical performance analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell for aviation hybrid power system,10.1016/j.energy.2023.129665
