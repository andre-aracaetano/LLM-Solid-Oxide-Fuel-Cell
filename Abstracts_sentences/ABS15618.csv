1,15618,"For the promising intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) cathode material Nd2NiO4+delta, chemical surface exchange coefficients k(chem) and chemical diffusion coefficients D-chem of oxygen have been determined by conductivity relaxation measurements and compared with results for La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta between 575 and 725 degrees C.",Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of the IT-SOFC Cathode Material Nd2NiO4+δ and Comparison with La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1149/1.3569697
2,15618,"At 725 degrees C and an oxygen partial pressure of 0.1 bar, k(chem) and D-chem of Nd2NiO4+delta amount to 1 x 10(-3) cm s(-1) and 2 x 10(-6)",Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of the IT-SOFC Cathode Material Nd2NiO4+δ and Comparison with La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1149/1.3569697
3,15618,"cm(2) s(-1), respectively, which are higher than those for La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d. However, due to high activation energies, a strong decrease of both kinetic parameters is observed for Nd2NiO4+delta upon temperature reduction.",Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of the IT-SOFC Cathode Material Nd2NiO4+δ and Comparison with La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1149/1.3569697
4,15618,"Activation energies of k(chem) and D-chem are lower for La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-d, leading to faster oxygen exchange compared to Nd2NiO4+delta at 600 degrees C. Electronic conductivities of Nd2NiO4+delta amount to 100-125 S cm(-1) while those of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta are between 1600 and 2200 S cm(-1) in the investigated temperature and oxygen partial pressure range.",Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of the IT-SOFC Cathode Material Nd2NiO4+δ and Comparison with La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1149/1.3569697
5,15618,"Ionic conductivities and surface exchange resistances, which were calculated from the kinetic parameters, further show superior oxygen transport properties of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta compared to Nd2NiO4+delta in pure O-2-Ar atmospheres.",Oxygen Exchange Kinetics of the IT-SOFC Cathode Material Nd2NiO4+δ and Comparison with La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1149/1.3569697
