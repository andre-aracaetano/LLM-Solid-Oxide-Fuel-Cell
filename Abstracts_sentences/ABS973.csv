6,973,"Thus, the use of a mixed composite (YSZ-CGO) will allow to extend the applicability of LSCM at temperatures lower than 850 degrees C. LSCN1-(YSZ-CGO) based SFCs offer promising performances, e.g., 0.4 W cm(-2) at 950 degrees C using humidified H, as fuel.",LSCM-(YSZ-CGO) composites as improved symmetrical electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.02.117
