1,15024,A NiO/Yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) transition layer and/or a SDC function layer were introduced into the anode/electrolyte and/or electrolyte/cathode interface to decrease the activation polarization resulted from the mass transfer at electrode/electrolyte interface.,YSZ-based SOFC with modified electrode/electrolyte interfaces for operating at temperature lower than 650°C,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.066
2,15024,"With a NiO/YSZ transition layer, the activation polarization simulated from I-V curves drops from 4.42 to 2.42 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, about 45% less than that of cell I; with additional SDC function layer, no activation polarization is obviously observed.",YSZ-based SOFC with modified electrode/electrolyte interfaces for operating at temperature lower than 650°C,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.066
3,15024,The cell performance was also remarkably improved with the introduction of both the transition layer and the SDC function layer.,YSZ-based SOFC with modified electrode/electrolyte interfaces for operating at temperature lower than 650°C,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.066
4,15024,"Peak power densities of 187 and 443 mW cm(-2) at 600 and 650 degrees C, respectively, were achieved for a single cell with both a transition layer and a function layer, with an increment of 87% and 95% compared to that of the cell without any structural improvement, and about 30% and 25% compared to that of the cell with only anode transition layer.",YSZ-based SOFC with modified electrode/electrolyte interfaces for operating at temperature lower than 650°C,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.066
5,15024,"The study by ac impedance spectroscopy technique also indicated that the interfacial polarization resistance, the main source of cell resistance, could be effectively reduced by interface improvement.",YSZ-based SOFC with modified electrode/electrolyte interfaces for operating at temperature lower than 650°C,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.066
