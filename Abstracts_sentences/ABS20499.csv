4,20499,"Based on nonequilibrium thermodynamics and transition state theory, this framework yields rate laws that are rigorously consistent with thermodynamics, yet allow rates of individual steps to be developed in terms of simple mass action laws, where appropriate.",Mechanisms and rate laws for oxygen exchange on mixed-conducting oxide surfaces,10.1016/j.jcat.2006.09.019
5,20499,"This framework is used to reexamine equilibrium oxygen-exchange kinetics reported for electron-rich perovskite mixed conductors La1-xSrxCoO3-delta (LSC) and Lai-xSrxFeO3-delta (LSF), which have a metallic and a semiconducting band structure, respectively.",Mechanisms and rate laws for oxygen exchange on mixed-conducting oxide surfaces,10.1016/j.jcat.2006.09.019
6,20499,Our analysis suggests that metallic band structure may play an important role in catalysis by stabilizing physisorbed O-2 on the surface.,Mechanisms and rate laws for oxygen exchange on mixed-conducting oxide surfaces,10.1016/j.jcat.2006.09.019
7,20499,"We also show that equilibrium surface exchange rates (as measured by O-18/O-16 isotopes, concentration steps, impedance, etc.) are generally only weak indicators of mechanism, and emphasize the need for kinetic data involving moderate to large displacements from equilibrium.",Mechanisms and rate laws for oxygen exchange on mixed-conducting oxide surfaces,10.1016/j.jcat.2006.09.019
