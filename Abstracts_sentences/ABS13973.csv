2,13973,+ xGe(6)O(26+ 3x/2) have attracted considerable interest due to their high oxide ion conductivities.,Strategies for the Optimisation of the Oxide Ion Conductivities of Apatite-Type Germanates,10.1002/fuce.201000020
3,13973,Research has shown that the key defects are oxide ion interstitials which lead to the conversion of some of the GeO4 units to GeO5.,Strategies for the Optimisation of the Oxide Ion Conductivities of Apatite-Type Germanates,10.1002/fuce.201000020
4,13973,Consequently there has been a large interest in the preparation of high oxygen excess samples with high defect concentration.,Strategies for the Optimisation of the Oxide Ion Conductivities of Apatite-Type Germanates,10.1002/fuce.201000020
5,13973,"This strategy, however, leads to a reduction in symmetry from hexagonal to triclinic for x > 0.4, and consequently to reduced oxide ion conductivity at low temperatures.",Strategies for the Optimisation of the Oxide Ion Conductivities of Apatite-Type Germanates,10.1002/fuce.201000020
6,13973,"We present doping strategies to stabilise the hexagonal lattice, while maintaining high oxygen content.",Strategies for the Optimisation of the Oxide Ion Conductivities of Apatite-Type Germanates,10.1002/fuce.201000020
7,13973,"In particular, partial substitution of La by smaller rare earths (Y, Yb) is shown to be successful in preparing x = 0.67 samples with hexagonal symmetry and hence high conductivities.",Strategies for the Optimisation of the Oxide Ion Conductivities of Apatite-Type Germanates,10.1002/fuce.201000020
8,13973,"In addition, doping on the Ge site with Ti, Nb or W, has been shown to be similarly successful, leading to very high oxygen contents for W doping, e. g. La10Ge5.5W0.5O27.5.",Strategies for the Optimisation of the Oxide Ion Conductivities of Apatite-Type Germanates,10.1002/fuce.201000020
9,13973,"In the case of Ti doping, however, there was some evidence for trapping of the interstitial oxide ions around the Ti.",Strategies for the Optimisation of the Oxide Ion Conductivities of Apatite-Type Germanates,10.1002/fuce.201000020
10,13973,"Preliminary results on the effect of similar doping strategies on Pr, Nd germanates (Pr/Nd)(9.33+x)Ge6O26+3x/2, are also discussed.",Strategies for the Optimisation of the Oxide Ion Conductivities of Apatite-Type Germanates,10.1002/fuce.201000020
