2,19746,"Among them, BaCeO3-based materials exhibit good proton conductivity under a humidified hydrogen-containing atmosphere, but rather poor chemical stability in CO2 atmosphere.",Barium Non-Stoichiometry Role on the Properties of Ba1+xCe0.65Zr0.20Y0.15O3-δ Proton Conductors for IT-SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800021
3,19746,The substitution with Zr for Ce improves the chemical stability but reduces proton conductivity due to difficulties in fabricating dense materials.,Barium Non-Stoichiometry Role on the Properties of Ba1+xCe0.65Zr0.20Y0.15O3-δ Proton Conductors for IT-SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800021
4,19746,"In the present work, single phase nanostructured powders of Ba1+xCe0.65Zr0.20Y0.15O3-delta (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10) solid solutions have been prepared by a modified sol-gel Pechini method with the final aim of evaluating the role of barium on their chemical and electrical properties.",Barium Non-Stoichiometry Role on the Properties of Ba1+xCe0.65Zr0.20Y0.15O3-δ Proton Conductors for IT-SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800021
5,19746,A significant influence of barium excess on the preparation and on properties of these materials has been demonstrated.,Barium Non-Stoichiometry Role on the Properties of Ba1+xCe0.65Zr0.20Y0.15O3-δ Proton Conductors for IT-SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800021
6,19746,"In fact, density measurements evidenced that a 5 or 10 mol% nominal barium excess sensibly favoured the sintering process.",Barium Non-Stoichiometry Role on the Properties of Ba1+xCe0.65Zr0.20Y0.15O3-δ Proton Conductors for IT-SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800021
7,19746,"Impedance analyses of sintered pellets confirmed the necessity of barium excess in order to avoid the lowering of proton conductivity, which has been evidenced for samples having stoichiometric barium content.",Barium Non-Stoichiometry Role on the Properties of Ba1+xCe0.65Zr0.20Y0.15O3-δ Proton Conductors for IT-SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800021
8,19746,"Moreover, an unforeseen increase in chemical stability in CO2-containing atmosphere with the growth of the barium excess was detected by thermogravimetric analyses.",Barium Non-Stoichiometry Role on the Properties of Ba1+xCe0.65Zr0.20Y0.15O3-δ Proton Conductors for IT-SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800021
