3,17241,It was found that LiSm4Mo3O15F samples are isostructural to cubic Sm5Mo3O16 compounds with a fluorite-like structure.,The fluorite-like LiSm4Mo3O15F ceramics: Synthesis and conductivity,10.1016/j.jssc.2023.124078
4,17241,It is shown that the double replacement of samarium with lithium and oxygen with fluorine leads to the appearance of a reversible phase transition accompanied by a jump in conductivity by 2 orders of magnitude.,The fluorite-like LiSm4Mo3O15F ceramics: Synthesis and conductivity,10.1016/j.jssc.2023.124078
5,17241,The con-ductivity of the LiSm4Mo3O15F compound reaches the value of 10-3 S/cm at 600 degrees C which is about half an order of magnitude higher than the conductivity of non-fluorinated compounds at this temperature.,The fluorite-like LiSm4Mo3O15F ceramics: Synthesis and conductivity,10.1016/j.jssc.2023.124078
