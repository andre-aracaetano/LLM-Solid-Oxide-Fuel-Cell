1,4434,A commercially available glass-ceramic composition is applied on a ferritic stainless steel (FSS) substrate reproducing a type of interface present in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) stacks.,Characterization of Glass-Ceramic Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells at Operating Conditions by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,10.3390/ma13214702
2,4434,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to study the electrical response of the assembly in the temperature range of 380-780 degrees C and during aging for 250 h at 780 degrees C. Post-experiment analyses, performed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), and along cross-sections by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, highlight the microstructural changes promoted by aging conditions over time.",Characterization of Glass-Ceramic Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells at Operating Conditions by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,10.3390/ma13214702
3,4434,"In particular, progressive crystallization of the glass-ceramic, high temperature corrosion of the substrate and diffusion of Fe and Cr ions from the FSS substrate into the sealant influence the electrical response of the system under investigation.",Characterization of Glass-Ceramic Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells at Operating Conditions by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,10.3390/ma13214702
4,4434,The electrical measurements show an increase in conductivity to 5 x 10(-6),Characterization of Glass-Ceramic Sealant for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells at Operating Conditions by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,10.3390/ma13214702
