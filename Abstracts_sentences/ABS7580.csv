1,7580,Solid oxide fuel cells with an electrode supported thin film electrolyte are a promising alternative to electrolyte supported single cells because of decreased electrolyte resistance.,Preparation of SOFC cells by means of electrophoretic deposition,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.314.101
2,7580,"The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of the electrolyte was performed on A-site deficient La0.75Sr0.2MnO3-delta (ULSM) from three different suspensions: (Y2O3)(0.08)(ZrO2)(0.92) (YSZ), (Ce0.9Gd0.1)O-1.955 (GDC) and La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 (LSGM) in acetylacetone and isopropanol.",Preparation of SOFC cells by means of electrophoretic deposition,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.314.101
3,7580,The thickness of the deposits was controlled by varying the conditions of the electrophoretic deposition.,Preparation of SOFC cells by means of electrophoretic deposition,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.314.101
4,7580,Because of porosity reduction in the cathode layer during sintering of the electrolytes we deposited porous cathodes (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta (LSCF)) as well as anodes (NiO/YSZ and NiO/GDC) on dense YSZ foils by applying a conductive layer on top of the surface part to be coated.,Preparation of SOFC cells by means of electrophoretic deposition,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.314.101
