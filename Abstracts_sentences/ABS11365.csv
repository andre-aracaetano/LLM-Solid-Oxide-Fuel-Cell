2,11365,"The fatigue strength of 24Cr stainless steel decreased with increasing temperature, but the fatigue life increased at 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C.",High temperature low cycle fatigue properties of 24Cr ferritic stainless steel for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.msea.2013.04.036
3,11365,The fatigue behavior at room temperature (RI) was characterized as cyclic hardening followed by saturation and cyclic softening while marginal cyclic hardening was observed at 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C.,High temperature low cycle fatigue properties of 24Cr ferritic stainless steel for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.msea.2013.04.036
4,11365,The superior oxidation resistance of 24Cr stainless steel allows preventing the fatal impact of oxidation on the high-temperature fatigue life.,High temperature low cycle fatigue properties of 24Cr ferritic stainless steel for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.msea.2013.04.036
5,11365,Microstructural analysis showed that persistent slip bands (PSBs) developed prevalently at RI but not at 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C. Such temperature-dependent microstructural difference retarded the crack initiation and prolonged fatigue life at high temperatures.,High temperature low cycle fatigue properties of 24Cr ferritic stainless steel for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.msea.2013.04.036
