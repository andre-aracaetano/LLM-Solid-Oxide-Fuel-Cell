5,7742,"The Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.25Cu0.05O3-delta (BSCFC5) cathode, where lattice contraction occurred, exhibits the best performance with an area-specific resistance (ASR) of 0.0247 omega cm2 and a high peak power density (PPD) of 1715 mW cm-2 at 650 degrees C for the symmetrical and single cells, respectively.",Effect of engineered lattice contraction and expansion on the performance and CO2 tolerance of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.3O3-? functional material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.110
6,7742,"The functional material also exhibits enhanced tolerance to CO2 compared to BSCF by surviving several rounds of 10% CO2 injection and ejection for an overall nonstop testing period of 100 h. The improved ORR, stability, and CO2 tolerance instigated by lattice contraction in BSCF provides an insight into the adoption of this approach in achieving optimal desirable properties in SOFC cathode functional materials.",Effect of engineered lattice contraction and expansion on the performance and CO2 tolerance of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.3O3-? functional material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.04.110
