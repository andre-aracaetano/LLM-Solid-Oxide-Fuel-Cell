1,18288,"A new type of anode with double layers, composed of an outer layer Ni-CeO2 (about 0.5 mm) with relatively large porosity and pore size and an inner layer adjacent to the electrolyte Ni-SDC (about 120 mu m), was developed for direct utilization of methane fuel in low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with thin-film SDC electrolytes.",Electrochemical performance of IT-SOFCs with a double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.090
2,18288,Cells with this novel anode were fabricated using a tri-layer co-pressing technique.,Electrochemical performance of IT-SOFCs with a double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.090
3,18288,This anode microstructure is believed to lower the anodic concentration polarization when using methane as fuel.,Electrochemical performance of IT-SOFCs with a double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.090
4,18288,Impedance measurements show that the anode polarization resistance of the cell with the novel anode in H-2 is only 0.02 ohm cm(2) which is lower than a conventional NVSDC anode.,Electrochemical performance of IT-SOFCs with a double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.090
5,18288,"However, it is about 0.2 ohm cm(2) lower when using methane as fuel, which is consistent with the results of electrochemical measurements, inferring that the novel anode shows a relatively high catalytic activity towards methane than the conventional anode.",Electrochemical performance of IT-SOFCs with a double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.090
6,18288,The stability of the cell with the novel anode at 600 degrees C when using methane as fuel was also studied.,Electrochemical performance of IT-SOFCs with a double-layer anode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.01.090
