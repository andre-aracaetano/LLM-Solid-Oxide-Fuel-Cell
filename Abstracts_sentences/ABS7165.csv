1,7165,Electrospun LaxSr1-xCo1-yFeyO3 (LSCF) fibers with y=0.2 - 1.0 have been investigated as the cathode of intermediate solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC).,Electrochemical characteristics of La0.6Sr0.4Co1-yFeyO3 (y=0.2-1.0) fiber cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.002
2,7165,The electrochemical performances of LSCF (y=0.2-1.0) fibers were studied by impedance spectroscopy in symmetrical cells containing gadolinium doped ceria (CGO) electrolyte and LSCF electrode infiltrated with CGO.,Electrochemical characteristics of La0.6Sr0.4Co1-yFeyO3 (y=0.2-1.0) fiber cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.002
3,7165,"Impedance measurements showed that the impedance spectra have two or three semicircles, depending on the measurement temperature.",Electrochemical characteristics of La0.6Sr0.4Co1-yFeyO3 (y=0.2-1.0) fiber cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.002
4,7165,"The LSCF electrodes with higher cobalt content exhibit lower polarization resistance (R-p) and the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 electrode displayed the lowest polarization resistance between 500 and 900 degrees C, classifying this composite cathode as a promising material for intermediate temperature SOFC based on CGO electrolyte.",Electrochemical characteristics of La0.6Sr0.4Co1-yFeyO3 (y=0.2-1.0) fiber cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.002
