6,20691,Strength tests were performed after every layer deposition and the non-symmetrical layout was taken into account during mechanical testing.,Electrolyte-Supported Fuel Cell: Co-Sintering Effects of Layer Deposition on Biaxial Strength,10.3390/ma12020306
7,20691,Obtained experimental data were evaluated with the help of Weibull statistical analysis.,Electrolyte-Supported Fuel Cell: Co-Sintering Effects of Layer Deposition on Biaxial Strength,10.3390/ma12020306
8,20691,"A loss of mechanical strength after every layer deposition was usually detected, with the final strength of the cell being significantly smaller than the initial strength of the uncoated electrolyte (sigma(0) approximate to 800 MPa and sigma(0) approximate to 1800 MPa, respectively).",Electrolyte-Supported Fuel Cell: Co-Sintering Effects of Layer Deposition on Biaxial Strength,10.3390/ma12020306
9,20691,Fractographic analyses helped to reveal the fracture behavior changes when individual layers were deposited.,Electrolyte-Supported Fuel Cell: Co-Sintering Effects of Layer Deposition on Biaxial Strength,10.3390/ma12020306
10,20691,"It was found that the reasons behind the weakening effect can be ascribed to the presence and redistribution of residual stresses, changes in the crack initiation site, porosity of layers, and pre-crack formation in the electrode layers.",Electrolyte-Supported Fuel Cell: Co-Sintering Effects of Layer Deposition on Biaxial Strength,10.3390/ma12020306
