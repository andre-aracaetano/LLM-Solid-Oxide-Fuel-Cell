1,17778,"Quantitative investigation is conducted on the resistance sources of the components in the NiO-YSZ/YSZ/GDC/LSCF GDC solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) stack at the H2O/H-2 ratios of 70/30, 80/20 and 90/10 at 750 degrees C.",Quantitative contribution of resistance sources of components to stack performance for solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.096
2,17778,"The results indicate that the cell resistance accounts for 76.3-66.7% of that of the stack repeating unit (SRU), the contact resistance (CR) between the air electrode current-collecting layer (AECCL) and the interconnect accounts for 23.6-27.0%, the CR between the hydrogen electrode current-collecting layer (HECCL) and the interconnect only accounts for 23-3.2%, and the resistance of the interconnect can be neglected.",Quantitative contribution of resistance sources of components to stack performance for solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.096
3,17778,"Duration test of the stack is conducted at 0.8 A cm(-2) for 380 h, the cell resistance increase is found to be the major contribution of the SRU degradation (82.2% of the SRU degradation) while the air electrode CR increase and the hydrogen electrode CR increase are other two important factors.",Quantitative contribution of resistance sources of components to stack performance for solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.096
