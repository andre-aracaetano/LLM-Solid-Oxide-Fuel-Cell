1,3199,"BaCe0.9-xZrxY0.1O3-delta (0.1 <= x <= 0.9) are ceramic proton conductors widely investigated for different electrochemical devices, such as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) electrolytes, however, their applications are limited by the high sintering temperatures necessary to achieve densification.",The effect of Zn addition on the structure and transport properties of BaCe0.9-xZrxY0.1O3-δ,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2013.12.008
2,3199,Polycrystalline powders of BaCe0.9-xZrxY0.1O3-delta (BCZ) have been prepared by freeze-drying precursor method at 1000 degrees C. These powders were mixed with a zinc nitrate solution to decrease the sintering temperature to 1200-1300 degrees C.,The effect of Zn addition on the structure and transport properties of BaCe0.9-xZrxY0.1O3-δ,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2013.12.008
3,3199,The addition of Zn has several effects on the structure and microstructure of BCZ: the densification and grain growth are enhanced at lower temperature and a reduction of the crystallographic symmetry is observed for samples with low Zr-content (x <= 0.3).,The effect of Zn addition on the structure and transport properties of BaCe0.9-xZrxY0.1O3-δ,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2013.12.008
