2,3062,"The hydrogen concentration and internal reforming effects were evaluated systematically with different fuels including: hydrogen, simulated reformate, anhydrous ethanol, ethanol water blend, and hydrogen-nitrogen mixtures.",Ethanol internal reforming in solid oxide fuel cells: A path toward high performance metal-supported cells for vehicular applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227598
3,3062,"A simple infiltration of Ni reforming catalyst into 40 vol% Ni-Sm0.20Ce0.80O2.delta (Ni-SDCN40) and fuel-side metal support leads to complete internal reforming, as confirmed by comparison to simulated reformate.",Ethanol internal reforming in solid oxide fuel cells: A path toward high performance metal-supported cells for vehicular applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227598
4,3062,The performance difference between hydrogen and fully-reformed ethanol is attributed entirely to decrease in hydrogen concentration.,Ethanol internal reforming in solid oxide fuel cells: A path toward high performance metal-supported cells for vehicular applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227598
5,3062,"High peak power density was achieved for a range of conditions, for example 1.0 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C in ethanol-water blend, and L4 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C in anhydrous ethanol fuel.",Ethanol internal reforming in solid oxide fuel cells: A path toward high performance metal-supported cells for vehicular applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227598
6,3062,Initial durability tests with ethanol-water blend show promising stability for 100 h at 700 degrees C and 0.7 V.
