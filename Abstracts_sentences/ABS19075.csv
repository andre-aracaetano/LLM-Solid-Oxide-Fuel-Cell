1,19075,"La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) is a promising cathode for CO2 electroreduction in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), but its low catalytic activity limits the performance of SOECs.",Nano-CeO2-Modified Cathodes for Direct Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b01183
2,19075,"In this work, CeO2 nanoparticles with a size of 3-5 nm were successfully impregnated into an LSCM-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) composite cathode to investigate its effects on the CO2 electrochemical reduction.",Nano-CeO2-Modified Cathodes for Direct Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b01183
3,19075,"The introduction of CeO2 nanoparticles on the LSCM-GDC cathodes can create more three-phase boundaries (TPBs), improve the CO2 adsorption capability, and facilitate the transportation of oxygen ions between the cathode and the electrolyte.",Nano-CeO2-Modified Cathodes for Direct Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b01183
4,19075,"Therefore, the nano-CeO2 modified cathodes show better performance than the conventional LSCM-GDC cathode.",Nano-CeO2-Modified Cathodes for Direct Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b01183
5,19075,"The maximum current density of the nano-CeO2-modified cathode is about 90% higher than that of the conventional LSCM-GDC cathode at 1.4 V and 800 degrees C. Therefore, loading nano-CeO2 onto the LSCM-GDC backbone is an effective way to improve the electrocatalytic performance of the conventional LSCM-GDC cathode.",Nano-CeO2-Modified Cathodes for Direct Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b01183
