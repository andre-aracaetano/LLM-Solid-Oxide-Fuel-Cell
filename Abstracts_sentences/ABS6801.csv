5,6801,"Compared with the ESC, power density of the ASC was much higher due to thin electrolyte, whereas its open-circuit voltage (OCV) was lower.",Additive effect of NiO on electrochemical properties of mixed ion conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ,10.2109/jcersj2.16237
6,6801,"This is due to Ni diffusion from the NiO-BZCYYb anode into the BZCYYb electrolyte during high-temperature co-sintering process at 1350 degrees C. From the results of OCV measurements, 0-2 wt.% NiO was considered to be dissolved in the BZCYYb electrolyte of the ASC, suggesting that controlling Ni diffusion during co-sintering process is essential to achieve higher-performance ASCs using BZCYYb.",Additive effect of NiO on electrochemical properties of mixed ion conductor BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ,10.2109/jcersj2.16237
