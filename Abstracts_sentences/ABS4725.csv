1,4725,"A new ceramic-based multi-component material, containing one electronic conductor (Y-substituted SrTiO3, SYT), one ionic conductor (YSZ) and a small amount (similar to 5 vol.%) of Ni catalyst, was investigated as an alternative anode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",An efficient ceramic-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.159
2,4725,The ceramic framework SYT/YSZ shows good dimensional stability upon redox cycling and has an electrical conductivity of similar to 10 S cm(-1) under typical anode conditions.,An efficient ceramic-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.159
3,4725,"Owing to the substantial electrocatalytic activity of the fine and well-dispersed Ni particles on the surface of the ceramic framework, the electrode polarization resistance of 5 vol.% Ni-impregnated SYT/YSZ anode reached 0.21 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C in wet Ar/5%H-2.",An efficient ceramic-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.159
4,4725,"Based on these results, a redox-stable anode-supported planar SOFC is expected using this anode material, thus offering great advantages over the current generation of Ni/YSZ-based SOFCs.",An efficient ceramic-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.159
