4,10478,The SEM images exhibit well-densified microstructures while XRD results show that the perovskite structure after flash-sintering does not changed.,Flash-Sintering and Characterization of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ Electrolytes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.207
5,10478,EIS results show that the conductivity of LSGM sintered by the current-limiting flash-sintering process increases with sintering current density value.,Flash-Sintering and Characterization of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ Electrolytes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.207
6,10478,"The conductivity of samples sintered at 120 mA mm(-2) reaches 0.049 s cm(-1) at 800 degrees C, which is approximate to the value of conventional sintered LSGM samples at 1400 degrees C. Additionally, the flash-sintering process is interpreted by Joule heating theory.",Flash-Sintering and Characterization of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ Electrolytes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.207
