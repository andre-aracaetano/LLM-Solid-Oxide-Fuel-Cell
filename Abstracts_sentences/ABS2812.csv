1,2812,The durability of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) composite cathodes of lanthanum strontium manganite and yttria stabilised zirconia was investigated.,Durability test of SOFC cathodes,10.1023/A:1003987318963
2,2812,"The cathodes were kept at constant, realistic operating conditions (-300 mA cm(-2) at 1000 degrees C in air) for up to 2000 h. After the 2000 h test the increase in electrode overvoltage exceeded 100% of the initial value.",Durability test of SOFC cathodes,10.1023/A:1003987318963
3,2812,Nominally identical cathodes kept for 2000 h at 1000 degrees C in air without current load for comparison showed little or no degradation.,Durability test of SOFC cathodes,10.1023/A:1003987318963
4,2812,"Thus, the current load of -300 mA cm(-)2, rather than the operation temperature of 1000 degrees C, was responsible for the degradation.",Durability test of SOFC cathodes,10.1023/A:1003987318963
5,2812,"Structural analysis showed an increase in the porosity at the electrode interfaces, when the electrode had been polarised.",Durability test of SOFC cathodes,10.1023/A:1003987318963
6,2812,No such structural changes were found for electrodes tested without current load.,Durability test of SOFC cathodes,10.1023/A:1003987318963
7,2812,The degradation is primarily ascribed to pore formation in the electrode material induced by an electric field.,Durability test of SOFC cathodes,10.1023/A:1003987318963
