1,10711,"Apatite-type systems have been attracting significant attention recently due to their high oxide ion conductivity, offering the potential for use as the electrolyte in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).",Oxide ion conductivity in mixed Si/Ge-based apatite-type systems,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.030
2,10711,"In this article, we report the synthesis and conductivities of a range of novel mixed Si/ Ge-based apatite systems, La8.67BaSi6-yGeyO26 and La9.33Si6-yGeyO26 (0less than or equal toyless than or equal to6).",Oxide ion conductivity in mixed Si/Ge-based apatite-type systems,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.030
3,10711,"The results suggest that problems due to Ge volatility increase with increasing Ge content, but are partially reduced by Ba doping, which helps to stabilise the hexagonal apatite lattice.",Oxide ion conductivity in mixed Si/Ge-based apatite-type systems,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.030
4,10711,"All the phases show high oxide ion conductivities, although the activation energy for oxide ion conduction shows a general increase with increasing Ge content.",Oxide ion conductivity in mixed Si/Ge-based apatite-type systems,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.030
5,10711,"The mixed systems show the highest conductivities (e.g., sigma(800) (c)=0.06 S cm(-1) for La9.33Si2Ge4O26), and so are promising materials as electrolytes for SOFCs if problems due to Ge loss can be overcome.",Oxide ion conductivity in mixed Si/Ge-based apatite-type systems,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.030
