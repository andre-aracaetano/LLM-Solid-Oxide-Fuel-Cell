1,8235,"Novel electrode scaffold materials based on chromium-rich spinets, such as MgMxCr2-xO4, = Li, Mg, Ti, Fe, Cu, Ga) have been investigated for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications, in terms of conductivity and chemical stability when operated in fuel environments.","Structure and properties of MgMxCr2-xO4 (M = Li, Mg, Ti, Fe, Cu, Ga) spinels for electrode supports in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ta03633f
2,8235,"Cation distributions were obtained by Rietveld refinement from X-ray diffraction data (XRD), with cation site preference considered in agreement with literature, and correlated with electrical properties determined experimentally.","Structure and properties of MgMxCr2-xO4 (M = Li, Mg, Ti, Fe, Cu, Ga) spinels for electrode supports in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ta03633f
3,8235,"The substitutions with cations such as Li and Cu on B site improved the conductivity of the materials in air, while introducing Fe and Ga in the structure led to a decrease in conductivity in air.","Structure and properties of MgMxCr2-xO4 (M = Li, Mg, Ti, Fe, Cu, Ga) spinels for electrode supports in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ta03633f
4,8235,"However, Fe had a positive contribution under reducing conditions, generating a change in the conductivity mechanism from p-type in air, to n-type.","Structure and properties of MgMxCr2-xO4 (M = Li, Mg, Ti, Fe, Cu, Ga) spinels for electrode supports in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ta03633f
5,8235,"Conductivity measurements indicated that MgFexCr2-xO4 spinets exhibit faster reduction kinetics, in comparison with other substituted cations at the B site which is desirable in fuel cell application, for a reasonably fast response of a cell or a stack to reach its full functional potential.","Structure and properties of MgMxCr2-xO4 (M = Li, Mg, Ti, Fe, Cu, Ga) spinels for electrode supports in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ta03633f
6,8235,"MgFeCrO4 showed fast reduction kinetics, with increase of the conductivity in reducing conditions from 0.014 S cm(-1) to 0.4 S cm(-1) and equilibration time for reaching the maximum conductivity value of 10 hours, under dry 5% H-2/Ar at 850 degrees C.","Structure and properties of MgMxCr2-xO4 (M = Li, Mg, Ti, Fe, Cu, Ga) spinels for electrode supports in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ta03633f
