1,9830,"La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF), one kind of state-of-art solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) cathodes, often suffers from the chromium poisoning in the operating condition with Cr-based stainless steel interconnects, resulting in deteriorating cell performances.",Inhibition of chromium poisoning in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d cathode via simple electroless silver plating for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.157
2,9830,"A simple electroless silver plating method was used to modify the surface of LSCF cathodes (named LSCF-Ag), and the anti-chromium stability of LSCF cathodes was studied.",Inhibition of chromium poisoning in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d cathode via simple electroless silver plating for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.157
3,9830,"After the Cr treatment for 40 h, the polarization resistance (R-p) of LSCF cathodes changes from 0.26 Omega cm(2) to 0.62 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, while that of LSCF-Ag cathodes shows nearly no change (from 0.24 U cm(2) to 0.26 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C).",Inhibition of chromium poisoning in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d cathode via simple electroless silver plating for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.157
4,9830,"In LSCF-Ag cathodes, the formation of AgCrO2 instead of SrCrO4 avoids the lack of excessive Sr in the A site of LSCF, and AgCrO2 has an electronic conductivity two orders of magnitude greater than SrCrO4, thereby exhibiting significant survivability to Cr.",Inhibition of chromium poisoning in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d cathode via simple electroless silver plating for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.157
5,9830,The single cell with LSCF-Ag cathodes after Cr treatment shows a stable peak powder density of 288 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C while taking wet hydrogen and air as fuel and oxidizer.,Inhibition of chromium poisoning in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d cathode via simple electroless silver plating for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.157
6,9830,"As a comparison, the peak power density of single cells with blank LSCF cathodes drops by 12%.",Inhibition of chromium poisoning in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d cathode via simple electroless silver plating for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.157
7,9830,It is suggested that the simple electroless silver plating on LSCF cathodes is an effective method to suppress cathode chromium poisoning.,Inhibition of chromium poisoning in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d cathode via simple electroless silver plating for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.157
