1,1658,This study compares the electrochemical performance of the composite cathodes of La(0.6)Sr(0.4)CoxFe(1-x)O(3-delta) and BaZr0.8Yb0.2O3-delta (BZYb) sintered at 900 and 1100 degrees C in anode-supported protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) using a BZYb electrolyte.,Effect of cobalt content on electrochemical performance for La0.6Sr0.4CoxFe1-xO3-δ and BaZr0.8Yb0.2O3-δ composite cathodes in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.105
2,1658,"For materials composited with BZYb, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF), La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSC), and La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta (LSF) were used.",Effect of cobalt content on electrochemical performance for La0.6Sr0.4CoxFe1-xO3-δ and BaZr0.8Yb0.2O3-δ composite cathodes in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.105
3,1658,"The composite cathodes sintered at 1100 degrees C showed higher per-formance than those sintered at 900 degrees C, because the number and thickness of proton conductive network paths of BZYb within the composite cathodes increase with increasing sintering temperature.",Effect of cobalt content on electrochemical performance for La0.6Sr0.4CoxFe1-xO3-δ and BaZr0.8Yb0.2O3-δ composite cathodes in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.105
4,1658,"The PCFCs with LSCF-BZYb, LSC-BZYb, and LSF-BZYb composite cathodes exhibit power densities of 0.25, 0.19, and 0.07 W cm(-2), respec-tively, at an operating temperature of 600 degrees C.",Effect of cobalt content on electrochemical performance for La0.6Sr0.4CoxFe1-xO3-δ and BaZr0.8Yb0.2O3-δ composite cathodes in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.105
5,1658,"The polarization resistance of the Co-free LSF-BZYb composite cathodes is originally higher than those of the Co-containing LSC-BZYb and LSCF-BZYb cathodes, suggesting that Co plays an important role in obtaining high catalytic activity for cathode reactions in PCFCs as well as con-ventional solid oxide fuel cells.",Effect of cobalt content on electrochemical performance for La0.6Sr0.4CoxFe1-xO3-δ and BaZr0.8Yb0.2O3-δ composite cathodes in protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.03.105
