5,12044,"When the amount of Al(2)O(3) added was more than 26 vol%, however, the Ni anode migrated into the PSZ substrate to react with Al(2)O(3), which led to performance degradation.",Influence of reduced substrate shunting current on cell performance in integrated planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.07.058
6,12044,"In the case of the two-cell arrayed IP-SOFC with a 20 vol%-Al(2)O(3) added to the PSZ substrate, a reduced shunting current loss improved the power density by 30% compared to that of the Al(2)O(3)-free substrate.",Influence of reduced substrate shunting current on cell performance in integrated planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.07.058
