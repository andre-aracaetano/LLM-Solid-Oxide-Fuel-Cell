3,16440,The primary observables are the extent of fuel conversion and the amount of deposit formed on a YSZ disk placed at the end of the furnace.,Comparison of conversion and deposit formation of ethanol and butane under SOFC conditions,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.036
4,16440,"Experiments are performed at 700, 750 and 800 degrees C.",Comparison of conversion and deposit formation of ethanol and butane under SOFC conditions,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.036
5,16440,"The residence times in the hot zone varied from 2 to 4 s. Ethanol is more reactive than butane, and almost all the ethanol is reacted at 750 degrees C whereas butane is completely reacted at 800 degrees C. Deposit formation is much larger for butane.",Comparison of conversion and deposit formation of ethanol and butane under SOFC conditions,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.09.036
