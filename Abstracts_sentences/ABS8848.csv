1,8848,This paper reports our initial development of simulation-informed machine learning algorithms for failure diagnostics in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems.,Simulation-Informed Machine Learning Diagnostics of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,10.1149/1945-7111/ac59f4
2,8848,"We used physics-based models to simulate electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) response of a short SOFC stack under normal conditions and under three different failure modes: fuel maldistribution, delamination, and oxidant gas crossover to the anode channel.",Simulation-Informed Machine Learning Diagnostics of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,10.1149/1945-7111/ac59f4
3,8848,"These data were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) model, which is able to detect and differentiate these failures in simulated data under various conditions.",Simulation-Informed Machine Learning Diagnostics of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,10.1149/1945-7111/ac59f4
4,8848,The SVM model can also distinguish these failures from simulated uniform degradation that often occurs with long-term operation.,Simulation-Informed Machine Learning Diagnostics of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,10.1149/1945-7111/ac59f4
5,8848,These encouraging results are guiding our ongoing efforts to apply EIS as a failure diagnostic for real SOFC cells and short stacks.,Simulation-Informed Machine Learning Diagnostics of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,10.1149/1945-7111/ac59f4
