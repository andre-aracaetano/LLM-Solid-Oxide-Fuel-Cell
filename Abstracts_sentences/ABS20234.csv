2,20234,"However, state-of-the-art proton conductors arelimited by an inherent trade-off between conductivity and stability.",Durable and High-Performance Thin-Film BHYb-Coated BZCYYb Bilayer Electrolytes for Proton-Conducting Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.3c04627
3,20234,"The bilayer electrolyte design bypasses this limitation by combininga highly conductive electrolyte backbone (e.g., BaZr0.1Ce0.7-Y0.1Yb0.1O3-& delta; (BZCYYb1711)) with a highly stable protection layer (e.g., BaHf0.8Yb0.2O3-& delta; (BHYb82)).Here, a BHYb82-BZCYYb1711 bilayer electrolyte is developed, whichdramatically enhances the chemical stability while maintaining highelectrochemical performance.",Durable and High-Performance Thin-Film BHYb-Coated BZCYYb Bilayer Electrolytes for Proton-Conducting Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.3c04627
4,20234,The dense and epitaxial BHYb82 protectionlayer effectively protects the BZCYYb1711 from degradation in contaminatingatmospheres such as high concentrations of steam and CO2.,Durable and High-Performance Thin-Film BHYb-Coated BZCYYb Bilayer Electrolytes for Proton-Conducting Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.3c04627
5,20234,"When exposed to CO2 (3% H2O), the bilayercell degrades at a rate of 0.4 to 1.1%/1000 h, which is much lowerthan the unmodified cells at 5.1 to 7.0%.",Durable and High-Performance Thin-Film BHYb-Coated BZCYYb Bilayer Electrolytes for Proton-Conducting Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.3c04627
6,20234,The optimized BHYb82 thin-filmcoating adds negligible resistance to the BZCYYb1711 electrolyte whileproviding a greatly enhanced chemical stability.,Durable and High-Performance Thin-Film BHYb-Coated BZCYYb Bilayer Electrolytes for Proton-Conducting Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.3c04627
7,20234,"Bilayer-based singlecells demonstrated state-of-the-art electrochemical performance, witha high peak power density of 1.22 W cm(-2) in thefuel cell mode and -1.86 A cm(-2) at 1.3 Vin the electrolysis mode at 600 & DEG;C, while demonstrating excellentlong-term stability.",Durable and High-Performance Thin-Film BHYb-Coated BZCYYb Bilayer Electrolytes for Proton-Conducting Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsami.3c04627
