1,8160,"Eight mol% Yttria-stabilized zirconia, the most commonly employed electrolyte material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), was shaped into honeycomb structures by thermally induced gelation of aqueous zirconia slurry containing methyl cellulose using microwave irradiation.",Colloidal Shaping of 8 mol% Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte Honeycomb Structures by Microwave-Assisted Thermal Gelation of Methyl Cellulose,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02852.x
2,8160,The green honeycomb samples were subjected to green density and green compressive strength measurements revealing a uniform gelation and hence a relatively higher strength for microwave irradiated samples.,Colloidal Shaping of 8 mol% Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte Honeycomb Structures by Microwave-Assisted Thermal Gelation of Methyl Cellulose,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02852.x
3,8160,The green honeycomb samples were further sintered to crack-free dense honeycombs (>99% TD) at 1525 degrees C for 1h.,Colloidal Shaping of 8 mol% Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte Honeycomb Structures by Microwave-Assisted Thermal Gelation of Methyl Cellulose,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2012.02852.x
