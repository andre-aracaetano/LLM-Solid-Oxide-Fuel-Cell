1,2860,"The response of a solid oxide fuel cell towards waste ammonia has been studied using a small tubular solid oxide fuel cell system, since ammonia is present in certain biogas in large quantities as a breakdown product of biological waste.",Clean destruction of waste ammonia with consummate production of electrical power within a solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1039/B307396N
2,2860,"SOFCs are not only tolerant to ammonia, but can actually utilise the ammonia present in biogas to produce electrical power, at the same time acting as an environmental clean-up device breaking down the ammonia pollutant to nitrogen and water.",Clean destruction of waste ammonia with consummate production of electrical power within a solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1039/B307396N
3,2860,"Ammonia is catalytically decomposed over the nickel cermet anode to N-2 and H-2, and the H-2 is then electrochemically oxidised to water.",Clean destruction of waste ammonia with consummate production of electrical power within a solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1039/B307396N
4,2860,"Direct electrochemical oxidation of the ammonia does not occur, and no undesirable nitrogen oxides are formed.",Clean destruction of waste ammonia with consummate production of electrical power within a solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1039/B307396N
