1,16558,"The crystallographic, mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of La(0.6)AE(0.4)MnO(3) perovskites (AE = Ca and Sr) have been investigated.",Application of La0.6AE0.4MnO3 (AE=Ca and Sr) to electric current collectors in high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00303-5
2,16558,"La0.6Ca0.4MnO3 showed an orthorhombic symmetry at room temperature, and its symmetry changed into tetragonal at approximately 500 degreesC and into cubic at approximately 900 degreesC. La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 showed tetragonal symmetry at room temperature and its symmetry changed into cubic at temperatures greater than or equal to90 degreesC. Transgranular fracture of dense La(0.6)AE(0.4)MnO(3) specimens, after mechanical strength measurements at temperatures less than or equal to400 degreesC, was indicated, whereas the specimens mechanically tested after the measurement at temperatures greater than or equal to600 degreesC showed intergranular fracture.",Application of La0.6AE0.4MnO3 (AE=Ca and Sr) to electric current collectors in high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00303-5
3,16558,"Thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of the sintered specimens in the temperature range from 50 to 1000degreesC were 11.7 x 10(-6)/,C for La0.6Ca0.4MnO3 and 12.2 x 10(-6)/degreesC for La0.6Sr0.4WO3.",Application of La0.6AE0.4MnO3 (AE=Ca and Sr) to electric current collectors in high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(03)00303-5
