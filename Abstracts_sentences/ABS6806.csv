1,6806,Micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SOFC) is considered as a promising choice for portable applications.,A new design of metal supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with sandwich structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.218
2,6806,"In this work, we developed a novel metal supported MT-SOFC with porous 430 stainless steel support| 430 stainless steel-SSZ| SSZ| porous SSZ sandwich structure by dip coating and one-step co-sintering technology.",A new design of metal supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with sandwich structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.218
3,6806,The metal supported MTSOFC showed good connection between each function layer and exhibited a significant maximum power density of 271 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C.,A new design of metal supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with sandwich structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.218
4,6806,"Although the power density showed about 19.6% off after 14 thermal cycles between 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C, and about 5% per 100 h degradation rate during the 200 h long-term stability test at 700 degrees C and 0.7 V, the structure of the single cell could be maintained well and no crack and Sr diffusion was observed.",A new design of metal supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with sandwich structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.218
5,6806,"As the result, the ohmic resistance of the cell kept unchanged during the thermal cycling and long-term test.",A new design of metal supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with sandwich structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.218
6,6806,"The relatively fast degradation was attributed to the Ni and LSM particles coarsening and agglomeration, which will be improved in the further work.",A new design of metal supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with sandwich structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.218
7,6806,This work presented a low-cost and simple way to fabricate the metal supported MT-SOFCs with good electrochemical performance.,A new design of metal supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell with sandwich structure,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.218
