3,17260,"The proton conductivity of thus-obtained 20 mol%Yb-doped BaZrO3 with the 1.0 mol% of CuO addition was 55 x 10(-3)S/cm at 600 degrees C under the wet nitrogen atmosphere, which was comparable to that of the 15 mol% Yb-doped BaZrO3 sintered at 1700 degrees C for 20 h without the CuO addition.",Low temperature sintering of BaZrO3-based proton conductors for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.06.015
