1,7436,Composite materials based on gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) and alkali carbonates (Li2CO3-K2CO3 or Li2CO3-Na2CO3) are potential electrolytes for low temperature solid oxide fuel cell applications (LTSOFC).,Gadolinia-doped ceria mixed with alkali carbonates for SOFC applications: II - An electrochemical insight,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.062
2,7436,"This paper completes a first one dedicated to the thermal, structural and morphological study of such compounds; it is fully focussed on their electrical/electrochemical properties in different conditions, temperature, composition and gaseous atmosphere (oxidative or reductive).",Gadolinia-doped ceria mixed with alkali carbonates for SOFC applications: II - An electrochemical insight,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.062
3,7436,"The influence of the gaseous composition on the Arrhenius conductivity plots is evidenced, in particular under hydrogen atmosphere.",Gadolinia-doped ceria mixed with alkali carbonates for SOFC applications: II - An electrochemical insight,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.062
4,7436,"Finally, electrical conductivity determined by impedance spectroscopy is presented as a function of time to highlight the stability of such composites over 6000 h. First results on single cells showed performance at 600 degrees C of 60 mW cm(-2).",Gadolinia-doped ceria mixed with alkali carbonates for SOFC applications: II - An electrochemical insight,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.10.062
