1,14810,Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) films as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes were screen-printed on Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) electrolyte disks using powders prepared from the citrate precursor method.,Electrochemical and microstructure characteristics of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) cathodes prepared by citrate precursor method for SOFCs,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2009.01.018
2,14810,Two different powders were obtained via different calcination schemes: the one obtained with an additional calcination step in nitrogen protection atmosphere (P-NA) consisted of smaller aggregates of fine particles in comparison with that obtained only through a calcination step in air (P-A).,Electrochemical and microstructure characteristics of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) cathodes prepared by citrate precursor method for SOFCs,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2009.01.018
3,14810,"X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope observation were carried out to examine the structures and morphologies of the BSCF powders and films obtained with different sintering temperatures ranging from 800 to 950,C. AC impedance spectra for BSCF/CGO/BSCF cells were also measured to obtain the interfacial area specific resistances (ASRs).",Electrochemical and microstructure characteristics of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) cathodes prepared by citrate precursor method for SOFCs,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2009.01.018
