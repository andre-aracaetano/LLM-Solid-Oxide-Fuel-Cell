1,5670,"This work demonstrates the potential of two recently developed plasma spray methods to deposit Sr-doped La-(Mn,Fe.Co) perovskite (LSM, LSF, LSCF) cathodes, and yttria-doped zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes as components of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).",Thermal induction plasma processes for the synthesis of SOFC materials,10.1002/1521-4052(200206)33:6<322::AID-MAWE322>3.0.CO;2-3
2,5670,These methods are Thermal Plasma Chemical Vapour Deposition (TPCVD) and Suspension Plasma Spraying (SPS).,Thermal induction plasma processes for the synthesis of SOFC materials,10.1002/1521-4052(200206)33:6<322::AID-MAWE322>3.0.CO;2-3
3,5670,The microstructure obtained is determined by the method applied.,Thermal induction plasma processes for the synthesis of SOFC materials,10.1002/1521-4052(200206)33:6<322::AID-MAWE322>3.0.CO;2-3
4,5670,TPCVD results in either globular or columnar coatings which were deposited with growth rates up to 30 mum/min. SPS with a deposition rate in excess of 100 mum/min yields coatings of layered microstructure.,Thermal induction plasma processes for the synthesis of SOFC materials,10.1002/1521-4052(200206)33:6<322::AID-MAWE322>3.0.CO;2-3
5,5670,The homogeneity of the dopant distribution and the phase purity of YSZ is excellent.,Thermal induction plasma processes for the synthesis of SOFC materials,10.1002/1521-4052(200206)33:6<322::AID-MAWE322>3.0.CO;2-3
