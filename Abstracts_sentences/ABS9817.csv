1,9817,A method is described for quantitatively analyzing the level of interconnectivity of solid-oxide fuel cell electrode phases.,Three-Dimensional Analysis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Anode Interconnectivity,10.1017/S1431927609090096
2,9817,"The method was applied to the three-dimensional microstructure of a Ni-Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2, (Ni-YSZ) anode active layer Measured by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy.",Three-Dimensional Analysis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Anode Interconnectivity,10.1017/S1431927609090096
3,9817,"Each individual contiguous network of Ni, YSZ, and porosity was identified and labeled according to whether it was contiguous with the rest of the elect rode.",Three-Dimensional Analysis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Anode Interconnectivity,10.1017/S1431927609090096
4,9817,"It was determined that the YSZ phase was 100% connected, whereas at least 86% of the Ni and 96% of the pores were connected.",Three-Dimensional Analysis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Anode Interconnectivity,10.1017/S1431927609090096
5,9817,Triple-phase boundary (TPB) segments were identified and evaluated with respect to the contiguity of each of the three phases at their locations.,Three-Dimensional Analysis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Anode Interconnectivity,10.1017/S1431927609090096
6,9817,It was found that 11.6% of the TPB length was on one or more isolated phases and hence was not electrochemically active.,Three-Dimensional Analysis of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Ni-YSZ Anode Interconnectivity,10.1017/S1431927609090096
