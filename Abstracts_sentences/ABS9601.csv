1,9601,Direct carbon fuel cells (DCFCs) are highly efficient power generators fueled by abundant and cheap solid carbons.,A High-Performing Direct Carbon Fuel Cell with a 3D Architectured Anode Operated Below 600 °C,10.1002/adma.201704745
2,9601,"However, the limited triple-phase boundaries (TPBs) in the fuel electrode, due to the lack of direct contact among carbon, electrode, and electrolyte, inhibit the performance and result in poor fuel utilization.",A High-Performing Direct Carbon Fuel Cell with a 3D Architectured Anode Operated Below 600 °C,10.1002/adma.201704745
3,9601,"To address the challenges of low carbon oxidation activity and low carbon utilization, a highly efficient, 3D solid-state architected anode is developed to enhance the performance of DCFCs below 600 degrees C. The cell with the 3D textile anode framework, Gd:CeO2-Li/Na2CO3 composite electrolyte, and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 cathode demonstrates excellent performance with maximum power densities of 143, 196, and 325 mW cm(-2) at 500, 550, and 600 degrees C, respectively.",A High-Performing Direct Carbon Fuel Cell with a 3D Architectured Anode Operated Below 600 °C,10.1002/adma.201704745
4,9601,"At 500 degrees C, the cells can be operated steadily with a rated power density of approximate to 0.13 W cm(-2) at a constant current density of 0.15 A cm(-2) with a carbon utilization over 85.5%.",A High-Performing Direct Carbon Fuel Cell with a 3D Architectured Anode Operated Below 600 °C,10.1002/adma.201704745
5,9601,"These results, for the first time, demonstrate the feasibility of directly electrochemical oxidation of solid carbon at 500-600 degrees C, representing a promising strategy in developing high-performing fuel cells and other electrochemical systems via the integration of 3D architected electrodes.",A High-Performing Direct Carbon Fuel Cell with a 3D Architectured Anode Operated Below 600 °C,10.1002/adma.201704745
