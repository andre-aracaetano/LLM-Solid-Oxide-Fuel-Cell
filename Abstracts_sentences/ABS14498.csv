1,14498,The effect of the post-annealing on the properties of the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (LSC-GDC) nano-composite cathode fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is investigated.,The Effect of Post-Annealing on the Properties of a Pulsed-Laser-Deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ Nano-Composite Cathode,10.1149/2.075309jes
2,14498,Implementing the post-annealing treatment at a temperature in the range of 800 degrees C similar to 1000 degrees C enables the control of the grain size in the LSC-GDC over the range of several tens of nanometers to near one-hundred nanometers.,The Effect of Post-Annealing on the Properties of a Pulsed-Laser-Deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ Nano-Composite Cathode,10.1149/2.075309jes
3,14498,"Moreover, the post-annealing treatment improves the interconnectivity between the same materials and mitigates the vertical separation between the columnar domains, resulting in the reduction of the lateral conduction loss.",The Effect of Post-Annealing on the Properties of a Pulsed-Laser-Deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ Nano-Composite Cathode,10.1149/2.075309jes
4,14498,"In terms of the electrochemical properties, the cathodic activity of the post-annealed cathode appears to be reduced due to the reduction in the number of the surface reaction sites, which is a result of the post-annealing grain-size growth.",The Effect of Post-Annealing on the Properties of a Pulsed-Laser-Deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ Nano-Composite Cathode,10.1149/2.075309jes
5,14498,"Although this grain-size growth results less power output of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) using a post-annealed LSC-GDC cathode relative to that of the SOFC using the as-deposited LSC-GDC cathode, the lifetime of the former at 650 degrees C is improved.",The Effect of Post-Annealing on the Properties of a Pulsed-Laser-Deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ Nano-Composite Cathode,10.1149/2.075309jes
