1,4708,"Planar, Cu-containing Gadolinia-doped ceria anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells to be used at intermediate temperature (500-750 C-omicron) were produced in the present work, The Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells were fabricated using Li2O as sintering aid for Gadolinia-doped ceria, varying the anode-to-electrolyte thickness ratio (r) from 2 to 10 and the CuO content in the anode from 45 vol% to 55 vol%.",Effect of anode thickness and Cu content on consolidation and performance of planar copper-based anode-supported SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.221
2,4708,"Co-sintering of the thermo-pressed green cells was carried out at 900 C-omicron for 3 h. The electrolyte densification was favoured by increasing the r value, this being accounted for the enhanced compressive stresses induced by the supporting anode on the electrolyte upon sintering.",Effect of anode thickness and Cu content on consolidation and performance of planar copper-based anode-supported SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.221

4,4708,"Nevertheless, CuO concentration cannot exceed 50 vol% because of the tensile stresses (and corresponding flaws) generated in the electrolyte for larger amount.",Effect of anode thickness and Cu content on consolidation and performance of planar copper-based anode-supported SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.221
