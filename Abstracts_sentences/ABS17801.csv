6,17801,"The significant microstructural differences of the YSZ and SYSZ, when formed with and without LSM, then indicate that the significant decrease in network effective ion conductivity is likely to be attributable to an increase in network interruptions and anomalously high constriction resistances resulting from differential densification promoted by the LSM.",Ionic conductivity of stabilized zirconia networks in composite SOFC electrodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.03.010
