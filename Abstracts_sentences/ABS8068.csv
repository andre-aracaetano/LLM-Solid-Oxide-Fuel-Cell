1,8068,"Composite anodes consisting of Pd-substituted (La,Sr)CrO3-delta mixed with 50 wt% Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta were tested in La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta-electrolyte supported fuel cells at 800 degrees C with humidified H-2 fuel.","Pd-substituted (La,Sr)CrO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ solid oxide fuel cell anodes exhibiting regenerative behavior",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.050
2,8068,"Low anode polarization resistance was observed during the first several hours of operation, explained by the nucleation of Pd nano-particles on perovskite particle surfaces.","Pd-substituted (La,Sr)CrO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ solid oxide fuel cell anodes exhibiting regenerative behavior",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.050

4,8068,"Redox cycling repeatedly restored the anodes to their initial peak performance, followed again by degradation.","Pd-substituted (La,Sr)CrO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ solid oxide fuel cell anodes exhibiting regenerative behavior",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.050
5,8068,"This regenerative behavior was explained by the observation that the Pd nano-particles were removed by oxidation, and then re-nucleated upon reduction.","Pd-substituted (La,Sr)CrO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ solid oxide fuel cell anodes exhibiting regenerative behavior",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.050
