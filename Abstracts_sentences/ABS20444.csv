1,20444,Sr0.7R0.3CoO3-delta (R = Tb and Er) tetragonal perovskites have been prepared and evaluated as mixed ionic-electronic cathodes for SOFC.,Design of Sr0.7R0.3CoO3-δ (R = Tb and Er) Perovskites Performing as Cathode Materials in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0031710jes
2,20444,Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) measurements evidenced that both compounds are oxygen hypo-stoichiometric with long-range order of oxygen vacancies that leads to a tetragonal perovskite-type superstructure (s.g. I4/mmm) stable within the whole temperature range under study.,Design of Sr0.7R0.3CoO3-δ (R = Tb and Er) Perovskites Performing as Cathode Materials in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0031710jes
3,20444,The oxygen vacancies located mainly in the equatorial oxygen positions exhibit large displacement factors.,Design of Sr0.7R0.3CoO3-δ (R = Tb and Er) Perovskites Performing as Cathode Materials in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0031710jes
4,20444,The high oxygen mobility in Sr0.7Tb0.3CoO3-delta was confirmed by O-18 oxygen labeling followed by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) with values of oxygen self-diffusion of 1.29 x 10(-10) cm(2)/s at 525 degrees C. Polarization resistances with LSGM as electrolyte gave values as low as 0.011 Omega.cm(2) and maximum output powers of 570 mW/cm(2) at 850 degrees C were obtained in test cells set in electrolyte-supported configuration.,Design of Sr0.7R0.3CoO3-δ (R = Tb and Er) Perovskites Performing as Cathode Materials in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0031710jes
