1,17027,"Scandia-stabilised zirconia (ScSZ) electrolyte materials exhibit the highest conductivity of all the zirconia systems, but the degradation in the ScSZ system has only been investigated yet for samples of 7.8, 8.0 and 11.0 mol% Sc2O3.",Degradation of the electrical conductivity in stabilised zirconia system Part II:: Scandia-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.039
2,17027,"Therefore, ScSZ electrolytes with scandia contents varying from 7 to 13 mol% were synthesised and their electrical conductivity and phase composition was determined as a function of annealing time at 1000 degreesC. A conductivity degradation occurs in aged specimens with less than 10 mol% Sc2O3, which were cubic at room temperature.",Degradation of the electrical conductivity in stabilised zirconia system Part II:: Scandia-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.039
3,17027,"On the other hand, the conductivity of the specimens with higher scandia content was stable after annealing.",Degradation of the electrical conductivity in stabilised zirconia system Part II:: Scandia-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.039
4,17027,"These specimens were rhombohedral at room temperature, but transform into the cubic phase between 400 and 600 degreesC. This phase transition is accompanied by a volume change DeltaV of 0.15%.",Degradation of the electrical conductivity in stabilised zirconia system Part II:: Scandia-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.039
5,17027,"To suppress the phase change, 1 mol% Al2O3 was added to specimens with 7-13 mol% scandia.",Degradation of the electrical conductivity in stabilised zirconia system Part II:: Scandia-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.039
6,17027,They showed no relevant difference in conductivity and phase to the specimens without alumina.,Degradation of the electrical conductivity in stabilised zirconia system Part II:: Scandia-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.039
7,17027,"In addition, 10ScSZ samples were doped with higher amounts of alumina up to 5.5 mol% (Al-10ScSZ), and titania up to 6 mol% (Ti-10ScSZ).",Degradation of the electrical conductivity in stabilised zirconia system Part II:: Scandia-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.039
8,17027,"The cubic phase stabilisation was not obtained with the addition of 5.5 mol% Al2O3, but already with the addition of 2 mol% TiO2.",Degradation of the electrical conductivity in stabilised zirconia system Part II:: Scandia-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.039
9,17027,"On the other hand, the conductivity drop of both the Al- and the Ti-10ScSZ electrolytes with increasing alumina or titania content, makes them uninteresting for applications in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).",Degradation of the electrical conductivity in stabilised zirconia system Part II:: Scandia-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.039
10,17027,Finally an interpretation for the conductivity degradation for stabilised zirconia electrolytes is given.,Degradation of the electrical conductivity in stabilised zirconia system Part II:: Scandia-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.039
