1,3195,The effects of switching asymmetry and flux walking on an isolated current-fed full-bridge boost converter are presented with two different secondary configurations: a voltage doubler (VD) and a diode bridge (DB).,Effects of Switching Asymmetry on an Isolated Full-Bridge Boost Converter,10.1109/TPEL.2010.2045902
2,3195,"The results show that a drop in the converter efficiency is clearly visible when there are switching asymmetries in the DB configuration, whereas the VD configuration is more tolerant of switching asymmetries because of its inherent capability to oppose flux walking.",Effects of Switching Asymmetry on an Isolated Full-Bridge Boost Converter,10.1109/TPEL.2010.2045902
