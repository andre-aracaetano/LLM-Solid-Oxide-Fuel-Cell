1,5961,"Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are an energy conversion device that theoretically has the capability of producing electrical energy for as long as the fuel and oxidant are supplied to the electrodes but performance is expected for, at least, 40,000 h. In reality, performance degradation is observed in planar SOFC with metallic bipolar plate under steady and repeated thermal cycling conditions, which limits the practical operating life of these SOFCs.","Advances, aging mechanisms and lifetime in solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.09.025
