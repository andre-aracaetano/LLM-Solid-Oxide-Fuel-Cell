5,19786,"In order to use (La0.6Sr0.4) CoO3 cathode, a thin (CeO2)(0.9)(GdO1.5)(0.1) interlayer was also fabricated by the slurry dip-coating method.",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported tubular SOFCs with zirconia-based electrolyte for reduced temperature operation,10.1149/1.1768131
6,19786,The fabricated tubular cell generated electricity successfully between 600 and 850 degreesC. Power density of ca.,Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported tubular SOFCs with zirconia-based electrolyte for reduced temperature operation,10.1149/1.1768131
7,19786,"170 and 220 mW/cm(2) was achieved at 600 and 700 degreesC, respectively, however, the ohmic resistance was larger than expected.",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported tubular SOFCs with zirconia-based electrolyte for reduced temperature operation,10.1149/1.1768131
8,19786,"Because (CeO2)(0.9)(GdO1.5)(0.1) interlayer was used, ohmic resistance could be high due to the formation of a layer of (Zr, Ce)O-2 solid solution at the zirconia/ceria interface.",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported tubular SOFCs with zirconia-based electrolyte for reduced temperature operation,10.1149/1.1768131
9,19786,"The gaseous diffusion resistance governed the performance between 700 and 850 degreesC. Better performances of the anode-supported tubular SOFCs can be achieved by further optimizations for the zirconia/ceria interface, control of both porosity and thickness of the anode substrate, as well as improvement of the (La0.6Sr0.4) CoO3 cathode.",Fabrication and characterization of anode-supported tubular SOFCs with zirconia-based electrolyte for reduced temperature operation,10.1149/1.1768131
