3,20120,"This study is focused on the reproducibility of electrochemical characterization results of patterned Ni anodes, with a parameter variation of the partial pressures of H-2 and H2O, temperature, and polarization voltage.",Degradation and Relaxation Effects of Ni Patterned Anodes in H2-H2O Atmosphere,10.1149/1.3383041
4,20120,"Considerable (electro)chemical relaxation and degradation processes with time constants in the order of some hours were found and are discussed: (i) an initial decrease in the line specific resistance (LSR) during the first 20-25 h of temperature exposure (T = 800 degrees C) attributed to a restructuring process in the Ni thin film, (ii) reversible changes in LSR upon variations of the partial pressure of H-2 and H2O in correlation to the initial gas composition, and (iii) rapid reversible changes in LSR upon anodic and cathodic polarization voltages followed by a slow relaxation.",Degradation and Relaxation Effects of Ni Patterned Anodes in H2-H2O Atmosphere,10.1149/1.3383041
5,20120,The corresponding preconditions for reliable measurement series were deduced and yield the data set of the LSR values.,Degradation and Relaxation Effects of Ni Patterned Anodes in H2-H2O Atmosphere,10.1149/1.3383041
