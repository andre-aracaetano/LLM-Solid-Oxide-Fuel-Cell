4,11843,"Their oxidation kinetics was systematically investigated in air at 600-800 degrees C. Relative density, oxidation rate constant and electrical conductivity can be readily optimized by adjusting the Ni content in the cermets, and their corresponding maximum values reached 99.6%, 2.56 x 10(-11) g(2) cm(-4)",TiN-Ni Cermets with High Oxidation Resistance and Electrical Conductivity as Candidates for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnects,10.1007/s11837-019-03418-7
