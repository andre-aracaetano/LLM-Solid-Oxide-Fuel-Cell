1,8237,"To elucidate the reaction mechanism of the co-fired La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/YSZ electrode in solid oxide fuel cells, two different electrode microstructures were prepared using the co-firing method: the electrodes were of type A and type B. Those electrodes consist of a mixture of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 and YSZ particles.","Oxygen reduction behavior at co-fired La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/YSZ interface, as an SOFC air electrode",10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.65.407
2,8237,"The electrochemical properties of them were measured by the complex impedance and the steady-state cathodic polarization as a function of oxygen partial pressure, For the type A electrode, the contacts between each electrode particle in P(O-2), at 800-1000 degrees C. with those of type B. For both electrodes, the electrode interface conductivity, sigma(E),increases in proportion to P(O-2)(1/2) in lower P(O-2)s, and tends lo be saturated in higher P(O-2)s.","Oxygen reduction behavior at co-fired La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/YSZ interface, as an SOFC air electrode",10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.65.407
3,8237,"The and P(O-2) was interpreted by the model that the rate determining step is the surface diffusion of adsorbed oxygen atoms, O-ad, on the electrode surface.","Oxygen reduction behavior at co-fired La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/YSZ interface, as an SOFC air electrode",10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.65.407
4,8237,"For the type A electrode, the relationship between the cathodic current density, i, and the overpotential, eta, obeys the O-ad surface diffusion model.","Oxygen reduction behavior at co-fired La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/YSZ interface, as an SOFC air electrode",10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.65.407
5,8237,"For the type B electrode, however, the observed polarization curve deviated from that determined by this model.","Oxygen reduction behavior at co-fired La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/YSZ interface, as an SOFC air electrode",10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.65.407
6,8237,"Under large polarization, the predominant reaction path is much affected by the electrode microstructure.","Oxygen reduction behavior at co-fired La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/YSZ interface, as an SOFC air electrode",10.5796/kogyobutsurikagaku.65.407
