2,6017,"Four different composite anode materials: Ni-SSZ (SSZ: (ZrO2)(0.89)(Sc2O3)(0.1)(CeO2)(0.01)), Ni-GDC (GDC: Ce0.9Gd0.1O2), Ni-GDC-SLT, and GDC-SLT were prepared.",Redox-stable Sr0.9La0.1TiO3-supported SOFC single cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.160
3,6017,The porous thick Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 substrate was stable enough during 50 redox cycles so that OCV showed no decrease during the cycling test.,Redox-stable Sr0.9La0.1TiO3-supported SOFC single cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.160
4,6017,"Moreover, the electrochemical performance, redox stability, and performance degradation during the cycling tests were mainly determined by the different electrical and catalytic properties of the composite anode materials.",Redox-stable Sr0.9La0.1TiO3-supported SOFC single cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.160
