1,8353,"A porous NiO-YSZ substrate for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells has been prepared by gelcasting of NiO-YSZ powders using urea-formaldehyde monomers, followed by humidity-controlled drying, binder removal, and sintering of the gelled bodies.",Preparation of a porous cermet SOFC anode substrate by gelcasting of NiO-YSZ powders,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01385.x
2,8353,The gelled bodies had sufficient strength to remove even 2-mm-thick samples from the mold immediately after gelation.,Preparation of a porous cermet SOFC anode substrate by gelcasting of NiO-YSZ powders,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01385.x
3,8353,"A gelcast NiO-YSZ sample sintered at 1450 degrees C for 2 h showed an open porosity of similar to 53 vol%, and the porosity increased to similar to 58% upon reduction with hydrogen.",Preparation of a porous cermet SOFC anode substrate by gelcasting of NiO-YSZ powders,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01385.x
4,8353,"Pore sizes measured on the scanning electron microscopy photomicrograph of NiO-YSZ and Ni-YSZ cermet substrates are in the range of 2-5 mu m. Urea-formaldehyde polymer, present in a high amount (similar to 13 wt%) in the gelcast body, acts as a template for pores.",Preparation of a porous cermet SOFC anode substrate by gelcasting of NiO-YSZ powders,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01385.x
