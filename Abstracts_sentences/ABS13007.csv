1,13007,"This study reports a kind of single layer solid oxide fuel cell (SLSOFC) based on semiconductor-ionic conductor composite material which consists of Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC, ionic conductor), La0.25Sr0.75Ti1O3+delta (LST, n-type semiconductor) and Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-delta (NCAL, p-type semiconductor).",Single layer low-temperature SOFC based on Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ- La0.25Sr0.75Ti1O3-δ- Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-δ composite material,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.043
2,13007,It was found that the LST-SDC-NCAL composite based SLSOFC exhibited open circuit voltage (OCV) of more than 1 V and maximum power density of 222 mW cm(-2) under 550 degrees C. In-situ Schottky junction in the devicehelps to prevent short circuiting aswell as promote ion transport.,Single layer low-temperature SOFC based on Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ- La0.25Sr0.75Ti1O3-δ- Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-δ composite material,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.043
