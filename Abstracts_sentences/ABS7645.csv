3,7645,"Below 700 degrees C, BCTb has dominant proton conductivity while above 700 degrees C, the electronic conductivity becomes more significant, showing apparent behavior change from proton to mixed proton-electronic conductor.",Bi-functional performances of BaCe0.95Tb0.05O3-δ-based hollow fiber membranes for power generation and hydrogen permeation,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2016.06.041
4,7645,This enables its applicability as an electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) below 700 degrees C and as a hydrogen permeation membrane beyond 700 degrees C. Microtubular SOFC showed a maximum power density of 552 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C. Hydrogen permeation membrane demonstrated the highest flux of 0.53 mL min(-1) cm(-2) at 850 degrees C.,Bi-functional performances of BaCe0.95Tb0.05O3-δ-based hollow fiber membranes for power generation and hydrogen permeation,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2016.06.041
5,7645,The transition from proton to mixed protonic-electronic conductor was substantiated by the abrupt reduction in the open circuit voltage of the SOFC operated above 700 degrees C and in the protonic transport number from 0.94 to 0.81 with the temperature rise from 700 to 850 degrees C.
