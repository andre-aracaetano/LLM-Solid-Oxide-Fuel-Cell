2,19173,Only very few studies compared electrical (k(q)) and tracer (k*) exchange coefficients of solid-gas interfaces measured under identical conditions.,Water-Induced Decoupling of Tracer and Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Kinetics on Mixed Conducting Electrodes,10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00778
3,19173,The 1:1 correlation between k(q) and k* often made is thus more an assumption than experimentally verified.,Water-Induced Decoupling of Tracer and Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Kinetics on Mixed Conducting Electrodes,10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00778
4,19173,In this study it is shown that the measured rates of electrical and tracer exchange of oxygen may strongly differ.,Water-Induced Decoupling of Tracer and Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Kinetics on Mixed Conducting Electrodes,10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00778
5,19173,Simultaneous acquisition of k(q) and k* on La0.6Sr0.4FeO3.delta and SrTi0.3FeO3.delta thin film electrodes revealed that k* > 100 k(q) in humid oxidizing (O-16(2) + (H2O)-O-18) and humid reducing (H-2 + (H2O)-O-18) atmospheres.,Water-Induced Decoupling of Tracer and Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Kinetics on Mixed Conducting Electrodes,10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00778
6,19173,"These results are explained by fast water adsorption and dissociation on surface oxygen vacancies, forming two surface hydroxyl groups.",Water-Induced Decoupling of Tracer and Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Kinetics on Mixed Conducting Electrodes,10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00778
7,19173,"Hence, interpreting experimentally determined k* values in terms of electrochemically relevant oxygen exchange is not straightforward.",Water-Induced Decoupling of Tracer and Electrochemical Oxygen Exchange Kinetics on Mixed Conducting Electrodes,10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00778
