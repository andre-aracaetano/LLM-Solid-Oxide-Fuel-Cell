1,846,"The development of proton, oxygen-ion, and electron mixed conducting materials, known as triple-conduction materials, as cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs) is highly desired because they can increase fuel cell performance by extending the reaction active area.","A real proton-conductive, robust, and cobalt-free cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with exceptional performance",10.1002/sus2.156
2,846,"Although oxygen-ion and electron conductions can be measured directly, proton conduction in these oxides is usually estimated indirectly.","A real proton-conductive, robust, and cobalt-free cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with exceptional performance",10.1002/sus2.156
3,846,"Because of the instability of cathode materials in a reducing environment, direct measurement of proton conduction in cathode oxide is difficult.","A real proton-conductive, robust, and cobalt-free cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with exceptional performance",10.1002/sus2.156
4,846,"The La0.8Sr0.2Sc0.5Fe0.5O3-delta (LSSF) cathode material is proposed for H-SOFCs in this study, which can survive in an H-2-containing atmosphere, allowing measurement of proton conduction in LSSF by hydrogen permeation technology.","A real proton-conductive, robust, and cobalt-free cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with exceptional performance",10.1002/sus2.156
5,846,"Furthermore, LSSF is discovered to be a unique proton and electron mixed-conductive material with limited oxygen diffusion capability that is specifically designed for H-SOFCs.","A real proton-conductive, robust, and cobalt-free cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with exceptional performance",10.1002/sus2.156
6,846,"The LSSF is an appealing cathode choice for H-SOFCs due to its outstanding CO2 tolerance and matched thermal expansion coefficient, producing a record-high performance of 2032 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C and good long-term stability under operational conditions.","A real proton-conductive, robust, and cobalt-free cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with exceptional performance",10.1002/sus2.156
7,846,"The current study reveals that a new type of proton-electron mixed conducting cathode can provide promising performance for H-SOFCs, opening the way for developing high-performance cathodes.","A real proton-conductive, robust, and cobalt-free cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with exceptional performance",10.1002/sus2.156
