6,18691,"Moreover, electrical properties of the coated Crofer22APU alloy are tested up to 2500 h and an excellent compatibility is found between Mn1.5Co1.5O4 coated Crofer22APU and a new glass-ceramic sealant, after 500 h of thermal tests in air, thus suggesting that the spinet protection layer can effectively act as a barrier to outward diffusion of Cr.
