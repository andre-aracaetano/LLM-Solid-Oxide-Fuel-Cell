1,14733,"Considering that conventional lanthanum chromate (LaCrO3) interconnector is hard to be co-sintered with green anode, we have fabricated a novel bilayered interconnector which consists of La-doped SrTiO3 (Sr0.6La0.4TiO3) and Sr-doped lanthanum manganite (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3).",A novel bilayered Sr0.6La0.4TiO3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 interconnector for anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cell via slurry-brushing and co-sintering process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.088
2,14733,"Sr0.6La0.4TiO3 is conductive and stable in reducing atmosphere, locating on the anode side; while La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 is on the cathode side.",A novel bilayered Sr0.6La0.4TiO3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 interconnector for anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cell via slurry-brushing and co-sintering process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.088
3,14733,"A slurry-brushing and co-sintering method is applied; the Sr0.6La0.4TiO3 and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 slurries are successively brushed onto green anode specimen, followed by co-firing course to form a dense bilayered Sr0.6La0.4TiO3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 interconnector.",A novel bilayered Sr0.6La0.4TiO3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 interconnector for anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cell via slurry-brushing and co-sintering process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.088
4,14733,"For operating with humidified hydrogen and oxygen at 900 degrees C, the ohmic resistances between anode and cathode/interconnector are 0.33 Omega cm(2) and 0.186 Omega cm(2), respectively.",A novel bilayered Sr0.6La0.4TiO3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 interconnector for anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cell via slurry-brushing and co-sintering process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.088
5,14733,"The maximum power density is 290 mW cm(-2) for a cell with interconnector, and 420 mW cm(-2) for a cell without it, which demonstrates that nearly 70% of the power output can be achieved using this bilayered Sr0.6La0.4TiO3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 interconnector.",A novel bilayered Sr0.6La0.4TiO3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 interconnector for anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cell via slurry-brushing and co-sintering process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.088
