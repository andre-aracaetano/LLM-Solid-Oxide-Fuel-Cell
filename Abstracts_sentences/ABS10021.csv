2,10021,Experiments were conducted for 250 h in the temperature range of 650-850 degrees C to evaluate the time and temperature dependence of chromium evaporation in the initial oxidation stage.,Volatilization of chromium from AISI 441 stainless steel: Time and temperature dependence,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2022.128125
3,10021,"The results showed a thermally activated process with an activation energy of 218.3 kJ.mol(- 1) and parabolic evolution over time at 650 and 750 degrees C, while a change in the evaporation kinetics was observed at 850 degrees C, resulting in a linear trend.",Volatilization of chromium from AISI 441 stainless steel: Time and temperature dependence,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2022.128125
4,10021,A diffusion-evaporation model was applied and compared to the experimental data demonstrating the role of the chromium cation diffusion on the evaporation process.,Volatilization of chromium from AISI 441 stainless steel: Time and temperature dependence,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2022.128125
