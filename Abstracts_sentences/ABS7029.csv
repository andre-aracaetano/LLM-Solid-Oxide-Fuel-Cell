2,7029,A detailed post-test analysis of stacks is of major importance in understanding degradation mechanisms.,Component interactions after long-term operation of an SOFC stack with LSM cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.117
3,7029,"Here the results are reported of a post-test analysis of an SOFC stack with anode supported cells with Ni/YSZ anode, 8YSZ electrolyte, and a lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) cathode operated under steady-state conditions for 19,000h.",Component interactions after long-term operation of an SOFC stack with LSM cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.117
4,7029,"In particular, the microstructural and chemical analyses of the relevant metallic and ceramic components are reported.",Component interactions after long-term operation of an SOFC stack with LSM cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.117
5,7029,"The interconnects were coated with a (Mn,Co,Fe)(3) O-4 spinel by atmospheric plasma spraying, which prevented Cr evaporating into the cathode compartment.",Component interactions after long-term operation of an SOFC stack with LSM cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.117
6,7029,"The diffusion of Mn from the (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode into the 8YSZ electrolyte led to local enrichment at grain boundaries, which might have been responsible for the degradation via electronic pathways leading to partial short-circuiting across the electrolyte.",Component interactions after long-term operation of an SOFC stack with LSM cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.117
7,7029,"However, the ultimate failure of the stack was the result of a weakening and fracture of the 8YSZ electrolyte along grain boundaries due to the local Mn enrichment.",Component interactions after long-term operation of an SOFC stack with LSM cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.117
