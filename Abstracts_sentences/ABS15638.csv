3,15638,"As shown in a neutron powder diffraction (NPD) study at RT, for x = 0 and 0.2 the compounds crystallized in a single phase with brownmillerite-type structure (s.g. Pcrnn), whereas for x = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, and 1.4 the samples crystallized in a supercell, two times the c-axis and the volume of that for a typical brownmillerite (s.g Pcmb).",Structural and electrical characterization of the Co-doped Ca2Fe2O5 brownmillerite: Evaluation as SOFC -cathode materials,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.067
4,15638,"This superstructure consists of Fe1O(4) and Co1O(4) tetrahedral layers containing Fe1 and Co1 atoms, which alternate with (Fe,Co)2O(6) and (Fe,Co)3O(6) octahedral layers.",Structural and electrical characterization of the Co-doped Ca2Fe2O5 brownmillerite: Evaluation as SOFC -cathode materials,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.067
