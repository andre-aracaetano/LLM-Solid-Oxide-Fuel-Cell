1,12451,It is possible for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to use the alloy as interconnect due to that the SOFC's operation temperature lowers to the middle temperature of 600 similar to 800 degrees C.,Development of Coating Materials on Alloy Interconnect in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
2,12451,"In order to prolong the life of alloy in the SOFC operating condition, e.g. high-temperature oxidation and humid hydrogen, it is necessary to coat the protect layers.",Development of Coating Materials on Alloy Interconnect in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
3,12451,The perovskite and spinel oxide are usually optimized as the coating materials on alloys.,Development of Coating Materials on Alloy Interconnect in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
4,12451,"It is important to deposite dense oxides of coatings on the surface of metallic alloy, which could decrease the oxidation rate of alloys and reduce the poison of Cr to cathode by reacting with Cr that vaporizes from the alloys.",Development of Coating Materials on Alloy Interconnect in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
5,12451,"The high electrical conductivity of the coating materials is required to lower the interlayer resistance, and the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of it should match that of alloys in order to prevent the coating layer from falling off.",Development of Coating Materials on Alloy Interconnect in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
6,12451,"Up to now, there are not the optimized coating materials to satisfy the above properties.",Development of Coating Materials on Alloy Interconnect in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
7,12451,"Therefore, the research works should be continued in the areas.",Development of Coating Materials on Alloy Interconnect in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,
