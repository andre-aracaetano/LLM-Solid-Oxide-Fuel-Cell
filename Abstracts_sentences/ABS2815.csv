1,2815,Adding ZnO reduces sintering temperature of yttria stabilized zirconia.,Microstructural and Electrical Features of Yttrium Stabilised Zirconia with ZnO as Sintering Additive,10.1590/1980-5373-MR-2015-0161
2,2815,"Adding up to 0.5 wt% of ZnO is possible to densify to 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (TZ8Y) to 95% of relative density at 1300 degrees C, besides, the electrical conductivity increases about 30% at 800 degrees C when compared to pure TZ8Y with the same relative density and average grain size.",Microstructural and Electrical Features of Yttrium Stabilised Zirconia with ZnO as Sintering Additive,10.1590/1980-5373-MR-2015-0161
3,2815,These results show that TZ8Y co-doped with ZnO can be a potential electrolyte to solid oxide fuel cells and electrolyzer cells.,Microstructural and Electrical Features of Yttrium Stabilised Zirconia with ZnO as Sintering Additive,10.1590/1980-5373-MR-2015-0161
