2,16127,"Here, findings that dramatically enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of a conventional (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.95)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) air electrode by a multiphase catalyst coating composed of a conformal Pr1-xBaxCoO3-delta thin film and exsolved BaCoO3-delta nanoparticles, are reported.",Highly Active and Durable Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells Enabled by an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst,10.1002/aenm.202103783
3,16127,"At 600 degrees C, the catalyst coating decreases the polarization resistance of the LSCF air electrode by a factor of 25 (from 1.09 to 0.043 omega cm(2)) in air and the degradation rate by two orders of magnitude (from 1.0 x 10(-2) to 1.8 x 10(-4)",Highly Active and Durable Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells Enabled by an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst,10.1002/aenm.202103783

5,16127,"Further, a single cell with the catalyst-coated LSCF air electrode at 600 degrees C demonstrates a high peak power density of 1.04 W cm(-2) in the fuel cell mode and a high current density of 1.82 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V in the electrolysis mode.",Highly Active and Durable Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells Enabled by an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst,10.1002/aenm.202103783
6,16127,"The significantly enhanced performance of the LSCF air electrode is attributed mainly to the high rate of surface oxygen exchange, fast surface proton diffusion, and the rapid H2O and O-2 dissociation on the catalysts.",Highly Active and Durable Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells Enabled by an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst,10.1002/aenm.202103783
