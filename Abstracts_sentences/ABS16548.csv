2,16548,The A-site and charge ordered NdBaMn2O5 material has been synthesized by solid-state reaction in a reducing atmosphere at 1100 degrees C for 12 h; the resulting material crystallizes in root 2a(p) x a(p) x 2a(p) tetragonal cell of P4/nmm space group.,Synthesis and preliminary study of the double perovskite NdBaMn2O5 + δ as symmetric SOFC electrode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.022
3,16548,Thermogravimetric analysis coupled to HT-XRD experiment shows that the material is completely stable to redox cycling between air and 5% H-2/Ar up to at least 850 degrees C.,Synthesis and preliminary study of the double perovskite NdBaMn2O5 + δ as symmetric SOFC electrode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.022
4,16548,"In air, the phase is completely oxidized to A-site ordered NdBaMn2O6 (P4/mmm) and in anode conditions is reduced back to its initial form, with intermediate formation of orthorhombic NdBaMn2O5.5 ordered phase.",Synthesis and preliminary study of the double perovskite NdBaMn2O5 + δ as symmetric SOFC electrode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.022
5,16548,"Considering possible conditions of cell preparation in air (T = 1300 degrees C for 6 h), a loss of A-site ordering is evidenced but the material is reduced back to ordered NdBaMn2O5",Synthesis and preliminary study of the double perovskite NdBaMn2O5 + δ as symmetric SOFC electrode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.022

7,16548,"Whereas the material reacts strongly with SYSZ at 1300 degrees C, no particular chemical affinity with 20GDC is observed neither at high temperature in air nor at 850 degrees C in anodic atmosphere; TEC coefficients for NdBaMn2O5 (+) (delta), measured in both anode and cathode conditions, are also in good agreement with reported TEC values for a ceria electrolyte.",Synthesis and preliminary study of the double perovskite NdBaMn2O5 + δ as symmetric SOFC electrode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.022
8,16548,Relatively low values of electrical conductivity are found in diluted hydrogen whereas a sufficient level for the application is obtained in air.,Synthesis and preliminary study of the double perovskite NdBaMn2O5 + δ as symmetric SOFC electrode material,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.022
