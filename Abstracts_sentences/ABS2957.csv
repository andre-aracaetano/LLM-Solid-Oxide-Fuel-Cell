1,2957,"Ferritic stainless steels (16-18 wt.% Cr) can be used as interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) that operate at lower temperatures, i.e., <800degreesC. Long-term reliability is a concern; however, as oxidation of the steel can occur readily at elevated temperatures leading to the formation of Cr2O3 and Cr-Mn spinel ((CrMn)(3)O-4).",Sol-gel coatings to reduce oxide growth in interconnects used for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.06.063
