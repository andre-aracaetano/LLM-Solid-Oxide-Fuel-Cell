1,6905,"In this study, SUS430 alloy is evaluated for its high temperature corrosion properties as a possible material for interconnects of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",High temperature oxidation behavior of SUS430 SOFC interconnects with Mn-Co spinel coating in air,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.01.015
2,6905,"Samples are coated with Mn-Co by commercial physical vapor deposition (PVD) process and oxidized in air for 1250 h at 800 degrees C. A dense cubic Mn-Co-Fe spinel layer is formed on the surface, showing great effect on corrosion reduction compared with the samples without coating.",High temperature oxidation behavior of SUS430 SOFC interconnects with Mn-Co spinel coating in air,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.01.015
