3,11461,"Because the carbon deposition rate increased with increasing GDC content, the redox stability decreased.","Percolation effect on electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.01.128
4,11461,"The area specific resistance (ASR) of the SLT-GDC composite anode at 800 degrees C in H-2 decreased up to 15 vol.% GDC (SLT-GDC15) and then increased at the SLT-GDC20 and the SLT-GDC33 compositions, due to the high electro-catalytic activity and low electrical conductivity of GDC.","Percolation effect on electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.01.128
5,11461,"Consequently, the SLT-GDC15 composition within the mixed region below SLT and GDC percolation limit exhibited the best electrochemical performance due to the optimized electronic and ionic conduction network.","Percolation effect on electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.01.128
