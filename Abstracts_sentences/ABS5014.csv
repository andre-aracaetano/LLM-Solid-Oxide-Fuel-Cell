1,5014,This paper presents a performance analysis of a planar SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) with proton-conducting electrolyte (SOFC-H(+)).,Analysis of a proton-conducting SOFC with direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.ces.2009.06.066
2,5014,The SOFC-H(+) is fueled by methane and operated under direct internal reforming and isothermal conditions.,Analysis of a proton-conducting SOFC with direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.ces.2009.06.066
3,5014,A one-dimensional steady-state model coupled with a detailed electrochemical model is employed to investigate the distribution of gas composition within fuel and air channels and all the electrochemical-related variables.,Analysis of a proton-conducting SOFC with direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.ces.2009.06.066
4,5014,The current voltage characteristics of SOFC-H(+) are analyzed and the result shows that the operation of SOFC-H(+) at 0.7 V gives a good compromise on power density and fuel utilization.,Analysis of a proton-conducting SOFC with direct internal reforming,10.1016/j.ces.2009.06.066
