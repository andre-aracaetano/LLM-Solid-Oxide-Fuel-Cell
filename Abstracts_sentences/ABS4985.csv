2,4985,"However, the exact nature of the coarsening process is not known, nor how it affects three-phase boundaries (TPBs) and the resulting electrochemical performance.",Simulation of coarsening in three-phase solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.010
3,4985,We apply a phase-field approach to simulate the microstructural evolution of Ni-YSZ anode functional layers.,Simulation of coarsening in three-phase solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.010
4,4985,An experimentally obtained three-dimensional reconstruction of a functional layer from an anode-supported SOFC is used as the initial microstructure.,Simulation of coarsening in three-phase solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.010
5,4985,"The evolution of the microstructure is characterized quantitatively by examining the TPB density, interfacial area per unit volume, and tortuosity versus time.",Simulation of coarsening in three-phase solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.010
6,4985,"The assumed TPB contact angles are found to have a strong effect on the microstructural evolution; in particular, reducing the contact angle of nickel on YSZ yields less TPB reduction.",Simulation of coarsening in three-phase solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.010
