1,7794,"Interconnector (IC) is a key component for current collection in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks, but leads to uneven distribution of gas (especially O-2) and significantly reduces the power density.",Effect of Interconnector Rib on Optimization of SOFC Structural Parameters,10.1149/1945-7111/ac911d
2,7794,"In this paper, a 3D numerical model is developed to study the effect of interconnector on the optimization of cathode structures of a planar SOFC.",Effect of Interconnector Rib on Optimization of SOFC Structural Parameters,10.1149/1945-7111/ac911d
3,7794,"After model validation, parametric analyses are conducted to investigate the effects of cathode structural properties on the SOFC performance and temperature distribution, considering the interconnect dimensions and parameter variations along the flow channel.",Effect of Interconnector Rib on Optimization of SOFC Structural Parameters,10.1149/1945-7111/ac911d
4,7794,It is found that the interconnector causes more non-uniform distribution of oxygen in the downstream cathode than in the upstream.,Effect of Interconnector Rib on Optimization of SOFC Structural Parameters,10.1149/1945-7111/ac911d
5,7794,Increasing porosity or cathode thickness can improve the oxygen uniformity and the cell electrochemical performance especially in the downstream.,Effect of Interconnector Rib on Optimization of SOFC Structural Parameters,10.1149/1945-7111/ac911d
6,7794,"However, too high porosity (epsilon > 0.4) or too thick cathode (t (c) > 250 mu m) can cause significant ohmic or concentration losses, respectively.",Effect of Interconnector Rib on Optimization of SOFC Structural Parameters,10.1149/1945-7111/ac911d
7,7794,"Besides, gradient porosity can increase the oxygen uniformity (up to 6.5%) and reduce the concentration loss (up to 10.6%) especially under the rib.",Effect of Interconnector Rib on Optimization of SOFC Structural Parameters,10.1149/1945-7111/ac911d
8,7794,"In addition, a higher temperature region is observed in the cathode area under the channel, while increasing the porosity, the cathode thickness or using gradient porosity all cause a more uniform temperature distribution.",Effect of Interconnector Rib on Optimization of SOFC Structural Parameters,10.1149/1945-7111/ac911d
