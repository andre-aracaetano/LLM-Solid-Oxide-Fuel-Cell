3,8167,"Overall, the electrochemical performance of the Ba2Co9O14/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta & nbsp;(BCO/CGO-20) composite electrode is found to be enhanced under cathodic polarisation, while becoming impaired under anodic polarisation.",The effects of polarisation on the performance of the Ba2Co9O14-Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-d composite electrode for fuel cells and electrolysers,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.169
4,8167,"The latter behaviour may result from the high local oxygen partial pressures upon increasing the applied anodic polarisation that lead to a depletion of oxygen vacancies at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thus, decreasing the ionic conductivity as well as electrocatalytic activity of this interface.",The effects of polarisation on the performance of the Ba2Co9O14-Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-d composite electrode for fuel cells and electrolysers,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.169
5,8167,"This work, therefore, provides the first electrochemical analysis of the performance of BCO-based electrodes under applied polarisation conditions for SOFC and SOEC applications, and highlights the higher potential of this compound as a cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.",The effects of polarisation on the performance of the Ba2Co9O14-Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-d composite electrode for fuel cells and electrolysers,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.169
