3,6659,"It has been shown that the segregated SrO has a significant inhibiting effect on the surface exchange process such as dissociative adsorption, incorporation and diffusion of oxygen species on the LSM surface, resulting in the initially very high impedance for the O-2 reduction on LSM electrodes.","A mechanistic study on the activation process of (La, Sr)MnO3 electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2006.05.022
