3,6788,"Based on the physical connections and interactions of microstructure parameters, two submodel correlations (i.e., porosity-tortuosity and porosity-particle size ratio) are proposed.",Microscale Correlations Adoption in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4031153
4,6788,Three experiments from literature are selected to facilitate the validation of the numerical results with experimental data.,Microscale Correlations Adoption in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4031153
5,6788,"In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the impact of the adopted submodel correlations to the SOFC performance predictions.",Microscale Correlations Adoption in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4031153
6,6788,"Normally, the microstructural inputs in the numerical model need to be measured by experiments in order to test the real cell performance.",Microscale Correlations Adoption in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4031153
