1,8150,A thermodynamic analysis of electrical power generation in ethanol fueled solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was made in the temperature range between 800-1200 K at atmospheric total pressure.,Ethanol Utilization In Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermodynamic Approach,10.1007/BF02375841
2,8150,A SOFC was considered being fed with the thermodynamic equilibrium products of ethanol a) steam reforming b) CO(2) reforming and c) partial oxidation.,Ethanol Utilization In Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermodynamic Approach,10.1007/BF02375841
3,8150,"In each case, ethanol, steam, carbon oxides, methane and hydrogen were considered coexisting in the equilibrium mixture produced by different ethanol to oxidant (H(2)O, CO(2) and O(2)) initial ratios.",Ethanol Utilization In Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: A Thermodynamic Approach,10.1007/BF02375841
