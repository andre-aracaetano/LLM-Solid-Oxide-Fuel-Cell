4,1160,"The CCO materials showed a two-phase composite with very high ionic conductivity, 0.01 to 0.5 S cm(-1) between 400 and 700degreesC. Using the CCO-composites as the electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFC) a high performance, e.g., 600 mW cm(-2) was demonstrated at 600degreesC.
