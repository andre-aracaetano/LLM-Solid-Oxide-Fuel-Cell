1,8161,"An anode-supported single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC), consisting of a Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.9 electrolyte, a Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.8 (SDC) cermet anode, and a Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 cathode, was operated in a mixture feed of dimethyl ether (DME), ethanol or butane, and air at a furnace temperature of 300 degrees C.",Single-chamber SOFCs using dimethyl ether and ethanol,10.1149/1.2747326
2,8161,"This SC-SOFC showed comparatively poor performance for DME and ethanol fuels when compared to the performance for butane fuel, resulting from the relatively small difference in catalytic activity for DME and ethanol oxidation between the anode and the cathode.",Single-chamber SOFCs using dimethyl ether and ethanol,10.1149/1.2747326
3,8161,"An effective improvement was achieved by attaching Ru/SDC/Ni and Cu/Zn/Al catalyst layers for DME and ethanol, respectively, on the anode surface.",Single-chamber SOFCs using dimethyl ether and ethanol,10.1149/1.2747326
4,8161,"As a result, peak power densities of 64 and 117 mW cm(-2) were obtained for DME and ethanol, respectively.",Single-chamber SOFCs using dimethyl ether and ethanol,10.1149/1.2747326
