4,19433,The results showed that 59wt% BaCO3 retained undecomposed in the glass prepared via heat treatment at 1300 degrees C for 1 h and its expansion coefficient decreased due to devitrification of monoclinic BaAl2Si2O8.,Residual Amount of BaCO3 on Glass Thermal Property Based on BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 System,10.15541/jim20170411
5,19433,Softening temperature (>800 degrees C) of the glass produced via heating at 1400 degrees C for 3 h increased obviously owing to the increment of Al2O3 amount.,Residual Amount of BaCO3 on Glass Thermal Property Based on BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 System,10.15541/jim20170411
6,19433,"The expansion coefficient of the glass produced via heat treatment at 1400 degrees C for 1 h was 10.3 x10(-6)K(-1) from room temperature to the glass transition temperature, indiating the process of heat treatment at 1400 degrees C for 1 h the optimal condition in three candidates for the specific formula, which was found to be eligible for SOFC sealing.",Residual Amount of BaCO3 on Glass Thermal Property Based on BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 System,10.15541/jim20170411
