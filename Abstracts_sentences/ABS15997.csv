3,15997,"SDC pellets were formed using uniaxial and isostatic pressing approaches and sintered at 1200 degrees C for 5 h. Crystal and thermal features, chemical functional groups were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), combined thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis methods.",Comparative study of samarium-doped ceria nanopowders synthesized by various chemical synthesis routes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.221
4,15997,It is shown that the crystallization of the samples synthesized by combustion method starts at the comparably low calcination temperature (171.42 degrees C) as compared to the samples obtained by sol-gel and co precipitation methods (391.94 degrees C and 368.05 degrees C respectively).,Comparative study of samarium-doped ceria nanopowders synthesized by various chemical synthesis routes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.221
5,15997,The structural and morphological properties of all the samples were analysed via Scanning (SEM) and Transmission (TEM) electron microscopies that have shown very dense structures with no intergranular pores.,Comparative study of samarium-doped ceria nanopowders synthesized by various chemical synthesis routes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.221
