1,3021,The paper presents a lumped zero dimensional (0D) model for the simulation of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack thermal dynamics.,Control-Oriented Modeling of Non-Adiabatic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201600150
2,3021,"Particularly, a dedicated sub-model is developed, via a mixed gray/black-box modeling approach, to suitably treat the heat exchange mechanisms between the stack and its surrounding environment.",Control-Oriented Modeling of Non-Adiabatic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201600150
3,3021,Such a sub-model was embedded into an existing 0D simulator and then tested via comparison with temperature sensor measurements.,Control-Oriented Modeling of Non-Adiabatic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201600150
4,3021,"The hardware sensor is indeed particularly critical, due to its location and the typically high operating temperature characterizing SOFC.",Control-Oriented Modeling of Non-Adiabatic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201600150
5,3021,"Therefore, suitable experimental transients were performed at Topsoe fuel cell test-bench, thus allowing verifying the accuracy and generalization granted by the 0D model in reproducing stack outlet temperature trajectories, both in steady-state and dynamic operations.",Control-Oriented Modeling of Non-Adiabatic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201600150
6,3021,"As a result, the modeling approach here proposed is proven effective either to replace the hardware temperature sensor at stack outlet or for redundancy purposes to improve reliability.",Control-Oriented Modeling of Non-Adiabatic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201600150
7,3021,"Moreover, the 0D model can be deployed for offline design of SOFC systems' control strategies, as well as for real-time diagnostic and control applications.",Control-Oriented Modeling of Non-Adiabatic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201600150
