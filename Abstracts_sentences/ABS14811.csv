1,14811,"In order to develop a cost-effective route to fabricate solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), a dense Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte was fabricated on a porous cathode based on a mixed conducting La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta (LSF) via a suspension spray/co-firing process.",A cathode-supported SOFC with thin Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolyte prepared by a suspension spray,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.10.063
2,14811,"For the purpose of shrinkage matching between the cathode support and the electrolyte membrane, nano-SDCI powder for the easily sinterable electrolyte was synthesized with ammonia as the precipitant from the nitrates, whereas SDC2 powder prepared by modified glycine-nitrate method (GNP) was added into cathode to favor the shrinkage of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta(LSF).",A cathode-supported SOFC with thin Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolyte prepared by a suspension spray,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.10.063
3,14811,"Sm-doped ceria solid solution was directly formed during precipitation at 50 degrees C, and this is ascribed to the role of OH-.",A cathode-supported SOFC with thin Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolyte prepared by a suspension spray,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.10.063
4,14811,The powders calcined at 800 degrees C for 2 h were still uniform and exhibited an average particle size of 20 nm.,A cathode-supported SOFC with thin Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolyte prepared by a suspension spray,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.10.063
5,14811,"The bi-layer with 10 mu m dense SDC electrolyte was obtained by co-sintering at 1250 degrees C for 5 h. A thin and well-adherent anode was formed by depositing ultra-fine NiO-SDC powders, followed by sintering at 1000 degrees C.",A cathode-supported SOFC with thin Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolyte prepared by a suspension spray,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.10.063
6,14811,The obtained single cells were tested with humidified (3% H2O) hydrogen as fuel and the static air as oxidant.,A cathode-supported SOFC with thin Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolyte prepared by a suspension spray,10.1016/j.jallcom.2007.10.063
