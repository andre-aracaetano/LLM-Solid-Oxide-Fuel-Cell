1,17481,"Cerium-gadolinium oxide is a promising material for electrolytes of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) due to its high electrical conductivity at relatively lower temperatures of 400-700 degrees C. However, a high sintering temperature of up to 1550 degrees C is typically required to produce dense CGO electrolyte, eventually leading to an interfacial interdiffusion between the electrolyte and electrode components as well as generate a highly resistive interface which reduces ionic conductivity.",Anode supported micro-tubular SOFC fabricated with mixed particle size electrolyte via phase-inversion technique,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.016
