1,2490,We propose a solid oxide fuel cell design based on a configuration of two electrodes on the same surface of the electrolyte in a flowing mixture of different hydrocarbons and air between 500 and 600degreesC. The ohmic resistance can be reduced without using a thin electrolyte film due to a significantly enhanced performance by the approach of the two electrodes to each other on the smooth electrolyte surface.,A solid oxide fuel cell with a novel geometry that eliminates the need for preparing a thin electrolyte film,10.1149/1.1431573
2,2490,"The fuel cell performance, especially at reduced temperatures, is further improved by using a more reactive hydrocarbon fuel and a more catalytically active anode.",A solid oxide fuel cell with a novel geometry that eliminates the need for preparing a thin electrolyte film,10.1149/1.1431573
