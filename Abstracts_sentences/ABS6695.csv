1,6695,"The goal of this work is to compare the long-term chemical stability of BaCe0,85Y0,15O3-delta and Ce0,85Y0,15O2-delta bulk composite samples to that of pure BaCe0,85Y0,15O3-delta after ageing for 600 hours in CO2/H2O atmosphere at room temperature and N-2/","LONG-TERM CHEMICAL STABILITY OF BaCe0,85Y0,15O3-δ + Ce0,85Y0,15O2-δ COMPOSITE SAMPLES AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND AT 873 K FOR USE IN DUAL PCFC-SOFC FUEL CELLS",10.2478/amm-2013-0006
2,6695,H2O atmosphere at 873 K. Differential Thermal Analysis and Thermogravimetry were used to investigate the physicochemical processes that took place during the ageing of the afore-mentioned samples and the chemical composition of the gases released from the samples was analyzed by a Mass Spectrometer.,"LONG-TERM CHEMICAL STABILITY OF BaCe0,85Y0,15O3-δ + Ce0,85Y0,15O2-δ COMPOSITE SAMPLES AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND AT 873 K FOR USE IN DUAL PCFC-SOFC FUEL CELLS",10.2478/amm-2013-0006
3,6695,"The influence of the reactive atmospheres on phase and chemical composition, as well as the microstructure of the bulk samples, was determined from X-ray Diffraction results and Scanning Electron Microscopy observations combined with Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy analysis.","LONG-TERM CHEMICAL STABILITY OF BaCe0,85Y0,15O3-δ + Ce0,85Y0,15O2-δ COMPOSITE SAMPLES AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND AT 873 K FOR USE IN DUAL PCFC-SOFC FUEL CELLS",10.2478/amm-2013-0006
4,6695,"From these studies it can be concluded that the composite materials are capable of maintaining stability in the studied conditions, however, pure BaCe0,85Y0,15O3-delta is unstable in CO2/H2O atmosphere at room temperature.","LONG-TERM CHEMICAL STABILITY OF BaCe0,85Y0,15O3-δ + Ce0,85Y0,15O2-δ COMPOSITE SAMPLES AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND AT 873 K FOR USE IN DUAL PCFC-SOFC FUEL CELLS",10.2478/amm-2013-0006
