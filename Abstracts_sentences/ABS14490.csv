1,14490,"The microstructure, fracture strength, and electric conductivity of 3-7 mol% Sc2O3-doped zirconia polycrystals fabricated by sintering at 1300 degreesC for 1 h in air, followed by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 196 MPa at 1300 and 1450 degreesC for 1.5 h in an Ar gas atmosphere, have been investigated.",Mechanical and electrical properties of Sc2O3-doped zirconia ceramics improved by postsintering with HIP,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00706-2
2,14490,Significant improvements in the fracture strength and also enhancement in the electric conductivity were obtained by the HIP treatment.,Mechanical and electrical properties of Sc2O3-doped zirconia ceramics improved by postsintering with HIP,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00706-2
3,14490,"We obtained HIPed zirconia polycrystals doped with 3.5 mol% Sc2O3 having an average fracture strength as high as 1770 MPa, high fracture toughness as 5.6 MPa m(1/2), and an electric conductivity of 0.08 S cm(-1) at 1000 degreesC. The present zirconia ceramics which had uniform submicron grains of tetragonal phases and were stabilized with 5 and 6 mol% Sc2O3 doping showed excellent mechanical strength (1330, 1140 MPa), good fracture toughness (4.8, 4.1 MPa m(1/2)), and good conductivity (0.15, 0.18 S cm(-1), respectively), both being higher than those reported before.",Mechanical and electrical properties of Sc2O3-doped zirconia ceramics improved by postsintering with HIP,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00706-2
