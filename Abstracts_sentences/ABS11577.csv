5,11577,Sr2MMoO6 undergoes a structural phase transition from tetragonal to cubic (Fm-3m) below 300 degrees C; Sr2MMoO6 experiences two consecutive phase transitions to tetragonal (I4/m) and finally cubic (Fm-3m) at 600 degrees C and above.,"Evaluation of Sr2MMoO6 (M = Mg, Mn) as anode materials in solid-oxide fuel cells: A neutron diffraction study",10.1063/1.4774764
6,11577,"In the cubic phases, the absence of octahedral tilting accounts for a good overlap between the oxygen and transition-metal orbitals, resulting in a good electronic conductivity; a high mobility of the oxygen atoms is derived from the elevated displacement parameters, for instance 3.0 angstrom(2) and 4.6 angstrom(2) at 930 degrees C for M = Mg, Mn, respectively.","Evaluation of Sr2MMoO6 (M = Mg, Mn) as anode materials in solid-oxide fuel cells: A neutron diffraction study",10.1063/1.4774764
