1,16134,We have investigated the effect of Cr poisoning on various cells which consist of either LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (LNF) or La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) as a cathode and either yttria- stabilized zirconia (YSZ) or alumina- doped scandia stabilized zirconia (SASZ) as the electrolyte.,Cr poisoning suppression in solid oxide fuel cells using LaNi(Fe)O3 electrodes,10.1149/1.2130309
2,16134,"It was found that the cathodic overvoltage was almost the same for cells with LNF cathodes, either in the presence or absence of Cr- containing alloy (Inconel 600).",Cr poisoning suppression in solid oxide fuel cells using LaNi(Fe)O3 electrodes,10.1149/1.2130309
3,16134,LSM cathodes in the presence of Inconel 600 exhibited a very steep increase in voltage curves after applying the current.,Cr poisoning suppression in solid oxide fuel cells using LaNi(Fe)O3 electrodes,10.1149/1.2130309
4,16134,These results indicate that the LNF cathode is electrochemically stable for Cr poisoning compared with the LSM cathode.,Cr poisoning suppression in solid oxide fuel cells using LaNi(Fe)O3 electrodes,10.1149/1.2130309
