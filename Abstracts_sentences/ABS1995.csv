1,1995,The impact of oxygen ion transport at the electrolyte-electrode interface of a micro-solid oxide fuel cell using different fuels is investigated.,Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A multi-fuel approach for portable applications,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.111
2,1995,Model validation is performed to verify the results versus the reported values.,Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A multi-fuel approach for portable applications,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.111
3,1995,"Furthermore, as the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio decreases, the diffusivity of the oxygen ion increases.",Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A multi-fuel approach for portable applications,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.111
4,1995,This increase in diffusivity is observed because the number of hydrogen atoms available as the reacting species increases in fuels with lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratios.,Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A multi-fuel approach for portable applications,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.111
5,1995,The oxygen ion conductivity and output power density decrease as the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the fuels decreases.,Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A multi-fuel approach for portable applications,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.111
6,1995,"The reason behind this impact is the formation of a gas-induced ion barrier at the electrode-electrolyte interface by the CO2 molecules formed during the reaction at the interface, thus blocking the flow of oxygen ions.",Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A multi-fuel approach for portable applications,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.111
7,1995,"As the oxygen ions become blocked, the output current contribution from the reaction also decreases and thereby affects the overall performance of the micro-solid oxide fuel cell.",Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A multi-fuel approach for portable applications,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.111
8,1995,The experimental verification confirms this because of a significant decrease in the output power density.,Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A multi-fuel approach for portable applications,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.111
9,1995,"Furthermore, as per the application in portable devices, the appropriate choice of fuel can be chosen so that the micro-solid oxide fuel cell operates at the maximum power density.",Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: A multi-fuel approach for portable applications,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.111
