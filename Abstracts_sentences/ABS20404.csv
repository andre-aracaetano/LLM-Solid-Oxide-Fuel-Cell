3,20404,"Therefore, donor compensation in the Sr1-xBaxTiO3 solid solution should demonstrate a crossover from the A-site vacancies at x=0 to the B-site vacancies at x=1.",Coexistence of A- and B-Site Vacancy Compensation in La-Doped Sr1-xBaxTiO3,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03810.x

6,20404,"Based on the Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns and their phase composition analysis as well as scanning electron microscopic and transmission electron microscopic data, we demonstrate that the 28% La-doped Sr1-xBaxTiO3 system equilibrated at 1400 degrees C indeed becomes invariant to the vacancy-type compensation at x(c)approximate to 0.25 and can accommodate A- and B-site vacancies at any given ratio.",Coexistence of A- and B-Site Vacancy Compensation in La-Doped Sr1-xBaxTiO3,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03810.x
7,20404,"Finally, we propose a microscopic model based on the off-center Ti displacement and the partial covalency of Ti-O bond to explain the distinct difference in the vacancy compensation mechanisms in BaTiO3 and SrTiO3.",Coexistence of A- and B-Site Vacancy Compensation in La-Doped Sr1-xBaxTiO3,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03810.x
