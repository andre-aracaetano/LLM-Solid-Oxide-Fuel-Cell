2,16064,"This work is aimed at studying the effect of hydrogen sulfide content in a high-temperature (600 degrees C) hydrogenous atmosphere on the evolution of nanopores and microstructural degradation, as well as strength, microhardness, and crack growth resistance of a fine-grained YSZ-NiO(Ni) anode materials for SOFCs.",Study of the evolution of nanopores and microstructural degradation of fine-grained YSZ-NiO(Ni) anode materials in a hydrogen sulfide containing atmosphere,10.1007/s13204-022-02609-0
3,16064,"To obtain the corresponding YSZ-NiO(Ni) cermet structure, specimens of the YSZ-NiO anode ceramics were reduced in Ar-5 vol% H-2 mixture for 4 h at 600 degrees C under a pressure of 0.15 MPa.",Study of the evolution of nanopores and microstructural degradation of fine-grained YSZ-NiO(Ni) anode materials in a hydrogen sulfide containing atmosphere,10.1007/s13204-022-02609-0

7,16064,It was revealed that the atmosphere containing up to 7 vol% H2S had a slight effect on the strength and electrical conductivity of the YSZ-NiO(Ni) cermet.,Study of the evolution of nanopores and microstructural degradation of fine-grained YSZ-NiO(Ni) anode materials in a hydrogen sulfide containing atmosphere,10.1007/s13204-022-02609-0
8,16064,"In contrast to this, an increased content of hydrogen sulfide (18 vol% H2S) caused some changes in the YSZ-Ni cermet microstructure.",Study of the evolution of nanopores and microstructural degradation of fine-grained YSZ-NiO(Ni) anode materials in a hydrogen sulfide containing atmosphere,10.1007/s13204-022-02609-0
9,16064,"As compared to the preconditioned cermet, strength of the aged cermet decreased by almost 30%.",Study of the evolution of nanopores and microstructural degradation of fine-grained YSZ-NiO(Ni) anode materials in a hydrogen sulfide containing atmosphere,10.1007/s13204-022-02609-0
10,16064,"In contrast to this, microhardness and fracture toughness of the aged cermet were only lowered by about 10%.",Study of the evolution of nanopores and microstructural degradation of fine-grained YSZ-NiO(Ni) anode materials in a hydrogen sulfide containing atmosphere,10.1007/s13204-022-02609-0
11,16064,"To explain this difference, several fracture micromechanisms were suggested: (1) the localization of stresses in the crack tip vicinity (so-called process zone) during indentation that promotes further crack growth until touching a material-pore interface where stress relaxation occurs causing crack retardation (the case of Vickers indentation test); (2) a decrease in the integral cross-section area due to pores in the material bulk when expanding ultimate stress zone that results in a sharp decrease in strength of the YSZ-NiO(Ni) cermet aged in a hydrogen sulfide containing atmosphere (the case of strength test).",Study of the evolution of nanopores and microstructural degradation of fine-grained YSZ-NiO(Ni) anode materials in a hydrogen sulfide containing atmosphere,10.1007/s13204-022-02609-0
12,16064,"It was found that in the case of increased content of H2S (18 vol%) in a hydrogenous atmosphere, microstructure degradation due to the nanopores formation and weakening of the zirconia-nickel bonds occurs promoting low-energy intergranular fracture along boundaries of both the nickel and zirconia phase grains.",Study of the evolution of nanopores and microstructural degradation of fine-grained YSZ-NiO(Ni) anode materials in a hydrogen sulfide containing atmosphere,10.1007/s13204-022-02609-0
