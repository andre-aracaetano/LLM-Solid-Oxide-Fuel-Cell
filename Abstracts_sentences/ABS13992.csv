1,13992,Probing temperature inside a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack lies at the heart of the development of high-performance and stable SOFC systems.,"Probing Temperature Inside Planar SOFC Short Stack, Modules, and Stack Series",10.1007/s11837-016-2155-z
2,13992,"In this article, we report our recent work on the direct measurements of the temperature in three types of SOFC systems: a 5-cell short stack, a 30-cell stack module, and a stack series consisting of two 30-cell stack modules.","Probing Temperature Inside Planar SOFC Short Stack, Modules, and Stack Series",10.1007/s11837-016-2155-z
3,13992,The dependence of temperature on the gas flow rate and current density was studied under a current sweep or steady-state operation.,"Probing Temperature Inside Planar SOFC Short Stack, Modules, and Stack Series",10.1007/s11837-016-2155-z
4,13992,"During the current sweep, the temperature inside the 5-cell stack decreased with increasing current, while it increased significantly at the bottom and top of the 30-cell stack.","Probing Temperature Inside Planar SOFC Short Stack, Modules, and Stack Series",10.1007/s11837-016-2155-z
5,13992,"During a steady-state operation, the temperature of the 5-cell stack was stable while it was increased in the 30-cell stack.","Probing Temperature Inside Planar SOFC Short Stack, Modules, and Stack Series",10.1007/s11837-016-2155-z
6,13992,"In the stack series, the maximum temperature gradient reached 190A degrees C when the gas was not preheated.","Probing Temperature Inside Planar SOFC Short Stack, Modules, and Stack Series",10.1007/s11837-016-2155-z
7,13992,"If the gas was preheated and the temperature gradient was reduced to 23A degrees C in the stack series with the presence of a preheating gas and segmented temperature control, this resulted in a low degradation rate.","Probing Temperature Inside Planar SOFC Short Stack, Modules, and Stack Series",10.1007/s11837-016-2155-z
