1,14424,"In this study, we demonstrate that the La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3- (LSFCr) perovskite, examined here as a CO/CO2 fuel electrode material intended for symmetrical, reversible solid oxide fuel cell (RSOFC) applications, is both high performing and stable towards CO2 electrolysis (SOEC mode) and the oxidation of CO (SOFC mode).",CO/CO2 Study of High Performance La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3- Reversible SOFC Electrodes,10.1002/fuce.201400196
2,14424,"To demonstrate this, symmetrical LSFCr/GDC/YSZ/GDC/LSFCr cells were evaluated electrochemically by using both DC (cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic) and AC (impedance) techniques.",CO/CO2 Study of High Performance La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3- Reversible SOFC Electrodes,10.1002/fuce.201400196
3,14424,The cells were tested at 800 degrees C using either 90% CO2:10% CO or 70% CO2:30% CO at the fuel electrode and air flowing to the O-2 electrode.,CO/CO2 Study of High Performance La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3- Reversible SOFC Electrodes,10.1002/fuce.201400196
4,14424,"From the open circuit impedance data, the polarization resistance, measured at 800 degrees C in a 90% CO2:10% CO and 70% CO2:30% CO gas composition, was 1.3cm(2) and 0.9cm(2), respectively.",CO/CO2 Study of High Performance La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3- Reversible SOFC Electrodes,10.1002/fuce.201400196
5,14424,Both the CV and polarized impedance data showed that the cell performance is higher during the electrolysis of CO2 than for the oxidation of CO.,CO/CO2 Study of High Performance La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3- Reversible SOFC Electrodes,10.1002/fuce.201400196
