4,12393,"In 3D analysis, wettability analyzing method was adopted for solid particle on solid substrate, and apparent contact angle was evaluated by the following equation; theta = 2 tan(-1) (2 h/d) where d and h are the observed particle diameter and the observed particle height of each agglomerated particle obtained by SPM analysis.",Agglomeration behavior of nickel particles on YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.04.010
5,12393,"Results from both analysis techniques revealed that NiO doped YSZ tend to enhance the nickel agglomeration, whereas TiO2 doped YSZ shows better wettability especially for larger nickel particles.",Agglomeration behavior of nickel particles on YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.04.010
