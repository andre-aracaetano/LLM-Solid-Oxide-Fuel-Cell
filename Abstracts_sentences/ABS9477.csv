1,9477,A critical hurdle in realizing commercially viable anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is the re-oxidation of cermet anode during the cell abnormal operation.,A model for oxidation-induced stress analysis of Ni-based anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.166
2,9477,"In this paper, the analysis of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy on a partially oxidized half-cell demonstrates a particular inhomogeneous oxidation mechanism that a portion of anode near the air/anode interface is oxidized with a graded NiO content, while the remaining region hold a reduced status.",A model for oxidation-induced stress analysis of Ni-based anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.166

4,9477,The dependences of the mechanical performance of half-cell on the NiO distribution and thickness of oxidation-graded zone are revealed.,A model for oxidation-induced stress analysis of Ni-based anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.166
5,9477,"The results show that an increase in oxidation-graded zone elevates the stress level of electrolyte, but decreases the curvature under the same global degree of oxidation (DoO).",A model for oxidation-induced stress analysis of Ni-based anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.166
6,9477,"In addition, the influence of thickness of oxidation-graded zone on the electrolyte failure probability is also investigated.",A model for oxidation-induced stress analysis of Ni-based anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.166
7,9477,"According to these results, we conclude that the thickness of oxidation-graded zone should be as thin as possible in order to delay the electrolyte cracking.",A model for oxidation-induced stress analysis of Ni-based anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.166
