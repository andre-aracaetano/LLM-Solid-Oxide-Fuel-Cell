1,20123,Electric conductions in La0.9Sr0.1Ga1-xMgxO3-delta (LSGM; x=0 and 0.1) have been elucidated by ac and do methods as a function of temperature.,Electric conductions in La0.9Sr0.1GaO3-δ and La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.9Mg0.1O3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.010
2,20123,"Using complex-plane impedance analyses and dielectric relaxation processes along with do results, activation energy for electric conduction, migration energy of O2- ions (E-M), and energy required to create a free mobile oxygen vacancy which assists O2- migration (E-O) within intragrains and in boundaries have been obtained separately.",Electric conductions in La0.9Sr0.1GaO3-δ and La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.9Mg0.1O3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.010
3,20123,Dielectric dispersion due to a distribution of relaxation times in boundaries is observed.,Electric conductions in La0.9Sr0.1GaO3-δ and La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.9Mg0.1O3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.010
4,20123,The activation energy for each electric conduction is nearly equal to sum of E-M and E-O. Lattice distortion due to a large difference in ionic radii of Mg2+ and Ga3+ brings about high migration energy within intragrains in x=0.1 specimen compared with that of x=0.,Electric conductions in La0.9Sr0.1GaO3-δ and La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.9Mg0.1O3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.010
5,20123,Such high migration energy has an adverse effect on improvement of ionic conductivities but excess oxygen vacancies compensate this adverse effect.,Electric conductions in La0.9Sr0.1GaO3-δ and La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.9Mg0.1O3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.010
