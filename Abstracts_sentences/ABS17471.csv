1,17471,Porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathodes are coated with a thin film of Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.95-delta (SDC) using a one-step infiltration process.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes infiltrated with samarium-doped cerium oxide for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.049
2,17471,Examination of the microstructures reveals that small SDC particles are formed on the surface of LSCF grains with a relatively narrow size distribution.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes infiltrated with samarium-doped cerium oxide for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.049
3,17471,"Impedance analysis indicates that the SDC infiltration has dramatically reduced the polarization of LSCF cathode, reaching interfacial resistances of 0.074 and 0.44 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C and 650 degrees C, respectively, which are about half of those for LSCF cathode without infiltration of SDC.",La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes infiltrated with samarium-doped cerium oxide for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.049
4,17471,"The activation energies of the SDC infiltrated LSCF cathodes are in the range of 1.42-1.55 eV, slightly lower than those for a blank LSCF cathode.",La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes infiltrated with samarium-doped cerium oxide for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.049
5,17471,"The SDC infiltrated LSCF cathodes have also shown improved stability under typical SOFC operating conditions, suggesting that SDC infiltration improves not only power output but also performance stability and operational life.",La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes infiltrated with samarium-doped cerium oxide for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.049
