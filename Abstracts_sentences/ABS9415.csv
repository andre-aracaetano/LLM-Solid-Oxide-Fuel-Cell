1,9415,The long-term stability of the oxygen exchange kinetics of the Sr- and Co-free solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and solid oxide electrolyser cell (SOEC) air electrode material Pr0.8Ca0.2FeO3-delta (PCF82) is investigated by in-situ dc-conductivity relaxation measurements.,Long-term stability of oxygen surface exchange kinetics of Pr0.8Ca0.2FeO3-δ against SO2-poisoning,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.09.017
2,9415,The chemical oxygen surface exchange coefficient k(chem) is determined as a function of time at 700 degrees C under ideal (O-2-Ar atmosphere) and accelerated ageing conditions (O-2-Ar with 2 ppm SO2).,Long-term stability of oxygen surface exchange kinetics of Pr0.8Ca0.2FeO3-δ against SO2-poisoning,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.09.017
3,9415,In pure O-2-Ar PCF82 shows fast oxygen surface exchange kinetics with k(chem) = 6 x 10(-4) cm,Long-term stability of oxygen surface exchange kinetics of Pr0.8Ca0.2FeO3-δ against SO2-poisoning,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.09.017
4,9415,s(-1) and excellent stability for 1000 h. Due to the addition of 2 ppm SO2 to the test gas only a moderate degradation occurs with k(chem) decreasing to 8 x 10(-5) cm s(-1) during further 1000 h. Post-test analyses by scanning (transmission) electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show S-rich secondary phases in the near surface region of the SO2-poisoned sample.,Long-term stability of oxygen surface exchange kinetics of Pr0.8Ca0.2FeO3-δ against SO2-poisoning,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.09.017
