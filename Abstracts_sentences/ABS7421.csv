1,7421,The electronic conductivity of pure ceria was successfully measured by a dc polarization technique based on the Hebb-Wagner ion blocking method at T=873-1273 K. The electronic conductivity increased with increasing temperature at given P(O-2) values.,Electronic Conductivity of CeO2: Its Dependence on Oxygen Partial Pressure and Temperature,10.1149/1.3276731
2,7421,It also increased with decreasing P(O-2) following slope values of -1/6 to -1/4.,Electronic Conductivity of CeO2: Its Dependence on Oxygen Partial Pressure and Temperature,10.1149/1.3276731
3,7421,"At 873-1073 K, no P(O-2) dependent region was observed at higher P(O-2) more than 10(-2), 10(-4), and 10(-5) MPa at 1073, 973, and 873 K, respectively.",Electronic Conductivity of CeO2: Its Dependence on Oxygen Partial Pressure and Temperature,10.1149/1.3276731
4,7421,"Activation energies calculated from the Arrhenius plots for those different regions were 2.2, 2.9, and 1.9 eV for P(O-2) dependences of -1/6, -1/4, and 0 regions, respectively.",Electronic Conductivity of CeO2: Its Dependence on Oxygen Partial Pressure and Temperature,10.1149/1.3276731
