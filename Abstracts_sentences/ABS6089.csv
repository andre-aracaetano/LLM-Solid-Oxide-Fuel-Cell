1,6089,A composite cathode material for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IT-SOFC) was prepared by adding Ce(0.8)Sm(0.2)O(1.9) into La(0.7)Sr(0.3)Co(0.95)Cu(0.05)O(3-delta) at different ratios.,Preparation and Performance of Composite Cathode Materials for IT-SOFC,
2,6089,"The crystal structure was characterized; the high temperature conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient and overpotentials of cathode electrodes were tested.",Preparation and Performance of Composite Cathode Materials for IT-SOFC,
3,6089,The results show that adding Ce(0.55)Sm(0.2)O(1.9) effectively decreases the thermal expansion coefficient of La(0.7)Sr(0.3)Co(0.95)Cu(0.05)O(3-delta).,Preparation and Performance of Composite Cathode Materials for IT-SOFC,
4,6089,"When the content of the adding of Ce(0.8)Sm(0.2)O(1.9) is 10% (mass faction, similarly hereinafter), the conductivity of the composite material is higher than that of La(0.7)Sr(0.3)Co(0.95)Cu(0.05)O(3-delta) and the current density of the cathode under the same overpotential is greater than that of others.",Preparation and Performance of Composite Cathode Materials for IT-SOFC,
5,6089,A single fuel cell containing this cathode material has the maximum short-circuit current density of 511 mA/cm(-2) and the maximum output power density of 106 mW/cm(-2) at 850 degrees C.,Preparation and Performance of Composite Cathode Materials for IT-SOFC,
