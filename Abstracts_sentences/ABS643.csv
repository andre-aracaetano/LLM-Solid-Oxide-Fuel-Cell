4,643,The fuel cells with a porous catalyst layer yield much higher maximum power density than those without a catalyst layer.,Investigations of mesoporous CeO2-Ru as a reforming catalyst layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2006.03.018
5,643,"In particular., the performance of the fuel cell with a flowerlike mesoporous CeO2-Ru microsphere catalyst layer is obviously improved, producing maximum power density up to 0.654 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis showed the kinetic characteristic of anode reactions in the fuel cell with porous CeO2-Ru microsphere catalyst layers was significantly enhanced.",Investigations of mesoporous CeO2-Ru as a reforming catalyst layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2006.03.018
