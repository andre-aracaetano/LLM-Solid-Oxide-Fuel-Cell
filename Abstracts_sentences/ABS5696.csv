2,5696,The BSNFM-NFA/NFO ceramic anode exhibits an excellent catalytic activity toward H-2 and hydrocarbon fuels.,In Situ Exsolved NiFe/(NiFe)OX Core-Shell-Structured Nanocatalysts on Perovskite Anode with Enhanced Coking Resistance,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01024
3,5696,"The La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-6 (LSGM) electrolyte-supported SOFC single cell with a BSNFM-NFA/NFO anode delivers a Pmax of 1099 mW cm(-2) in wet H-2 at 800 degrees C and 1049 mW cm(-2) in wet C3H8 at 850 degrees C, respectively.",In Situ Exsolved NiFe/(NiFe)OX Core-Shell-Structured Nanocatalysts on Perovskite Anode with Enhanced Coking Resistance,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01024
4,5696,"Moreover, the single cell with a BSNFM-NFA/NFO anode showed a stable output under a constant current density of 1.0 A cm(-2) at 750 degrees C in C3H8 fuel, suggesting that BSNFM-NFA/NFO is a promising anode with outstanding coking resistance.",In Situ Exsolved NiFe/(NiFe)OX Core-Shell-Structured Nanocatalysts on Perovskite Anode with Enhanced Coking Resistance,10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01024
