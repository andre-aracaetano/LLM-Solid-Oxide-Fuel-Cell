1,10985,"The microstructure and geometry of yttrium-doped ceria particles, synthesized by spray pyrolysis (SP), were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, and the distribution of yttrium was investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).",Nanoscale yttrium distribution in yttrium-doped ceria powder,10.1007/s11051-009-9585-2
2,10985,The yttrium distribution was investigated by considering an electron interaction volume and geometry of the particle in an EDX profile analysis.,Nanoscale yttrium distribution in yttrium-doped ceria powder,10.1007/s11051-009-9585-2
3,10985,"Two models, linear and non-linear, for the yttrium concentration gradient were tested against the experimental EDX data for hollow particles.",Nanoscale yttrium distribution in yttrium-doped ceria powder,10.1007/s11051-009-9585-2
4,10985,The results showed that the linear concentration distribution of yttrium fits the EDX profiles appreciably better than the non-linear concentration gradient model.,Nanoscale yttrium distribution in yttrium-doped ceria powder,10.1007/s11051-009-9585-2
5,10985,"This suggests that yttrium distribution is mainly controlled by the different diffusion rates of the precursors from the centre to the surface of the particle, which could be related to their different solubilities, during the heating process in SP.",Nanoscale yttrium distribution in yttrium-doped ceria powder,10.1007/s11051-009-9585-2
