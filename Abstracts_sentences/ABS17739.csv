1,17739,"Better interfacial bonding with fewer dislocations is observed between in-situ TiC and hastelloy than that between ex-situ TiC and hastelloy, which slows down the diffusion rate of Ti and O during oxidation process.",Interfacial effect on oxidation resistance of TiC/hastelloy composites applied for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.corsci.2018.08.042
2,17739,"Mass gain (800 degrees C/100 h) of in-situ TiC/hastelloy composites is 2.60 mg cm(-2) with oxidation rate 6.84 x 10(-8) g(2) cm(-4) h(-1), much lower than 4.17 mg cm(-2) with oxidation rate of 1.75 x 10(-7) g(2) cm(-4) h(-1) of ex-situ TiC/hastelloy composites.",Interfacial effect on oxidation resistance of TiC/hastelloy composites applied for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.corsci.2018.08.042
3,17739,"Besides, smaller TiO2 area is formed on in-situ TiC/hastelloy composites with smaller interparticle spacing of TiC, against the prediction that the decrease of interparticle spacing of TiC accelerates the formation of continuous TiO2 area.",Interfacial effect on oxidation resistance of TiC/hastelloy composites applied for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.corsci.2018.08.042
