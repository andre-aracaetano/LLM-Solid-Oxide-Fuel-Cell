1,8489,A novel design for the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has been proposed.,New concept for simplifying SOFC system,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00437-7
2,8489,"By attaching palladium and gold electrodes on the same face of BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3-alpha electrolyte and feeding a mixture of CH4 and O-2 (CH4:O-2 mole ratio = 2:1) to the cell at 950 degrees C, electric power could be generated from the cell.",New concept for simplifying SOFC system,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00437-7
3,8489,The main advantages are that the ohmic resistance of the cell decreased with reducing distance between the two electrodes and that some unit cells were connected in series and parallel with one another on the same electrolyte.,New concept for simplifying SOFC system,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00437-7
4,8489,"In addition, the surface ionic conduction of oxide ion was studied from the standpoint of the surface morphology of the electrolyte.",New concept for simplifying SOFC system,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00437-7
