2,5777,Crystal structure and chemical state of BSCF have been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.10.046
3,5777,XRD pattern indicates that a single cubic perovskite phase of BSCF oxide is successfully obtained after calcination at 850 degrees C for 2 h. XPS results show there exists a little amount of SrCO3 in the surface of BSCF.,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.10.046
