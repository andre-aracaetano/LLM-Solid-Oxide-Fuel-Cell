3,14218,Muscovite mica was pressed between a metal pipe and an alumina substrate and tested for leak rates at a stress of 100 psi in the plain (mica only) and the hybrid design.,Thermal cycling and degradation mechanisms of compressive mica-based seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00444-5
4,14218,The hybrid design involves adding two glass interlayers and was found to greatly reduce the leak rates in an earlier paper Two metals (Inconel #600 and SS430) with high and low coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) were used to evaluate the effect of CTE mismatch on thermal cycling.,Thermal cycling and degradation mechanisms of compressive mica-based seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00444-5
5,14218,The results showed that the leak rates were lower for the hybrid design than the plain micas.,Thermal cycling and degradation mechanisms of compressive mica-based seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00444-5

9,14218,CTE measurement of the heat-treated Muscovite mica showed a relatively low value of similar to7 ppm/degreesC. The cause for the degradation of the mica is discussed.,Thermal cycling and degradation mechanisms of compressive mica-based seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00444-5
