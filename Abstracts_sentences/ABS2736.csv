6,2736,"The energy gap (Eg) was observed to increase from 2.94 eV to 3.32 eV and dc conductivity decreased from 9.084 Scm(-1) to 0.46 Scm(-1) by increasing sintering temperature from 700 degrees C to 1200 degrees C. Additionally, the best fuel cell performance of 0.90 Wcm(-2) was achieved for LiNiCuZn-Oxide sintered at 700 degrees C using H-2/air as a fuel and oxidant and it decreased to 0.17 Wcm(-2) for powders sintered at 1200 degrees C. Based on these results, we can conclude that 700 degrees C is the best optimum temperature for these chemical compositions, where all parameters of electrode are as per SOFCs requirement.",Effect of sintering temperature on properties of LiNiCuZn-Oxide: a potential anode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1088/2053-1591/ab36c8
