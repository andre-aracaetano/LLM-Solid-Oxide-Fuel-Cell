1,12801,"Low-temperature solid oxide cells (LT-SOCs), operating at 400 to 650 degrees C, have great potential for commercialization since they can provide lower cost and improved long-term durability.",Tape Casting of High-Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Cells with Thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ Electrolytes and Impregnated Nano Anodes,10.1021/acsami.6b15224
2,12801,Low operating temperature can also enable high round-trip efficiency of SOCs as reversible energy storage devices.,Tape Casting of High-Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Cells with Thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ Electrolytes and Impregnated Nano Anodes,10.1021/acsami.6b15224
3,12801,"This paper describes SrosLa(0.2)TiO(3-alpha) (SLT) anode supported LT-SOC with thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte made by tape casting, with screen printed La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta (LSCF) cathode and impregnated Ni anode.",Tape Casting of High-Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Cells with Thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ Electrolytes and Impregnated Nano Anodes,10.1021/acsami.6b15224
4,12801,Optimization of the anode functional layers is described; the best anodes had 68 vol % LSGM and 12.3 vol % Ni and yielded maximum power density of 1.6 Wcm(-2) with a cell area specific resistance (ASR) of 0.21 Omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C. Most of the cell ASR was associated with the cathode.,Tape Casting of High-Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Cells with Thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ Electrolytes and Impregnated Nano Anodes,10.1021/acsami.6b15224
5,12801,Reversible electrolysis and fuel cell operation yielded similar characteristics with both 50% H-2-50% H2O and syngas fuel.,Tape Casting of High-Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Cells with Thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ Electrolytes and Impregnated Nano Anodes,10.1021/acsami.6b15224
6,12801,"Life testing over 500 h showed that the cathode impedance stabilized after an initial break-in period; the ohmic and anode resistances, though relatively small, increased slightly with time.",Tape Casting of High-Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Cells with Thin La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ Electrolytes and Impregnated Nano Anodes,10.1021/acsami.6b15224
