6,15655,The Co-Cu coating effectively blocked the outward migration of Cr from the substrate.,Evaluation of electroplated Co-Cu metallic coatings for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.10.103
7,15655,"No Cr element could be found in the coupled La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) plate of the coated sample after oxidized at 800 degrees C in air for 500 h. The highly conductive coating with a structure of CuO/Co-based spinels significantly decreased the growth of the Cr-rich oxide scale, and thus a much lower scale area specific resistance (ASR).",Evaluation of electroplated Co-Cu metallic coatings for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.10.103
