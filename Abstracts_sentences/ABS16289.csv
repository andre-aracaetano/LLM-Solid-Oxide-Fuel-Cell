1,16289,"The paper discusses new honeycomb catalysts for natural gas oxidation to syngas, a recently developed processes of moderate-temperature (450-650 degrees C) catalytic pyrolysis of natural gas and/or light hydrocarbons into hydrogen and valuable carbonaceous materials, as well as partial oxidation of natural gas into syngas in high temperature solid oxide fuel-cell-like systems.",New catalysts and catalytic processes to produce hydrogen and syngas from natural gas and other light hydrocarbons,
2,16289,"The advantages of the new processes against conventional ones lie, e.g., in ability to produce hydrogen completely free of carbon monoxide, as well as to cogenerate hydrogen or syngas with other valuable materials, chemicals or even electricity.",New catalysts and catalytic processes to produce hydrogen and syngas from natural gas and other light hydrocarbons,
