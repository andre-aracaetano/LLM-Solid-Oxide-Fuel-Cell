1,4096,A distance propagation method is presented for calculating tortuosity with relatively low computation time from three-dimensional (3D) tomographic data.,Tortuosity characterization of 3D microstructure at nano-scale for energy storage and conversion materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.026
2,4096,"Moreover, a novel concept of tortuosity distribution is developed to provide a more comprehensive picture of inhomogeneous microstructures where tortuosity depends on the actual 3D paths.",Tortuosity characterization of 3D microstructure at nano-scale for energy storage and conversion materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.026
3,4096,"Instead of using one single tortuosity value, the tortuosity distribution both as spatial distribution map and also statistic histogram can provide a more complete description.",Tortuosity characterization of 3D microstructure at nano-scale for energy storage and conversion materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.026
4,4096,"The method, which can be applied to any porous medium, is tested against a diffusion-based tortuosity calculation on two 3D microstructures: a LiCoO2 cathode electrode of lithium ion battery measured by x-ray nano-tomography and a lanthanum strontium rnanganite-ttria-stabilized zirconia, solid oxide fuel cells cathode measured using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy serial sectioning.",Tortuosity characterization of 3D microstructure at nano-scale for energy storage and conversion materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.026
5,4096,The present method is shown to provide good-agreement with the effective diffusion-based tortuosity values.,Tortuosity characterization of 3D microstructure at nano-scale for energy storage and conversion materials,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.026
