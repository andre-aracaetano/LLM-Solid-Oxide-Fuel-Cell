3,8392,"Symmetrical cathodes of GSC-50Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.95) (GDC) (50:50 by volume) powders were deposited on GDC electrolyte pellets, and the electrochemical properties of the interfaces between the porous cathode and the electrolyte were investigated at intermediate temperature (500-750 degrees C) using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",A high-performance Gd0.8Sr0.2CoO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.018
4,8392,The addition of 50 vol.% GDC to GSC resulted in an additional factor approximate to 3 decrease in the area-specific resistance (ASR).,A high-performance Gd0.8Sr0.2CoO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.018
5,8392,"The ASR values for the GSC-50GDC cathodes were as low as 0.064 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C and 0.16 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, respectively.",A high-performance Gd0.8Sr0.2CoO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.018
