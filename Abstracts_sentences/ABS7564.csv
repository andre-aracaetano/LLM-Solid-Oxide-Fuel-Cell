1,7564,"Given the complicated mechanisms associated with the operation of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), mathematical models developed to capture the SOFC's dynamic characteristics often result in high order and complex dynamics that make the model unsuitable for control design and analysis.",A control oriented low order dynamic model for planar SOFC using minimum Gibbs free energy method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.009
2,7564,"In this paper, the minimum Gibbs free energy (MGFE) method is exploited to simplify the calculation of the mass balance dynamics of the fuel flow in the SOFC in an effort to develop a control oriented model that achieves appropriate trade-off between model accuracy and simplicity.",A control oriented low order dynamic model for planar SOFC using minimum Gibbs free energy method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.009

5,7564,"The MGFE method leads to the elimination of 5 out of 11 states in the baseline model, thereby resulting in a significantly lower order model.",A control oriented low order dynamic model for planar SOFC using minimum Gibbs free energy method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.009
6,7564,Critical parameters that may influence the accuracy of the simplified model are also identified.,A control oriented low order dynamic model for planar SOFC using minimum Gibbs free energy method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.009

8,7564,"Noticeable model errors are only observed in steady-state responses at extreme conditions, where the fuel inlet has a high fraction of CH4 and the fuel cell has low fuel utilization, and in transient when the inputs change at high frequency.",A control oriented low order dynamic model for planar SOFC using minimum Gibbs free energy method,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.009
