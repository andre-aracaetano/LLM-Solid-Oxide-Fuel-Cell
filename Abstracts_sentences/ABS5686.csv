1,5686,"Fast and precise identification of several unknown parameters for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) models play a critical role in modeling analysis, optimal control, and behavior prediction.",Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm for parameter identification of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.6929
2,5686,"However, inherent high-nonlinear, multi-variable, and strongly coupled features usually lead to thorny obstacles that hinder conventional methods to identify them with a high speed, high accuracy, and reliable stability.",Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm for parameter identification of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.6929
3,5686,"Hence, a Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation (LMBP) algorithm-based parameter identification technique is proposed in this study, which is applied to efficiently train designed artificial neural networks (ANNs) to implement the identification task.",Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm for parameter identification of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.6929
4,5686,"Furthermore, two typical models, for example, electrochemical model (ECM) and steady-state model (SSM), are taken into account to validate the identification performance of the LMBP algorithm under different operation conditions.",Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm for parameter identification of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.6929
5,5686,"Simulation results based on MATLAB demonstrate that the LMBP algorithm can extremely improve the accuracy, speed, and stability for estimating these unknown parameters via a comprehensive comparison with four mainstream meta-heuristic algorithms, that is, artificial ecosystem-based optimization (AEO), equilibrium optimizer (EO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and moth-flame optimization (MFO).",Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm for parameter identification of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.6929
