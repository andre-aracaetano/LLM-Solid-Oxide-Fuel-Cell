1,9929,Ni-Sn porous metals with different concentrations of Sn were prepared as potential current collectors for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Long-term stability of Ni-Sn porous metals for cathode current collector in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.04.007
2,9929,The weight increase of these species was evaluated after heat-treatment under elevated temperatures in air for thousands of hours to evaluate the long-term oxidation resistance.,Long-term stability of Ni-Sn porous metals for cathode current collector in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.04.007
3,9929,"Ni-Sn porous metals with 5-14 wt% of Sn exhibited excellent oxidation resistance at 600 degrees C, although oxidation became significant above 700 degrees C. Intermetallic Ni3Sn was formed at 600 degrees C due to phase transformation of the initially solid solutions of Sn in Ni in the porous metals.",Long-term stability of Ni-Sn porous metals for cathode current collector in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.04.007
4,9929,"For the porous metal with 10 wt% of Sn, the oxidation rate constant at 600 degrees C in air was estimated to be 8.5 x 10(-14) g(2) cm(-4)",Long-term stability of Ni-Sn porous metals for cathode current collector in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.04.007
5,9929,s(-1) and the electrical resistivity at 600 degrees C was almost constant at approximately 0.02 Omega cm(2) up to an elapsed time of 1000 h.,Long-term stability of Ni-Sn porous metals for cathode current collector in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.04.007
6,9929,"In addition, the gas diffusibility and the power-collecting ability of the porous metal were equivalent to those of a platinum mesh when applied in the cathode current collector of a SOFC operated at 600 degrees C. Ni-Sn porous metals with adequate contents of Sn are believed to be promising cathode current collector materials for SOFCs for operation at temperatures below 600 degrees C.
