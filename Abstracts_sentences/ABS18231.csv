1,18231,"Normal operations of electrochemical devices such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOEC) and lithium ion batteries (LIB) sometimes fail because of unexpected formation of internal phases.",Potential jumps at transport bottlenecks cause instability of nominally ionic solid electrolytes in electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.08.017
2,18231,"These phases include oxygen bubbles at grain boundaries inside the zirconia electrolyte of SOEC, isolated Li metal islands inside the (garnet type) Li7La3Zr2O12 electrolyte of all-solid-state LIB, and similar Na metal islands inside the Na-beta-alumina and NASICON electrolytes of Na-S batteries.",Potential jumps at transport bottlenecks cause instability of nominally ionic solid electrolytes in electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.08.017
3,18231,"Remarkably, although the devices can operate in both polarities, the propensity for failure depends on the polarity.",Potential jumps at transport bottlenecks cause instability of nominally ionic solid electrolytes in electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.08.017
4,18231,Here we explain these and other phenomena in nominally ionic solid electrolytes and mixed-conducting electrodes in simple thermodynamic and kinetic terms: the unexpected internal phases are caused by a large potential jump that is needed to push a constant ion or electron flow through its internal transport bottleneck.,Potential jumps at transport bottlenecks cause instability of nominally ionic solid electrolytes in electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.08.017
5,18231,"Definite rules for internal phase formation including its polarity dependence are formulated to help predict and mitigate it, which leads to microstructural instability, efficiency deterioration and breakdown.",Potential jumps at transport bottlenecks cause instability of nominally ionic solid electrolytes in electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2020.08.017
