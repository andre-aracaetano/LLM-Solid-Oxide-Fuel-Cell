1,13566,Development of alternative ceramic oxide anode materials is a key step for direct hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,A High-Performing Sulfur-Tolerant and Redox-Stable Layered Perovskite Anode for Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1038/srep18129
2,13566,"Several lanthanide based layered perovskite-structured oxides demonstrate outstanding oxygen diffusion rate, favorable electronic conductivity, and good oxygen surface exchange kinetics, owing to A-site ordered structure in which lanthanide and alkali-earth ions occupy alternate (001) layers and oxygen vacancies are mainly located in [LnO(x)] planes.",A High-Performing Sulfur-Tolerant and Redox-Stable Layered Perovskite Anode for Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1038/srep18129
3,13566,"Here we report a nickel-free cation deficient layered perovskite, (PrBa)(0.95)(Fe0.9Mo0.1)(2)O5 + delta (PBFM), for SOFC anode, and this anode shows an outstanding performance with high resistance against both carbon build-up and sulfur poisoning in hydrocarbon fuels.",A High-Performing Sulfur-Tolerant and Redox-Stable Layered Perovskite Anode for Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1038/srep18129
4,13566,"At 800 degrees C, the layered PBFM showed high electrical conductivity of 59.2 S cm(-1) in 5% H-2 and peak power densities of 1.72 and 0.54 W cm(-2) using H-2 and CH4 as fuel, respectively.",A High-Performing Sulfur-Tolerant and Redox-Stable Layered Perovskite Anode for Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1038/srep18129
5,13566,The cell exhibits a very stable performance under a constant current load of 1.0 A cm(-2).,A High-Performing Sulfur-Tolerant and Redox-Stable Layered Perovskite Anode for Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1038/srep18129
6,13566,"To our best knowledge, this is the highest performance of ceramic anodes operated in methane.",A High-Performing Sulfur-Tolerant and Redox-Stable Layered Perovskite Anode for Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1038/srep18129
7,13566,"In addition, the anode is structurally stable at various fuel and temperature conditions, suggesting that it is a feasible material candidate for high-performing SOFC anode.",A High-Performing Sulfur-Tolerant and Redox-Stable Layered Perovskite Anode for Direct Hydrocarbon Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1038/srep18129
