1,17492,"In this work, electrochemical improvement of the SOFC anode material was achieved through the modification of a NiO-YSZ anode composition with a further infiltration of a mixed conductor such as Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (CGO20).",Decreasing the polarisation resistance of a Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anode by infiltration of a ceria-based solution,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.092
2,17492,"This approach rendered improved power densities, 3 times better, compared to non-optimized systems, i.e. 160 mW cm(-2) under pure hydrogen, measured at 700 degrees C, with an OCV of similar to 1.1 V. A simple valuation cost survey of the proposed methodology indicated that the improved polarisations can obtained using about 176 mg of Ce(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O and 46 mg of Gd(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O per cm(2).",Decreasing the polarisation resistance of a Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anode by infiltration of a ceria-based solution,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.092
