2,10640,"Coating a 40 m thin film of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) perovskite on the Ni/YSZ anode surface decreased the amount of carbon deposits, slowing down the degradation rate.",La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 Perovskite: A Stable Anode Catalyst for Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/catal4020146
3,10640,The improvement in anode durability could be related to the oxidation activity of LSCF which facilitates oxidation of CH4 and carbon deposits.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 Perovskite: A Stable Anode Catalyst for Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/catal4020146
4,10640,Analysis of the crystalline structure of LSCF revealed that LSCF was stable in the reducing anode environment under H-2 and CH4 flow at 750 degrees C and retained its perovskite structure throughout the 475 h long-term stability test.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 Perovskite: A Stable Anode Catalyst for Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/catal4020146
