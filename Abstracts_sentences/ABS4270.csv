1,4270,Series of Ni-Fe-La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.115Co0.085O3 (LSGMC8.5) composite anodes were prepared and characterized for solid oxide fuel cells(SOFCs) fueled with dimethyl ether(DME).,Study of Ni composite anodes for dimethyl ether fuel cell,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20060716
2,4270,"The molar ratio of Ni to Fe was 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, and 5:5, respectively, and the total mass fraction of Ni-Fe in the electrode was 75%.",Study of Ni composite anodes for dimethyl ether fuel cell,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20060716
3,4270,"Multiple techniques were applied to study the phase composition, the microstructure of the electrode, and the electrochemical oxidation of DME over the electrode/electrolyte interface.",Study of Ni composite anodes for dimethyl ether fuel cell,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20060716
4,4270,The results demonstrated that increase in the amount of Fe in the electrode improved the sintering activity of the electrode and changed the microstructure of the electrode and electrode/electrolyte interface.,Study of Ni composite anodes for dimethyl ether fuel cell,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20060716
5,4270,"The activities for electrochemical oxidation of DME of the electrodes depended strongly on the molar ratio of Ni to Fe, and the electrode with a molar ratio of Ni to Fe at 8:2 exhibited the highest activity.",Study of Ni composite anodes for dimethyl ether fuel cell,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20060716
6,4270,"The electrodes showed good activity and stability for DME oxidation, and no obvious coke deposition was observed.",Study of Ni composite anodes for dimethyl ether fuel cell,10.3866/PKU.WHXB20060716
