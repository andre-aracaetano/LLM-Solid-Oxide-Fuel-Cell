1,767,A thin-film yttrium-doped barium zirconate comprised of two distinct layers with different porosity was fabricated by pulsed laser deposition method for a low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte to enhance electrode reactions and suppress electric short-circuit problem simultaneously.,Performance enhancement of thin-film ceramic electrolyte fuel cell using bi-layered yttrium-doped barium zirconate,10.1016/j.tsf.2013.05.063
2,767,"At 250 degrees C, the peak power density of bi-layer electrolyte fuel cell was similar to 2 mW/cm(2), which is similar to 56% higher than that of single-layer electrolyte fuel cell due to significant reduction of cathodic activation loss.",Performance enhancement of thin-film ceramic electrolyte fuel cell using bi-layered yttrium-doped barium zirconate,10.1016/j.tsf.2013.05.063
3,767,A set of materials characterizations revealed that the differences in compositions and micro-structures at the electrolytes accounts for the improved performance.,Performance enhancement of thin-film ceramic electrolyte fuel cell using bi-layered yttrium-doped barium zirconate,10.1016/j.tsf.2013.05.063
