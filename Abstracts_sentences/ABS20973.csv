2,20973,"Two conversion coatings with identical structure and phase composition, but slightly different thickness were produced in nitrate-accelerated baths containing the nitrate additive at two concentration levels.",Sr-doped LaFeO3 thin coatings for protection of ferritic stainless steel interconnects in solid oxide cells: A study on Cr-barrier and electrical properties,10.1016/j.tsf.2023.140036
3,20973,The as-prepared coatings consisted of a dual-layered perovskite-spinel structure with a top sub-micrometric Sr-doped LaFeO3 layer grown onto a micron-range thick inner Fe-Cr spinel oxide layer.,Sr-doped LaFeO3 thin coatings for protection of ferritic stainless steel interconnects in solid oxide cells: A study on Cr-barrier and electrical properties,10.1016/j.tsf.2023.140036
4,20973,"Both coatings showed high protection against oxidation and chromia scale formation at 700 degrees C. Further, excellent Area Specific Resistance (ASR) behavior was found for both coatings at 700 degrees C, although an optimal balance of ASR and Cr-diffusion barrier properties was achieved with the coating produced in the lower nitrate content bath (N-02 coating).",Sr-doped LaFeO3 thin coatings for protection of ferritic stainless steel interconnects in solid oxide cells: A study on Cr-barrier and electrical properties,10.1016/j.tsf.2023.140036
5,20973,"The causes for the enhanced barrier properties of the N-02 coating were ascribed not to a different coating thickness, but rather to the evolution of the pristine dual-layer into a more impervious three-layer structure during oxidation aging at 700 degrees C.",Sr-doped LaFeO3 thin coatings for protection of ferritic stainless steel interconnects in solid oxide cells: A study on Cr-barrier and electrical properties,10.1016/j.tsf.2023.140036
6,20973,"The evolved structure was formed by decomposition of the pristine sub-coating Fe-Cr spinel into two new spinel sublayers: an outer ferrite and an inner chromite layer, whereas the top thin-film perovskite layer remained essentially unaltered.",Sr-doped LaFeO3 thin coatings for protection of ferritic stainless steel interconnects in solid oxide cells: A study on Cr-barrier and electrical properties,10.1016/j.tsf.2023.140036
7,20973,Partial change in the Fe oxidation state and other possible causes involved in the observed decomposition of the pristine Fe-Cr spinel layer during the thermal aging are analyzed and discussed.,Sr-doped LaFeO3 thin coatings for protection of ferritic stainless steel interconnects in solid oxide cells: A study on Cr-barrier and electrical properties,10.1016/j.tsf.2023.140036
8,20973,Measurements of ASR activation energy indicated that the contact resistance behavior of the thin perovskite coatings was dominated by the internal spinel layer conductivity.,Sr-doped LaFeO3 thin coatings for protection of ferritic stainless steel interconnects in solid oxide cells: A study on Cr-barrier and electrical properties,10.1016/j.tsf.2023.140036
