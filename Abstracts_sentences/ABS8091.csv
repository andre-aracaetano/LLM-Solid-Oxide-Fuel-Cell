7,8091,Lowering the syngas preheat temperature (prior to SOFC anodes) is highly recommended and is more practical than lowering the cathode air preheat temperature.,Process simulation of biomass gasification integrated with a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.125
8,8091,Results of the parametric study indicate that: steam to carbon ratio and biomass moisture content should be as low as possible; fuel utilisation factor can change the mode of operation of the plant (focus on electricity or heat); high temperature syngas cleaning is very attractive; gasification air preheating is more attractive than gasification steam superheating.,Process simulation of biomass gasification integrated with a solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.125
