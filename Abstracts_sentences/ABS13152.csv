3,13152,"The isotope oxygen exchange technique (O-16/O-18 exchange) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis were adopted to determine the active sites for oxygen adsorption, surface oxygen exchange, and incorporation of oxygen around the O-2/cathode/YSZ triple phase boundaries (TPBs).",Oxygen transport at the hetero interfaces of electrochemical ceramic devices,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.253.179
4,13152,"The cathode surfaces were active for oxygen adsorption and surface oxygen exchange than the free surfaces of YSZ, which suggested the higher activity on the cathode surfaces.",Oxygen transport at the hetero interfaces of electrochemical ceramic devices,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.253.179
5,13152,The active sites for oxygen incorporation were determined with mesh shape cathodes (La0.9Sr0.1MnO3 and Au) and porous cathode (Ag).,Oxygen transport at the hetero interfaces of electrochemical ceramic devices,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.253.179
6,13152,The SIMS images clearly determined the active sites for oxygen incorporation on YSZ surfaces: the cathode/YSZ interfaces were active for oxygen incorporation as well as TPB in the La0.9Sr0.1MnO3-mesh and the Ag-porous cathodes.,Oxygen transport at the hetero interfaces of electrochemical ceramic devices,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.253.179

8,13152,The expansion of active sites from the TPB was considered on the basis of the SIMS images.,Oxygen transport at the hetero interfaces of electrochemical ceramic devices,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.253.179
