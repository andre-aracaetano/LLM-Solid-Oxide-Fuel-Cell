1,10317,Commercial use of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) requires high output performance and excellent long-term stability for cathode materials.,Nanostructured spinel high-entropy oxide (Fe0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)3O4 as a potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.04.131
2,10317,A nanostructured spinel high-entropy oxide (Fe0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)3O4 (FMCNZ) is developed as the SOFC cathode using an impregnation method.,Nanostructured spinel high-entropy oxide (Fe0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)3O4 as a potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.04.131
3,10317,FMCNZ nanoparticles are distributed uniformly and infiltrated into a network on the Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) skeleton by modifying the impregnation content.,Nanostructured spinel high-entropy oxide (Fe0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)3O4 as a potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.04.131
4,10317,"The polarization resistance of FMCNZ with 40 wt% impregnation loading shows a minimum value of 0.018 & omega; cm2 at 800 degrees C, which is around one-third of that for the typical Ni0.2Fe0.8Co2O4 spinel cathode with the same preparation processing.",Nanostructured spinel high-entropy oxide (Fe0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)3O4 as a potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.04.131
5,10317,The excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is primarily attributed to the di-versity of surface metal cations and the population increase of surface oxygen vacancies brought on by the high entropy design.,Nanostructured spinel high-entropy oxide (Fe0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)3O4 as a potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.04.131
6,10317,"The analysis of ORR kinetics based on the distribution of relaxation time (DRT) method reveals that the species exchange process at the electrode surface is a rate-determining step, which probably originated from the low electronic conductivity of FMCNZ.",Nanostructured spinel high-entropy oxide (Fe0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)3O4 as a potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.04.131
7,10317,"The SOFC with the nanostructured FMCNZ cathode reaches a maximum power density of 1080 mW cm-2 at 800 degrees C. Additionally, the nanostructures of the cathode barely change after 100 h of cell operation at 750 degrees C. Thus, our findings provide a novel and promising path for developing high-performance cathodes by integrating a high-entropy design strategy with the construction of nanostructured materials.",Nanostructured spinel high-entropy oxide (Fe0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)3O4 as a potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.04.131
