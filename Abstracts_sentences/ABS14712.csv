2,14712,"Relative densities > 98 % have been achieved after sintering at 1400 A degrees C or 1500 A degrees C for only 1 h. All studied compounds are stable in ambient air up to the measured 900 A degrees C and, in reducing atmosphere (both wet and dry 5 % H-2-Ar) up to the measured 800 A degrees C. The Co-free sample (BaCe0.7Y0.2Pr0.1O3-delta) exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.21 x 10(-2)","Effects of cobalt addition on structural, thermal and electrical properties of praseodymium-yttrium co-doped barium cerates",10.1007/s10832-014-9910-8

4,14712,Cobalt addition allows the ability to retain much larger amounts of water to be retained as suggested by the higher conductivities obtained in wet hydrogen compared to the values in dry reducing atmosphere.,"Effects of cobalt addition on structural, thermal and electrical properties of praseodymium-yttrium co-doped barium cerates",10.1007/s10832-014-9910-8
5,14712,This latter phenomenon is of special interest as it suggests the possibility of higher ionic conductivities in water-containing atmosphere and would benefit to intermediate- and high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells and/or electrolysers.,"Effects of cobalt addition on structural, thermal and electrical properties of praseodymium-yttrium co-doped barium cerates",10.1007/s10832-014-9910-8
6,14712,The thermal expansion coefficients for the Co-free and Co-containing samples were around 12.0 x 10(-6) K-1 between 25 and 1000 A degrees C.,"Effects of cobalt addition on structural, thermal and electrical properties of praseodymium-yttrium co-doped barium cerates",10.1007/s10832-014-9910-8
