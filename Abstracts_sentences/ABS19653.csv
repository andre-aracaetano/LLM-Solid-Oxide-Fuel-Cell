5,19653,Measurement of D* and k may be performed by the isotopic exchange/diffusion profile technique with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) used to determine the O-18 stable isotope depth distribution.,DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL SIMS TECHNIQUE FOR OXYGEN SELF-DIFFUSION AND SURFACE EXCHANGE COEFFICIENT MEASUREMENTS IN OXIDES OF HIGH DIFFUSIVITY,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90266-R
6,19653,"In the case of oxides of high diffusivity the penetration depth-at the chosen anneal temperature, approximately (D*t)0.5, is of the order of hundreds of micrometers from the surface into the bulk of the sample for the shortest practicable anneal times, t. SIMS depth profiles are generally limited to tens of micrometers due to various considerations including the time required for sputtering and roughening at the base of the SIMS crater.",DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL SIMS TECHNIQUE FOR OXYGEN SELF-DIFFUSION AND SURFACE EXCHANGE COEFFICIENT MEASUREMENTS IN OXIDES OF HIGH DIFFUSIVITY,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90266-R
7,19653,Thus the sputter depth profiling approach must be abandoned in favour of a new SIMS technique described in this paper.,DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL SIMS TECHNIQUE FOR OXYGEN SELF-DIFFUSION AND SURFACE EXCHANGE COEFFICIENT MEASUREMENTS IN OXIDES OF HIGH DIFFUSIVITY,10.1016/0167-2738(92)90266-R
