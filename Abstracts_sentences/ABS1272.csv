2,1272,"Aiming to formulate a guideline for the selection of cathode materials, we compared the most representative high-performance low-temperature cathode materials: lanthanum strontium cobalt oxide (LSC), samarium strontium cobalt oxide (SSC), praseodymium barium strontium cobalt iron oxide (PBSCF), and barium strontium cobalt iron oxide (BSCF) over the same anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell platform.",Comparison of Various Cathode Materials Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Low-Temperature Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00540-5
3,1272,"The nanostructured LSC, SSC, PBSCF, and BSCF cathode layers were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition.",Comparison of Various Cathode Materials Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Low-Temperature Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00540-5
4,1272,The PBSCF cathode material showed the highest performance owing to the low activation loss and low polarization resistance under biased conditions.,Comparison of Various Cathode Materials Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Low-Temperature Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00540-5
5,1272,"SSC exhibited the mildest degradation; however, its electrochemical performance was worse than those of LSC and PBSCF.",Comparison of Various Cathode Materials Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Low-Temperature Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00540-5
6,1272,"LSC and PBSCF exhibited considerably high degradation rates, which were attributed to the surface composition alteration owing to strontium and/or barium segregation.",Comparison of Various Cathode Materials Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Low-Temperature Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00540-5
7,1272,"At the same time, as-deposited BSCF exhibited significantly different microstructure from those of other cathode materials; it showed the worst performance and the fastest degradation as well, which was attributed to its composition and phase instability.",Comparison of Various Cathode Materials Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Low-Temperature Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00540-5
8,1272,"Although numerous issues still need to be solved for the practical application of these cathode materials, we expect that the results of the present study will provide a guideline for selecting and improving cathode materials for the low-temperature operation of ceramic fuel cells.",Comparison of Various Cathode Materials Fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition for Low-Temperature Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1007/s40684-023-00540-5
