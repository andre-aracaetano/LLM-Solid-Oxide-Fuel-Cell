1,16656,The sintering behavior of gadolinia-doped ceria powders was studied by the master sintering curve (MSC).,Master sintering curve for Gd-doped CeO2 solid electrolytes,10.1007/s10973-009-0238-6
2,16656,Dilatometric analyses of powders produced by a soft chemical method were performed to provide the experimental data set for the construction of the MSC.,Master sintering curve for Gd-doped CeO2 solid electrolytes,10.1007/s10973-009-0238-6
3,16656,"The assumed model provided good fittings of the MSC and the activation energy for the sintering of Ce1-x Gd (x) O3-delta, with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 were found to be in the 218-325 KJ/mol range, depending on the dopant content.",Master sintering curve for Gd-doped CeO2 solid electrolytes,10.1007/s10973-009-0238-6
4,16656,The results supported that both the nanometric size of the particles and the difference in ionic radii between Gd3+ and Ce4+ affects the sintering of Gd-doped CeO2.,Master sintering curve for Gd-doped CeO2 solid electrolytes,10.1007/s10973-009-0238-6
