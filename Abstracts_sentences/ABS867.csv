2,867,Herein we report calcined crab shell (CCS) forming nanocomposites with La0.6Sr0.4CO0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) perovskite as functional electrolytes for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LTSOFCs).,Fast ion channels for crab shell-based electrolyte fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.048
3,867,The single CCS electrolyte fuel cell achieved open circuit voltage (OCV) at 0.9 V and a peak power density of 70 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C; while the highest OCV of 1.21 V and a maximum power density of 440 mW cm(-2) were achieved for the CCS-LSCF (40 wt. % LSCF) electrolyte fuel cell.,Fast ion channels for crab shell-based electrolyte fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.048
4,867,The results are attributed to the ion channel construction and interface effect built in the CCS-LSCF composite.,Fast ion channels for crab shell-based electrolyte fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.048
