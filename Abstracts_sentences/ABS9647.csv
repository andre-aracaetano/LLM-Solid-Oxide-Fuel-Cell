6,9647,"An optimal thermal insulation strategy is defined to maintain the steady-state operation temperature of the mu-SOFC at 973 K and an external temperature lower than 323 K. A hybrid start-up procedure, based on heaters embedded in the mu-SOFCs and heat released by chemical reactions in the post-combustion unit, is analyzed allowing start-up times below 1 min and energy consumption under 500 J. These results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of high temperature mu-SOFC power systems fuelled with hydrocarbons for portable applications, therefore, anticipating a new family of mobile and uninterrupted power generators.",Is it possible to design a portable power generator based on micro-solid oxide fuel cells?
