1,6056,"We demonstrate the high-performance and robust operation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells under a mixed-gas atmosphere applying a novel cell structure and characterization method, useful for minimizing the conventional problems of mixed-gas operation with anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells.",High-performance and robust operation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells in mixed-gas atmosphere,10.1002/er.3465
2,6056,"To achieve the exothermic methane (CH4) partial oxidation and sufficient difference in oxygen partial pressure even in mixed-gas mode, a composite of metallic rhodium and cerium dioxide (CeO2) was chosen as the optimized reforming and oxygen barrier layer after the comprehensive catalytic experiment.",High-performance and robust operation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells in mixed-gas atmosphere,10.1002/er.3465
3,6056,"We also obtained increased cell operation reliability through the combination of anode pre-reduction, an optimized material system, and a customized characterization jig (including cathode-ahead layout and impinging jet flow).",High-performance and robust operation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells in mixed-gas atmosphere,10.1002/er.3465
4,6056,"According to the cell test at 600 degrees C under a feeding gas of CH4 and O-2, an open-circuit voltage and maximum power density of 0.916V and 0.422W/cm(2), respectively, were successfully achieved.",High-performance and robust operation of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells in mixed-gas atmosphere,10.1002/er.3465
