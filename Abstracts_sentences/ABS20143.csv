5,20143,"The relationship between the molar ratio R of the amount of citric acid and nickel ions and the nickel oxide particle sizes is as following were prepared after drying and calcination: the grain sizes of the nickel oxide particle in the anode exhibit a decreasing trend With the R value increasing, and the grain sizes are between the range of 7 similar to 30 nm.",Ni-YSZ Anode of IT-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Prepared by Impregnation,
6,20143,"The polarization resistance of the anode prepared by impregnating in the citric acid-nickel complex compound is smaller than that of the anode impregnated in the nickel nitrate, about 1 order of magnitude, and the output power density of the cell prepared by this anode is also higher than that of nickel nitrate impregnated anode.",Ni-YSZ Anode of IT-Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Prepared by Impregnation,
