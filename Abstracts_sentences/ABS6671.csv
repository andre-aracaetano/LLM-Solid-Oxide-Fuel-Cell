2,6671,"In this study, ionic conducting Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) are incorporated into perovskite SrCo0.7Nb0.1Ni0.2O3-delta (SCNN) cathode to synergistically improve its ORR activity as well as CO2 tolerance.",High-performance and CO2-resistant cathode toward electrocatalytic oxygen reduction for solid oxide fuel cells: Doped ceria and SrCo0.7Nb0.1Ni0.2O3-δ composite,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139323
3,6671,"A series of composite oxide, SCNN-xSDC (x = 0, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt %), were systematically evaluated as candidate cathodes for intermediate temperature SOFCs.",High-performance and CO2-resistant cathode toward electrocatalytic oxygen reduction for solid oxide fuel cells: Doped ceria and SrCo0.7Nb0.1Ni0.2O3-δ composite,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139323
4,6671,"Among all cathodes, SCNN-40SDC has the lowest polarization resistance (0.019 Omega(2) cm(2)), only similar to 30% of SCNN (0.066 Omega(2) cm(2)) at 700 degrees C.

5,6671,"SDC boosts ORR activity of the composite cathodes, which is owing to enhanced oxygen surface exchange process, as evidenced by higher oxygen surface exchange coefficient (K-chem) and bulk diffusion coefficient (D-chem).",High-performance and CO2-resistant cathode toward electrocatalytic oxygen reduction for solid oxide fuel cells: Doped ceria and SrCo0.7Nb0.1Ni0.2O3-δ composite,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139323
6,6671,"Furthermore, the composite cathode shows much enhanced stability under CO2 poisoning, which was ascribed to the suppression of Sr segregation from SrCo0.7Nb0.1Ni0.2O3-delta and alleviated formation of carbonate in condition of SDC addition.",High-performance and CO2-resistant cathode toward electrocatalytic oxygen reduction for solid oxide fuel cells: Doped ceria and SrCo0.7Nb0.1Ni0.2O3-δ composite,10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139323
