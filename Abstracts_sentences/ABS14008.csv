1,14008,The reaction of carbon dioxide catalytic reforming with methane is an attractive route because these greenhouse gases can be converted into variable feedstocks.,Electrocatalytic reforming of carbon dioxide by methane in SOFC system,10.1016/j.cattod.2003.10.017
2,14008,However this reaction is a highly energy consuming and coke forming process.,Electrocatalytic reforming of carbon dioxide by methane in SOFC system,10.1016/j.cattod.2003.10.017
3,14008,"These problems were improved by the electrocatalytic reforming of CO2 with CH4 in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) membrane reactor system, which generates high electrical power and synthesis gases.",Electrocatalytic reforming of carbon dioxide by methane in SOFC system,10.1016/j.cattod.2003.10.017
4,14008,"The single cell consists of catalyst electrode (NiO-MgO), counter electrode ((La,Sr)MnO3) and Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) electrolyte.",Electrocatalytic reforming of carbon dioxide by methane in SOFC system,10.1016/j.cattod.2003.10.017
5,14008,"The reaction rates of CO2 and CH4, and the electrochemical properties were investigated by an on-line GC and impedance-analyzer under open- and closed-circuit conditions, respectively.",Electrocatalytic reforming of carbon dioxide by methane in SOFC system,10.1016/j.cattod.2003.10.017
6,14008,It was found that reaction rates of O-2 and CH4 under the closed-circuit condition were more stable than those of the open-circuit.,Electrocatalytic reforming of carbon dioxide by methane in SOFC system,10.1016/j.cattod.2003.10.017
7,14008,The results were interpreted that the stability of catalyst anode was maintained by the reaction of oxygen ion transferred from the cathode with the surface carbon formed in the internal CO2 reforming by CH4 in SOFC system.,Electrocatalytic reforming of carbon dioxide by methane in SOFC system,10.1016/j.cattod.2003.10.017
