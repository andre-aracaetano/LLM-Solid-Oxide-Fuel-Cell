2,10088,"Interestingly, the experimental results reveal that with the linear increase of y in LSSC, the conductivity of the corresponding samples does not alter linearly but reaches a peak when y = 0.35, namely, the maximum electrical conductivity enhancing from 2148 S cm-1 (LSC, y = 0.30) and 1802 S cm(-1) (SSC, y = 0.50) to 2750 S cm(-1) (y = 0.35).",Investigation of La1-xSmx-ySryCoO3-δ cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.037
3,10088,"In addition, this turning point coincidently corresponds to the structure transition from hexagonal (y = 035) to orthorhombic (y = 0.40).",Investigation of La1-xSmx-ySryCoO3-δ cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.037
4,10088,"Furthermore, comparing with LSC and SSC, the cathode polarization resistance (Rp) decreases by about 50% and 38%, respectively, after employing the LSSC (y = 0.40) compound as cathode at 800 degrees C and 0.21 atm p(O-2), which also leads to an increment of 49% and 31% respectively in peak power density.",Investigation of La1-xSmx-ySryCoO3-δ cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.037
