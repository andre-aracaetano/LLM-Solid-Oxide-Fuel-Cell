1,4820,The composite cathodes with lanthanum-based iron and cobalt-containing perovskite La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3.delta (LSCF) and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) are investigated for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications at relatively low operating temperatures (700-800 degrees C).,High-Performance composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.075
2,4820,LSCFs with high surface areas of 55 m(2)g(-1) are synthesized via a complex method with inorganic nano dispersants.,High-Performance composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.075
3,4820,"The fuel cell performances of composite cathodes on anode supported SOFCs are characterized with GDC materials of surface areas of 5 m(2)g(-1) (ULSA-GDC), 12 m(2)g(-1) (LSA-GDC), and 23 m(2)g(-1) (HAS-GDC).",High-Performance composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.075
4,4820,The maximum power density of the SOFCs increases from 0.68 Wcm(-2) to 1.2 Wcm(-2) at 780 degrees C and 0.8 V as the GDC surface area increases from 5 m(2)g(-1) to 23 m(2)g(-1).,High-Performance composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.075
5,4820,"The area specific resistance of the porous composite cathodes with a HAS-GDC are 0.467 ohmcm(2) at 780 degrees C and 1.086 ohmcm(2) at 680 degrees C, while these values with an LSA-GDC are 0.543 ohmcm(2) and 0.945 ohmcm(2), respectively.",High-Performance composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.075
6,4820,The best compositions of the porous composite cathodes result from the morphologies of the GDC materials at each temperature due to the formation of an electron-oxygen ion-gas boundary.,High-Performance composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.075
