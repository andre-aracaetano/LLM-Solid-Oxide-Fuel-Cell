1,8170,SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-delta (SFCM) is a ceramic oxide that has the potential to replace conventional Ni-based cermet anodes and is appropriate for use in solid oxide fuel cells operating at low temperatures (below 650 degrees C).,Defect chemistry and oxygen non-stoichiometry in SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-δ ceramic oxide for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-020-03674-7
2,8170,SFCM was shown to be phase stable with n-type conductivity above 43 S/cm under reducing conditions and reversibly creates secondary phases under oxidizing conditions with p-type conductivity around 4 S/cm at 600 degrees C. SFCM begins desorbing oxygen and creating vacancies under nitrogen at 350 degrees C and continues to do so above 800 degrees C.,Defect chemistry and oxygen non-stoichiometry in SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-δ ceramic oxide for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-020-03674-7

4,8170,"Once exposed to reducing conditions, SFCM can obtain a non-stoichiometry up to delta = 0.176 due to the reduction of the three multivalent B-site cations resulting in a low enthalpy of formation for oxygen vacancies at 109 kJ mol(-1).",Defect chemistry and oxygen non-stoichiometry in SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-δ ceramic oxide for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-020-03674-7
