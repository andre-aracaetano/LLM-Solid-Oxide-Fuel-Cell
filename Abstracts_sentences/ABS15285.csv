1,15285,The O-2 reduction reactions on Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM) electrodes in solid-oxide fuel cells in the absence and presence of a chromia-forming alloy metallic interconnect have been investigated.,Deposition of chromium species at Sr-doped LaMnO3 electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells -: II.: Effect on O2 reduction reaction,10.1149/1.1393883
2,15285,"Similar to those in the absence of the chromia-forming alloy, the O-2 reduction reactions on LSM electrodes in the presence of chromia-forming alloys are limited by two electrode processes, the diffusion of oxygen species on the LSM surface and the migration of oxygen ions into zirconia electrolyte.",Deposition of chromium species at Sr-doped LaMnO3 electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells -: II.: Effect on O2 reduction reaction,10.1149/1.1393883
3,15285,"In the presence of chromia;forming alloy, the dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on the LSM electrode surface are inhibited by the gaseous Cr species (e.g.:, CrO3), and the migration processes of oxygen ions into zirconia electrolyte are inhibited by the solid Cr species [e.g., Cr2O3/(Cr, Mn)(3)O-4] deposited on the electrolyte surface.",Deposition of chromium species at Sr-doped LaMnO3 electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells -: II.: Effect on O2 reduction reaction,10.1149/1.1393883
