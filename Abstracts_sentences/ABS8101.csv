1,8101,"A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) laboratory has been installed in Torino, Italy, in order to analyze the operation, in a cogenerative couliguration, of the CHP-100 SOFC Field Unit built by Sienrens Power Corporation (SPG) Stationary Fuel Cells (SFC), within the frametvork of the EOS Project.",Experimental analysis of the voltage and temperature behavior of a solid oxide fuel cell generator,10.1115/1.2713772
2,8101,"An experimental session was perjbrmed, varying the setpoi.",Experimental analysis of the voltage and temperature behavior of a solid oxide fuel cell generator,10.1115/1.2713772
3,8101,"at temperature T-GEN and the fuel consumption (FC), with the aim of characterizing the behaviour of the local voltages and temperatures.",Experimental analysis of the voltage and temperature behavior of a solid oxide fuel cell generator,10.1115/1.2713772
4,8101,"A design of experiments procedure was applied to obtain first (simple 2(2)) and second-order (spherical central composite design (CCD)) regression models, which were then used in subsequent constrained optimization procedures.",Experimental analysis of the voltage and temperature behavior of a solid oxide fuel cell generator,10.1115/1.2713772
5,8101,"A sensitivity analysis was also performed: FC revealed cis the prevailing control factor of the operation, and it was shown that the analysis of the local voltage and temperature sensitivity to FC can be used as a diagnostic tool for the fuel distribution within a SOFC generator (the honrogeneity of the sensitivity of the various cells was similar to 10%, depending strongly on the cell bundle arrangement in the stack).",Experimental analysis of the voltage and temperature behavior of a solid oxide fuel cell generator,10.1115/1.2713772
6,8101,"Finally, the effect of any changes in the control factors on the tube temperature profile was evaluated and discussed,- a link between a high terminal voltage and a more uniform temperature along the cell tube has been pointed out.",Experimental analysis of the voltage and temperature behavior of a solid oxide fuel cell generator,10.1115/1.2713772
