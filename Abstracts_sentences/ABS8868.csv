1,8868,Performances of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) were investigated in triode operation mode under methane steam reforming in the presence of H2S. Both the catalytic performances for methane steam reforming and the electrochemical properties for the electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen of a Ni/GDC anode drastically dropped in the presence of 1 ppm H2S. Poisoned catalytic sites are different from those for the hydrogen electrochemical oxidation.,Triode operation for enhancing the performance of H2S-poisoned SOFCs operated under CH4-H2O mixtures,10.1016/j.ssi.2015.05.003
