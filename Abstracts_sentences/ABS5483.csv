2,5483,"For this purpose, a multiphase solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrode composite made of yttria-stabilized zirconia and nickel oxide phases, with grains of about a few micrometres in size, has been analyzed.",X-ray micro Laue diffraction tomography analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1107/S1600576715002447
3,5483,"In order to calibrate the Laue data and to test the technique's sensitivity limits, a monocrystalline germanium sample of about 8 x 4 mu m in cross-section size has also been studied through mu-LT.",X-ray micro Laue diffraction tomography analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1107/S1600576715002447
4,5483,The SOFC and germanium Laue diffraction pattern analyses are compared and discussed.,X-ray micro Laue diffraction tomography analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1107/S1600576715002447
5,5483,"The indexing procedure has been successfully applied for the analysis of the germanium Laue data, and the depth-resolved two-dimensional cartographies of the full deviatoric strain tensor components were obtained.",X-ray micro Laue diffraction tomography analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1107/S1600576715002447
6,5483,"The development and application of an original geometrical approach to analyze the SOFC Laue data allowed the authors to resolve grains with sizes of about 3 mu m and to identify their individual Laue patterns; by indexing those Laue patterns, the crystalline phases and orientations of most of the grains identified through the geometrical approach could be resolved.",X-ray micro Laue diffraction tomography analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1107/S1600576715002447
