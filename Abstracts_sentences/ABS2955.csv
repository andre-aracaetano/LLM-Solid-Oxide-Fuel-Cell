3,2955,"According to the model, Al2O3 powders are selected for preparation of the seals by tape casting, and the leak rate is evaluated under various compressive stresses and gauge pressures.",Model-oriented cast ceramic tape seals for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.032
4,2955,The results indicate that Al2O3 Powder with D-50 value about 2 mu m and specific surface area near 5 m(2) g(-1) can be used for the cast tape seals; and the obtained leak rate can satisfy the allowable leak limit.,Model-oriented cast ceramic tape seals for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.032
