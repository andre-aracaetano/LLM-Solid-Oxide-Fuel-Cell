1,10632,A ceria based solid oxide fuel cell was fabricated onto a porous stainless steel support by sintering process.,Evaluation of Metal Supported Ceria Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Wet Powder Spray and Sintering,10.1149/1.3253653
2,10632,"The metal supported cell was composed of a porous AISI430 support, a Ni-Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 anode, a Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolyte, and a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode.",Evaluation of Metal Supported Ceria Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Wet Powder Spray and Sintering,10.1149/1.3253653
3,10632,A cell was tested at 600 degrees C for up to 2700 h on humidified argon balanced hydrogen and air.,Evaluation of Metal Supported Ceria Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Wet Powder Spray and Sintering,10.1149/1.3253653
4,10632,"The cell showed no signs of degradation over 1200 h at low current densities of 0.16 and 0.24 A cm(-2); however, under a high current density of 0.32 A cm(-2), the cell voltage dropped by 25% in 1400 h. Impedance measurements showed a sharp increase in polarization resistance that could be associated with the cathode.",Evaluation of Metal Supported Ceria Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Wet Powder Spray and Sintering,10.1149/1.3253653
5,10632,"Ohmic resistances from the oxide scale and electrodes did not significantly contribute to the overall resistance, while electrode polarization resistance accounted for more than half of the overall resistance.",Evaluation of Metal Supported Ceria Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fabricated by Wet Powder Spray and Sintering,10.1149/1.3253653
