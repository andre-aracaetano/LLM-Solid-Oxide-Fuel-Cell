1,5966,For solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) one key aspect is the structural integrity of the cell and hence its thermo mechanical long term behaviour.,Failure analysis of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.009
2,5966,"The present study investigates the failure mechanisms and the actual causes for fracture of electrolyte supported SOFCs which were run using the current mu-CHP system of Hexis AG, Winterthur - Switzerland under lab conditions or at customer sites for up to 40,000 h. In a first step several operated stacks were demounted for post-mortem inspection, followed by a fractographic evaluation of the failed cells.",Failure analysis of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.009
3,5966,The respective findings are then set into a larger picture including an analysis of the present stresses acting on the cell like thermal and residual stresses and the measurements regarding the temperature dependent electrolyte strength.,Failure analysis of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.009
4,5966,"For all investigated stacks, the mechanical failure of individual cells can be attributed to locally acting bending loads, which rise due to an inhomogeneous and uneven contact between the metallic interconnect and the cell.",Failure analysis of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.009
