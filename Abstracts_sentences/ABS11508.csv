1,11508,"Rare-earth-doped ceria powders (Ce0.8R0.2O1.9, R=Yb, Y, Gd, Sm, Nd and La), which may be applied to the oxygen ion electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells, were prepared by the oxalate coprecipitation method.",Oxygen partial pressure dependence of the electrical conductivity of rare-earth-doped ceria ceramics,
2,11508,"As-produced powders were calcined at 600degreesC, then pressed isostatically into disks (8 rum in diameter and I nun thickness) and sintered to above 98% relative density at 1600degreesC for 4 h. The complex impedance of the disk samples with An electrodes was measured by a two-terminal AC bridge circuit in an oxygen partial pressure range from 0.21 to I x 10(-23) atm at 336degrees-866degreesC.",Oxygen partial pressure dependence of the electrical conductivity of rare-earth-doped ceria ceramics,
3,11508,"The electrical conductivity of Yb, Y or Sm-doped ceria was independent of the oxygen partial pressure.",Oxygen partial pressure dependence of the electrical conductivity of rare-earth-doped ceria ceramics,
4,11508,This result indicates that the conductivity is dominated by the diffusion of oxygen ions and electronic conduction can be ignored in the present case.,Oxygen partial pressure dependence of the electrical conductivity of rare-earth-doped ceria ceramics,
