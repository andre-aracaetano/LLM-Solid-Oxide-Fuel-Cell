1,15547,"This paper presents the development of the subsystems for stationary biogas powered solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-based combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP).",Investigation of Subsystems for Combination into a SOFC-Based CCHP System,10.1115/1.4041727
2,15547,"For certain applications, such as buildings, a heat-driven operation mode leads to low operating hours per year for conventional combined heat and power (CHP) systems due to the low heat demand during the summer season.",Investigation of Subsystems for Combination into a SOFC-Based CCHP System,10.1115/1.4041727
3,15547,"The objectives of this study are the evaluation of an adsorber, a steam reformer, a SOFC, and an absorption chiller (AC).",Investigation of Subsystems for Combination into a SOFC-Based CCHP System,10.1115/1.4041727
4,15547,"Biogas, however, contains impurities in the form of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen chloride (HCl), and siloxanes in different concentrations, which have a negative effect on the performance and durability of the SOFC and, in the case of H2S, also on the catalyst of the steam reformer.",Investigation of Subsystems for Combination into a SOFC-Based CCHP System,10.1115/1.4041727
5,15547,"This paper describes different experimental sections: (i) the biogas treatment with its main focus on H2S separation and steam reforming, (ii) the setup and start-up of a 10 cell SOFC stack, and (iii) test runs with an AC using a mixture of NH3 (ammonia)/H2O (water).",Investigation of Subsystems for Combination into a SOFC-Based CCHP System,10.1115/1.4041727
