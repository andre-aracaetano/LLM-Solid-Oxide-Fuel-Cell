1,10188,"In this study, with the motivation of elucidating the effect of H2S and HCl on solid oxide fuel cell anodes, nickel and ceria pattern anodes are prepared on yttrium-stabilized zirconia electrolyte, and the effect of H2S and HCl on their performance is tested using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",Effect of H2S and HCl contaminants on nickel and ceria pattern anode solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140592
2,10188,"However, it has been found that while H2S adversely impacts both nickel and ceria, the poisoning caused is reversible for nickel and only partially reversible for ceria.",Effect of H2S and HCl contaminants on nickel and ceria pattern anode solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140592
3,10188,"Poisoning kinetics are similar and fast for both materials, while recovery kinetics are slower for ceria than nickel.",Effect of H2S and HCl contaminants on nickel and ceria pattern anode solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140592
4,10188,High sulfur coverage is the rate-limiting factor inferred from the elementary kinetic modeling.,Effect of H2S and HCl contaminants on nickel and ceria pattern anode solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140592
5,10188,"Unlike H2S, the presence of HCl appeared to be favorable for electrochemical oxidation as the polarization resistance of both pattern electrode cells decreased upon feeding HCl contaminated hydrogen gas.",Effect of H2S and HCl contaminants on nickel and ceria pattern anode solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140592
6,10188,"Similar behavior has not been reported previously, and the conclusion regarding underlying mechanisms requires further investigation.",Effect of H2S and HCl contaminants on nickel and ceria pattern anode solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140592
