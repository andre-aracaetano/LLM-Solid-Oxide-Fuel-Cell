1,13197,Samaria-doped ceria (SDC) was prepared by using the solid-state reaction method.,Effect of gallia addition on the sintering behavior of samaria-doped ceria,
2,13197,Sintering of SDC was significantly promoted by adding a small amount of gallium.,Effect of gallia addition on the sintering behavior of samaria-doped ceria,
3,13197,"SDC that had 1% of gallium added, sintered at 1450 degrees C, showed almost the same properties as SDC sintered at 1600 degrees C. Measurements showed that the addition of gallia could reduce the sintering temperature by 150 degrees C without deteriorating the properties of SDC as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells.",Effect of gallia addition on the sintering behavior of samaria-doped ceria,
