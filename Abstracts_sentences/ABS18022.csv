1,18022,"Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) materials are used in industrial applications such as catalyst supports, solid oxide fuel cell anodes, and red-emitting phosphors, and these applications require different particle morphologies, either porous or solid.",Manipulation of morphology of strontium titanate particles by spray pyrolysis,10.1016/j.powtec.2014.05.056
2,18022,"Spray pyrolysis (SP) is a potential process for preparing SrTiO3 because it is simple and continuous, but to date, no solid spherical shape has been reported.",Manipulation of morphology of strontium titanate particles by spray pyrolysis,10.1016/j.powtec.2014.05.056
3,18022,"One possible challenge is the instability of the precursor solution, which can cause non-homogenous precipitation of porous structures.",Manipulation of morphology of strontium titanate particles by spray pyrolysis,10.1016/j.powtec.2014.05.056
