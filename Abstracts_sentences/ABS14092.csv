2,14092,"They are used as current conducting backbones as an alternative to nickel-cermets, which suffer degradation due to coking, sulphur poisoning, and low tolerance to redox cycling.","Fabrication and Electrochemical Performance of Zn-Doped La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Infiltrated with Nickel-CGO, Iron, and Cobalt as an Alternative Anode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/catal9030269
3,14092,"In this work, anode backbone materials were synthesized from La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3-delta (LSCTA-), modified with 5 wt.% Zn, and infiltrated with nickel (Ni)/ceria gadolinium-doped cerium oxide (CGO), Fe, and Co.","Fabrication and Electrochemical Performance of Zn-Doped La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Infiltrated with Nickel-CGO, Iron, and Cobalt as an Alternative Anode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/catal9030269
4,14092,The electrodes were further studied for their electrochemical performance using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at open circuit voltage (OCV) in different hydrogen to steam ratios and at various operating temperatures (850-650 degrees C).,"Fabrication and Electrochemical Performance of Zn-Doped La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Infiltrated with Nickel-CGO, Iron, and Cobalt as an Alternative Anode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/catal9030269
5,14092,"Infiltration of electrocatalysts significantly reduced the polarization resistance and among the studied infiltrates, at all operating temperatures, Ni-CGO showed excellent electrode performance.","Fabrication and Electrochemical Performance of Zn-Doped La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Infiltrated with Nickel-CGO, Iron, and Cobalt as an Alternative Anode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/catal9030269
6,14092,"The polarization resistances in 3% and 50% H2O/H-2 atmosphere were found to be 0.072 and 0.025 omega cm(2), respectively, at 850 degrees C, and 0.091 and 0.076 omega cm(2), respectively, at 750 degrees C, with Ni-CGO.","Fabrication and Electrochemical Performance of Zn-Doped La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Infiltrated with Nickel-CGO, Iron, and Cobalt as an Alternative Anode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/catal9030269
7,14092,These values are approximately three orders of magnitude smaller than the polarization resistance (25 omega cm(2)) of back bone material measured at 750 degrees C.,"Fabrication and Electrochemical Performance of Zn-Doped La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 Infiltrated with Nickel-CGO, Iron, and Cobalt as an Alternative Anode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.3390/catal9030269
