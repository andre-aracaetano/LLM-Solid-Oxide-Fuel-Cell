1,9634,Westinghouse is developing its tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for a variety of applications in stationary power generation markets.,A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
2,9634,"By pressurizing a SOFC and integrating it with a gas turbine (GT), power systems with efficiencies as high as 70-75% can be obtained.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
3,9634,The first such system will be tested in 1998.,A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
4,9634,"Because of their extraordinarily high efficiency (60-70%) even in small sizes the first SOFC products to be offend are expected to be integrated SOFC/GT power systems in the 1-7 MW range, for use in the emerging distributed generation (DG) market segment.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
5,9634,Expansion into larger sizes will follow later.,A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
6,9634,"Because of their modularity, environmental friendliness and expected cost effectiveness, and because of a worldwide thrust towards utility deregulation, a ready market is forecasted for baseload distributed generation.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
7,9634,"Assuming Westinghouse can complete its technology development and reach its cost targets, the integrated SOFC/GT power system is seen as a product with tremendous potential in the emerging distributed generation market.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
8,9634,"While Westinghouse has been a leader in the development of power generation technology for over a century, it does not plan to manufacture small gas turbines.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
9,9634,"However, GTs small enough to integrate with SOFCs and address the 1-7 MW market are generally available from various manufacturers.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
10,9634,Westinghouse will need access to a new set of customers as it brings baseload plants to the present small market mix of emergency and peaking power applications.,A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
11,9634,"Small cogeneration applications, already strong in some parts of the world, are also gaining ground everywhere.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
12,9634,"Small GT manufacturers already serve this market, and alliances and partnerships can enhance SOFC commercialization.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
13,9634,"Utilities also serve the DG market, especially those that have set up energy service companies and seek to grow beyond the legal and geographical confines of their current regulated business.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
14,9634,"Because fuel cells in general are a new product, because small baseload applications are a new segment, and because deregulation will continue to shake up the mature traditional power generation market, the commercial risks of launching a new product at this time are unique and considerable.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
15,9634,"Hence, a collaborative approach to commercialization is deemed desirable and appropriate, and collaboration with GT manufacturers and utilities will be addressed in this paper.",A consortium approach to commercialized Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cell technology,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02757-2
