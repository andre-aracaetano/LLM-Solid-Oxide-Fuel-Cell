1,9272,Chemically stable BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BZY) oxide is limited to applications as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) because of its poor sintering behavior.,A new neodymium-doped BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ as potential electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.062
2,9272,This study attempts to improve the sinterability and conductivity of BZY using the partial substitution of Zr4+ in BZY with Nd3+.,A new neodymium-doped BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ as potential electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.062
3,9272,An oxide with the nominal composition of BaZr0.7Nd0.1Y0.2O3-delta (BZNY) is specifically investigated.,A new neodymium-doped BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ as potential electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.062
4,9272,Results from X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrate Nd3+ is successfully doped into the lattice as anticipated and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations verify the morphology and crystal structure of the BZNY powder.,A new neodymium-doped BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ as potential electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.062
5,9272,Dilatometric measurement and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations provide verification that the sinterability of the oxide is effectively improved by introducing Nd3+.,A new neodymium-doped BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ as potential electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.062
6,9272,XRD and CO2-TPD results demonstrate that BZNY is relatively stable with respect to the CO2 atmosphere.,A new neodymium-doped BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ as potential electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.062
7,9272,"The total conductivity of BZNY in wet H-2 is 2.76 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C. An anode-supported thin-film BZNY electrolyte (similar to 30 mu m) cell is fabricated, and the electrolyte layer is found to be well densified after co-sintering with the anode substrate at 1450 degrees C for 5 h. The cell delivers a peak power density of 142 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, higher than the reported values for a similar cell with BZY electrolyte.",A new neodymium-doped BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ as potential electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.062
