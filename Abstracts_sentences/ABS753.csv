1,753,Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFC) operating below 650 degrees C have attracted attention as a next-generation fuel cell.,Multiscale structured low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with 13 W power at 500 °C,10.1039/d0ee00870b
2,753,"Although much effort has been paid to develop such fuel cells, it still remains challenging to satisfy all the requirements ensuring practical operation, such as power output and durability.",Multiscale structured low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with 13 W power at 500 °C,10.1039/d0ee00870b
3,753,Here we demonstrate 4 cm x 4 cm multiscale structured LT-SOFCs having a record high power output of 13 W per single cell at 500 degrees C via a large-area ceramic micropatterning and thin-film depositions.,Multiscale structured low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with 13 W power at 500 °C,10.1039/d0ee00870b
4,753,Our cell exhibits excellent long-term stability with performance degradation of less than 0.05% per 500 h. Quantitative microstructure and electrochemical analyses reveal that the proposed cell significantly lowered both ohmic and polarization losses than the reference planar cells.,Multiscale structured low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with 13 W power at 500 °C,10.1039/d0ee00870b
5,753,"This work features a facile and powerful tool to implement robust and large-area 3D architectures in LT-SOFCs, which opens up opportunities to produce practical LT-SOFC systems satisfying both power and durability.",Multiscale structured low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with 13 W power at 500 °C,10.1039/d0ee00870b
