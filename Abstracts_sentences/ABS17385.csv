1,17385,"This research is focused on the study of the samples, approximatively 15 9 30 mm(2) sized, that were mechanically cut from two sheets (0.4 and 0.2 mm thick, respectively) of AISI 444 Type ferritic stainless steel (FSS) (DIN 1.4521, Eu designation X2CrMoTi18-2); this material was in the 'as-rolled' state.",Influence of Surface Finishing on High-Temperature Oxidation of AISI Type 444 Ferritic Stainless Steel Used in SOFC Stacks,10.1007/s40195-017-0543-1
2,17385,"Part of these specimens were treated superficially on one side using abrasive SiC papers with different average grit sizes (i.e., 46.2, 30.2, 18.3 mu m) and diamond suspension (up to 1 mu m) in order to obtain various surface roughness.",Influence of Surface Finishing on High-Temperature Oxidation of AISI Type 444 Ferritic Stainless Steel Used in SOFC Stacks,10.1007/s40195-017-0543-1
3,17385,Both the 'as-rolled' and superficially treated samples were then aged in a muffle furnace in static air according to a thermal cycle corresponding to the curing phase of an experimental glass used as sealing in the solid oxide fuel cell stacks.,Influence of Surface Finishing on High-Temperature Oxidation of AISI Type 444 Ferritic Stainless Steel Used in SOFC Stacks,10.1007/s40195-017-0543-1
4,17385,"After aging, the chemical compositions and morphological peculiarities of the scale formed depending on the thickness of the samples and their surface state were studied by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, bright field light optical microscopy.",Influence of Surface Finishing on High-Temperature Oxidation of AISI Type 444 Ferritic Stainless Steel Used in SOFC Stacks,10.1007/s40195-017-0543-1
5,17385,"The obtained results show that all scales formed consist of an inner Cr2O3 subscale and an outer (Mn, Cr)(3)O-4 spinel layer; the relationship between FSS grain size and scale microstructural features is consistent on the samples with mirror-like surface only; the scale thicknesses on SiC grinded samples are comparable; the scales covering the 'as-rolled' surfaces are morphologically similar to those grown on the surfaces finished with the 30.2 and 18.3 mu m SiC papers, and their thicknesses show an intermediate situation between the abraded and the mirror-like specimens.",Influence of Surface Finishing on High-Temperature Oxidation of AISI Type 444 Ferritic Stainless Steel Used in SOFC Stacks,10.1007/s40195-017-0543-1
6,17385,The last described characteristics depend mainly on the surface and microstructural peculiarities resulting from the rolling process.,Influence of Surface Finishing on High-Temperature Oxidation of AISI Type 444 Ferritic Stainless Steel Used in SOFC Stacks,10.1007/s40195-017-0543-1
