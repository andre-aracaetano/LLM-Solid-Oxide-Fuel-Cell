1,20814,"Protonic ceramic solid oxide cells (P-SOCs) have gained widespread attention due to their potential for operation in the temperature range of 300-500 degrees C, which is not only beneficial in terms of material stability but also offers unique possibilities from a thermodynamic point of view to realize a series of reactions.",Development of Electrode-Supported Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Cells and their Evaluation as Electrochemical Hydrogen Pumps,10.1021/acsami.2c11779
2,20814,"For instance, they are ideal for the production of synthetic fuels by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, upgradation of hydrocarbons, or dehydrogenation reactions.",Development of Electrode-Supported Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Cells and their Evaluation as Electrochemical Hydrogen Pumps,10.1021/acsami.2c11779
3,20814,"However, the development of P-SOC is quite challenging because it requires a multifront optimization in terms of material synthesis and fabrication procedures.",Development of Electrode-Supported Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Cells and their Evaluation as Electrochemical Hydrogen Pumps,10.1021/acsami.2c11779
4,20814,"Herein, we report in detail a method to overcome various fabrication challenges for the development of efficient and robust electrode-supported P-SOCs (Ni-BCZY/BCZY/Ni-BCZY) based on a BaCe0.2Zr0.7Y0.1O3-delta (BCZY271) electrolyte.",Development of Electrode-Supported Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Cells and their Evaluation as Electrochemical Hydrogen Pumps,10.1021/acsami.2c11779
5,20814,"We examined the effect of pore formers on the porosity of the Ni-BCZY support electrode, various electrolyte deposition techniques (spray, spin, and vacuum-assisted), and thermal treatments for developing robust and flat half-cells.",Development of Electrode-Supported Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Cells and their Evaluation as Electrochemical Hydrogen Pumps,10.1021/acsami.2c11779
6,20814,Half-cells containing a thin (10-12 mu m) pinhole-free electrolyte layer were completed by a screen-printed Ni-BCZY electrode and evaluated as an electrochemical hydrogen pump to access the functionality.,Development of Electrode-Supported Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Cells and their Evaluation as Electrochemical Hydrogen Pumps,10.1021/acsami.2c11779
7,20814,The P-SOCs are found to show a current density ranging from 150 to 525 mA cm(-2) at 1 V over an operating temperature range of 350-450 1 V. The faradaic efficiency of the P-SOCs as well as their stability were also evaluated.,Development of Electrode-Supported Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Cells and their Evaluation as Electrochemical Hydrogen Pumps,10.1021/acsami.2c11779
