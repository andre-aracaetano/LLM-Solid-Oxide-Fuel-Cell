1,4932,"To date, most investigations of Ni-Fe bimetallic catalysts for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have focused on materials with micro-scale particle sizes, which severely restrict their catalytic activity.",A-site-deficiency facilitated in situ growth of bimetallic Ni-Fe nano-alloys: a novel coking-tolerant fuel cell anode catalyst,10.1039/c5nr02518d
2,4932,"In this study, we fabricated a Ni-and/or Fe-doped A-site-deficient LaSrCrO3 perovskite (A-LSC) bimetallic anode material on which the in situ exsolution of uniformly dispersed nano Ni, Fe and Ni-Fe alloy with an average particle size of 25 to 30 nm was facilitated by the introduction of A-site deficiency under a reducing atmosphere.",A-site-deficiency facilitated in situ growth of bimetallic Ni-Fe nano-alloys: a novel coking-tolerant fuel cell anode catalyst,10.1039/c5nr02518d
3,4932,The dopants were shown to significantly enhance the electrical conductivity of the material by many orders of magnitude.,A-site-deficiency facilitated in situ growth of bimetallic Ni-Fe nano-alloys: a novel coking-tolerant fuel cell anode catalyst,10.1039/c5nr02518d
4,4932,Further characterization of the bimetallic material showed that the addition of Fe changed the reduction behavior and increased the amount of oxygen vacancies in the material.,A-site-deficiency facilitated in situ growth of bimetallic Ni-Fe nano-alloys: a novel coking-tolerant fuel cell anode catalyst,10.1039/c5nr02518d
5,4932,Fuel cell performance tests demonstrated that the prepared bimetallic anode catalyst with a highly catalytically active nano Ni-Fe alloy promoted the electrochemical performance in 5000 ppm H2S-syngas and improved the carbon deposition resistance compared to a monometallic anode catalyst.,A-site-deficiency facilitated in situ growth of bimetallic Ni-Fe nano-alloys: a novel coking-tolerant fuel cell anode catalyst,10.1039/c5nr02518d
