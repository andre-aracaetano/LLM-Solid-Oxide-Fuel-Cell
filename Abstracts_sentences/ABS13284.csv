2,13284,"Changes in the lattice parameters of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta were observed depending on the temperature (T), electrode potential (E) and oxygen partial pressure (p(O2)) applied.","Oxygen Stoichiometry in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes under Applied Potential as a Function of Temperature and Oxygen Partial Pressure, Measured by Electrochemical in Situ High-Temperature XRD Method",10.1149/2.072309jes
3,13284,"At fixed T and p(O2), the cathode potential noticeably influences the crystallographic cell volume calculated, thus, i.e., the oxygen stoichiometry, explained by the partial reduction of electrochemically labile Co-ionic centers in La0.6Sr0.4Co3-delta (LSC), La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and mechanically mixed cathodes La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta + La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (50:50 wt%) under study.","Oxygen Stoichiometry in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes under Applied Potential as a Function of Temperature and Oxygen Partial Pressure, Measured by Electrochemical in Situ High-Temperature XRD Method",10.1149/2.072309jes
4,13284,Noticeably higher effect of cathode potential on the cell volume has been established at lower p(O2).,"Oxygen Stoichiometry in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes under Applied Potential as a Function of Temperature and Oxygen Partial Pressure, Measured by Electrochemical in Situ High-Temperature XRD Method",10.1149/2.072309jes
5,13284,"The dependence of crystallographic parameters obtained is in a good agreement with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data, indicating that the electrocatalytic activity of cathode decreases with the rise of Fe ions concentration in LSCF.","Oxygen Stoichiometry in La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodes under Applied Potential as a Function of Temperature and Oxygen Partial Pressure, Measured by Electrochemical in Situ High-Temperature XRD Method",10.1149/2.072309jes
