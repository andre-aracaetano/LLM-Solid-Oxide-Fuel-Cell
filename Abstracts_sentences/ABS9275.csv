1,9275,A mathematical model predicting the performance of planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has been developed.,Mathematical modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.055
2,9275,"The model is fuel flexible, which implies not only pure H-2 but also any reformate composition (H-2, H2O, CO, CO2 and CH4) can be used as a fuel.",Mathematical modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.055
3,9275,The important characteristic of this model is the consideration of reaction zone layers as finite volumes.,Mathematical modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.055
4,9275,"Reaction zone layers are thin layers in the vicinity of the electrolyte where electrochemical reactions takes place to produce electrons, oxide ions and water vapor (and/or carbon dioxide).",Mathematical modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.055
5,9275,"In addition, the effect of Knudsen diffusion is accounted in the porous electrode (backing) and reaction zone layers.",Mathematical modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.055
6,9275,The model can predict the performance of SOFC at various operating and design conditions.,Mathematical modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.055
7,9275,The predicted performance of SOFC is validated with the measured data found in the literature.,Mathematical modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.055
8,9275,An excellent agreement is obtained between the predicted performance and the experimental results.,Mathematical modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.055

10,9275,It is found that the anode concentration overpotential in an anode-supported SOFC is about four orders of magnitude smaller than the anode ohmic overpotential even at higher current densities.,Mathematical modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.055
11,9275,"Further, it is found that the single largest contributor to the total cell potential loss is ohmic overpotential and hence it needs to be minimized to enhance the cell performance.",Mathematical modeling of planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.05.055
