1,4173,"NiO/YSZ hollow fibers were fabricated via a combined phase inversion and sintering technique, where polyethersulfone (PESf) was employed as the polymeric binder, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMIP) as the solvent and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the additive, respectively.",A phase inversion/sintering process to fabricate nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia hollow fibers as the anode support for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.006
2,4173,"After reduction with hydrogen at 750 degrees C for 5 h, the porous Ni/YSZ hollow fibers with an asymmetric structure comprising of a microporous layer integrated with a finger-like Porous layer were obtained, which can be served as the anode support of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",A phase inversion/sintering process to fabricate nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia hollow fibers as the anode support for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.006
3,4173,"As the sintering temperature was increased from 1200 to 1400 degrees C, the mechanical strength and the electrical conductivity of the Ni/YSZ hollow fibers increased from 35 to 178 MPa and front 30 to 772 S cm(-1), respectively but the porosity decreased from 64.2% to 37.0%.",A phase inversion/sintering process to fabricate nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia hollow fibers as the anode support for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.006
