1,12535,A compact and adherent Co-Cu spinel coating on ferritic stainless steel was developed by electroplating a Co-Cu alloy layer followed by oxidation.,Preparation and performances of Cu-Co spinel coating on ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.133
2,12535,"The Co-Cu alloy was oxidized into a three-layer structure consisted of a thinner CuO outer layer, a middle thicker Cu0.92Co2.08O4 layer and an inner Co3O4 layer after an oxidation treatment of 2 h at 800 degrees C in air.",Preparation and performances of Cu-Co spinel coating on ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.133
3,12535,"The three-layer oxide structure was transformed into a double-layer scale with a (Co,Cr,Cu,Mn,Fe)(3)O-4 spinel outer layer and an inner Cr-rich oxide layer after an oxidation of 500 hat 800 degrees C in air.",Preparation and performances of Cu-Co spinel coating on ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.133
