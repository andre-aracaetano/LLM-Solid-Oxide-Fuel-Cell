5,16705,shows considerably low electrode polarization of 0.067 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C with activation energy 1.19 eV. Electrochemical performances evaluated using single cell configuration Ni-YSZ parallel to YSZ parallel to CoCGO/L20-C80/L50-C50/L80-C20/CF-1 shows power density as high as 2.03 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C at 0.7 V. Addition of composite interlayers increases the stability significantly and the voltage degradation is found negligible (0.9%) for first 300 hat a constant load of 0.5 A cm(-2) which is further increased to 2.9% for next 300 h. The cell stability is clinically correlated with layer wise elemental 'Sr' mapping in the applied quad interlayers.,Functionally graded doped lanthanum cobalt ferrite and ceria-based composite interlayers for advancing the performance stability in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.07.106
