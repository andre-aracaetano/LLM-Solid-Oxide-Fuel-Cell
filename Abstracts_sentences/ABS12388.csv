1,12388,The electrode behavior and microstructure of freshly prepared (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.9)MnO3 (LSM) electrodes were investigated under various polarization conditions.,"Effect of polarization on the electrode behavior and microstructure of (La,Sr)MnO3 electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10008-004-0515-z
2,12388,"The original, large agglomerates in freshly prepared LSM electrodes were broken down into sphere-shaped grains when exposed to cathodic or anodic current passage of 200 mA cm(-2) at 800 degreesC in air for 3 h. Microstructural changes under cathodic polarization could be related to the pronounced diffusion and migration of oxygen vacancies and Mn ions on the LSM surface and lattice expansion, while lattice shrinkage under oxidation conditions most likely contributes to the structural changes under anodic polarization.","Effect of polarization on the electrode behavior and microstructure of (La,Sr)MnO3 electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1007/s10008-004-0515-z
