1,16757,Ba(0.5)Sr(0.5)Co(0.8)Fe(0.2)O(3-delta) (BSCF) shows promising oxygen transport properties for the use as oxygen separation membranes and cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells.,BSCF epitaxial thin films: Electrical transport and oxygen surface exchange,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.005
2,16757,"In order to evaluate the electrical conductivity properties as well as surface exchange coefficients without the influence of grain boundaries present in polycrystalline bulk samples, high-quality epitaxial BSCF thin films on single crystal NdGaO(3) (110) (NGO) substrates were prepared for the first time.",BSCF epitaxial thin films: Electrical transport and oxygen surface exchange,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.005
3,16757,This was achieved by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using single-phase cubic targets sintered from powder prepared via the mixed oxide route.,BSCF epitaxial thin films: Electrical transport and oxygen surface exchange,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.005
4,16757,Structural and compositional properties of the thin films were verified by various X-ray diffraction techniques as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).,BSCF epitaxial thin films: Electrical transport and oxygen surface exchange,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.005
5,16757,"The electrical conductivity of the thin films was measured in dependence of temperature and compared to values obtained by measurements on polycrystalline bulk samples from the same powder as well as data from literature, showing different activation energies and higher general conductivity.",BSCF epitaxial thin films: Electrical transport and oxygen surface exchange,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.005
6,16757,"Dependence of the conductivity on oxygen partial pressure has also been studied, revealing a rather small variation and indicating a possible phase change beginning to occur at oxygen partial pressures below 10(-4) bar.",BSCF epitaxial thin films: Electrical transport and oxygen surface exchange,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.005
7,16757,"Additionally, the surface exchange coefficient k(Chem) of the purely surface exchange controlled samples was determined by a conductivity relaxation technique and yielded an activation energy of 93 kJ/mol.",BSCF epitaxial thin films: Electrical transport and oxygen surface exchange,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.03.005
