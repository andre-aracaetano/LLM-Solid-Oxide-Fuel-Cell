1,1912,"Size-induced structural differences in the oxygen-vacancy ordering between nano-and bulk Y-doped CeO2 (YDC) were measured using Y-89 MAS NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating a preferential association of the vacancies with Ce atoms in nano-YDC, which may imply pronounced size effects on the ionic conductivity of this solid electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells.",Direct spectroscopic observation of size-dependent vacancy distribution in Y-doped CeO2,10.1039/b810888a
