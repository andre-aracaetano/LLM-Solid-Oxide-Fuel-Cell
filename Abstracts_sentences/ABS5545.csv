2,5545,"A nickel wire is coiled around carbon-composite rods to fabricate the cells support, and dip coating technique is used to deposit the anode and the electrolyte from ceramic slurries containing NiO/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and YSZ, respectively.",Fabrication of Innovative Compliant Current Collector-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02676.x
3,5545,Pyrolizable materials are eliminated by heat treatment in air at 800 degrees C; the half-cell is then sintered in Ar at 1380 degrees C to avoid the oxidation of the Ni wire whose compliance allows to minimize stresses generated during heat treatments.,Fabrication of Innovative Compliant Current Collector-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02676.x
4,5545,The cathode consists of two layers made by lanthanum strontium manganateYSZ mixture and pure lanthanum strontium manganate co-sintered at 1150 degrees C. Electrochemical IV characterization of single microtubular solid oxide fuel cells points out great potentiality of the innovative architecture demonstrated by the maximum power output of similar to 200 similar to mW/cm2 at 800 degrees C under a wet H2 fuel flow.,Fabrication of Innovative Compliant Current Collector-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2011.02676.x
