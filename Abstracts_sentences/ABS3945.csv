1,3945,"To understand the corrosion behavior of solid oxide fuel cell interconnect under current effects, two ferritic alloys, Ebrite and SS430, were investigated with a 0.5 A/cm2 loading current.",Corrosion Behavior of Ebrite and SS430 in Coal Syngas with Loaded Current,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2010.02553.x
2,3945,"The samples were exposed to coal syngas (29.1CO+28.5H(2)+11.8 CO(2)+27 center dot 6H(2)O+2.1N(2)+0.01CH(4)) at 800 degrees C for 500 h. Surface and cross-section morphologies, chemical compositions, and conductivities of the oxide scales were studied.",Corrosion Behavior of Ebrite and SS430 in Coal Syngas with Loaded Current,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2010.02553.x
3,3945,It was found that the oxide films formed on the different sides of the sample have similar phases.,Corrosion Behavior of Ebrite and SS430 in Coal Syngas with Loaded Current,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2010.02553.x
4,3945,"However, oxide films' thicknesses and surface morphologies are significantly different.",Corrosion Behavior of Ebrite and SS430 in Coal Syngas with Loaded Current,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2010.02553.x
