1,18287,"The Young's modulus (E), hardness (H) and fracture toughness (K-IC) of various compositions of gadolinia doped-ceria (GDC, GdxCe1-xO2-x/2, 0.1 <= x <= 0.2) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ, Y0.08Zr0.92O1.96) electrolytes were investigated by nanoindentation.",Mechanical properties at the nanometer scale of GDC and YSZ used as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2009.12.036
2,18287,"All samples were produced by the sol-gel method, formed by uniaxial pressure and sintered at 1400 degrees C.",Mechanical properties at the nanometer scale of GDC and YSZ used as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2009.12.036
3,18287,"In order to determine the mechanical properties, a Berkovich diamond tip was employed at applied loads of 5, 10, 30, 100 and 500 mN. The results were interpreted by the Oliver-Pharr method and values of K-IC were determined using the method of Palmqvist cracks.",Mechanical properties at the nanometer scale of GDC and YSZ used as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2009.12.036
