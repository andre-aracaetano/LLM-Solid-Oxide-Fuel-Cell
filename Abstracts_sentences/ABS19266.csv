4,19266,"The addition of barium yields an increase in total conductivity in argon from 18 S cm(-1) for La0.25Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 to 26 S cm(-1) for La0.75Ba0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 at 900 degrees C. However, in H-2-3% H2O, the total conductivity decreases for all compositions and it decreases with barium substitution (0.9 S cm(-1) for La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 and 0.5 S cm(-1) for La0.75Ba0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 at 900 degrees C).",Ba-substituted LSCM anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.126
