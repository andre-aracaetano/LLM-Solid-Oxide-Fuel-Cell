3,8512,The PLD technique has been found suitable for growing a film of complex composition because of its good control of stoichiometry and thus for fabricating a GSCO film used as the cathode of the SOFC.,Fabrication of Gd0.5Sr0.5CoO3 film for SOFC cathode by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.10.010
4,8512,The GSCO film has been studied for porosity electrical conductivity and power density.,Fabrication of Gd0.5Sr0.5CoO3 film for SOFC cathode by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.10.010
5,8512,The GSCO film grown at a substrate temperature of 1100 K and oxygen gas pressure of 100 Pa has high electrical conductivity which is 820 S cm(-1) at 973 K with post annealing at a rather low temperature (1000 K).,Fabrication of Gd0.5Sr0.5CoO3 film for SOFC cathode by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.10.010
