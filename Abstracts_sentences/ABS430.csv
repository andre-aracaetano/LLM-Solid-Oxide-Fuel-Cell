3,430,It is shown that Ti3AlC2 and Ti3AlC2 -Nb materials with a porosity of 1% are comparable with Crofer JDA alloy by electric conductivity but possess higher strength and heat resistance than this alloy for lower density.,Influence of Technological Media on the Mechanical and Physical Properties of Materials for Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11003-015-9822-z
4,430,These results enable us to recommend the investigated materials for manufacturing the interconnects of solid-oxide fuel cells.,Influence of Technological Media on the Mechanical and Physical Properties of Materials for Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11003-015-9822-z
