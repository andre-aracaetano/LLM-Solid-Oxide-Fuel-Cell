1,8689,"In this study, suspension plasma spraying (SPS) was applied to deposit double perovskite Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.6O6-delta (SFM) which can be used as both cathode and anode for solid oxide fuel cells.",Suspension Plasma Sprayed Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.6O6-δ Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11666-016-0478-5
2,8689,"The effects of SFM concentration on the electrode phase composition, microstructure, and catalytic performance were investigated.",Suspension Plasma Sprayed Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.6O6-δ Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11666-016-0478-5
3,8689,The electrodes showed a dense structure when it was deposited at a concentration of 0.05 mol/L.,Suspension Plasma Sprayed Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.6O6-δ Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11666-016-0478-5
4,8689,The cathode performance was limited by the limited three-phase boundaries and poor gas diffusion.,Suspension Plasma Sprayed Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.6O6-δ Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11666-016-0478-5
5,8689,"At 750 A degrees C, cathode polarization (R (pc)) was 0.19 Omega cm(2).",Suspension Plasma Sprayed Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.6O6-δ Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11666-016-0478-5
6,8689,"When the SFM concentration increased to 0.075 mol/L, the deposits revealed a porous microstructure with well-bonded fine particles.",Suspension Plasma Sprayed Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.6O6-δ Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11666-016-0478-5
7,8689,"As a result, the R-pc decreased significantly to 0.078 Omega cm(2) at 750 A degrees C. However, when the SFM concentration was further increased to 0.1 mol/L, the R (pc) increased owing to the limited interface bonding between the non-molten particles.",Suspension Plasma Sprayed Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.6O6-δ Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11666-016-0478-5
8,8689,"As a result, it was found that the SFM suspension concentration should be optimized to achieve a highly active SFM by SPS process.",Suspension Plasma Sprayed Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.6O6-δ Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11666-016-0478-5
9,8689,"Moreover, when the optimized deposit was employed as an anode and tested in a hydrogen atmosphere, it showed anode polarization resistance (R-pa) of 1.5 Omega cm(2) at 750 A degrees C.",Suspension Plasma Sprayed Sr2Fe1.4Mo0.6O6-δ Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11666-016-0478-5
