1,19463,The potential of biogas as a source of H-2 for the operation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) has received much attention in recent years.,Study on biochar as desulfurizer for SOFC application,10.1002/fuce.202100025
2,19463,"However, in order to achieve commercial-level stability of a biogas-fueled SOFC system, impurities in biogas such as H2S, which poisons the reforming catalyst and anode material, must be eliminated.",Study on biochar as desulfurizer for SOFC application,10.1002/fuce.202100025
3,19463,"In this study, an environmentally-friendly biogas purification process using biochar was explored.",Study on biochar as desulfurizer for SOFC application,10.1002/fuce.202100025
4,19463,"Bamboo (BB) and rice husk (RH) were chosen as starting materials and heat-treated at 500 degrees C for 120 min in an O-2-free atmosphere to produce BB- and RH-derived biochars, BB-BC and RH-BC, respectively, then treated with steam or ammonia.",Study on biochar as desulfurizer for SOFC application,10.1002/fuce.202100025
5,19463,"H2S adsorption tests were performed for these biochar samples, and breakthrough capacity (ACP(H2S(0))) and total H2S adsorption capacity (ACP(H2S)) were evaluated.",Study on biochar as desulfurizer for SOFC application,10.1002/fuce.202100025
6,19463,"Steam treatment effectively increased ACP(H2S(0)) and ACP(H2S) for BB-BC, however, intense steam treatment had a negative effect, especially for RH-BC because of the silica exposed on the surface.",Study on biochar as desulfurizer for SOFC application,10.1002/fuce.202100025
7,19463,Ammonia treatment of biochar to form pyridinic N sites on the carbon surface was considerably effective to enhance the performance of a biochar as desulfurizer.,Study on biochar as desulfurizer for SOFC application,10.1002/fuce.202100025
8,19463,"By the ammonia treatment of RH-BC at 900 degrees C, ACP(H2S(0)) and ACP(H2S) increased by 2 and 30 times, respectively.",Study on biochar as desulfurizer for SOFC application,10.1002/fuce.202100025
