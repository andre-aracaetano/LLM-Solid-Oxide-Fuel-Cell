1,2859,"Integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC) technology combining coal gasification and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is believed to be the only viable solution to achieving U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s performance goal for next generation coal-based power plants, producing electricity at 60% efficiency (coal HHV-AC) while capturing more than 90% of the evolved CO(2).",Design of highly efficient coal-based integrated gasification fuel cell power plants,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.045
2,2859,Achieving this goal is challenging even with high performance SOFCs: design concepts published to date have not demonstrated this performance goal.,Design of highly efficient coal-based integrated gasification fuel cell power plants,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.045
3,2859,"In this work an IGFC system concept consisting of catalytic hydro-gasification, proven low-temperature gas cleaning and hybrid fuel cell-gas turbine power block (with SOFC operating at about 10 bar) is introduced.",Design of highly efficient coal-based integrated gasification fuel cell power plants,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.045
4,2859,"The system is demonstrating an electricity efficiency greater than 60% (coal HHV basis), with more than 90% of the carbon present in the syngas separated as CO(2) amenable to sequestration.",Design of highly efficient coal-based integrated gasification fuel cell power plants,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.045
5,2859,"A unique characteristic of the system is recycling de-carbonized, humidified anode exhaust back to the catalytic hydro-gasifier for improved energy integration.",Design of highly efficient coal-based integrated gasification fuel cell power plants,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.045
6,2859,"Alternative designs where: (1) anode exhaust is recycled directly back to SOFC stacks, (2) SOFC stack operating pressure is reduced to near atmospheric and (3) methanation reactor in the reactor/expander topping cycle is removed, have also been investigated and the system design and performance differences are discussed.",Design of highly efficient coal-based integrated gasification fuel cell power plants,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.045
