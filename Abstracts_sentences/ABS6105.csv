1,6105,"An alternating constant-current (CC)/constant-voltage (CV) discharge for the optimal operation mode of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) inside stack is carried out, and the degradation of SOFCs is discussed.",Degradation behavior under alternating constant-current/constant-voltage discharge for flat-tube solid oxide fuel cells inside stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.253
2,6105,The SOFCs are operated alternately in CC/CV mode for 985 h at 750 degrees C.,Degradation behavior under alternating constant-current/constant-voltage discharge for flat-tube solid oxide fuel cells inside stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.253
3,6105,The results show that the degradation rate of SOFCs first decreases and then increases in the CC/CV alternating operation mode.,Degradation behavior under alternating constant-current/constant-voltage discharge for flat-tube solid oxide fuel cells inside stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.253
4,6105,"And the lowest degradation rate is 3.64%/100 h in the CV operation mode at similar to 0.85 V, which is about one order of magnitude higher than the average degradation rate (0.36%/100 h) in the corresponding CC operation mode.",Degradation behavior under alternating constant-current/constant-voltage discharge for flat-tube solid oxide fuel cells inside stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.253
5,6105,"The EIS analysis indicates that the ohmic resistance increases and the polarization resistance decreases after the CV operation mode, while the impedance change after CC discharge shows the opposite trend.",Degradation behavior under alternating constant-current/constant-voltage discharge for flat-tube solid oxide fuel cells inside stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.253
