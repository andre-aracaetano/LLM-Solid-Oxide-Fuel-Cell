1,10635,A quick and simple method was developed for the study of the interaction between Fe-Cr metallic interconnect and Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM)-materials using the LSM Powders without the high temperature sintering step of the electrode coating.,A fast method for the investigation of the interaction between metallic interconnect and Sr-doped LaMnO3 of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.mseb.2005.01.008
2,10635,The deposition of Cr species on the LSM powder/Y2O3-ZrO2 (YSZ) electrolyte interface has been found to be significantly dependent on the flow field of the metallic interconnect.,A fast method for the investigation of the interaction between metallic interconnect and Sr-doped LaMnO3 of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.mseb.2005.01.008
3,10635,The Cr deposition was far more significant at the LSM/YSZ interface areas under the rib of the interconnect as compared to that under the channel of the interconnect.,A fast method for the investigation of the interaction between metallic interconnect and Sr-doped LaMnO3 of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.mseb.2005.01.008
4,10635,The electrochemical behavior for the O-2 reduction and Cr deposition on the LSM powders are very similar to that observed for the reaction on the LSM electrode coatings pre-sintered at 1150 degrees C. The result demonstrates the feasibility of the direct investigation of the Cr deposition process on the oxide powders.,A fast method for the investigation of the interaction between metallic interconnect and Sr-doped LaMnO3 of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.mseb.2005.01.008
