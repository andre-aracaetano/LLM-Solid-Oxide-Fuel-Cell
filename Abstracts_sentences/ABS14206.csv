2,14206,It was aimed to discuss the influence of B-site Ni substitution on structure and electrochemical properties of Pr0.5Ba0.5FeO3-delta.,Novel cobalt and strontium-free perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5Fe1-xNixO3-δ (x=0 and 0.2) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-021-04148-0
3,14206,The results indicated that PBF-based oxides were both cubic perovskite structure.,Novel cobalt and strontium-free perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5Fe1-xNixO3-δ (x=0 and 0.2) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-021-04148-0
4,14206,"Ni atoms were successfully doped into the B sites of PBF, resulting in lattice shrinkage.",Novel cobalt and strontium-free perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5Fe1-xNixO3-δ (x=0 and 0.2) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-021-04148-0
5,14206,Ni doping could enhance the oxygen reduction activity by increasing the surface oxygen content and the release of lattice oxygen to increase oxygen vacancies.,Novel cobalt and strontium-free perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5Fe1-xNixO3-δ (x=0 and 0.2) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-021-04148-0
6,14206,"At 700 degrees C, the cathodic polarization resistance of PBFN (0.0726 omega center dot cm(2)) was lower than PBF (0.122 omega center dot cm(2)), and the maximum power density (PPD) of PBFN (528.79 mW center dot cm(-2)) was higher than PBF (259.65 mW center dot cm(-2)).",Novel cobalt and strontium-free perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5Fe1-xNixO3-δ (x=0 and 0.2) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-021-04148-0
