1,6889,"Effect of zinc (Zn) dopant on the conductivity, catalytic activity and the interface matching of La(0.6)Sr(0.4)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) (LSCF) cathode materials with 8YSZ electrolyte were investigated for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell's (IT-SOFC).",Zn Doped LSCF as a Novel Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1080/10584587.2010.495670
2,6889,XRD patterns of powders showed pure perovskite phase after being calcined at 1100 degrees C for 2 h. Substitution of Zn at B-site decreased the TEC(13.7x10(-6) K(-1)) and polarization resistance (0.15 Omega-cm(2)).,Zn Doped LSCF as a Novel Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1080/10584587.2010.495670
3,6889,"Higher exchange current density of 330mA/cm(2) was achieved in air, suggesting that LSCZF system of compounds provide high cathodic reaction zoned junctions and numerous diffusing pathways for oxygen ions to access triple phase boundary.",Zn Doped LSCF as a Novel Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1080/10584587.2010.495670
4,6889,"The performance of La(0.6)Sr(0.4)Co(0.04)Zn(0.16)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta), such as thermal expansion coefficient, polarization resistance, catalysis activation are superior to those of LSCF and are sufficient for application as cathode material for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).",Zn Doped LSCF as a Novel Cathode Material for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1080/10584587.2010.495670
