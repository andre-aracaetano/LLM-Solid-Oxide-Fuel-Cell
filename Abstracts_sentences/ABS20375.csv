1,20375,A methodology based on FIB-tomography and image analysis (IA) is proposed which allows quantification of all relevant morphological features that are necessary to predict effective transport properties in porous SOFC electrodes.,"Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Influence of tortuosity, constriction and percolation factors on the effective transport properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.047
2,20375,"These morphological features are constrictivity, tortuosity, percolation factor and phase volume fraction.","Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Influence of tortuosity, constriction and percolation factors on the effective transport properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.047
3,20375,An M-factor can then be calculated which represents the ratio of effective over intrinsic conductivities.,"Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Influence of tortuosity, constriction and percolation factors on the effective transport properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.047
4,20375,The methodology is used to describe effects of microstructure degradation in Ni-YSZ anodes which are caused by redox cycling at 950 degrees C.,"Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Influence of tortuosity, constriction and percolation factors on the effective transport properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.047
5,20375,The so calculated M-factors predict that because of redox cycling the effective electronic conductivity of nickel decreases from 3 to 1.2% which is mainly due to changes of percolation and constriction factors.,"Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Influence of tortuosity, constriction and percolation factors on the effective transport properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.047
6,20375,Based on these results the effective electrical conductivity of nickel is predicted to be 685 S/cm before redox and 243 S/cm after 8 redox cycles.,"Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Influence of tortuosity, constriction and percolation factors on the effective transport properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.047
7,20375,"The predictions fit well with the experimental measurements that reveal 600 S/cm before and 200 S/cm after redox cycling at 950 degrees C. For YSZ the M-factors obtained with 3D-analysis predict that the degradation causes a drop of the effective ionic conductivity from 7 to 0.6%, which is due to a change of the bottleneck dimensions.","Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Influence of tortuosity, constriction and percolation factors on the effective transport properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.047
8,20375,This finding contradicts the frequent interpretation of YSZ as a 'rigid backbone' that is not affected by microstructure degradation.,"Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Influence of tortuosity, constriction and percolation factors on the effective transport properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.047
9,20375,"Finally, the effective bulk gas diffusivity increases from 2 to 11% due to an increase of porosity associated with swelling of the anode.","Redox cycling of Ni-YSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells: Influence of tortuosity, constriction and percolation factors on the effective transport properties",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.047
