1,14896,"For the investigation of the reactivity of alternative solid oxide cell air electrode materials with forsterite (Mg2SiO4), a magnesium silicate doped with Zn and Ca, five different phase materials were chosen: two Ruddlesden-Popper phase materials: La4Ni3O10 (L4N3) and La3Ni2O7 (L3N2) and three titanium-based perovskite materials: SrTiO3 (STO), SrTi0.75Fe0.25O3 (STF25) and CaTi0.9Fe0.1O3 (CTF).",Novel air-electrode materials for low-cost inert-supported solid oxide cells: investigation of materials compatibility during co-sintering,10.1007/s10853-023-08862-0
2,14896,"Forsterite was chosen as a support material for the fuel cell, as it is abundant and therefore relatively inexpensive.",Novel air-electrode materials for low-cost inert-supported solid oxide cells: investigation of materials compatibility during co-sintering,10.1007/s10853-023-08862-0
3,14896,"For the investigation of their reactivity, different types of samples were prepared: mixed pellets, double-layered pellets and screen-printed electrode inks on forsterite green substrates, which were subsequently co-sintered at T = 1300 & DEG;C. These samples and their cross sections were then studied using XRD, SEM, EDS and TEM lamella point analysis.",Novel air-electrode materials for low-cost inert-supported solid oxide cells: investigation of materials compatibility during co-sintering,10.1007/s10853-023-08862-0
4,14896,"Consequently, the impedance spectra were acquired to determine their electro-catalytic performance.",Novel air-electrode materials for low-cost inert-supported solid oxide cells: investigation of materials compatibility during co-sintering,10.1007/s10853-023-08862-0
5,14896,"The two Ruddlesden-Popper phase materials L4N3 and L3N2 are of high interest due to their thermodynamic stability and high electro-catalytic activity, resulting in a very low polarization resistance.",Novel air-electrode materials for low-cost inert-supported solid oxide cells: investigation of materials compatibility during co-sintering,10.1007/s10853-023-08862-0
6,14896,"However, this polarization resistance is increased when mixing with forsterite material.",Novel air-electrode materials for low-cost inert-supported solid oxide cells: investigation of materials compatibility during co-sintering,10.1007/s10853-023-08862-0
7,14896,"In case of the three titanium-based perovskites, the electro-catalytic activity is of less interest due to high polarization resistances.",Novel air-electrode materials for low-cost inert-supported solid oxide cells: investigation of materials compatibility during co-sintering,10.1007/s10853-023-08862-0
