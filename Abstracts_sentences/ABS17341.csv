3,17341,"The Ni (8 vol %) dispersed SDC cathode exhibited very high performance at a water vapor pressure >0.4 atm at 900 degrees C. An SOEC, comprised of Ni-dispersed SDC cathode, La(Sr) CoO3 anode with SDC interlayer, and YSZ electrolyte, exhibited fairly high performance; IR-free cell voltage = 1.20 V at 0.50 A cm(-2) and 900 degrees C under the atmosphere of H-2",High-performance electrode for steam electrolysis mixed conducting ceria-based cathode with highly-dispersed Ni electrocatalysts,10.1149/1.1819864
