5,3538,The double layer undergoes pronounced relaxations when the interfaces are under anodic biases ranging from 0 to 150 mV. The results indicate that 70-80% of the oxygen vacancies are immobilized in the Helmholtz-Perrin layer.,Double layer structure in solid oxide fuel cell anode/electrolyte interfaces: A Monte Carlo study,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.05.004
