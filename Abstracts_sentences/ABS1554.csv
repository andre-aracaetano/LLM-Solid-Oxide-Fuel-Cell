2,1554,The microstructures of the cathodes are gradually changed from a finer LSCF layer with smaller grains (to increase the number of active sites for oxygen reduction) to a coarser LSCF layer with larger grains and higher porosity (for efficient current collection and fast gas transportation).,Fabrication and characterization of functionally-graded LSCF cathodes by tape casting,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.10.048
