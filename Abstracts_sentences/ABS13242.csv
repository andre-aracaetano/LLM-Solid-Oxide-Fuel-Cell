1,13242,"For the sake of improving the electrochemical activity and chromium tolerance of the K2NiF4-type oxide, La2NiO4+delta (LNO), with nonnucleation agents like Mn and Sr elements, the electrochemical performance and degradation were comparatively studied at two cathodes La2Ni0.9Fe0.1O4+delta (LNF) and LNF-40wt%Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (LNF-GDC) on the GDC electrolyte, where 5wt%Cr2O3 incorporation provides Cr-containing atmosphere.",Enhanced Electrochemical Activity and Chromium Tolerance of the Nucleation-Agent-Free La2Ni0.9Fe0.1O4+δ Cathode by Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Incorporation,10.1007/s13391-018-0045-y
2,13242,"Compared with non-doped LNO, LNF shows a higher interstitial oxygen concentration (delta = 0.298) and a lower electrical conductivity, where bivalent Ni ion, , and trivalent Ni ion, , and trivalent Fe ion on Ni-site, , were observed from the XPS measurements.",Enhanced Electrochemical Activity and Chromium Tolerance of the Nucleation-Agent-Free La2Ni0.9Fe0.1O4+δ Cathode by Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Incorporation,10.1007/s13391-018-0045-y
3,13242,"LNF-GDC shows greatly reduced interfacial polarization resistances (Rp), which are only half of those of LNF, indicating a better electrochemical performance.",Enhanced Electrochemical Activity and Chromium Tolerance of the Nucleation-Agent-Free La2Ni0.9Fe0.1O4+δ Cathode by Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Incorporation,10.1007/s13391-018-0045-y
4,13242,"More importantly, no significant degradation of LNF-GDC in performance has been observed under exposure of Cr-containing atmosphere at 700 A degrees C for 350 h, while Rp of LNF increased by nearly 20%, suggesting LNF by GDC incorporation can enhance the electrochemical performance as well as chromium tolerance for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Enhanced Electrochemical Activity and Chromium Tolerance of the Nucleation-Agent-Free La2Ni0.9Fe0.1O4+δ Cathode by Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 Incorporation,10.1007/s13391-018-0045-y
