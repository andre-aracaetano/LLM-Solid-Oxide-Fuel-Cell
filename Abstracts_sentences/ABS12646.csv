1,12646,"A key need for the advancement of high-performance solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is to develop viable cathode materials with high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at reduced operating temperatures below 700 degrees C. Here, we report a Ni-substituted perovskite composition Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.7Fe0.2Ni0.1O3- (BSCFN) as a potential cathode material focusing on enhancing the electrochemical performance.",Nickel-substituted Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-: a highly active perovskite oxygen electrode for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta02548k
2,12646,"Considerable attention is paid to the research of physicochemical properties primarily by crystal structure and oxygen transport measurements, with the aim to build up the correlation with the ORR activity.",Nickel-substituted Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-: a highly active perovskite oxygen electrode for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta02548k
3,12646,"With the BSCFN cathode, a symmetrical cell achieves a very low area-specific polarization resistance of only approximate to 0.018 cm(2) and a single cell delivers a maximum power density as high as approximate to 1.8 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C. Such a large electrode performance improvement is attributed to the sustained cubic-symmetry perovskite structure and fast oxygen kinetics promoted by Ni substitution.",Nickel-substituted Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-: a highly active perovskite oxygen electrode for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c9ta02548k
