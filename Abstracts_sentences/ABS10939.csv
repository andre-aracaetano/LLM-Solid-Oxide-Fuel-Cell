2,10939,LST-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (GDC) anodes of various composition ratios were evaluated in order to optimize the performance of composite anode on LaGaO3-based solid oxide fuel cell.,LST-GDC composite anode on LaGaO3-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.06.048
3,10939,Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) indicated that the addition of GDC into LST significantly reduces the anode polarization thus leading to an increased performance.,LST-GDC composite anode on LaGaO3-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.06.048
4,10939,"LST30-GDC70 (LST:GDC = 30:70 wt.%) composite anode showed the lowest polarization-resistance value at 800 degrees C. With further Ni impregnation into anode, the maximum power density of the single cell was similar to 0.3 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C in air/97% H-2 + 3% H2O gas.",LST-GDC composite anode on LaGaO3-based solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.06.048
