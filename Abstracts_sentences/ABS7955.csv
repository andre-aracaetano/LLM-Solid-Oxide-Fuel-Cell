1,7955,Finding suitable cathode materials is the key to developing intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,A novel cathode material Pr0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-δ for intermediate temperate solid oxide fuel cell,10.1088/2053-1591/aae253
2,7955,"In this work, a novel Pr0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-delta (PSCF) is prepared by EDTA-citric acid-nitrate combustion (EDTA: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid).",A novel cathode material Pr0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-δ for intermediate temperate solid oxide fuel cell,10.1088/2053-1591/aae253
3,7955,"Analysis by thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry techniques (TG-DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrate that a structure composed by a single perovskite is obtained upon sintering in air at 950 degrees C. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were applied to analyze the physical characteristics of the cathode materials.",A novel cathode material Pr0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-δ for intermediate temperate solid oxide fuel cell,10.1088/2053-1591/aae253
4,7955,"In addition, PSCF-GDC as a cathode and the performances of the complete cell (NiO-GDC/GDC/PSCF-GDC) at 600 degrees C - 700 degrees C are also tested when 99% H-2 and ambient air were fed into anode and cathode, respectively.",A novel cathode material Pr0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-δ for intermediate temperate solid oxide fuel cell,10.1088/2053-1591/aae253
5,7955,The maximum power density obtained was 64.72 mW cm(-2) and the maximum OCV was 0.89 V under operating conditions at 700 degrees,A novel cathode material Pr0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-δ for intermediate temperate solid oxide fuel cell,10.1088/2053-1591/aae253
6,7955,"C. The EIS demonstrated that the polarization resistance was the main loss, and the area-specific resistance was 3.4 Omega cm(-2) at 700 degrees C.",A novel cathode material Pr0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-δ for intermediate temperate solid oxide fuel cell,10.1088/2053-1591/aae253
