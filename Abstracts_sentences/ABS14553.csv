2,14553,Superoxide (O-2) species was detected with appearance of an IR peak at wavenumber about 1124 cm(-1).,FTIR study of the oxygen reduction reactions on Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3,10.1142/S0218625X07009712
3,14553,"Moreover, we interpreted for the first time that there would be a close relationship between the baseline shift of IR spectra and the oxygen vacancy concentration (OVC) of the samples.",FTIR study of the oxygen reduction reactions on Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3,10.1142/S0218625X07009712
4,14553,"The downward baseline shift of IR spectra is due to the decrease of OVC in the bulk, while, the increase of the OVC in the bulk would cause the upward baseline shift.",FTIR study of the oxygen reduction reactions on Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3,10.1142/S0218625X07009712
