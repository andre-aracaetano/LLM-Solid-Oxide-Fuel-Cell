1,15849,The carbon deposition behavior on nickel particles was observed within the temperature range from 400 to 800A degrees C in a pure methane atmosphere.,"Topography, structure, and formation kinetic mechanism of carbon deposited onto nickel in the temperature range from 400 to 850A°C",10.1007/s12613-017-1439-9
2,15849,"The topography, properties, and molecular structure of the deposited carbon were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) technology, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy.","Topography, structure, and formation kinetic mechanism of carbon deposited onto nickel in the temperature range from 400 to 850A°C",10.1007/s12613-017-1439-9
3,15849,"The deposited carbon is present in the form of a film at 400-450A degrees C, as fibers at 500-600A degrees C, and as particles at 650-800A degrees C.","Topography, structure, and formation kinetic mechanism of carbon deposited onto nickel in the temperature range from 400 to 850A°C",10.1007/s12613-017-1439-9
4,15849,"In addition, the structure of the deposited carbon becomes more ordered at higher temperatures because both the TPO peak temperature of deposited carbon and the Raman shift of the G band increase with the increase in experimental temperature, whereas the intensity ratio between the D bands and the G band decreases.","Topography, structure, and formation kinetic mechanism of carbon deposited onto nickel in the temperature range from 400 to 850A°C",10.1007/s12613-017-1439-9
5,15849,An interesting observation is that the carbon deposition rate is suppressed in the medium-temperature range (M-T range) and the corresponding kinetic mechanism changes.,"Topography, structure, and formation kinetic mechanism of carbon deposited onto nickel in the temperature range from 400 to 850A°C",10.1007/s12613-017-1439-9
6,15849,"Correspondingly, the FWHM of the G and D1 bands in the Raman spectrum reaches a maximum and the intensities of the D2, D3, and D4 bands decrease to low limits in the M-T range.","Topography, structure, and formation kinetic mechanism of carbon deposited onto nickel in the temperature range from 400 to 850A°C",10.1007/s12613-017-1439-9
7,15849,These results indicate that carbon structure parameters exhibit two different tendencies with respect to varying temperature.,"Topography, structure, and formation kinetic mechanism of carbon deposited onto nickel in the temperature range from 400 to 850A°C",10.1007/s12613-017-1439-9
8,15849,Both of the two group parameters change dramatically as a peak function with increasing reaction temperature within the M-T range.,"Topography, structure, and formation kinetic mechanism of carbon deposited onto nickel in the temperature range from 400 to 850A°C",10.1007/s12613-017-1439-9
