1,20464,"In this work, a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF113) perovskite core coated by Ruddlesden-Popper phase La0.6Sr1.4Co0.2Fe0.8O4-delta (LSCF214) thin film to form a LSCF113-214 core-shell structure cathode is synthesized by Sr2+ solution coating method.",A novel core-shell LSCF perovskite structured electrocatalyst with local hetero-interface for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.130
2,20464,"Its phase composition, lattice structure, electrochemical catalytic activity and full cell performance are investigated.",A novel core-shell LSCF perovskite structured electrocatalyst with local hetero-interface for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.130
3,20464,The electrocatalytic activity and stability of the LSCF113 cathode are enhanced by in situ formation of LSCF214 on the LSCF113 surface.,A novel core-shell LSCF perovskite structured electrocatalyst with local hetero-interface for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.130
4,20464,The electrochemical performance enhancement is due to the higher catalytic activity of the LSCF214 Ruddlesden-Popper phase and the mismatch of the lattice parameters between the LSCF214 and LSCF113 regions leading to more favorable oxygen vacancy formation and oxygen molecule adsorption.,A novel core-shell LSCF perovskite structured electrocatalyst with local hetero-interface for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.130
5,20464,The electrochemical impedance spectrum indicates that LSCF113-214 electrode has a lower polarization resistance (0.17 Omega cm(2)) than the LSCF113 electrode (0.32 Omega cm(2)) at 650 degrees C.,A novel core-shell LSCF perovskite structured electrocatalyst with local hetero-interface for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.130
6,20464,"And the long term stability of LSCF113-214 is evaluated with no structure evolution in 400 h test at 600 degrees C. An anode-supported single cell with doped ceria as the electrolyte is used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of LSCF113-214, which shows an open circuit voltage of 0.81 V and a maximum power density of 0.57 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C.
