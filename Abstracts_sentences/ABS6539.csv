1,6539,Samples of 8 mol% Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (8YSZ) doped with Fe were prepared and sintered at 1350 degrees C in air or argon atmosphere.,Detection of phases in Fe-doped YSZ by XRD and Raman spectroscopy,10.1111/ijac.13524
2,6539,"The sintered samples were characterized by SEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy.",Detection of phases in Fe-doped YSZ by XRD and Raman spectroscopy,10.1111/ijac.13524
3,6539,Raman spectroscopy and XRD were found to complement each other in phase identification; all the sintered samples were shown to possess tetragonal phase (t) whose axial ratio (c/a) is equal to 1 in the cubic matrix.,Detection of phases in Fe-doped YSZ by XRD and Raman spectroscopy,10.1111/ijac.13524
4,6539,"The Raman peak at 616 cm(-1), in general, was seen to broaden with increase in Fe concentration for both sintering atmospheres.",Detection of phases in Fe-doped YSZ by XRD and Raman spectroscopy,10.1111/ijac.13524
