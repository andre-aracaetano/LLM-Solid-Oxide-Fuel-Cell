1,18671,A transitional layer is introduced between the La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (LSCM-GDC) cathode and the YSZ (8 mol% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2) electrolyte by a calcining-stripping-calcining method to improve the cell performance for CO2 electroreduction.,CO2 electroreduction enhanced by transitional layer at cathode/electrolyte interface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227743
2,18671,The effects of second calcination temperature and the LSCM/GDC weight ratio in the transitional layer are investigated to understand the role of the transitional layer.,CO2 electroreduction enhanced by transitional layer at cathode/electrolyte interface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227743
