1,19437,SmCoO3 is a perovskite material that has gained attention as a potential substitute for La1-xSrxMnO3-d as a solid oxide fuel cell cathode.,"A DFT plus U study of the structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of cubic and orthorhombic SmCoO3",10.1063/1.4971186
2,19437,"However, a number of properties have remained unknown due to the complexity of the material.","A DFT plus U study of the structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of cubic and orthorhombic SmCoO3",10.1063/1.4971186
3,19437,"For example, we know from experimental evidence that this perovskite exists in two different crystal structures, cubic and orthorhombic, and that the cobalt ion changes its spin state at high temperatures, leading to a semiconductor-to-metal transition.","A DFT plus U study of the structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of cubic and orthorhombic SmCoO3",10.1063/1.4971186
4,19437,"However, little is known about the precise magnetic structure that causes the metallic behavior or the spin state of the Co centers at high temperature.","A DFT plus U study of the structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of cubic and orthorhombic SmCoO3",10.1063/1.4971186
5,19437,"Here, we therefore present a systematic DFT+U study of the magnetic properties of SmCoO3 in order to determine what magnetic ordering is the one exhibited by the metallic phase at different temperatures.","A DFT plus U study of the structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of cubic and orthorhombic SmCoO3",10.1063/1.4971186
6,19437,"Similarly, mechanical properties are difficult to measure experimentally, which is why there is a lack of data for the two different phases of SmCoO3.","A DFT plus U study of the structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of cubic and orthorhombic SmCoO3",10.1063/1.4971186
7,19437,"Taking advantage of our DFT calculations, we have determined the mechanical properties from our calculated elastic constants, finding that both polymorphs exhibit similar ductility and brittleness, but that the cubic structure is harder than the orthorhombic phase.","A DFT plus U study of the structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of cubic and orthorhombic SmCoO3",10.1063/1.4971186
