1,18389,Heat and mass transfer effects in evaporating solution droplets (20-40 mu m in diameter) containing dissolved hexahydrated cerium nitrate in a stationary rf Ar-O-2 thermal plasma were investigated using a model.,"Transient heat, mass and momentum transfer of an evaporating stationary droplet containing dissolved cerium nitrate in a rf thermal argon-oxygen plasma under reduced pressure",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2006.06.023
2,18389,The evaporation occurred under reduced pressure.,"Transient heat, mass and momentum transfer of an evaporating stationary droplet containing dissolved cerium nitrate in a rf thermal argon-oxygen plasma under reduced pressure",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2006.06.023
3,18389,"The impact of different plasma operating parameters on temperature and dissolved solid content profiles was studied: surrounding plasma temperature, initial salt content and droplet size, plasma gas composition, and system pressure.","Transient heat, mass and momentum transfer of an evaporating stationary droplet containing dissolved cerium nitrate in a rf thermal argon-oxygen plasma under reduced pressure",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2006.06.023
4,18389,Temperature and composition dependant thermophysical properties were used.,"Transient heat, mass and momentum transfer of an evaporating stationary droplet containing dissolved cerium nitrate in a rf thermal argon-oxygen plasma under reduced pressure",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2006.06.023
5,18389,The model was solved in a moving frame (ALE method) and considered Stefan flow.,"Transient heat, mass and momentum transfer of an evaporating stationary droplet containing dissolved cerium nitrate in a rf thermal argon-oxygen plasma under reduced pressure",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2006.06.023
6,18389,The results indicate that a salt supersaturation limit is reached at the droplet surface which leads to salt precipitation and formation of a crust in all cases analyzed.,"Transient heat, mass and momentum transfer of an evaporating stationary droplet containing dissolved cerium nitrate in a rf thermal argon-oxygen plasma under reduced pressure",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2006.06.023
7,18389,"This is favored by higher plasma temperatures, lower pressures, oxygen-rich plasma and higher salt content.","Transient heat, mass and momentum transfer of an evaporating stationary droplet containing dissolved cerium nitrate in a rf thermal argon-oxygen plasma under reduced pressure",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2006.06.023
