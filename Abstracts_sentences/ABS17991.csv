1,17991,Atomic scale simulations have been used to investigate the impact of co-doping (yttrium and gadolinium) and strain on oxygen diffusion and binding of dopant-vacancy clusters in ceria.,Effect of strain on the oxygen diffusion in yttria and gadolinia co-doped ceria,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.09.015
2,17991,Doped ceria in its relaxed or strained form is used as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell applications.,Effect of strain on the oxygen diffusion in yttria and gadolinia co-doped ceria,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.09.015
3,17991,For unstrained co-doped ceria we calculate an activation energy for migration of 0.70-0.75 eV in the temperature range of 973-1873 K. Co-doping with yttrium and gadolinium only affected oxide ion diffusion to a small degree when compared to single doping.,Effect of strain on the oxygen diffusion in yttria and gadolinia co-doped ceria,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.09.015
4,17991,The diffusion coefficient was substantially increased by tensile strain while compressive strain caused a decrease.,Effect of strain on the oxygen diffusion in yttria and gadolinia co-doped ceria,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.09.015
5,17991,To gain further insight why tensile strain leads to higher diffusivity static simulations were employed.,Effect of strain on the oxygen diffusion in yttria and gadolinia co-doped ceria,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.09.015
6,17991,It is calculated that tensile strain reduces the binding energies of clusters between oxygen vacancies and trivalent dopant atoms while compressive strain leads to higher binding energies.,Effect of strain on the oxygen diffusion in yttria and gadolinia co-doped ceria,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.09.015
