1,2015,"In traditional Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) systems, the anode and cathode off-gases are combusted in an afterburner and the flue gas is then used to provide the thermal energy required for hydrogen reforming.",An Experimental Investigation into the Performance of a Novel-Integrated Afterburner-Reformer in a 1 kw Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1080/15435075.2013.844153
2,2015,"However, significant heat losses occur in the piping between the afterburner and the reformer, and thus the overall efficiency of the SOFC system is reduced.",An Experimental Investigation into the Performance of a Novel-Integrated Afterburner-Reformer in a 1 kw Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1080/15435075.2013.844153
3,2015,"Accordingly, the present study proposes a novel-integrated afterburner-reformer, which not only improves the system efficiency, but also reduces the required afterburner operating temperature.",An Experimental Investigation into the Performance of a Novel-Integrated Afterburner-Reformer in a 1 kw Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1080/15435075.2013.844153
4,2015,The experimental results show that the combined H-2 and CO content of the reformate gas is approximately 80%.,An Experimental Investigation into the Performance of a Novel-Integrated Afterburner-Reformer in a 1 kw Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1080/15435075.2013.844153
5,2015,"In other words, the reforming performance of the proposed afterburner-reformer is comparable with that of a conventional electrically-heated reformer.",An Experimental Investigation into the Performance of a Novel-Integrated Afterburner-Reformer in a 1 kw Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System,10.1080/15435075.2013.844153
