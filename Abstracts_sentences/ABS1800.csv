1,1800,"Lanthanum apatite is one of the most promising materials as an electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) which operate close to 700 degrees C. Here, we report the preparation and optimization of dense La10AlSi5O26.5 tapes obtained by the combination of tape casting technology and reaction sintering.","Preparation of aluminium lanthanum oxyapatite tapes, La10AlSi5O26.5, by tape casting and reaction sintering",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.03.023
