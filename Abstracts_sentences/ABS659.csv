1,659,"The performance of a H2S solid oxide fuel cell with proton conductor electrolyte, which is constructed by Co-Mo metal sulfide as an anode electro-catalyst, was tested at different Co/Mo ratios.",The Effect of Different Co-Mo Ratios as Anode Electro-catalysts on an H2S Fuel Cell with Proton Conductors,10.1080/15567030903161255
2,659,"The results indicate that the maximum power output, 6.0 mW.cm(-2), was obtained at Co:Mo = 2:3, the next is 5.2 mW.cm(-2) at Co:Mo = 1:1, and the minimal is 4.5 mW.cm(-2) at Co:Mo = 2:1.",The Effect of Different Co-Mo Ratios as Anode Electro-catalysts on an H2S Fuel Cell with Proton Conductors,10.1080/15567030903161255
3,659,"However, the obtained power output value is not consistent with the sequence of conductivity of anode materials, which results from the fact that the performance of solid oxide fuel cells are greatly affected by anode electro-catalytic activity.",The Effect of Different Co-Mo Ratios as Anode Electro-catalysts on an H2S Fuel Cell with Proton Conductors,10.1080/15567030903161255
