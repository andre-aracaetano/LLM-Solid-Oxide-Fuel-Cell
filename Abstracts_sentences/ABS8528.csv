1,8528,A thermodynamic analysis has been performed to compare the theoretical performance of ammonia fed solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on proton-conducting electrolyte (SOFC-H) and oxygen ion-conducting electrolyte (SOFC-O).,Thermodynamic analysis of ammonia fed solid oxide fuel cells: Comparison between proton-conducting electrolyte and oxygen ion-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.022
2,8528,It is found that the ammonia fed SOFC-H is superior to SOFC-O in terms of theoretical maximum efficiency.,Thermodynamic analysis of ammonia fed solid oxide fuel cells: Comparison between proton-conducting electrolyte and oxygen ion-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.022
3,8528,"For example, at a fuel utilization of 80% and an oxygen utilization of 20%, the efficiency of ammonia fed SOFC-H is 11% higher than that of SOFC-O. The difference between SOFC-H and SOFC-O becomes more significant at higher fuel utilizations and higher temperatures.",Thermodynamic analysis of ammonia fed solid oxide fuel cells: Comparison between proton-conducting electrolyte and oxygen ion-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.022
4,8528,"This is because an SOFC-H has a higher hydrogen partial pressure and a lower steam partial pressure than an SOFC-O. In addition, an increase in oxygen utilization is found to increase the efficiency of ammonia fed SOFCs due to an increase in oxygen molar fraction and a reduction in steam molar fraction.",Thermodynamic analysis of ammonia fed solid oxide fuel cells: Comparison between proton-conducting electrolyte and oxygen ion-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.022
5,8528,"With further development of new ceramics with high proton conductivity and effective fabrication of thin film electrolyte, the SOFC based on proton-conducting electrolyte is expected to be a promising approach to convert ammonia fuel into electricity.",Thermodynamic analysis of ammonia fed solid oxide fuel cells: Comparison between proton-conducting electrolyte and oxygen ion-conducting electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.022
