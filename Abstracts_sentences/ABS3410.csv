1,3410,Microbeam X-ray diffraction (mu-XRD) using synchrotron radiation at BL33XU (Toyota beamline) in SPring-8 produces a small beam size (1 mu m similar to 1 mu m) that allows detecting changes in the lattice parameter and crystal phase of samples.,Microstructure of a solid oxide fuel cell by microbeam X-ray diffraction,10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128383
2,3410,This feature renders this technique suitable for the structural investigation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) having a layered structure of various components in a micrometer order.,Microstructure of a solid oxide fuel cell by microbeam X-ray diffraction,10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128383
3,3410,"In this study, using the m-XRD technique, the refinement of the lattice parameters of SOFC materials and the assignment of secondary phases (e.g., a solid solution of CeO2-ZrO2 and SrZrO3) formed by interdiffusion between layers at the interface with micrometer intervals are achieved in the cell cross section, which had not been accomplished using conventional XRD methods.",Microstructure of a solid oxide fuel cell by microbeam X-ray diffraction,10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128383
