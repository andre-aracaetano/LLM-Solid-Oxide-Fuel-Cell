1,1420,"In the present study, a detailed thermodynamic analysis is carried out to provide useful information for the operation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with direct internal reforming (DIR) fueled by ethanol.",Thermodynamic analysis for a solid oxide fuel cell with direct internal reforming fueled by ethanol,10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.039
2,1420,"Equilibrium calculations are performed to find the ranges of inlet steam/ethanol (H2O/EtOH) ratio where carbon formation is thermodynamically unfavorable in the temperature range of 500-1500 K. Two types of fuel cell electrolytes, i.e., oxygen-conducting, and hydrogen-conducting electrolytes, are considered.",Thermodynamic analysis for a solid oxide fuel cell with direct internal reforming fueled by ethanol,10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.039
3,1420,"The key parameters determining the boundary of carbon formation are temperature, type of solid electrolyte and extent of the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen.",Thermodynamic analysis for a solid oxide fuel cell with direct internal reforming fueled by ethanol,10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.039
4,1420,The minimum H2O/EtOH ratio for which the carbon fort-nation is thermodynamically unfavored decreases with increasing temperature.,Thermodynamic analysis for a solid oxide fuel cell with direct internal reforming fueled by ethanol,10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.039
