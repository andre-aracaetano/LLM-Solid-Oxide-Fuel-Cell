1,19708,"A novel hybrid compressive mica seal was developed that showed an exceptionally low leak rate of similar to8.9 x 10(-4) sccm/cm (standard cubic centimeters per minute per unit leak length of seal) at 800degreesC and a compressive stress of 100 psi, about 740 times lower than that of the conventional compressive mica seals (6.6 x 10(-1) sccm/cm), at a pressure gradient of 2 psi.",Novel compressive mica seals with metallic interlayers for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03408.x

6,19708,"Using the paper form of muscovite and phlogopite mica, the leak rates were still far superior (similar to1 x 10(-1) sccm/cm) compared with mica without the compliant silver layer (about 6-9 sccm/cm).",Novel compressive mica seals with metallic interlayers for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03408.x
