1,3703,A two-part interconnector is developed for solid oxide fuel cell stacks to reduce cost and to improve sealing.,A novel two-part interconnector for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.3192
2,3703,The novel interconnector involves a metallic core for current collection and gas distribution and a ceramic support to house the metallic core and to separate two short stacks.,A novel two-part interconnector for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.3192
3,3703,The new interconnector reduces usage of expensive metallic alloys and substantially reduce mismatch between stack components due to higher expansion coefficient of metals.,A novel two-part interconnector for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.3192
4,3703,The new interconnectors also improve sealing with glass-ceramics eliminating chromium evaporation which is a major reason for sealing failure in fully metallic interconnectors.,A novel two-part interconnector for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/er.3192
