1,9106,"Over the past decade, the University of St Andrews and HEXIS AG have engaged in a highly successful collaborative project aiming to develop and upscale La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 (LSCTA-) anode backbone microstructures, impregnated with Ce0.80Gd0.20O1.90 (CG20) and metallic electrocatalysts, providing direct benefits in terms of performance and stability over the current state-of-the-art (SoA) Ni-based cermet solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes.",Development and full system testing of novel co-impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 anodes for commercial combined heat and power units,10.1002/fuce.202300033
2,9106,"Here, we present a brief overview of previous work performed in this research project, including short-term, durability, and poison testing of small-scale (1 cm(2) area) SOFCs and upscaling to full-sized HEXIS SOFCs (100 cm(2) area) in short stacks.",Development and full system testing of novel co-impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 anodes for commercial combined heat and power units,10.1002/fuce.202300033
3,9106,"Subsequently, recent results from short stack testing of SOFCs containing LSCTA- anodes with a variety of metallic catalyst components (Fe, Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, or Ru) will be presented, indicating that only SOFCs containing the Rh catalyst provide comparable degradation rates to the SoA Ni/cerium gadolinium oxide anode, as well as tolerance to harsh overload conditions (which is not exhibited by SoA anodes).",Development and full system testing of novel co-impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 anodes for commercial combined heat and power units,10.1002/fuce.202300033
4,9106,"Finally, results from full system testing (60 cells within a 1.5 kW electrical power output HEXIS Leonardo FC40A micro-combined heat and power unit), will be outlined, demonstrating the robust and durable nature of these novel oxide electrodes, in addition to their potential for commercialization.",Development and full system testing of novel co-impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 anodes for commercial combined heat and power units,10.1002/fuce.202300033
