1,529,"In the work presented herein, the potential use of La4Sr8Ti12-xFexO38-delta (LSTF) materials as electrodes for a new concept of solid oxide fuel cells, symmetrical fuel cells (SFCs), is considered.","Fe-substituted (La,Sr)TiO3 as potential electrodes for symmetrical fuel cells (SFCs)",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.094
2,529,"Such fuel cells use simultaneously the same material as anode and cathode, which notably simplifies the assembly and further maintenance of the cells.","Fe-substituted (La,Sr)TiO3 as potential electrodes for symmetrical fuel cells (SFCs)",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.094
3,529,"Therefore, we search for materials showing high conductivity in a wide range of oxygen partial pressures in addition to certain degree of catalytic activity for the oxidation of the fuel and reduction of the oxidant, respectively.","Fe-substituted (La,Sr)TiO3 as potential electrodes for symmetrical fuel cells (SFCs)",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.094
4,529,"The preliminary electrochemical experiments performed reveal that the overall conductivity increases notably upon Fe substitution, being the main contribution electronic n-type.","Fe-substituted (La,Sr)TiO3 as potential electrodes for symmetrical fuel cells (SFCs)",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.094
5,529,"The fuel cell tests indicate that LSTF composites with YSZ and CeO2 perform reasonably well under H-2 conditions, although the performance in methane is rather modest and require further optimisation.","Fe-substituted (La,Sr)TiO3 as potential electrodes for symmetrical fuel cells (SFCs)",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.094
