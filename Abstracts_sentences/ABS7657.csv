2,7657,"The dynamic model and energy management strategy of the proposed system are constructed, and the short-and mid-term dynamic response characteristics against step perturbations are investigated.",Dynamic modeling and response characteristics of a solar-driven polygeneration system coupled with hydrogen and thermal energy storage,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117496
3,7657,"Based on eco-office load demands during the typical summer and winter solstices, the long-term dynamic response behaviors of the system load-tracking are also studied.",Dynamic modeling and response characteristics of a solar-driven polygeneration system coupled with hydrogen and thermal energy storage,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117496
4,7657,"The results demonstrate that: the output dynamic response times are less than 1 s for the photovoltaic, 3-22 s for the proton exchange membrane electrolysis cell, and about 25 s for the solid-oxide fuel cell, all demonstrating short-term transient response characteristics in response to step perturbations of external parameters.",Dynamic modeling and response characteristics of a solar-driven polygeneration system coupled with hydrogen and thermal energy storage,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117496
5,7657,"In contrast, the dynamic response behaviors of the parabolic trough collector and the absorption chiller elapse 10 to 30 min to reach a stable value in response to the step changes, exhibiting typical mid-term dynamic response characteristics.",Dynamic modeling and response characteristics of a solar-driven polygeneration system coupled with hydrogen and thermal energy storage,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117496
6,7657,"Furthermore, the outputs of the system could fully satisfy the eco-office load demands in summer, while grid electricity is required to supply parts of power or heat for about 11 h in the morning and evening due to the low solar irradiation and short daylight duration in winter.",Dynamic modeling and response characteristics of a solar-driven polygeneration system coupled with hydrogen and thermal energy storage,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.117496
