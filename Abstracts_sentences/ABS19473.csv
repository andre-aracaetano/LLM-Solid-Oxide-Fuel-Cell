1,19473,"Decrease in sintering temperature of lanthanum-doped ceria (Ce0.6La0.4O2-delta, LDC), which was used as a buffer layer, was investigated using sintering additives such as Ag2O, ZnO, BaO, CaO, Bi2O3, RuO2, and TiO2 for preventing NiO diffusion into Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3 (LSGM) electrolyte film prepared by screen printing and co-firing method.",Titania-Added Ce0.6La0.4O2-δ for the Buffer Layer of High-Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Doped Lanthanum Gallate Electrolyte Film,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2012.05364.x
2,19473,"It was found that TiO2 was the most effective in decreasing the sintering temperature to 1473 K, which was 300 K lower than that of LDC, and increasing the electrical conductivity.",Titania-Added Ce0.6La0.4O2-δ for the Buffer Layer of High-Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Doped Lanthanum Gallate Electrolyte Film,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2012.05364.x
3,19473,Ti addition in LDC was attributed to increased mass transportation caused by compensation for lattice mismatch and defect dissociation resulted in improved sintering density and electrical conductivity.,Titania-Added Ce0.6La0.4O2-δ for the Buffer Layer of High-Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Doped Lanthanum Gallate Electrolyte Film,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2012.05364.x
4,19473,"However, Ti-LDC buffer layer could not completely prevent NiO diffusion into the LSGM electrolyte, although it was effective in reducing the diffusion content-probably because of the low sintering temperature of Ti-LDC.",Titania-Added Ce0.6La0.4O2-δ for the Buffer Layer of High-Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Doped Lanthanum Gallate Electrolyte Film,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2012.05364.x
5,19473,The use of fast sintering (a heating/cooling rate of 600 K/h and a holding time of 3 h) further decreased NiO diffusion into the electrolyte.,Titania-Added Ce0.6La0.4O2-δ for the Buffer Layer of High-Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Doped Lanthanum Gallate Electrolyte Film,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2012.05364.x
6,19473,"Accordingly, theoretical open-circuit voltage and improved power density were attributed to reduced electron hole conduction and ohmic resistance that were assigned to suppressed NiO diffusion into the LSGM electrolyte.",Titania-Added Ce0.6La0.4O2-δ for the Buffer Layer of High-Performance Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using Doped Lanthanum Gallate Electrolyte Film,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2012.05364.x
