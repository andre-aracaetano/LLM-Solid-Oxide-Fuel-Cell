2,6510,The thermo-gravimetric (TG) analysis of as-prepared ash indicated the decomposition process of most of metal nitrates during gel combustion.,Preparation of Pr0.35Nd0.35Sr0.3MnO3-δ/YSZ composite cathode powders for tubular solid oxide fuel cells by microwave-induced monomer gelation and gel combustion synthesis process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.09.091
3,6510,The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the powders calcined at 1000 degrees C showed only pure PNSM and YSZ phase.,Preparation of Pr0.35Nd0.35Sr0.3MnO3-δ/YSZ composite cathode powders for tubular solid oxide fuel cells by microwave-induced monomer gelation and gel combustion synthesis process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.09.091
4,6510,Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the morphology of powders was characterized with the YSZ particles enwrapped by fine PNSM particles so that PNSM/YSZ composite powders were much better-dispersed compared with the powders made simply by mechanical mixing process.,Preparation of Pr0.35Nd0.35Sr0.3MnO3-δ/YSZ composite cathode powders for tubular solid oxide fuel cells by microwave-induced monomer gelation and gel combustion synthesis process,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.09.091
