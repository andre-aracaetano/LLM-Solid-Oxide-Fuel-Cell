1,2210,"Having a highly-conductive protonic electrolyte is an essential requirement of developing solid ceramic fuel cell (SCFC) operated below 600 degrees C. Proton transport in solid electrolyte structure occurs via a bulk conduction mechanism in conventional SCFC, which may not be so efficient; therefore we have developed a fast proton conducting NaAlO2/LiAlO2 (NAO-LAO) heterostructure electrolyte, achieving the ionic conductivity of 0.23 S cm-1 thanks to its rich cross-linked solid-liquid interfaces; the SCFC employing this new developed electrolyte showed a maximum power density of 844 mW cm-2 at 550 degrees C, and the fuel cell could still operate at even lower temperatures down to 370 degrees C, although the output reduced to 90 mW cm-2.",Cross-linked solid-liquid interfaces enable a fast proton transport in the aluminate heterostructure electrolyte,10.1016/j.jcis.2023.04.159
2,2210,"The proton-hydration liquid layer promoted the formation of cross-linked solid-liquid interfaces in the NAO-LAO electrolyte, which promoted the construction of solid-liquid hybrid proton transportation channels and effectively reduced polarization loss, leading to high proton conduction at even lower temperatures.",Cross-linked solid-liquid interfaces enable a fast proton transport in the aluminate heterostructure electrolyte,10.1016/j.jcis.2023.04.159
3,2210,This work provides an efficient design approach for developing enabling electrolytes with high proton conductivity for SCFCs to be operated at relatively lower temperatures (300-600 degrees C) than traditional solid oxide fuel cells which operate above 750 degrees C.,Cross-linked solid-liquid interfaces enable a fast proton transport in the aluminate heterostructure electrolyte,10.1016/j.jcis.2023.04.159
