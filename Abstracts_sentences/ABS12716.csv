1,12716,A Cu-metal-based cermet was used to improve the electrochemical properties of two novel oxide-based systems with intrinsic low electronic conductivity such as La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) and La4Sr8Ti11Mn0.5Ga0.5O37.5-delta (LSTMG).,"Improvement of the electrochemical properties of novel solid oxide fuel cell anodes, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ and La4Sr8Ti11Mn0.5Ga0.5O37.5-δ, using Cu-YSZ-based cermets",10.1016/j.electacta.2007.05.060
2,12716,The introduction of Cu results in a marked improvement of the polarisation resistance values and hence in the performance.,"Improvement of the electrochemical properties of novel solid oxide fuel cell anodes, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ and La4Sr8Ti11Mn0.5Ga0.5O37.5-δ, using Cu-YSZ-based cermets",10.1016/j.electacta.2007.05.060
3,12716,The best results correspond to the addition of similar to 15% of CuO.,"Improvement of the electrochemical properties of novel solid oxide fuel cell anodes, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ and La4Sr8Ti11Mn0.5Ga0.5O37.5-δ, using Cu-YSZ-based cermets",10.1016/j.electacta.2007.05.060
4,12716,"In both systems, the polarisation resistances were improved by a least a factor of 2.","Improvement of the electrochemical properties of novel solid oxide fuel cell anodes, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ and La4Sr8Ti11Mn0.5Ga0.5O37.5-δ, using Cu-YSZ-based cermets",10.1016/j.electacta.2007.05.060
5,12716,"Despite there are reports claiming that the CuO-zirconia-based systems exhibit catalytic activity, such an improvement seems to be mainly related to the capability of CuO as a sintering agent, helping to bridge electrode particles together, creating new electronic paths and thus effectively increasing the triple phase boundary through the whole electrode material.","Improvement of the electrochemical properties of novel solid oxide fuel cell anodes, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ and La4Sr8Ti11Mn0.5Ga0.5O37.5-δ, using Cu-YSZ-based cermets",10.1016/j.electacta.2007.05.060
