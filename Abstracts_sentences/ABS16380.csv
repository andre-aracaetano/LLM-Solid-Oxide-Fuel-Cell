1,16380,The oxidation behaviour of a Cr-rich alloy developed for use in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks has been investigated in the temperature range from 850-1600 degrees C in air and in a hydrogen-low oxygen partial pressure atmosphere.,Oxidation of Cr94Fe5(Y2O3)1 at high temperatures,
2,16380,Severe buckling of the scale is observed when the alloy is exposed to air at high temperature.,Oxidation of Cr94Fe5(Y2O3)1 at high temperatures,
3,16380,"The buckling may be detrimental for the expected application areas, such as in SOFC stacks.",Oxidation of Cr94Fe5(Y2O3)1 at high temperatures,
4,16380,"It is demonstrated that heat treatments in a hydrogen low oxygen partial pressure atmosphere provides a very good adhesion of the formed scale to the underlying metal, even for heat treatments up to 1600 degrees C.",Oxidation of Cr94Fe5(Y2O3)1 at high temperatures,
5,16380,The scale remains well-adhering even after a reoxidation in air at 1300 degrees C. Possible reasons for the improved behaviour are discussed.,Oxidation of Cr94Fe5(Y2O3)1 at high temperatures,
