2,7942,Thin proton-conducting BCZYZ electrolyte is prepared over porous anode substrate composed of NiO-BCZYZ by the one-step dry-pressing/co-firing method.,Stable BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with layered SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ cathode,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.080
3,7942,A laboratory-sized tri-layer cell of NiO-BCZYZ/BCZYZ (similar to 17 mu m)/SBSC is operated from 550 to 700 degrees C with humidified hydrogen (similar to 3% H2O) as fuel and the static air as oxidant.,Stable BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with layered SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ cathode,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.080
4,7942,"The BCZYZ perovskite electrolyte synthesized by a modified Pechini process is completely dense after sintered at 1250 degrees C for 5 h, lower than that without Znic dopant about 150 degrees C. An open-circuit potential of 1.007 V, a maximum power density of 0.306 W cm(-2), and a low polarization resistance of the electrodes of 0.11 Omega cm(2) are achieved at 700 degrees C.
