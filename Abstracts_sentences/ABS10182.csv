1,10182,The properties of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode functional layers prepared by impregnation of 1 wt % Pd and 10 wt % ceria into porous scaffolds of either Y0.04Ce0.48Zr0.48O2 (CZY) or composites of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3 (LST) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were examined to determine whether these scaffold materials would have sufficient electronic and ionic conductivity.,SOFC anodes based on LST-YSZ composites and on Y0.04Ce0.48Zr0.48O2,10.1149/1.2840473

3,10182,The electronic conductivities of LST-YSZ composites were a function of the porosity and the weight fraction of LST but could be sufficient for use in thin functional layers.,SOFC anodes based on LST-YSZ composites and on Y0.04Ce0.48Zr0.48O2,10.1149/1.2840473
4,10182,"However, anodes made with LST-YSZ composites had higher nonohmic losses than cells made with YSZ scaffolds.",SOFC anodes based on LST-YSZ composites and on Y0.04Ce0.48Zr0.48O2,10.1149/1.2840473

6,10182,"While CZY exhibited electronic conductivity, the loss in ionic conductivity compared to YSZ again resulted in higher nonohmic losses.",SOFC anodes based on LST-YSZ composites and on Y0.04Ce0.48Zr0.48O2,10.1149/1.2840473
