3,18677,"Planar tensile strain is found to reduce the migration barrier of oxygen vacancy anisotropically on the LCO(001) surface, inducing an enhanced mobility along the [1 (1) over bar0] direction and a suppressed mobility along the [110] direction.",Enhanced one dimensional mobility of oxygen on strained LaCoO3(001) surface,10.1039/c1jm12830b
4,18677,The increase of space around Co that the oxygen (vacancy) traverses with a curved path is the cause of the enhanced mobility along the,Enhanced one dimensional mobility of oxygen on strained LaCoO3(001) surface,10.1039/c1jm12830b
