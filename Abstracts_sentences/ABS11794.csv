1,11794,The initial degradation of a La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 (LSCF) cathode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was investigated.,Influence of sulfur impurities on the stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.08.005
2,11794,Degradation of the cathodic performance at 973 K was accelerated by decreasing the oxygen partial pressure from 20 to 10% due to the reduction of Fe3+ in ISCF.,Influence of sulfur impurities on the stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.08.005
3,11794,Sulfur contamination (1513 and 752 ppm) in the LSCF powder significantly increased the IR loss of the cathode within the initial few hours of SOFC operation.,Influence of sulfur impurities on the stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.08.005
4,11794,"Impedance and conductivity measurements suggested that the increase in IR loss could be explained by the decrease in the electrical conductivity of LSCF due to the phase separation of Sr2+ from lattice or surface segregation of Sr, and the formation of SrSO4.",Influence of sulfur impurities on the stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.08.005
5,11794,"Sintering of the LSCF powder electrode was enhanced at the Sr enriched part and the diffusion overpotential was significantly increased after degradation for 24 h. Therefore, sulfur impurities in the LSCF powder have a negative influence on the stability of cathode during the initial period of SOFC operation.",Influence of sulfur impurities on the stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.08.005
