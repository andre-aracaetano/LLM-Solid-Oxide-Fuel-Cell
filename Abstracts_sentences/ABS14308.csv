4,14308,"The coral's damage mechanism involves three regimes: at very low loads stresses are concentrated at the tips of individual corals that fracture and fill the spaces between corals (regime I); as load increases, generalized fracture of the corals occurs and the material starts compacting into an increasingly dense layer (regime II); finally, at the highest loads, the material behaves like an almost fully dense (regime III).",Mechanical behavior of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ oxygen electrode with a coral microstructure for solid oxide fuel cell and solid oxide electrolyzer cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.204
5,14308,As load increases during testing porosity decreases from about 60 to about 5 vol% in the compacted material.,Mechanical behavior of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ oxygen electrode with a coral microstructure for solid oxide fuel cell and solid oxide electrolyzer cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.204
6,14308,The transitions between regimes are associated to increases in the contact stress and the same damage mechanism is found during scratching and indentation.,Mechanical behavior of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ oxygen electrode with a coral microstructure for solid oxide fuel cell and solid oxide electrolyzer cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.07.204
