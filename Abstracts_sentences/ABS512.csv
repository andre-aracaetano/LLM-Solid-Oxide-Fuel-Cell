1,512,"Under operating conditions in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), metallic interconnect plates form electrically insulating or poor-conducting oxide scales (e.g. Cr2O3, Al2O3) at their surface which increase the contact resistance from one fuel cell membrane to the next.",Oxidation behaviour of ferrous alloys used as interconnecting material in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1021879800937
2,512,"In order to minimize electric losses in a fuel cell stack, the formation of oxide scales on the interconnect surface must either be prevented or the oxide scale formed must have sufficient electrical conductivity.",Oxidation behaviour of ferrous alloys used as interconnecting material in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1021879800937
3,512,"In the present work, investigations were carried out on the corrosion behaviour of different FeCrAl and FeCrMn alloys, some of which were coated with nickel (Ni).",Oxidation behaviour of ferrous alloys used as interconnecting material in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1021879800937
4,512,Information about ageing of these alloys on the anode side of the fuel cell was obtained by means of contact resistance measurements and scanning electron microscopy.,Oxidation behaviour of ferrous alloys used as interconnecting material in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1021879800937
5,512,The results reveal that FeCrMn(LaTi) alloys and Ni-coated interconnects exhibit low ageing rates and are thus suitable for use on the anode side of SOFCs.,Oxidation behaviour of ferrous alloys used as interconnecting material in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1021879800937
