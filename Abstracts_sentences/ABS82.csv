1,82,Samaria-doped ceria (SDC) overlayers were deposited on Ag cathodes by sputtering.,Thermally Stable Silver Cathode Covered by Samaria-Doped Ceria for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/nano14070561
2,82,The SDC sputtering time was varied to investigate the properties of the Ag-SDC overlayer cathode-coated fuel cells depending on the thickness of the SDC overlayers.,Thermally Stable Silver Cathode Covered by Samaria-Doped Ceria for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/nano14070561
3,82,"Among the fabricated fuel cells, Ag with a 10-nm-thick SDC overlayer (Ag-SDC10) cathode-coated fuel cell exhibited the highest peak power density of 6.587 mW/cm2 at 450 degrees C, showing higher performance than a pristine Pt-coated fuel cell.",Thermally Stable Silver Cathode Covered by Samaria-Doped Ceria for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/nano14070561
4,82,"Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the Ag-SDC10 cathode-coated fuel cell significantly mitigated polarization loss originating from enhanced oxygen reduction reaction kinetics compared to the pristine Ag-coated fuel cell.",Thermally Stable Silver Cathode Covered by Samaria-Doped Ceria for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/nano14070561
