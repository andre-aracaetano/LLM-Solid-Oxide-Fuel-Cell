1,10791,Porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) electrodes supported on Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) electrolyte were impregnated with small amounts of Pd and the electrochemical impedances resolved by AC impedance spectroscopy.,Pd-promoted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00294-X
2,10791,The optimum Pd loading resulted in 3-4 times lower cathodic impedance in the temperature range 400-750 degrees C. Single cell Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) were fabricated by tape casting CGO electrolyte onto an anode support.,Pd-promoted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00294-X
3,10791,"Under d.c operation, the addition of Pd to the LSCF cathode was found to decrease the overall cell resistance by 15% at 650 degrees C and 40% at 550 degrees C.",Pd-promoted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00294-X
4,10791,This suggests that the SOFC becomes more limited by the performance of the cathode at lower temperatures and hence the greater benefit of Pd promotion.,Pd-promoted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00294-X
5,10791,"Finally, Pd particles were deposited on dense smooth LSCF substrates and Isotope Exchange Depth Profiling (IEDP) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) were carried out to determine the tracer diffusion (D*) and surface exchange (k) coefficients.",Pd-promoted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00294-X
6,10791,D* was not significantly effected but k decreased by well over an order of magnitude with Pd loadings similar to those applied to the electrode.,Pd-promoted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00294-X
