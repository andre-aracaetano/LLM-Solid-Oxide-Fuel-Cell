1,6655,"In this study, the microstructural modification of pulsed laser deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSC64) thin-film cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to improve the lateral conduction and to reduce the surface composition degradation is investigated.",Microstructure refinement of pulsed laser deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s12540-013-0638-9
2,6655,A high-temperature deposited 100 nm-thick denser LSC64 layer is added over 2.4 mu m-thick porous cathode to cover and bridge the cathode domains.,Microstructure refinement of pulsed laser deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s12540-013-0638-9
3,6655,"According to the cell performance analyses using current-voltage-power measurements, the performance of the cell modified with an additional denser layer is increased compared with the cell without the denser layer in all operating temperature range.",Microstructure refinement of pulsed laser deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s12540-013-0638-9
4,6655,The degree of improvement of peak power density is bigger than 10% at 650-550 A degrees C and is about 6% at 500 A degrees C.,Microstructure refinement of pulsed laser deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s12540-013-0638-9
5,6655,"This performance enhancement can be attributed to the electrochemical property improvement, especially oxygen surface exchange property, rather than to the conduction improvement, based on the electrochemical impedance analysis.",Microstructure refinement of pulsed laser deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s12540-013-0638-9
6,6655,Improved crystallinity and composition integrity of the denser LSC64 layer is considered to enhance the surface exchange property of the cathode.,Microstructure refinement of pulsed laser deposited La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s12540-013-0638-9
