Furthermore, the peak power density of a cell using the nanofiber-structured SSC GDC cathode in combination with a 650-mu m-thick La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta electrolyte is found to be 0.134 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C. All of these results make of the nanofiber-structured SSC GDC composite cathodes a potential high-performance component for use in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.",Nanofiber-structured SSC-GDC composite cathodes for a LSGM electrolyte based IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.104
