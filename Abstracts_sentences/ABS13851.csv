3,13851,"First, we find that the binding of undesirable intermediates, such as C and S. can be inhibited and the catalytic activity of planar Ni-based anodes can be tuned towards oxidation by selectively forming a bimetallic surface alloy.",Catalytic activity of bimetallic nickel alloys for solid-oxide fuel cell anode reactions from density-functional theory,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.007
