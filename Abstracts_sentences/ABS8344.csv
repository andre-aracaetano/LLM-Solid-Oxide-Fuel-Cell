1,8344,The effect of the cathode-to-anode area ratio on the normalized power density for solid oxide fuel cells was investigated.,Influence of electrode configuration on the performance of electrode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1448817
2,8344,"A geometrically symmetric cell having a screen printed cathode produced a power density of 0.45 W/cm(2) at 800degreesC. However, using a cathode with a geometric area significantly less than that of the anode can enhance the normalized power density by a factor of two.",Influence of electrode configuration on the performance of electrode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1448817
3,8344,"Furthermore, using a current collector with a geometric area less than that of the cathode contributes an additional enhancement that leads to an apparent power density of 1.2 W/cm(2).",Influence of electrode configuration on the performance of electrode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1448817
