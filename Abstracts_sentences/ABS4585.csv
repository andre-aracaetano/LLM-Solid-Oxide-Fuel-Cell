1,4585,This paper reports the dynamic behavior of a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) power plant including a battery bank and a static Volt-Ampere-reactive power compensator system (static VAr compensator or SVC) for active and reactive power flow controllers.,Static VAr compensator based reactive power management for SOFC power plants,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.050
2,4585,"First, the necessities of the reactive power management as well as the load following capability of distributed generation (DG) systems are emphasized.",Static VAr compensator based reactive power management for SOFC power plants,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.050
3,4585,"Then, a decoupled active and reactive power management control strategies are described.",Static VAr compensator based reactive power management for SOFC power plants,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.050
4,4585,"in the proposed system, while the active power management is achieved using the SOFC power plant with the aid of the battery; the reactive power management is achieved using an SVC system which totally prevents the reactive loading interactions with the dc bus.",Static VAr compensator based reactive power management for SOFC power plants,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.02.050
