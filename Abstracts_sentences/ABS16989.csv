1,16989,Chemical expansion refers to the spatial dilation of a material that occurs upon changes in its composition.,Defining chemical expansion: the choice of units for the stoichiometric expansion coefficient,10.1039/c4cp01096e
2,16989,"When this dilation is caused by a gradual, iso-structural increase in the lattice parameter with composition, it is related to the composition change by the stoichiometric expansion coefficient.",Defining chemical expansion: the choice of units for the stoichiometric expansion coefficient,10.1039/c4cp01096e
3,16989,"In this work, three different approaches to defining the stoichiometric expansion coefficient (alpha(S)) are discussed.",Defining chemical expansion: the choice of units for the stoichiometric expansion coefficient,10.1039/c4cp01096e
4,16989,"While all three definitions of aS given here are legitimate, we show that there are advantages to selecting certain ones for comparison across different crystal structures.",Defining chemical expansion: the choice of units for the stoichiometric expansion coefficient,10.1039/c4cp01096e
