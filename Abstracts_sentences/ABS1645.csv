1,1645,A novel Ba-deficient layered perovskite EuBa0.98Co2O5+delta (EBCO) has been proposed as a high-performance cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Synergistic effect study of EuBa0.98Co2O5+δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.300
2,1645,Herein we report a systematic study on electrochemical properties of composite materials composed of EBCO and Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (EBCO-xSDC) with x ranging from 0 to 40 wt%.,Synergistic effect study of EuBa0.98Co2O5+δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.300
3,1645,The results indicate that the EBCO-xSDC composite cathodes have excellent electro-catalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity thanks to synergistic effects of high electronic conducting EBCO phase and ionic conducting SDC electrolyte.,Synergistic effect study of EuBa0.98Co2O5+δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.300
4,1645,"Among all these composite cathodes, EBCO-20SDC exhibits the best cathode performance, as evidenced by a low polarization resistance value of 0.028 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air.",Synergistic effect study of EuBa0.98Co2O5+δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.300
5,1645,"When tested in a complete fuel cell (Ni-YSZ vertical bar YSZ vertical bar CGO vertical bar EBCO-20SDC), a much higher maximum power density of 980 mW cm(-2) is achieved, compared with that of EBCO cathode-based fuel cell (505 mW cm(-2)).",Synergistic effect study of EuBa0.98Co2O5+δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.300
6,1645,"Furthermore, the rate-limiting steps toward oxygen reduction reaction at the EBCO-20SDC cathode interface are determined to explore the reaction kinetics and explain the enhanced electrochemical performance.",Synergistic effect study of EuBa0.98Co2O5+δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.300
