1,18238,"The reactivity of CeO2 is determined by grain size and oxygen vacancies, which can be achieved by doping elements with less oxidation state into CeO2.",Preparation and characterization of nanocrystalline Ca-doped CeO2 by sol-gel process,10.1007/s10971-012-2885-5
2,18238,In this study nanocrystalline Ca-doped CeO2 sol was synthesized from the reaction of hydrate cerium (III) nitrate and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate in alcohol solution after being calcined at 600 A degrees C. X-ray diffraction as well as selected area electron diffraction gave evidence that the synthesized Ca-doped CeO2 samples were well crystalline and had a cubic fluorite structure.,Preparation and characterization of nanocrystalline Ca-doped CeO2 by sol-gel process,10.1007/s10971-012-2885-5
3,18238,TEM observation revealed that Ca-doped CeO2 was composed by nanoparticles with grain size around 8 nm.,Preparation and characterization of nanocrystalline Ca-doped CeO2 by sol-gel process,10.1007/s10971-012-2885-5
4,18238,The Raman spectrum of pure CeO2 consists of a single triple degenerate F-2g model characteristic of the fluorite-like structure.,Preparation and characterization of nanocrystalline Ca-doped CeO2 by sol-gel process,10.1007/s10971-012-2885-5
5,18238,"In the Ca-doped CeO2 sample, two additional low-intensity Raman bands were detected, thus confirming the formation of the solid solution.",Preparation and characterization of nanocrystalline Ca-doped CeO2 by sol-gel process,10.1007/s10971-012-2885-5
6,18238,The synthesized nanometric powder is expected to be used in solid oxide fuel cells as well as in the catalytic treatment of automobile exhaust fumes.,Preparation and characterization of nanocrystalline Ca-doped CeO2 by sol-gel process,10.1007/s10971-012-2885-5
