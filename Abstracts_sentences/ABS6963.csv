1,6963,The effect of metallic Co-coating thickness on ferritic stainless steels is investigated.,The Effect of Metallic Co-Coating Thickness on Ferritic Stainless Steels Intended for Use as Interconnect Material in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11085-017-9782-9
2,6963,This material is suggested to be used as interconnect material in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,The Effect of Metallic Co-Coating Thickness on Ferritic Stainless Steels Intended for Use as Interconnect Material in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11085-017-9782-9
3,6963,"Uncoated, 200-, 600-, 1000-, and 1500-nm Co-coated Sanergy HT is isothermally exposed for up to 500 h in air at 650 A degrees C. Mass gain is recorded to follow oxidation kinetics, and area-specific resistance (ASR) measurements are conducted on samples exposed for 168 and 500 h. The microstructure of the thermally grown oxide scales is characterized utilizing scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis on broad ion beam-milled cross sections.",The Effect of Metallic Co-Coating Thickness on Ferritic Stainless Steels Intended for Use as Interconnect Material in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11085-017-9782-9
4,6963,A clear increase in ASR as a function of Co-coating thickness is observed.,The Effect of Metallic Co-Coating Thickness on Ferritic Stainless Steels Intended for Use as Interconnect Material in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11085-017-9782-9
5,6963,"However, the increase in ASR, as an effect of a thicker Co-coating, is correlated with thicker (Cr,Fe)(2)O-3 scales formed on these materials and not to an increase in Co spinel top layer thickness.",The Effect of Metallic Co-Coating Thickness on Ferritic Stainless Steels Intended for Use as Interconnect Material in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11085-017-9782-9
