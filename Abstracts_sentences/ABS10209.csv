3,10209,It is shown that the separation of anode and cathode overpotential by three-electrode method is essentially impractical for anode-supported SOFCs.,Effects of testing configurations and cell geometries on the performance of a SOFC: A modeling approach,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.08.010
4,10209,It is also found that testing configuration has little effect on cell performance due to the high electrical conductivity in anode.,Effects of testing configurations and cell geometries on the performance of a SOFC: A modeling approach,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.08.010
