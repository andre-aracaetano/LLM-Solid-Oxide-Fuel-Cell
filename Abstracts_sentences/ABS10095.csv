1,10095,"This paper reports and discusses composite interconnect materials that were modified from La0.7Ca0.3CrO3- (delta) (LCC) by addition of Re doped CeO2 (Re = Sm, Gd, Y) for improved conductivity at relative low temperatures.","High performance composite interconnect La0.7Ca0.3CrO3/20 mol% ReO1.5 doped CeO2 (Re = Sm, Gd, Y) for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.073
2,10095,It is found that the addition of small amounts of RDC (ReO1.5 doped Ce02) into LCC dramatically increased the electrical conductivity.,"High performance composite interconnect La0.7Ca0.3CrO3/20 mol% ReO1.5 doped CeO2 (Re = Sm, Gd, Y) for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.073
3,10095,"For the best system studied, LCC + 5 wt% SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9), LCC + 3 wt% GDC (Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9) and LCC + 3 wt% YDC (Y0.2Ce0.8O1.9), the electrical conductivities reached 687.8, 124.6 and 104.8 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C in air, respectively.","High performance composite interconnect La0.7Ca0.3CrO3/20 mol% ReO1.5 doped CeO2 (Re = Sm, Gd, Y) for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.073
4,10095,"The electrical conductivities of the specimens, LCC + 3 wt% SDC, LCC + 1 wt% GDC and LCC + 2 wt% YDC in H-2 at 800 degrees C were 7.1, 3.8 and 5.9 S cm-1, respectively.","High performance composite interconnect La0.7Ca0.3CrO3/20 mol% ReO1.5 doped CeO2 (Re = Sm, Gd, Y) for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.073
5,10095,"With the increase of RDC content, the relative density increased, indicating that RDC served as an effective sintering aid in enhancing the sinterability of the powders.","High performance composite interconnect La0.7Ca0.3CrO3/20 mol% ReO1.5 doped CeO2 (Re = Sm, Gd, Y) for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.073
6,10095,The average coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) at 30-1000 degrees C in air increased with the increase of the RDC content.,"High performance composite interconnect La0.7Ca0.3CrO3/20 mol% ReO1.5 doped CeO2 (Re = Sm, Gd, Y) for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.073
7,10095,"The oxygen permeation measurements indicated a negligible oxygen ionic conduction, indicating that the efficiency loss of a solid oxide fuel cell by permeation is negligible for the general cell design using LCC + RDC as interconnect.","High performance composite interconnect La0.7Ca0.3CrO3/20 mol% ReO1.5 doped CeO2 (Re = Sm, Gd, Y) for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.073
8,10095,"Therefore, the composite materials La0.7Ca0.3CrO3/20 mol% ReO1.5 doped CeO2 are very promising interconnecting ceramics for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","High performance composite interconnect La0.7Ca0.3CrO3/20 mol% ReO1.5 doped CeO2 (Re = Sm, Gd, Y) for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.073
