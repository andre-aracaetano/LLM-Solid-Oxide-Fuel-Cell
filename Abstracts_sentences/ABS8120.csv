1,8120,"Three different planar anode supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) were tested with hydrogen, with autothermally prereformed natural gas from which sulfur was removed, and with autothermally prereformed natural gas that contained sulfur.",Feasibility of autothermally reformed natural gas on anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2349526
2,8120,"The cells were obtained from Forschungszentrum Jalich (FZJ), Energy research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN), and HTceramix SA (HTc).",Feasibility of autothermally reformed natural gas on anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2349526
3,8120,All cells were so called Real-SOFC first generation cells.,Feasibility of autothermally reformed natural gas on anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2349526
4,8120,"Cell polarizations were first measured with hydrogen, followed by a 200 h test (25 A, 800 degrees C) with a selected fuel, and finally cell polarizations were measured with hydrogen.",Feasibility of autothermally reformed natural gas on anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2349526
5,8120,"When hydrogen was used as the fuel in the 200 It test, the performance for all cells was comparable and no degradation was observed.",Feasibility of autothermally reformed natural gas on anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2349526
6,8120,All cells underwent an initial deactivation process when reformate fuels were used but their cell voltage stabilized during the first 50 h. All cells also showed deactivation after the reformate tests when the area specific resistance values were compared to the values obtained from the hydrogen tests.,Feasibility of autothermally reformed natural gas on anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2349526
7,8120,The deactivation was comparable between the sulfur-free and sulfur-rich reformate tests.,Feasibility of autothermally reformed natural gas on anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2349526
8,8120,"Sulfur-rich reformate, however caused oscillation in cell voltages as the sulfur level in natural gas was not constant.",Feasibility of autothermally reformed natural gas on anode supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2349526
