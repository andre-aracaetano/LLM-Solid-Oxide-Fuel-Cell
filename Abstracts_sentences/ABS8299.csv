1,8299,"The LaBaCo2O5+delta-x wt.% Bi2O3 (LBCO-XBi2O3, X=10, 20, 30, and 40) were prepared as composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) via the conventional mechanical mixing method.",Effect of Bi2O3 on the electrochemical performance of LaBaCo2O5+δ cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.074
2,8299,"The effect of Bi2O3 on polarization resistance, overpotential, and long-term stability of the LBCO cathode was investigated.",Effect of Bi2O3 on the electrochemical performance of LaBaCo2O5+δ cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.074
3,8299,"An effective sintering aid for LBCO cathode, Bi2O3 not only lowers its sintering temperature by similar to 200 degrees C, but also improves the electrochemical performance within the intermediate temperature range of 600-800 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements showed that the addition of 20 wt.% Bi2O3 to LBCO exhibited the lowest area-specific resistance of 0.020 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C in air, which was about a seventh of that of the LBCO cathode at the same condition.",Effect of Bi2O3 on the electrochemical performance of LaBaCo2O5+δ cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.074
4,8299,"At a current density of 0.2 A cm(-2), the cathodic overpotential of LBCO-20Bi(2)O(3) was about 12.6 mV at 700 degrees C, while the corresponding value for LBCO was 51.0 mV. Compared to B2O3-Bi2O3-Pbo fit, the addition of Bi2O3 significantly improved the long-term stability of cathode.",Effect of Bi2O3 on the electrochemical performance of LaBaCo2O5+δ cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.074
