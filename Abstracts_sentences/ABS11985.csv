1,11985,The impact of infiltrating chloride salts on the electrochemical behavior of lanthanum strontium manganite-yttria stabilized zirconia (LSM-YSZ) cathodes was investigated under solid oxide fuel cell operation.,Lowering the Impedance of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite-Based Electrodes with Lanthanum Oxychloride and Lanthanum Scavenging Chloride Salts,10.1149/1945-7111/ac359a
2,11985,Infiltrating a lanthanum chloride solution resulted in the formation of a lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) phase.,Lowering the Impedance of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite-Based Electrodes with Lanthanum Oxychloride and Lanthanum Scavenging Chloride Salts,10.1149/1945-7111/ac359a
3,11985,"A LaOCl phase also formed by infiltrating an ammonium chloride solution; however, lanthanum was scavenged from the LSM phase to form LaOCl.",Lowering the Impedance of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite-Based Electrodes with Lanthanum Oxychloride and Lanthanum Scavenging Chloride Salts,10.1149/1945-7111/ac359a
4,11985,"The third infiltrating solution, a combination of zirconium chloride and yttrium nitrate, formed LaOCl by scavenging lanthanum from LSM and produced YSZ nanoparticles.",Lowering the Impedance of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite-Based Electrodes with Lanthanum Oxychloride and Lanthanum Scavenging Chloride Salts,10.1149/1945-7111/ac359a
5,11985,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results suggest that LaOCl improves oxygen adsorption kinetics compared to a baseline LSM-YSZ cathode, reducing the low frequency impedance by 30%.",Lowering the Impedance of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite-Based Electrodes with Lanthanum Oxychloride and Lanthanum Scavenging Chloride Salts,10.1149/1945-7111/ac359a
6,11985,"In addition, scavenging lanthanum from LSM improved oxygen ion diffusion polarization as indicated by the observed 40% reduction in high frequency impedance and improved serial ohmic resistance by 19%.",Lowering the Impedance of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite-Based Electrodes with Lanthanum Oxychloride and Lanthanum Scavenging Chloride Salts,10.1149/1945-7111/ac359a
7,11985,"Finally, YSZ nanoparticles further reduced the high frequency impedance and ohmic resistance by 45% and 23%, respectively.",Lowering the Impedance of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite-Based Electrodes with Lanthanum Oxychloride and Lanthanum Scavenging Chloride Salts,10.1149/1945-7111/ac359a
8,11985,The findings reveal new strategies for lowering the impedance of LSM-YSZ cathodes.,Lowering the Impedance of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite-Based Electrodes with Lanthanum Oxychloride and Lanthanum Scavenging Chloride Salts,10.1149/1945-7111/ac359a
