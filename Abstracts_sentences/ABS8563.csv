1,8563,"The effects of zinc modification methods on membrane sintering, electrical conductivity of BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY4) and the thermo-mechanical match of the BZCY4 electrolyte with anode were systematically investigated.",Optimizing the modification method of zinc-enhanced sintering of BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-δ-based electrolytes for application in an anode-supported protonic solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.03.039
2,8563,"Three modification methods are pursued, including the physical mixing of BZCY4 with a ZnO solid (method 1), introducing zinc during the solution stage of the sal-gel synthesis (method 2) and doping zinc into a perovskite lattice by synthesis of a new compound with a nominal composition of BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.16Zn0.04O3-delta (method 3).",Optimizing the modification method of zinc-enhanced sintering of BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-δ-based electrolytes for application in an anode-supported protonic solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.03.039
3,8563,"Method 1 turned out to be the most effective at reducing the sintering temperature, which can mainly be attributed to a reactive sintering although ZnO doping into the BZCY4 lattice also facilitates the sintering.",Optimizing the modification method of zinc-enhanced sintering of BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-δ-based electrolytes for application in an anode-supported protonic solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.03.039
4,8563,"While all three modification methods facilitated the membrane sintering, only the electrolyte from method 3 had similar shrinkage behavior to the anode.",Optimizing the modification method of zinc-enhanced sintering of BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-δ-based electrolytes for application in an anode-supported protonic solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.03.039
5,8563,"An anode-supported thin-film BZCY4-3 electrolyte solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was successfully fabricated, and the fuel cell delivered an attractive performance with a peak power density of similar to 307 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C.
