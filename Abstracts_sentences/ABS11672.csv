5,11672,"Thus, it is likely that the high oxygen partial pressure at the CGO electrolyte/LSC oxygen electrode interface accelerated the penetration of S. When air was supplied using an activated carbon filter during SOEC operation, the degradation rate decreased to 0.6% kh(-1) within 3000 h. Finally, the results of accelerated tests performed using air containing 0.2 ppm SO2 suggested that the effect of S poisoning was greater during SOEC operation than during SOFC operation.",Effects of sulfur poisoning on degradation phenomena in oxygen electrodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells and solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.151
