1,20569,The cathode performance of various LSCM-based composites for high temperature H2O electrolysis has been studied by examining their electrochemical behavior under current loading using three-electrode electrolysis cells with Pt as counter and reference electrodes.,Sulfur Tolerant LSCM-based Composite Cathode for High Temperature Electrolysis/Co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2,10.1002/fuce.201600189
2,20569,"Experimental results among pure LSCM, LSCM-GDC, LSCM-YSZ and LSCM-(GDC-YSZ) have shown that LSCM-GDC exhibits the highest H2O electrolysis performance.",Sulfur Tolerant LSCM-based Composite Cathode for High Temperature Electrolysis/Co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2,10.1002/fuce.201600189
3,20569,The ratio between LSCM and GDC is further optimized and it is shown that the LSCM-GDC with 50-50 wt.% for each component exhibits the highest performance.,Sulfur Tolerant LSCM-based Composite Cathode for High Temperature Electrolysis/Co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2,10.1002/fuce.201600189
4,20569,Benchmarking with a 60-40 wt.% Ni-YSZ cathode have shown that the optimized LSCM-GDC cathode exhibits better performance for H2O electrolysis with a lower area specific resistance.,Sulfur Tolerant LSCM-based Composite Cathode for High Temperature Electrolysis/Co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2,10.1002/fuce.201600189
5,20569,"Under a cathodic current of -0.1 A cm(-2), the optimized LSCM-GDC cathode shows much slower degradation, about 10 times slower as compared to the Ni-YSZ cathode when exposed to 10 ppm of SO2 for up to 72h.",Sulfur Tolerant LSCM-based Composite Cathode for High Temperature Electrolysis/Co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2,10.1002/fuce.201600189
