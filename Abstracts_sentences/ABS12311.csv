1,12311,Two Ag-Cu-Ti brazing alloy compositions were studied as gas seals for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Ag-Cu-Ti braze materials for sealing SOFCs,10.1115/1.2784279
2,12311,Yttria-stabilized zirconia pellets were bonded using Ag-35.25Cu-1.75Ti (Cusil-ABA) or Ag-20.1Cu-1.0Ti (average composition; Ag-Cusil).,Ag-Cu-Ti braze materials for sealing SOFCs,10.1115/1.2784279
3,12311,"Both as-brazed filler metals contained metallic Ag and Cu phases, along with continuous titanium oxide layers at the filler metal-zirconia interfaces.",Ag-Cu-Ti braze materials for sealing SOFCs,10.1115/1.2784279
4,12311,The brazed joints were then aged at 700 degrees C for up to 100 h in air or while separating H-2 and air atmospheres.,Ag-Cu-Ti braze materials for sealing SOFCs,10.1115/1.2784279
5,12311,"After annealing in air for 0 100 h at 700 C, degradation in microstructure and hermeticity was more pronounced in Cusil-ABA.",Ag-Cu-Ti braze materials for sealing SOFCs,10.1115/1.2784279
6,12311,"However in H-2-air atmosphere, Cusil-ABA performed better than Ag-Cusil.",Ag-Cu-Ti braze materials for sealing SOFCs,10.1115/1.2784279
7,12311,Ag-Cusil aged in H2 air delaminated from zirconia and its microstructure showed large interconnected pores in Ag-rich regions.,Ag-Cu-Ti braze materials for sealing SOFCs,10.1115/1.2784279
8,12311,The results were confirmed by single-cell tests using each filler metal as a gas seal.,Ag-Cu-Ti braze materials for sealing SOFCs,10.1115/1.2784279
9,12311,Observations of the post-test Cusil-ABA microstructure revealed little degradation.,Ag-Cu-Ti braze materials for sealing SOFCs,10.1115/1.2784279
10,12311,These results indicate that Cusil-ABA is better suited than Ag-Cusil as a SOFC gas seal.,Ag-Cu-Ti braze materials for sealing SOFCs,10.1115/1.2784279
