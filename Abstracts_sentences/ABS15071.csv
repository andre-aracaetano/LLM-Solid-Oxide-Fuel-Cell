1,15071,"Recently, SrTi0.3Fe0.7O3-delta (STF) has been investigated as a highly stable oxygen electrode material for solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) with a sufficiently low resistance for cell operation at temperatures of > 700 degrees C. However, in general, the STF electrode performance is limited at temperatures of <= 700 degrees C due to the low oxygen surface exchange coefficient, which is mainly caused by high Sr surface segregation.",A-site deficient Sr0.9Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ perovskite:A high stable cobalt-free oxygen electrode material for solid oxide electrochemical cells with excellent electrocatalytic activity and CO2 tolerance,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.06.047
2,15071,"To improve the electrode performance, Sr-0.9(Ti0.3Fe0.7)O3-delta (A-STF) with an A-site-deficient design is developed to reduce the Sr content and thus reduce the Sr surface segregation, thereby providing a unique combination of excellent oxygen electrode performance and long-term stability.",A-site deficient Sr0.9Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ perovskite:A high stable cobalt-free oxygen electrode material for solid oxide electrochemical cells with excellent electrocatalytic activity and CO2 tolerance,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.06.047
3,15071,The A-site deficiency reduces the electrode polarization resistance by > 3 times at 600 degrees C and clearly improves the oxygen diffusion and surface exchange coefficients due to the decrease of Sr surface segregation.,A-site deficient Sr0.9Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-δ perovskite:A high stable cobalt-free oxygen electrode material for solid oxide electrochemical cells with excellent electrocatalytic activity and CO2 tolerance,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2022.06.047
