1,5947,"The compatibilities and conductivities of K2NiF4 typed La2Ni0.9Fe0.1O4+delta (L(2)NF91) and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-delta (LNF64) perovskites, promising cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cell, with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) electrolyte were investigated.",Compatibility and conductivity of La2Ni1-xFexO4+δ and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-δ with GDC electrolyte,10.1179/1743676114Y.0000000203
2,5947,L(2)NF91 and LNF64 were synthesised using citrate and modified citrate methods with the calcination temperature of 1000 degrees C for 5 h. The single phased oxides with the average particle sizes of L(2)NF91 and LNF64 similar to 0.2 mu m were obtained.,Compatibility and conductivity of La2Ni1-xFexO4+δ and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-δ with GDC electrolyte,10.1179/1743676114Y.0000000203
3,5947,The thermal expansion coefficients of L(2)NF91 and LNF64 were 12.7 x 10(-6) and 13.2 x 10(-6) K-1 respectively.,Compatibility and conductivity of La2Ni1-xFexO4+δ and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-δ with GDC electrolyte,10.1179/1743676114Y.0000000203
4,5947,The mixtures of cathode materials and the electrolytes were heated between 800 and 1200 degrees C to observe the formation of secondary phases at the operation temperatures of solid oxide fuel cell.,Compatibility and conductivity of La2Ni1-xFexO4+δ and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-δ with GDC electrolyte,10.1179/1743676114Y.0000000203
5,5947,The X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray results indicated that L(2)NF91 and LNF64 had good chemical compatibility with GDC from room temperature up to 900 degrees C. Both L(2)NF91 and LNF64 showed higher conductivities when in contact with GDC electrolyte than with Zr0.92Y0.08O1.96 electrolyte.,Compatibility and conductivity of La2Ni1-xFexO4+δ and LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-δ with GDC electrolyte,10.1179/1743676114Y.0000000203
