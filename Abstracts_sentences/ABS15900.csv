5,15900,"Over the oxide, two main methane reaction regimes were identified: complete oxidation at intermediate temperatures (over the pre-oxidised catalyst only) and methane dissociation at high temperatures.",ACTIVITY AND DEACTIVATION OF LA0.8CA0.2CRO3 IN DRY METHANE USING TEMPERATURE-PROGRAMMED TECHNIQUES,10.1016/0926-860X(95)00018-6
6,15900,Each reaction took place via two mechanisms.,ACTIVITY AND DEACTIVATION OF LA0.8CA0.2CRO3 IN DRY METHANE USING TEMPERATURE-PROGRAMMED TECHNIQUES,10.1016/0926-860X(95)00018-6
