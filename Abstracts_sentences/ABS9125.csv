2,9125,"Herein, a heterogeneous catalyst coating, composed of Ba1-xCe0.8Gd0.2O3-delta and BaCO3, remarkably improves the oxygen adsorption, dissociation capability, and Cr resistance of a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode is demonstrated.",Heterogeneous Catalyst Coating for Boosting the Activity and Chromium Tolerance of Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.202310402
3,9125,"The coherent heterointerface interactions formed between the catalyst coating and LSCF result in varied levels of surface strain and electrostatic interactions, significantly suppressing Sr surface segregation on LSCF.",Heterogeneous Catalyst Coating for Boosting the Activity and Chromium Tolerance of Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.202310402
4,9125,"A single cell with the catalyst coating-decorated LSCF (CC-LSCF) achieves a peak power density of 1.73 W cm-2 at 750 degrees C, with no noticeable performance degradation for 100 h. The CC-LSCF cathode also exhibits outstanding durability under accelerated Cr poisoning conditions, compared with the tremendous degradation rate of 0.42% h-1 for the bare LSCF cathode.",Heterogeneous Catalyst Coating for Boosting the Activity and Chromium Tolerance of Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.202310402
