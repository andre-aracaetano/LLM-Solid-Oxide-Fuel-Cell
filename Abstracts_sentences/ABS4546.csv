1,4546,Extensive works have been performed to diminish cathode polarization for proton-conducting electrolyte based solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) while not much attention is paid to functional anode for improving electrochemical reaction at three-phase-boundaries (TPB).,A highly active anode functional layer for solid oxide fuel cells based on proton-conducting electrolyte BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.002
2,4546,"In this work, a highly active anode functional layer (FL) synthesized by a modified combustion method was employed to significantly elevate the cell performance at intermediate operation temperatures (550-650 degrees C).",A highly active anode functional layer for solid oxide fuel cells based on proton-conducting electrolyte BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.002
3,4546,"The effects of anode structure configuration, FL powder size and thickness on power outputs and electrode polarization were investigated.",A highly active anode functional layer for solid oxide fuel cells based on proton-conducting electrolyte BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.002
4,4546,"A maximum power density of 489 mW cm(-2) and a low electrode polarization resistance of 0.37 Omega cm(2) were achieved at 650 degrees C, indicating fuel gas transport and hydrogen oxidation reaction at TPB sites largely contribute to total cell resistance which could be effectively diminished by optimization of anodic interface environment with the adoption of highly active anode powders.",A highly active anode functional layer for solid oxide fuel cells based on proton-conducting electrolyte BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.002
