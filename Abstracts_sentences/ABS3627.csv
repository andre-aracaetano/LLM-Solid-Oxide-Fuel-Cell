1,3627,Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) have been the focus of research due to their advantageous properties compared to oxygen ion -conducting solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Surface reconfiguration on triple conductive perovskite cathode with exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability for protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234164
2,3627,"However, the biggest obstacles to the development of PCFC are the lower proton conductivity and the poor stability in high concentration steam environment.",Surface reconfiguration on triple conductive perovskite cathode with exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability for protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234164
3,3627,"Herein, we report a novel composite cathode with surface reconfiguration, comprised of BaCoO3-delta (BCO) nanoparticles by water -induced precipitation and Ba0.9Pr0.1Co0.7Fe0.2Y0.1O3-delta (BPCFY) substrate with e(-)/ O2-/H+ triple conducting behavior, exhibiting high catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and stability in high steam concentration.",Surface reconfiguration on triple conductive perovskite cathode with exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability for protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234164
4,3627,"With wet hydrogen (3 vol% H2O) as fuel and wet air (3 vol% H2O) as oxidant, the peak power density of NiO-BZCYYb|BZCYYb|BPCFY single cell reaches 750 m & sdot;cm(-2 )at 700 degrees C, approximately 25 % higher than that using dry air at cathode side.",Surface reconfiguration on triple conductive perovskite cathode with exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability for protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234164
5,3627,"Such improvement performance can be attributed to the precipitation of BaCoO3-delta nanoparticles that increase the active adsorption sites as well as the increased oxygen vacancy concentration by Pr doping in BaCo0.7Fe0.2Y0.1O3-delta, which synergistically expand the triple phase boundary and facilitate ions migration.",Surface reconfiguration on triple conductive perovskite cathode with exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability for protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234164
6,3627,This work provided a promising approach to enhance the catalytic activity of PCFC at lower temperatures while also improving its tolerance to steam.,Surface reconfiguration on triple conductive perovskite cathode with exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability for protonic ceramic fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234164
