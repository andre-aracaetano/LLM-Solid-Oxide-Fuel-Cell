2,12051,The metallic plates act as a current collector to which a few conducting wires made of conventional heat-resisting alloys can be attached.,Brazing of metallic conductors onto ceramic plates in solid oxide fuel cells - Part 1 Attaching a current collector,10.1023/A:1017580826793
3,12051,The alloy CrFe5Y(2)O(3)1 was found to be a suitable material for the current collector because its thermal expansion coefficient matches that of LaCrO(3) better than heat-resisting nickel- or iron-based alloys.,Brazing of metallic conductors onto ceramic plates in solid oxide fuel cells - Part 1 Attaching a current collector,10.1023/A:1017580826793
4,12051,"Among various filler alloys tested, SCP6 (Cu with 18 wt% Pd) enables the best wetting of LaCrO(3) and CrFe5Y(2)O(3)1 plates, leading to good adhesion between them.",Brazing of metallic conductors onto ceramic plates in solid oxide fuel cells - Part 1 Attaching a current collector,10.1023/A:1017580826793
5,12051,Several approaches were successfully pursued to reduce the bending of brazed LaCrO(3)/SCP6/CrFe5Y(2)O(3)1 joints.,Brazing of metallic conductors onto ceramic plates in solid oxide fuel cells - Part 1 Attaching a current collector,10.1023/A:1017580826793
6,12051,The area specific resistance of some LaCrO(3)/SCP6/CrFe5Y(2)O(3)1 joints increased slightly during annealing (1000 degreesC in air for 2400 h) due to oxidation in the filler alloy.,Brazing of metallic conductors onto ceramic plates in solid oxide fuel cells - Part 1 Attaching a current collector,10.1023/A:1017580826793
