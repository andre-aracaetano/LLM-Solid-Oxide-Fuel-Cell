5,497,After deposition of a cathode with the composition La0.65Sr0.35MnO3 the electrochemical properties of such a fuel cell were tested under operating conditions at temperatures between 600 degrees C and 850 degrees C. Current-voltage curves were recorded and impedance measurements were performed to calculate apparent activation energies from the fitted resistance data.,Reactive Sputtering Deposition and Electrochemical Characterisation of Thin Solid Electrolyte Membranes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/BF02377765
6,497,The conductivity of the YSZ films varied between 4.6.10(-6) S/cm and 2.2.10(-5) S/cm at 400 degrees C and the fuel cell gave a reasonable power density of 0.4 W/cm(2) at 0.7 V and 790 degrees C using H-2 with 3 % H2O as fuel gas.,Reactive Sputtering Deposition and Electrochemical Characterisation of Thin Solid Electrolyte Membranes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/BF02377765
7,497,The gas compositions were varied to distinguish the electrochemical processes of the anode and cathode in the impedance spectra.,Reactive Sputtering Deposition and Electrochemical Characterisation of Thin Solid Electrolyte Membranes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/BF02377765
