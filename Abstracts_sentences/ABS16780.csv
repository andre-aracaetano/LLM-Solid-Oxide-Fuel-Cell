2,16780,"The cells, mechanically supported by cupper tube, were provided by National Metal and Materials Technology Center, and they contain the electrode materials of nickel and yttria stabilized zirconia cermet for anode and lanthanum strontium manganate for cathode.",Sulfur diffusion of hydrogen sulfide contaminants to cathode in a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134713
3,16780,Pure hydrogen and hydrogen gas containing diluted hydrogen sulfide were repeatedly switched for the anode feed at the constant cell voltage of 0.9 V. Exposure times of 30 and 60 min were applied to study the effects of the poisoning interval.,Sulfur diffusion of hydrogen sulfide contaminants to cathode in a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134713
4,16780,"Then, the obtained results were analyzed.",Sulfur diffusion of hydrogen sulfide contaminants to cathode in a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134713
5,16780,"Herein, we reported two effects that had not been reported previously: the poisoning interval effect on the same hydrogen sulfide dosage and the poisoning sulfur-transport effect to the cathode surface.",Sulfur diffusion of hydrogen sulfide contaminants to cathode in a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134713
6,16780,"In the same dosage experiment, the recovery process was required before complete adsorption of sulfur species, and it supported not to fully block active sites of hydrogen adsorption and oxidation, and thus it would expand a cell lifespan on the contamination.",Sulfur diffusion of hydrogen sulfide contaminants to cathode in a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134713
7,16780,"In the analysis, different contamination steps between short and long term exposure time were presented, and thermodynamic parameters were calculated.",Sulfur diffusion of hydrogen sulfide contaminants to cathode in a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134713
8,16780,"Also, transport of elemental sulfur from the anode to the cathode surface was presented using the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy technique.",Sulfur diffusion of hydrogen sulfide contaminants to cathode in a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134713
9,16780,"The results appear to be strong evidence for the transport of sulfur from anode to cathode, and this means that the effect of sulfur diffusion to the cathode should be considered one major reason for performance degradation.",Sulfur diffusion of hydrogen sulfide contaminants to cathode in a micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134713
