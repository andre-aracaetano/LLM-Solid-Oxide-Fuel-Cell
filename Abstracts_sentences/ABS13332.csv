2,13332,"Power density for the Ru/CGO infiltrated cell reached similar to 0.7 W cm(-2) at 850 degrees C, 4% H2O/H-2, whereas the Ni/CGO infiltrated cell reached similar to 0.3 W cm(-2), with the current morphologies and loadings.",Effect of Ru/CGO versus Ni/CGO Co-Infiltration on the Performance and Stability of STN-Based SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201400013
3,13332,"Operation at 0.125 A cm(-2), 850 degrees C, feeding 50% H2O/H-2 to the node and air to the cathode, for a period >300 h showed superior stability for h Ru/CGO infiltrated cell, with similar to 0.04 mV h(-1) degradation rate, when compared to the infiltrated Ni/CGO infiltrated cell (similar to 0.5 mV h(-1)).",Effect of Ru/CGO versus Ni/CGO Co-Infiltration on the Performance and Stability of STN-Based SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.201400013
