1,13158,"The electrochemical performance of La0.65Sr0.3MnO3-type (LSM) anode-supported single cells, produced by alternative production processes, has been investigated at intermediate temperatures.",The electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs with LSM-type cathodes produced by alternative processing routes,10.1115/1.2173667
2,13158,"In particular, three different variations of the production route were investigated in more detail: (1) the use of nonground LSM powder for the cathode current collector layer, (2) the use of noncalcined and nonground YSZ powder for the cathode functional layer, and (3) the use of tape casting versus warm pressing as the production process for anode substrates.",The electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs with LSM-type cathodes produced by alternative processing routes,10.1115/1.2173667
3,13158,Results from electrochemical measurements performed between 700 and 900 degrees C with H-2 (3 vol % H2O) as fuel gas and air as the oxidant showed that performance increased with increasing grain size of the outer cathode current collector layer: the highest performance was achieved with nonground LSM powder.,The electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs with LSM-type cathodes produced by alternative processing routes,10.1115/1.2173667
4,13158,"Furthermore, performance was not adversely influenced by the use of noncalcined and nonground YSZ for the cathode functional layer.",The electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs with LSM-type cathodes produced by alternative processing routes,10.1115/1.2173667
5,13158,"Also the use of anode substrates with a thickness of about 0.7 mm and produced by tape casting, instead of those with a thickness of about 1.5 mm and applied by warm pressing, did not detrimentally affect the electrochemical performance of this type of SOFC.",The electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs with LSM-type cathodes produced by alternative processing routes,10.1115/1.2173667
