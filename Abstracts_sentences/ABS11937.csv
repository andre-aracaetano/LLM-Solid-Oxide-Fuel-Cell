1,11937,In this work it was determined the necessary anodic recirculation ratio that maximizes the hydrogen production for a process integrated by a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a micro-reformer fed with biogas.,"PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN BY SYNERGY OF SOFCS AND MICROREFORMERS, PART 1: THEORETICAL STUDY OF MICROREFORMER PARAMETERS",
2,11937,"For this purpose, a thermodynamic study was made of the recirculation effects over: a) the ratio of reforming agents/methane, b) the outlet/inlet atomic hydrogen ratio (psi), c) the reactor relative size, and d) the normalized electric energy output.","PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN BY SYNERGY OF SOFCS AND MICROREFORMERS, PART 1: THEORETICAL STUDY OF MICROREFORMER PARAMETERS",
3,11937,"The results show that in order to avoid coking, a steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C) higher than 2 is unnecessary, for a combined reforming with steam and CO2.","PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN BY SYNERGY OF SOFCS AND MICROREFORMERS, PART 1: THEORETICAL STUDY OF MICROREFORMER PARAMETERS",
4,11937,"Moreover, it was found that psi is maximized at a recirculation ratio of 0.22; and that an increase of recirculation caused a decrease in the electrical energy produced, and an increase in the relative reactor volume.","PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN BY SYNERGY OF SOFCS AND MICROREFORMERS, PART 1: THEORETICAL STUDY OF MICROREFORMER PARAMETERS",
5,11937,"Finally, it was found that a recirculation ratio of 0.22 was the best option for an operating temperature of 850 degrees C.","PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN BY SYNERGY OF SOFCS AND MICROREFORMERS, PART 1: THEORETICAL STUDY OF MICROREFORMER PARAMETERS",
6,11937,"If the recirculation ratio is exceeded to achieve S/C= 2, the hydrogen fraction produced will decrease 50% and the reactor volume will increase 118% for the same amount of biogas fed.","PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN BY SYNERGY OF SOFCS AND MICROREFORMERS, PART 1: THEORETICAL STUDY OF MICROREFORMER PARAMETERS",
