2,17659,The impedence responses at different electrode potentials of the half-cell and symmetric single-cell setups are compared and analyzed by the equivalent circuit modeling method.,Effect of Cell Geometry on the Electrochemical Parameters of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3043421
3,17659,The deconvolution of impedence spectra for single cells has been achieved by a differential impedence real part vs ac frequency plot analysis method.,Effect of Cell Geometry on the Electrochemical Parameters of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3043421
4,17659,"The results indicate that the three-electrode half-cell configuration is more suitable for fundamental research of material parameters at different electrode potentials (measured vs Pt vertical bar O-2 reference electrode), whereas the simpler two-electrode single-cell setup allows the estimation of cathode performance in approximate working conditions.",Effect of Cell Geometry on the Electrochemical Parameters of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3043421
