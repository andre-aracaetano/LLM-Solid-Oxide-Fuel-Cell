1,18789,"We prepared a highly active and stable cathode catalyst for a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), decorated with in situ exsolved Fe nanoparticles (NPs) socketed on La1.2Sr0.8Mn0.4Fe0.6O4-alpha (R.P.LSMF), toward the CO2 electrolysis reaction to produce CO selectively.",Highly efficient CO2 electrolysis to CO on Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxide with in situ exsolved Fe nanoparticles,10.1039/d0ta11328j
2,18789,"This catalyst was derived from the perovskite structure of La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSMF) by simple annealing in a H-2 atmosphere and showed high current densities of 2.04, 1.43, and 0.884 A cm(-2) at 850, 800, and 750 degrees C, respectively, at a voltage of 1.5 V with corresponding total polarization resistance values of 0.205, 0.326, and 0.587 omega cm(2), respectively, at an open circuit voltage.",Highly efficient CO2 electrolysis to CO on Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxide with in situ exsolved Fe nanoparticles,10.1039/d0ta11328j
3,18789,The highly improved performance should be ascribed to the in situ exsolved Fe NPs anchored on Ruddlesden-Popper oxide and to the increased contents of oxygen vacancies in R.P.LSMF.,Highly efficient CO2 electrolysis to CO on Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxide with in situ exsolved Fe nanoparticles,10.1039/d0ta11328j
4,18789,"More importantly, this active catalyst also exhibited a stable voltage profile for 100 h operation at an constant current density of 1.8 A cm(-2), suggesting that the catalyst Fe-R.P.LSMF proposed in this study is a highly promising candidate for use in an efficient SOEC cathode for CO2 electrolysis processes.",Highly efficient CO2 electrolysis to CO on Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxide with in situ exsolved Fe nanoparticles,10.1039/d0ta11328j
