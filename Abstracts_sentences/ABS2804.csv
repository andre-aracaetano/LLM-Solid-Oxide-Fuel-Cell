1,2804,The current study examined the effect of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) and La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) coatings on the electrical properties and oxidation resistance of Crofer22 APU at 800 degrees C hot air.,High temperature oxidation behavior of interconnect coated with LSCF and LSM for solid oxide fuel cell by screen printing,10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.10.013
2,2804,LSCF and LSM were coated on Crofer22 APU by screen printing and sintered over temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1100 degrees C in N-2.,High temperature oxidation behavior of interconnect coated with LSCF and LSM for solid oxide fuel cell by screen printing,10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.10.013
3,2804,"The coated alloy was first checked for compositions, morphology and interface conditions and then treated in a simulated oxidizing environment at 800 degrees C for 200 h. After measuring the long-term electrical resistance, the area specific resistance (ASR) at 800 degrees C for the alloy coated with LSCF was less than its counterpart coated with LSM.",High temperature oxidation behavior of interconnect coated with LSCF and LSM for solid oxide fuel cell by screen printing,10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.10.013
