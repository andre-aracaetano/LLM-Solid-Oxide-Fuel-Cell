1,20428,Lanthanum-containing materials are widely used in oxidative catalytic and electrocatalytic reactions such as oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,An In Situ Temperature-Dependent Study of La2O3 Reactivation Process,10.3389/fchem.2021.694559
2,20428,"However, many of these materials are highly susceptible to air contamination which means ex situ characterization results generally cannot be associated with their reactivity.",An In Situ Temperature-Dependent Study of La2O3 Reactivation Process,10.3389/fchem.2021.694559
3,20428,"In this study, the activation processes of an in situ-prepared bulk La2O2CO3 sample and an ex situ as-prepared La(OH)(3) sample are in situ investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and online mass spectroscopy (MS).",An In Situ Temperature-Dependent Study of La2O3 Reactivation Process,10.3389/fchem.2021.694559
4,20428,"Results indicate that the La2O2CO3 sample, during linear heating to 800 degrees C, always contains some carbonates near the surface region, which supports a two-step model of bulk carbonate decomposition through surface sites.",An In Situ Temperature-Dependent Study of La2O3 Reactivation Process,10.3389/fchem.2021.694559
5,20428,The La(OH)(3) sample structure evolution is more complex due to contaminations from air exposure.,An In Situ Temperature-Dependent Study of La2O3 Reactivation Process,10.3389/fchem.2021.694559
6,20428,"Together with TGA results, online mass analysis of water and CO2 signal loss showed that three major catalyst structure phase change steps and a preheating up to 800 degrees C are required for the as-prepared material to be transferred to La2O3.",An In Situ Temperature-Dependent Study of La2O3 Reactivation Process,10.3389/fchem.2021.694559
7,20428,This process is carefully investigated combining the three in situ methodologies.,An In Situ Temperature-Dependent Study of La2O3 Reactivation Process,10.3389/fchem.2021.694559
8,20428,"XPS and XRD data further reveal transformations of variety of in situ surface structures and forms including hybrid phases with hydroxyl, carbonates, and oxide as the sample heated to different temperatures within the range from 200 to 800 degrees C.",An In Situ Temperature-Dependent Study of La2O3 Reactivation Process,10.3389/fchem.2021.694559
9,20428,The results provide useful insights on the activation and deactivation of La-contained materials.,An In Situ Temperature-Dependent Study of La2O3 Reactivation Process,10.3389/fchem.2021.694559
