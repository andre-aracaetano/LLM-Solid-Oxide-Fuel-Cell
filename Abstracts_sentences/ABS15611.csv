1,15611,Transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the local chemistry and microstructure of the active cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells operated for 500 h (at 700 and 800 degrees C) under different electrochemical conditions while exposed to a chromia-forming stainless steel.,"Microstructural Degradation of (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Uncoated E-Brite Interconnects",10.1149/1.3515073
2,15611,"Several distinct microstructural changes were observed owing to chromium interactions with the (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSM)-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cathode; the nature and magnitude of which depended on the temperature, electrochemical load, and physical location.","Microstructural Degradation of (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Uncoated E-Brite Interconnects",10.1149/1.3515073
3,15611,"Nanosized particles of (Cr,Mn)(3)O-4 and Cr2O3 were observed on the surface of the YSZ, regardless of the overall extent of degradation; the quantity increased with decreasing temperature and increasing current.","Microstructural Degradation of (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Uncoated E-Brite Interconnects",10.1149/1.3515073
4,15611,"The results indicate that Mn species facilitate the formation of a stable Cr-Mn-O nuclei on the YSZ, on which further growth occurs, including growth of Cr2O3.","Microstructural Degradation of (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Uncoated E-Brite Interconnects",10.1149/1.3515073
5,15611,"In cases of severe performance degradation, LSM decomposes completely, which does not appear to be strongly correlated with the nanoparticles on the YSZ, but results from a more destructive mechanism.","Microstructural Degradation of (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Uncoated E-Brite Interconnects",10.1149/1.3515073
6,15611,"Following this decomposition, severe pore filling of Cr-containing species occurs.","Microstructural Degradation of (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Uncoated E-Brite Interconnects",10.1149/1.3515073
7,15611,The amount of microstructural degradation was largest near the cathode/electrolyte interface directly beneath the interconnect-cathode contact channels.,"Microstructural Degradation of (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Uncoated E-Brite Interconnects",10.1149/1.3515073
8,15611,"These results indicate that two distinct mechanisms of degradation occur, with the electrochemical decomposition of (La,Sr)MnO3 as the primary cause for severe performance degradation.","Microstructural Degradation of (La,Sr)MnO3/YSZ Cathodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Uncoated E-Brite Interconnects",10.1149/1.3515073
