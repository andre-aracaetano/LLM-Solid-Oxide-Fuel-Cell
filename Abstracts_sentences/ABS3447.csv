1,3447,A nickel and yttrium-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) composite is one of the most commonly used anode materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Electrochemical Performance and Microstructure Characterization of Nickel Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia Anode,10.1002/aic.12080
2,3447,One of the drawbacks of the Ni-YSZ anode is its susceptibility to deactivation due to the formation of carbonaceous species when hydrocarbons are used as fuel supplies.,Electrochemical Performance and Microstructure Characterization of Nickel Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia Anode,10.1002/aic.12080
3,3447,We therefore initiated an electrochemical study of the influence of methane (CH4) on the performance of Ni-YSZ anodes by examining the kinetics of the oxidation of CH4 and H-2 over operating temperatures of 600-800 degrees C. Anode performance deterioration was then correlated with the degree of carbonization observed on the anode using ex-situ X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy techniques.,Electrochemical Performance and Microstructure Characterization of Nickel Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia Anode,10.1002/aic.12080
4,3447,Results showed that carbonaceous species led to a significant deactivation of Ni-YSZ anode toward methane oxidation.,Electrochemical Performance and Microstructure Characterization of Nickel Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia Anode,10.1002/aic.12080
