1,14800,"Based on the interactions and the formation of secondary phases of various SOFC cathode materials if they are processed with the restrictions of an inert-supported cell utilizing forsterite as support material (described in Part I), impedance measurements and cell tests were performed to clarify the impact of the described interactions on the material combinations electrocatalytic performance.",Selection of cathode materials for forsterite-supported solid oxide fuel cells - Part II: Electro-catalytic activity,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227811
2,14800,Subsequently Part II focusses on the preselection of a cathode material displaying a higher catalytic activity compared to the currently used LSM/8YSZ cathode of the inert-supported cell concept.,Selection of cathode materials for forsterite-supported solid oxide fuel cells - Part II: Electro-catalytic activity,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227811
3,14800,"In order to do so symmetrical cells, mimicking the processing, were fabricated by co-firing various cathodes (La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3; Pr0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3; La0.58Sr0.4CoO3; La0.58Sr0.4FeO3; La0.58Ca0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3; (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)Fe0.2Mn0.8PO3; (La0.9Sr0.1)(0.95)Fe0.7Mn0.3O3) together with an La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 current collector layer (CCL) or with one LSM CCL containing 20 wt% of forsterite.",Selection of cathode materials for forsterite-supported solid oxide fuel cells - Part II: Electro-catalytic activity,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227811
4,14800,"The results indicate that the catalytic activity of the cathodes cannot simply be related to the number or amount of secondary phases formed during the co-firing if forsterite is present or not as LSF, which displayed the formation of numerous secondary phases (Part I), exhibits the best catalytic activity.",Selection of cathode materials for forsterite-supported solid oxide fuel cells - Part II: Electro-catalytic activity,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227811
