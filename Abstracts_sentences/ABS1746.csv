1,1746,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer many potential benefits as an energy conversion device.,Modeling and Verification of Steady State Operational Changes on the Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3080811
2,1746,This paper addresses experimental validation of a numerical SOFC model that has been developed.,Modeling and Verification of Steady State Operational Changes on the Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3080811
3,1746,Results are compared at steady state operation for temperatures ranging from 1073 K to 1173 K and for H-2 gas concentrations fuel supplies of 10-90% with a balance of N-2.,Modeling and Verification of Steady State Operational Changes on the Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3080811
4,1746,"The results agree well with a maximum of 13.3% difference seen between the numerical and experimental results, which is within the limit of the experimental uncertainties and the material constants that are measured, with most comparisons well below this level.",Modeling and Verification of Steady State Operational Changes on the Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3080811
5,1746,It is concluded that since the model is very sensitive to material properties and temperature that for the best results they should be as specific as possible to the experiment.,Modeling and Verification of Steady State Operational Changes on the Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3080811
6,1746,"These specific properties were demonstrated in this paper and a validation of a full fuel cell model, with a concentration on the anode, was presented.",Modeling and Verification of Steady State Operational Changes on the Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3080811
