2,12650,This problem affects the lifetime of solid oxide fuel cells and solid oxide electrolysers using chromia-forming alloys as interconnectors.,Chromium Vaporisation from AISI 441 Stainless Steel Oxidised in Humidified Oxygen,10.1007/s11085-013-9379-x
3,12650,"In this work, AISI 441, a commercial grade stainless steel which chromium vaporisation investigation has not been reported so far, was chosen for study.",Chromium Vaporisation from AISI 441 Stainless Steel Oxidised in Humidified Oxygen,10.1007/s11085-013-9379-x
4,12650,Chromium vaporisation rates of bare AISI 441 and AISI 430 and AISI 441 and AISI 430 coated with Mn-Co spinel by electroplating method were measured in an atmosphere of 5 % H2O in O-2 over the temperature range of 650-900 A degrees C with the linear velocity of the humidified oxygen stream varied in the range of 0.8-3.0 cm s(-1).,Chromium Vaporisation from AISI 441 Stainless Steel Oxidised in Humidified Oxygen,10.1007/s11085-013-9379-x
5,12650,"For uncoated samples, AISI 441 showed a lower chromium vaporisation rate in comparison with that of AISI 430.",Chromium Vaporisation from AISI 441 Stainless Steel Oxidised in Humidified Oxygen,10.1007/s11085-013-9379-x
6,12650,Mn-Co spinel coating could reduce the chromium vaporisation rate from AISI 430 surface.,Chromium Vaporisation from AISI 441 Stainless Steel Oxidised in Humidified Oxygen,10.1007/s11085-013-9379-x
7,12650,"However, on the contrary, the Mn-Co spinel coating could not only fail to suppress the chromium vaporisation, but it also promoted the chromium vaporisation from AISI 441 surface by 2 times.",Chromium Vaporisation from AISI 441 Stainless Steel Oxidised in Humidified Oxygen,10.1007/s11085-013-9379-x
