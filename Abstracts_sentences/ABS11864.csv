4,11864,"As a result, the single cells display enhanced initial electrochemical performance and performance stability compared with the cell without the catalyst in isooctane/air at 750 C. On the other hand, carbon species could still be identified in the NiMo-YSZ catalyst after operating the single cells for 12 h, which deteriorates the reforming and electrochemical performance.",A NiMo-YSZ catalyst support layer for regenerable solid oxide fuel cells running on isooctane,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119907
