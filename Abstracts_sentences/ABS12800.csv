2,12800,"The porous metal substrate provides the advantages of MS-SOCs such as high thermal and redox cycling tolerance, low-cost of structural materials, and mechanical ruggedness.","Approaches for co-sintering metal-supported proton-conducting solid oxide cells with Ba(Zr,Ce,Y,Yb)O3-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.03.181
3,12800,"In this work, the viability of co-sintering fabrication of metal-supported proton conducting solid oxide cells using BaZr1-x-yCexYyO3-delta (BZCY) is investigated.","Approaches for co-sintering metal-supported proton-conducting solid oxide cells with Ba(Zr,Ce,Y,Yb)O3-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.03.181
4,12800,"BZCY ceramics are sintered at 1450 degrees C in reducing environment alone and supported on Fe-Cr alloy metal support, and key characteristics such as Ba loss, sintering behavior, and chemical compatibility with metal support are determined.","Approaches for co-sintering metal-supported proton-conducting solid oxide cells with Ba(Zr,Ce,Y,Yb)O3-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.03.181
5,12800,"Critical challenges are identified for this fabrication approach, including: Contamination of the electrolyte with Si and Cr from the metal support, incomplete electrolyte sintering, and evaporation of electrolyte constituents.","Approaches for co-sintering metal-supported proton-conducting solid oxide cells with Ba(Zr,Ce,Y,Yb)O3-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.03.181
6,12800,"Various approaches to overcome these limitations are proposed, and preliminary assessment indicates that the use of barrier layers, low-Si-content stainless steel, and sintering aids warrant further development.","Approaches for co-sintering metal-supported proton-conducting solid oxide cells with Ba(Zr,Ce,Y,Yb)O3-δ electrolyte",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.03.181
