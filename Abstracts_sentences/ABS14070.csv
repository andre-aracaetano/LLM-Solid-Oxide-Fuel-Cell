1,14070,The catalytic activity of symmetrical LSM (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) cells operated under single chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) conditions was investigated for methane-to-oxygen ratios R-in between 1 and 2.,Catalytic activity and performance of LSM cathode materials in single chamber SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.020
2,14070,"The oxidation reactions over electrodes sintered at 1100 degrees C (LSM1100) and 1200 degrees C (LSM1200) were studied, and the effect of any combustion was followed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).",Catalytic activity and performance of LSM cathode materials in single chamber SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.020
3,14070,The activity of the LSM oo electrode increases with temperature.,Catalytic activity and performance of LSM cathode materials in single chamber SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.020

5,14070,"As a consequence, oxygen depletion is occurring and a low frequency semicircle in the EIS spectra becomes predominant.",Catalytic activity and performance of LSM cathode materials in single chamber SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.020
6,14070,An increase of the sintering temperature to 1200 degrees C leads to a decrease in the catalytic activity.,Catalytic activity and performance of LSM cathode materials in single chamber SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.020
7,14070,"A LSM1100 electrode deposited on a Julich half-cell proves to reach better performance at 600 degrees C than at 700 degrees C. On such complete cells, however, the catalytic combustion becomes much more complex than on a LSM cathode alone.",Catalytic activity and performance of LSM cathode materials in single chamber SOFC,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.02.020
