1,18149,The electrochemical performance of La0.5Sr1.5MnO4 +/-delta (L5S15M) in reducing atmosphere was investigated using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on Au/L5S15M/GDC/YSZ/GDC/L5S15M/Au symmetrical cell.,Performance of La0.5Sr1.5MnO4±δ Ruddlesden-Popper manganite as electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells. Part B. the hydrogen oxidation reaction,10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136494
2,18149,"In this research, the electrochemical performance of symmetrical cells sintered at different temperatures cells was evaluated in various reducing atmospheres: 3% H-2/Ar (3% H2O), dry 3% H-2/Ar, and pure H-2 (3% H2O).",Performance of La0.5Sr1.5MnO4±δ Ruddlesden-Popper manganite as electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells.

3,18149,"The lowest values for the area specific resistance (ASR) were acquired for the L5S15M electrode sintered at 1150 degrees C. For the hydrogen oxidation reaction, three rate limiting processes were identified and for all the electrode elaboration conditions, the low frequency response assigned to surface diffusion represents the highest contribution to the total polarization resistance.",Performance of La0.5Sr1.5MnO4±δ Ruddlesden-Popper manganite as electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells.
