1,4427,Low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that efficiently utilize widely available hydrocarbon resources are highly desirable for cost reduction and durability purposes.,Electrochemical performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells running on syngas from pyrolytic urban sludge,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.268
2,4427,"In this work, SOFCs consisting of highly ionic conductive ceria-carbonate composite electrolytes and lithiated transition metal oxide symmetric electrodes are assembled and their electrochemical performances at reduced temperature (<650 degrees C) are investigated using syngas fuel (44.65% H2, 10.19% CH4, 2.01% CO and the balanced CO2) derived from pyrolytic urban sludge.",Electrochemical performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells running on syngas from pyrolytic urban sludge,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.268
3,4427,The cell gives a peak power output of 127 mW cm-2 at 600 degrees C and shows a relatively stable operation for 11 hours under constant voltage operational conditions.,Electrochemical performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells running on syngas from pyrolytic urban sludge,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.268
4,4427,"Though the composite electrode presents a moderately high polarization resistance toward CH4 and CO oxidation and the electrochemical performance is highly correlated with the microstructure of ceria-carbonate electrolyte, it is interesting to see that a higher concentration of methane is obtained after the fuel cell reaction, which may suggest an alternative approach to realize the power and chemical co-generation within such a SOFC reactor.",Electrochemical performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells running on syngas from pyrolytic urban sludge,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.268
5,4427,"Finally, the symmetric electrode shows high resistance toward carbon deposition, possibly due to its high alkaline nature.",Electrochemical performance of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells running on syngas from pyrolytic urban sludge,10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.02.268
