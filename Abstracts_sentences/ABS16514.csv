2,16514,"Formed SDC thin films were characterized using different X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and impedance spectroscopy.",Structural and electrical study of samarium doped cerium oxide thin films prepared by e-beam evaporation,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.09.036
3,16514,The deposition rate of formed SDC thin films was changed from 2 angstrom/s to 16 angstrom/s. XRD analysis shows that all thin films have a cubic (FCC) structure and repeat the crystallographic orientation of the initial powders evaporated with different deposition rate and on different substrates.,Structural and electrical study of samarium doped cerium oxide thin films prepared by e-beam evaporation,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.09.036
4,16514,The crystallite size increases from 7.7 nm to 10.3 nm and from 7.2 nm to 9.2 nm on Alloy 600 substrate and optical quartz (SiO2) substrate respectively as the thin film deposition rate increases.,Structural and electrical study of samarium doped cerium oxide thin films prepared by e-beam evaporation,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.09.036

7,16514,"The best ionic conductivity (sigma(g) = 1.34 Sm-1 and sigma(gb) = 2.29 Sm-1 at 873 K temperature, activation energy Delta E-g = 0.91 eV and Delta E-g = 0.99 eV) was achieved for SDC thin films formed at 4 angstrom/s deposition rate.",Structural and electrical study of samarium doped cerium oxide thin films prepared by e-beam evaporation,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.09.036
8,16514,"It was found that the highest density (5.25 g/cm(3)) and the lowest relaxation time in grain (t(g) = 9.83 x 10(-7) s), and the lowest blocking factor (0.39) is in SDC thin films formed at 4 angstrom/s deposition rate.",Structural and electrical study of samarium doped cerium oxide thin films prepared by e-beam evaporation,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.09.036
