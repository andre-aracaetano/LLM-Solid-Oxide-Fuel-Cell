1,18047,Gadolinium doped ceria oxide (GDC) thin films were grown evaporating (Ce0.9Gd0.1)O-1.95 ceramic powder by using e-beam deposition technique.,Formation of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films by electron beam deposition,
2,18047,Operating technical parameters that influence thin film properties were studied.,Formation of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films by electron beam deposition,
3,18047,The GDC thin films (2 mu m - 3 mu m of thickness) were deposited on two different types of substrates: porous NiO-YSZ (nickel oxide - yttrium stabilized zirconium) and Alloy 600 (Fe-Ni-Cr).,Formation of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films by electron beam deposition,
4,18047,The influence of electron gun power on thin film structure and surface morphology were investigated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.,Formation of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films by electron beam deposition,
5,18047,It was found that electron gun power (changed in the range of 0.66 kW - 1.05 kW) has the influence on the crystallite size (it varied between 7.6 nm - 14.3 nm) of GDC thin films and decreased linearly increasing e-beam gun power.,Formation of gadolinium doped ceria oxide thin films by electron beam deposition,
