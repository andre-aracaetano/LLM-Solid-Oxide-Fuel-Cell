1,19039,Melilite type ceramics ABC(3)O(7) such as La1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 are a new class of oxide conductors where the conductivity is carried out through interstitial oxygen ions.,Synthesis and electrical conductivity of various melilite-type electrolytes Ln1+xSr1-xGa3O7+x/2,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.04.005
2,19039,"This work presents the attempt to replace the A-site element La with the other lanthanide elements and Y, resulting in various Ln(1+x)Sr(1-x)Ga(3)O(7+x/2) ceramics, in which Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Yb, Y, and 0.1 <0.54.",Synthesis and electrical conductivity of various melilite-type electrolytes Ln1+xSr1-xGa3O7+x/2,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.04.005
3,19039,X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the melilite structure could be formed when the replacement is conducted with most lanthanides but not Yb and Y. Impedance spectroscopy demonstrates that the conductivity decreases dramatically with the decreasing of Ln(3+) size and the charge-carrier concentration.,Synthesis and electrical conductivity of various melilite-type electrolytes Ln1+xSr1-xGa3O7+x/2,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.04.005
4,19039,"These results suggest that, as an interstitial oxide ion electrolyte, La1.54Sr0.46Ca3O7.27 is the most promising ceramic in the Ln(1+x)Sr(1-x)Ga(3)O(7+x/2) melilite family since La3+ has the largest ionic radius of the lanthanide elements.",Synthesis and electrical conductivity of various melilite-type electrolytes Ln1+xSr1-xGa3O7+x/2,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.04.005
