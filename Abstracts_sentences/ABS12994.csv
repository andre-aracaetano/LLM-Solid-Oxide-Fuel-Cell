2,12994,"First, the paper describes comprehensively how a grid-connected SOFC power plant can be modeled into a multi-machine power system.",Modelling a grid-connected SOFC power plant into power systems for small-signal stability analysis and control,10.1002/etep.662
3,12994,The model established can be used for power system small-signal stability analysis.,Modelling a grid-connected SOFC power plant into power systems for small-signal stability analysis and control,10.1002/etep.662
4,12994,"Second, a localized model of the grid-connected SOFC power plant is proposed.",Modelling a grid-connected SOFC power plant into power systems for small-signal stability analysis and control,10.1002/etep.662
5,12994,This localized model can be used for the design of a power system stabilizer attached to the SOFC power plant to improve power system small-signal stability.,Modelling a grid-connected SOFC power plant into power systems for small-signal stability analysis and control,10.1002/etep.662
6,12994,The design proposed is simple because establishment of the localized model does not need to obtain and validate the information of the entire multi-machine power system.,Modelling a grid-connected SOFC power plant into power systems for small-signal stability analysis and control,10.1002/etep.662
7,12994,"In the paper, an example four-machine power system integrated with a SOFC power plant is presented.",Modelling a grid-connected SOFC power plant into power systems for small-signal stability analysis and control,10.1002/etep.662
8,12994,"The example demonstrates the effectiveness of the stabilizer designed by the proposed method based on the localized model, which is confirmed by the modal computation and non-linear simulation.",Modelling a grid-connected SOFC power plant into power systems for small-signal stability analysis and control,10.1002/etep.662
