2,9941,"In this study, an integrated system comprising a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC), hot-water storage tank (HWST) and absorption refrigeration (AR) cycle is considered.","Integration of solid-oxide fuel cells and absorption refrigeration for efficient combined cooling, heat and power production",10.1093/ce/zkaa019
3,9941,The SOFC model was developed in Aspen Plus (R).,"Integration of solid-oxide fuel cells and absorption refrigeration for efficient combined cooling, heat and power production",10.1093/ce/zkaa019
4,9941,It was used to determine the thermodynamic properties of the exhaust gas that was then used to provide heat for the HWST and to drive the AR cycle.,"Integration of solid-oxide fuel cells and absorption refrigeration for efficient combined cooling, heat and power production",10.1093/ce/zkaa019
5,9941,"Thermodynamic models for the AR cycles were developed in Engineering Equation Solver, considering LiBr-H2O and NH3-H2O as working fluids.","Integration of solid-oxide fuel cells and absorption refrigeration for efficient combined cooling, heat and power production",10.1093/ce/zkaa019
6,9941,The sensitivity analysis of a number of SOFC output parameters has been carried out.,"Integration of solid-oxide fuel cells and absorption refrigeration for efficient combined cooling, heat and power production",10.1093/ce/zkaa019
7,9941,"The most optimal case was characterized with the coefficient of performance (COP) and CCHP efficiency of 0.806 and 85.2% for the LiBr-H2O system, and 0.649 and 83.6% for the NH3-H2O system, respectively.","Integration of solid-oxide fuel cells and absorption refrigeration for efficient combined cooling, heat and power production",10.1093/ce/zkaa019
8,9941,"Under such optimal operating conditions, the SOFC was characterized by the net electrical efficiency of 57.5% and the net power output of 123.66 kW. Data from the optimal solution were used to perform the thermodynamic study and sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of different absorption cycle operating conditions and to identify possible applications for the considered integrated systems.","Integration of solid-oxide fuel cells and absorption refrigeration for efficient combined cooling, heat and power production",10.1093/ce/zkaa019
