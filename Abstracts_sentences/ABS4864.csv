4,4864,"The space between columnar, as well as the large pores (similar to 100nm) inside the columns allowed gas molecules to diffuse quickly to the reaction sites; thus, very low interfacial resistance values (0.20 and 0.035 Omega cm(2) at 600 and 700 degrees C, respectively) were obtained.",Unique porous thick Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 solid oxide fuel cell cathode films prepared by spray pyrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.019
5,4864,"Moreover, the high deposition rate, ease of operation in open air and low cost make the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis assisted by an electrostatic field a particularly useful method for preparation of films ideal for SOFC operation.",Unique porous thick Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 solid oxide fuel cell cathode films prepared by spray pyrolysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.019
