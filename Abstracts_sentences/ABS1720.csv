1,1720,Experimental data of cells and cell stacks are presented which clearly demonstrate that their operation can be reversibly changed from the electrolysis mode to the fuel cell mode and vice versa without any discontinuity.,REVERSIBILITY AND POLARIZATION BEHAVIOR OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE ELECTROCHEMICAL-CELLS,10.1016/0360-3199(92)90026-S
2,1720,"Polarization measurements are reported showing that the polarization in fuel cell operation is lower than that in electrolysis operation, especially at operating temperatures below the standard temperature of 1000-degrees-C. An experimental technique for discrimination between the individual polarization losses at the air and fuel electrodes is described and corresponding results are Liven.",REVERSIBILITY AND POLARIZATION BEHAVIOR OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE ELECTROCHEMICAL-CELLS,10.1016/0360-3199(92)90026-S
