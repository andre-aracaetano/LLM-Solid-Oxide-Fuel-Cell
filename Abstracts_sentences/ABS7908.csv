4,7908,The synthesis of the nanofibrous LaCoO3 involves preparing an electrically conductive template of carbon nanotubes onto the walls of a porous scaffold made of oxide-ion-conducting material followed by co-electrodeposition of La and Co hydroxides from an aqueous mixed-metal nitrate solution.,Parametric study on electrodeposition of a nanofibrous LaCoO3 SOFC cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.141
5,7908,"Then, the deposited metal hydroxides are thermally converted to the LaCoO3 perovskite phase through low-temperature calcination performed at 800 degrees C. LaCoO3 microstructure is optimized as a function of deposition time, applied current, and solution concentration to obtain a nanofibrous morphology.",Parametric study on electrodeposition of a nanofibrous LaCoO3 SOFC cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.141
