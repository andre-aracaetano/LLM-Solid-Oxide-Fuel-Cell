1,2842,Integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC) systems combining coal gasification and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are promising for highly efficient and environmentally friendly utilization of coal for power production.,A Finite Volume SOFC Model for Coal-Based Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Systems Analysis,10.1115/1.4000687
2,2842,Most IGFC system analyses performed to-date have used nondimensional thermodynamic SOFC models that do not resolve the intrinsic constraints of SOFC operation.,A Finite Volume SOFC Model for Coal-Based Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Systems Analysis,10.1115/1.4000687
3,2842,In this work a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) finite volume model for planar SOFC is developed and verified using literature data.,A Finite Volume SOFC Model for Coal-Based Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Systems Analysis,10.1115/1.4000687
4,2842,"Special attention is paid to making the model capable of supporting recent SOFC technology improvements, including the use of anode-supported configurations, metallic interconnects, and reduced polarization losses.",A Finite Volume SOFC Model for Coal-Based Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Systems Analysis,10.1115/1.4000687
5,2842,"Activation polarization parameters previously used for high temperature electrolyte-supported SOFC result in cell performance that is much poorer than that observed for modern intermediate temperature anode-supported configurations; thus, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify appropriate parameters for modern SOFC modeling.",A Finite Volume SOFC Model for Coal-Based Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Systems Analysis,10.1115/1.4000687
6,2842,"Model results are shown for SOFC operation on humidified H-2 and CH4 containing syngas, under coflow and counterflow configurations; detailed internal profiles of species mole fractions, temperature, current density, and electrochemical performance are obtained.",A Finite Volume SOFC Model for Coal-Based Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Systems Analysis,10.1115/1.4000687
7,2842,"The effects of performance, fuel composition, and flow configuration of SOFC performance and thermal profiles are evaluated, and the implications of these results for system design and analysis are discussed.",A Finite Volume SOFC Model for Coal-Based Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Systems Analysis,10.1115/1.4000687
8,2842,"The model can be implemented not only as a stand-alone SOFC analysis tool, but also a subroutine that can communicate and cooperate with chemical flow sheet software seamlessly for convenient IGFC system analysis.",A Finite Volume SOFC Model for Coal-Based Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell Systems Analysis,10.1115/1.4000687
