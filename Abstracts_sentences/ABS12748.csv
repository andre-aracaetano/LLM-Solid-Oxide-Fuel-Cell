1,12748,A one-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (working in a methane-air mixture) with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte was modified by adding oxide to the anode (Pt) and cathode (Au).,Effect of electrode and electrolyte modification on the performance of one-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1392014
2,12748,It was determined that the addition of MnO2 to both electrodes significantly improved the cell discharge characteristics.,Effect of electrode and electrolyte modification on the performance of one-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1392014
3,12748,The short-circuit current density of a cell using 15 wt % MnO2 added to the Pt and 20 wt % MnO2 added to the Au was about 50 times larger than that of a cell using Pt and Au electrodes.,Effect of electrode and electrolyte modification on the performance of one-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1392014
4,12748,"Moreover, the cell performance was enhanced further when 1 wt % MnO2 was doped into the YSZ electrolyte.",Effect of electrode and electrolyte modification on the performance of one-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1392014
5,12748,Microstructural observations of the YSZ electrolyte/electrodes interfaces indicated that both the electrode porosity and the contact areas between electrodes and YSZ electrolyte increased markedly for the MnO2-containing Pt and Au electrodes.,Effect of electrode and electrolyte modification on the performance of one-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1392014
