2,4033,Pt thin films with a purity level of similar to 99% were achieved by controlling the O-2 pulsing time.,Application of dense nano-thin platinum films for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells by atomic layer deposition,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.02.081
3,4033,"The agglomeration behavior of the ALD Pt thin films was characterized by the annealing temperature, becoming extremely severe above 550 degrees C. An LT-SOFC with a 25 nm thick dense ALD Pt cathode layer exhibited a peak power density of similar to 110 mW/cm(2) at 450 degrees C.
