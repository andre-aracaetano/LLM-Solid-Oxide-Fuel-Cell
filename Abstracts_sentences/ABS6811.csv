1,6811,"Symmetric solid oxide fuel cells (SFCs) with double perovskite materials serving as symmetric electrodes are applied for the first time in fuel containing sulfur, aiming to explore solution to sulfur poison.",Application of symmetric solid oxide fuel cell in fuel containing sulfur: I. Effect of electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.190
2,6811,"Temperature-programmed techniques, including H-2-TPR, O-2-TPD, were used to evaluate catalytic activities of electrodes in different atmosphere, while stabilities of electrode materials in sulfur containing fuel gas were characterized in terms of phase structures, conductivity, and microstructures by SEM, four-probe method and XRD as a function of temperature and operating time.",Application of symmetric solid oxide fuel cell in fuel containing sulfur: I. Effect of electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.190
3,6811,"It is evidenced that Sr2CoMoO6 (denoted as SCMO) possesses better hydrogen reducibility, oxygen desorption and stability in sulfur containing fuel gas.",Application of symmetric solid oxide fuel cell in fuel containing sulfur: I. Effect of electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.190
4,6811,"In configuration of Sr2XMoO6 (X = Co, Ni)vertical bar Ce0.85Sm0.15O2-delta (SDC)|Sr2XMoO6, the maximum power density Pmax reaches 95 mW cm(-2) for SCMO and 68 mW cm(-2) for SNMO with H-2-0.1% H2S at 750 degrees C. Lower polarization resistance of SCMO (about 2.7 O cm(2) at 750 degrees C) is achieved.",Application of symmetric solid oxide fuel cell in fuel containing sulfur: I.
