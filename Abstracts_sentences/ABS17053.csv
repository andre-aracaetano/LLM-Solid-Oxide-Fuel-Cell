2,17053,SBF is a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and has a good potential to be used as a membrane material for methane conversion.,Transport and surface properties of Sr0.25Bi0.5FeO3-δ mixed conductor,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00277-1
3,17053,"The ionic conductivities and the interfacial resistances are determined from the dependence of oxygen permeation rate on membrane thickness, which are further confirmed from the dependence of oxygen permeation rate on the partial pressure of oxygen.",Transport and surface properties of Sr0.25Bi0.5FeO3-δ mixed conductor,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00277-1
4,17053,Results suggest that the interfacial resistances limit the oxygen permeation rates in the temperature range studied (700-800 degreesC) at low partial pressures of oxygen.,Transport and surface properties of Sr0.25Bi0.5FeO3-δ mixed conductor,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00277-1
