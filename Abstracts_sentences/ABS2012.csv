3,2012,"To prevent reactions between cathode and an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, we propose a Gd-doped ceria (GDC) porous barrier layer and formed barrier layers, screen-printed to 5, 10, and 15 mu m thicknesses.",Porous Gd-doped ceria barrier layer on solid oxide fuel cell with Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.08.056
4,2012,"The performance of SOFCs without a GDC layer decrease by 23% from 0.78 Wcm(-2) to 0.6 Wcm(-2) after 12 h of operation at 780 degrees C. A SOFC with a screen-printed GDC of 5 mu m shows a performance decrease of only 4% from 0.75 Wcm(-2) to 0.72 Wcm(-2) after 12 h of operation at 780 degrees C. Fuel cell performance decreases with decreasing thickness of the porous GDC layer, which may result from the lowered SSC active area due to its reaction with the YSZ electrolyte.",Porous Gd-doped ceria barrier layer on solid oxide fuel cell with Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.08.056
5,2012,The increase in ohmic resistance due to a thicker porous GDC layer is mitigated by a decrease in ohmic resistance due to reduced reaction between the SSC and YSZ.,Porous Gd-doped ceria barrier layer on solid oxide fuel cell with Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Cathodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.08.056
