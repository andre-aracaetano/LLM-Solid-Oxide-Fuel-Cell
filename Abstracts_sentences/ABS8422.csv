1,8422,For planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) designs chromia forming ferritic steels are being considered as possible construction materials for the interconnections.,Oxidation induced lifetime limits of chromia forming ferritic interconnector steels,10.1115/1.1782925
2,8422,In accordance with SOFC market requirements it is in many cases necessary to reduce the size of the fuel cell and thus the thickness of the interconnect.,Oxidation induced lifetime limits of chromia forming ferritic interconnector steels,10.1115/1.1782925
3,8422,"Therefore, long term, cyclic oxidation studies of ferritic interconnector steels were carried out at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C in air thereby putting main emphasis on the effect of specimen thickness on the oxidation behaviour It was observed that with decreasing sample thickness the life time of the mentioned alloys decreases due to breakaway phenomena.",Oxidation induced lifetime limits of chromia forming ferritic interconnector steels,10.1115/1.1782925
4,8422,This effect is caused by the smaller chromium reservoir in the alloy in case of thinner components.,Oxidation induced lifetime limits of chromia forming ferritic interconnector steels,10.1115/1.1782925
5,8422,"The observed life time limits can be predicted with reasonable accuracy by a theoretical model, using oxide growth rate parameters, initial alloy Cr content and critical Cr content for protective chromia scale formation.",Oxidation induced lifetime limits of chromia forming ferritic interconnector steels,10.1115/1.1782925
6,8422,It also has to be taken into account that the oxidation rates Of the steels increase with decreasing specimen thickness.,Oxidation induced lifetime limits of chromia forming ferritic interconnector steels,10.1115/1.1782925
