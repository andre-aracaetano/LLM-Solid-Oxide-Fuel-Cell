1,12308,The chemical interaction study of MgO-SiO2-B2O3 La2O3 (ML) glass with low and high-temperature electrolytes is reported as a function of different heating durations.,"Chemical compatibility between MgO-SiO2-B2O3-La2O3 glass sealant and low, high temperature electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cell applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.067
2,12308,"The as prepared diffusion couples with high-temperature and low temperature electrolytes have been heat-treated at 850 degrees C and 800 degrees C, respectively, for 5, 100 and 750 h. The heat-treated diffusion couples have been characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray dot mapping and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA).","Chemical compatibility between MgO-SiO2-B2O3-La2O3 glass sealant and low, high temperature electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cell applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.067
3,12308,Micro-structural analysis of diffusion couples completely precludes the presence of any unwanted oxides and reaction products at the interface.,"Chemical compatibility between MgO-SiO2-B2O3-La2O3 glass sealant and low, high temperature electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cell applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.067
4,12308,The glass has shown good bonding characteristics and absence of delamination particularly with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ).,"Chemical compatibility between MgO-SiO2-B2O3-La2O3 glass sealant and low, high temperature electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cell applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.067
5,12308,Efforts have also been made to understand the interfacial reaction by considering different theoretical parameters associated with ML glass.,"Chemical compatibility between MgO-SiO2-B2O3-La2O3 glass sealant and low, high temperature electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cell applications",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.067
