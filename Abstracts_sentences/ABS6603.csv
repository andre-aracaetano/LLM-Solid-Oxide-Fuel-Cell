1,6603,"Combined chromium and sulfur poisoning for La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were investigated with cathodic current of 200 mA cm(-2) under 800 degrees C for 22 h. After polarization in chromium and sulfur at 800 degrees C for 22 h, polarization and ohmic resistance for LSM electrodes were 5.1 Omega cm(2) and 7.62 Omega cm(2), which were larger than values of LSM electrodes after chromium deposition only and sulfur deposition only.",Combined Cr and S poisoning of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ (LSM) cathode of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2019.04.116
