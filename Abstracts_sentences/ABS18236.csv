2,18236,A generalized model is suggested that accounts for diffusion of tracer oxygen atoms and allows within a single approach to perform numeric analysis of isotope experiments implemented in reactors of various types and in different temperature modes.,Methods of isotopic relaxations for estimation of oxygen diffusion coefficients in solid electrolytes and materials with mixed ionic-electronic conductivity,10.1134/S1023193515050109
3,18236,"It is shown that when (CO2)-O-18 is used as an isotopic reagent, the oxygen exchange rate on the metal oxide surface increases manifold (as compared to O-18(2)), which allows determining more precisely diffusion limitations in case of isotopic exchange of oxygen in the oxide bulk.",Methods of isotopic relaxations for estimation of oxygen diffusion coefficients in solid electrolytes and materials with mixed ionic-electronic conductivity,10.1134/S1023193515050109
4,18236,"Estimates of oxygen self-diffusion coefficients are obtained in dispersed systems based on doped cerium-zirconium oxides with a fluorite-type structure, doped lanthanum silicates with an apatite-type structure, and also mixed praseodymium nickelates-cobaltites and their composites with yttrium-doped ceria.",Methods of isotopic relaxations for estimation of oxygen diffusion coefficients in solid electrolytes and materials with mixed ionic-electronic conductivity,10.1134/S1023193515050109
