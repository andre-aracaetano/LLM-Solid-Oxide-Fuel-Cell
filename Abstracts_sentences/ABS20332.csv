1,20332,Complex oxides Nd1.6Ca0.4Ni1-yCuyO4+delta (y = 0.0-0.4) have been prepared by a pyrolysis of glycerol-nitrate compositions.,Crystal structure and functional properties of Nd1.6Ca0.4Ni1-yCuyO4+δ as prospective cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.243
2,20332,"According to the X-ray diffraction analysis, the materials are single-phase up to y = 0.3 and crystallize in an orthorhombic structure (Bmab) at room temperature.",Crystal structure and functional properties of Nd1.6Ca0.4Ni1-yCuyO4+δ as prospective cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.243
3,20332,"High-temperature studies assert that they all undergo a phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal (I4/ mmm) structure in a range of 300-400 degrees C. With Cu doping, the over-stoichiometric oxygen content delta decreases from 0.07 (y = 0.0) down to 0.00 (y = 0.3).",Crystal structure and functional properties of Nd1.6Ca0.4Ni1-yCuyO4+δ as prospective cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.243
