1,930,This paper reports both experimental and theoretical results of the role of surface modification on the oxygen reduction reaction in low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFC).,Surface-Modified Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1002/adfm.201101058
2,930,Epitaxial ultrathin films of yttria-doped ceria (YDC) cathode interlayers (<10130 nm) are grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on single-crystalline YSZ(100).,Surface-Modified Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1002/adfm.201101058
3,930,"Fuel cell currentvoltage measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are performed in the temperature range of 350 degrees C 450 degrees C. Quantum mechanical simulations of oxygen incorporation energetics support the experimental results and indicate a low activation energy of only 0.07 eV for YDC, while the incorporation reaction on YSZ is activated by a significantly higher energy barrier of 0.38 eV. Due to enhanced oxygen incorporation at the modified Pt/YDC interface, the cathodic interface resistance is reduced by two-fold, while fuel cell performance shows more than a two-fold enhancement with the addition of an ultrathin YDC interlayer at the cathode side of an SOFC element.",Surface-Modified Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1002/adfm.201101058
4,930,"The results of this study open up opportunities for improving cell performance, particularly of LT-SOFCs by adopting surface modification of YSZ surface with catalytically superior, ultrathin cathodic interlayers.",Surface-Modified Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1002/adfm.201101058
