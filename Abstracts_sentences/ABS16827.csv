1,16827,Interrogation of conduction mechanisms in quasi two-dimensional (2D) brittle or highly resistive materials that are in a suspended form presents a formidable experimental challenge.,Ultra-thin freestanding ceria membranes: layer transfer techniques and high temperature conductivity studies,10.1039/c4ta02113d
2,16827,We report high temperature conductivity studies on substrate-free self-supported nano-crystalline ceria membranes up to 800 K utilizing a layer transfer method that enables four-terminal carrier transport studies under extreme environments.,Ultra-thin freestanding ceria membranes: layer transfer techniques and high temperature conductivity studies,10.1039/c4ta02113d
3,16827,Utilizing such structures we observe increasing conductivity with oxygen partial pressure directly opposing the behavior of thin film devices 'clamped' by the substrate.,Ultra-thin freestanding ceria membranes: layer transfer techniques and high temperature conductivity studies,10.1039/c4ta02113d
4,16827,"We illustrate that the relaxed nature of free standing membranes, and increased surface to volume ratio enable a more sensitive electrical response to oxygen adsorption on the surface which could have implications for their use in oxygen storage devices, solid oxide fuel cells, and chemical sensors.",Ultra-thin freestanding ceria membranes: layer transfer techniques and high temperature conductivity studies,10.1039/c4ta02113d
