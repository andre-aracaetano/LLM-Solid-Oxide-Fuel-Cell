1,9228,Integrating heat recovery units into modern power plants is a good way to improve their efficiency in the future.,Employing a booster/ejector-assisted organic flash cycle to heat recovery of SOFC system; Exergy- and economic-based optimization,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.254
2,9228,"To address this challenge, this study aims to design and develop an electricity/cooling cogeneration system (ECCS) that uses a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), fed by CH4, along with a booster/ejector-assisted organic flash cycle that recovers heat from the exhausted gasses.",Employing a booster/ejector-assisted organic flash cycle to heat recovery of SOFC system; Exergy- and economic-based optimization,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.254
3,9228,"An extended evaluation of the output of the proposed ECCS is conducted based on energy-exergy, environmental, and exergoeconomic criteria, in which the SOFC's current density (JSOFC), the SOFC operating temperature (TSOFC), along with the flashing tank temperature (TFT), are considered variables.",Employing a booster/ejector-assisted organic flash cycle to heat recovery of SOFC system; Exergy- and economic-based optimization,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.254
4,9228,"Accordingly, the exergetic efficiency and cost of products as objective functions are optimized by the NSGA-II method.",Employing a booster/ejector-assisted organic flash cycle to heat recovery of SOFC system; Exergy- and economic-based optimization,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.254
5,9228,"The optimum state is reachable at TFT=370 K, TSOFC=895 K, and JSOFC=5000 A/m2.",Employing a booster/ejector-assisted organic flash cycle to heat recovery of SOFC system; Exergy- and economic-based optimization,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.254
6,9228,"Here, the exergetic efficiency and cost of products are calculated at 53.23% and 43.27 $/GJ.",Employing a booster/ejector-assisted organic flash cycle to heat recovery of SOFC system; Exergy- and economic-based optimization,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.254
7,9228,"Accordingly, energetic efficiency and total exergoeconomic factor are enhanced by 1.33% and 1.96%, respectively, compared with the based case.",Employing a booster/ejector-assisted organic flash cycle to heat recovery of SOFC system; Exergy- and economic-based optimization,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.254
8,9228,"Moreover, a variation in TFT does not have any effect on the pollution damage cost (PDC) at all, in fact, the PDC remains at 3.066 $/h regardless of the variation in TFT.",Employing a booster/ejector-assisted organic flash cycle to heat recovery of SOFC system; Exergy- and economic-based optimization,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.254
