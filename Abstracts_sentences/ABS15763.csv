2,15763,"Typical solid electrolytes are polycrystalline with a number of grain boundaries, and it is common for grain boundaries to block the motion of mobile oxygen ions as they migrate from one grain to the next.",Analysis of the grain boundary conductivity of singly and doubly doped CeO2 thin films at elevated temperature,10.1016/j.actamat.2016.02.032
3,15763,"Accordingly, it is important precisely to measure the grain boundary conductivities of doped cerium oxides, particularly at the temperature of relevance (>500 degrees C).",Analysis of the grain boundary conductivity of singly and doubly doped CeO2 thin films at elevated temperature,10.1016/j.actamat.2016.02.032
4,15763,"Here, we undertake a quantitative analysis of the transport properties of singly and doubly doped cerium oxides.",Analysis of the grain boundary conductivity of singly and doubly doped CeO2 thin films at elevated temperature,10.1016/j.actamat.2016.02.032
5,15763,"So that we may precisely extract the grain boundary contribution out of the total conductivity at an elevated temperature (>500 degrees C), both epitaxial and polycrystalline thin films of the oxides are grown via pulsed layer deposition (PLD) on two different insulating, single-crystal substrates: Al2O3(0001) and SiO2(001), and these are then characterized by a range of analysis tools, in this case TEM, SEM, XRD, ICP-MS and AFM.",Analysis of the grain boundary conductivity of singly and doubly doped CeO2 thin films at elevated temperature,10.1016/j.actamat.2016.02.032
6,15763,"These samples with controlled microstructures, in combination with in-plane ionic conductivity measurements by impedance spectroscopy as a function of the thickness, temperature and pO(2), enable us precisely to measure the grain boundary conductivity of the doped ceria at temperatures ranging from 620 to 700 degrees C.",Analysis of the grain boundary conductivity of singly and doubly doped CeO2 thin films at elevated temperature,10.1016/j.actamat.2016.02.032
7,15763,The impact of the number and type of dopants on the transport properties are also explored.,Analysis of the grain boundary conductivity of singly and doubly doped CeO2 thin films at elevated temperature,10.1016/j.actamat.2016.02.032
