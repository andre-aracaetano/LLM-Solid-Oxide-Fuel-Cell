1,14637,"Dimethyl ether (DME) is a non-toxic fuel with high H/C ratio and high volumetric energy density, and could be served as an ideal source of H(2)/syngas production for application in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).",Partial oxidation of dimethyl ether to H2/syngas over supported Pt catalyst,10.1016/S1003-9953(08)60029-8
2,14637,"This study presents results of DME partial oxidation over a 1.5 wt% Pt/Ce(0.4)Zr(0.6)O(2) catalyst under the condition of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 15000-60000 ml/(g.h), molar ratio Of O(2)/DME of 0.5 and 500-700 degrees C, and this temperature range was also the operation temperature range for intermediate temperature SOFC.",Partial oxidation of dimethyl ether to H2/syngas over supported Pt catalyst,10.1016/S1003-9953(08)60029-8
3,14637,The results indicated that the catalyst showed good activity for the selective partial oxidation of DME to H2/syngas.,Partial oxidation of dimethyl ether to H2/syngas over supported Pt catalyst,10.1016/S1003-9953(08)60029-8

5,14637,"Increase in reaction temperature enhanced the amount of syngas, but lowered the H(2)/CO ratio and yield of methane; while increase in reaction GHSV resulted in only slight variation in the distribution of products.",Partial oxidation of dimethyl ether to H2/syngas over supported Pt catalyst,10.1016/S1003-9953(08)60029-8
6,14637,"The good catalytic activity of Pt supported on Ce(0.4)Zr(0.6)O(2) for the partial oxidation of DME may be directly associated with the good oxygen storage capacity of the support, which is worth of further investigation to develop materials for application in SOFC.",Partial oxidation of dimethyl ether to H2/syngas over supported Pt catalyst,10.1016/S1003-9953(08)60029-8
