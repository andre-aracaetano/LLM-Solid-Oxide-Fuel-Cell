1,17841,A slight Nb2O5 co-doping in 11Sc(2)O(3)-89ZrO(2) was earlier reported to stabilize the high-symmetry cubic phase completely and enhances the conductivity significantly.,Temporal stability of oxygen-ion conductivity in 1Nb2O5-10Sc2O3-89ZrO2,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.11.008
2,17841,The present work looked at the temporal stability of conductivity in 1Nb(2)O(5)-10Sc(2)O(3)-89ZrO(2) (1Nb10ScSZ) for the electrolyte application in solid oxide fuel cells.,Temporal stability of oxygen-ion conductivity in 1Nb2O5-10Sc2O3-89ZrO2,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.11.008
3,17841,In situ conductivity measurement was done using impedance spectroscopy at 650 degrees C in the air for 2000 h.,Temporal stability of oxygen-ion conductivity in 1Nb2O5-10Sc2O3-89ZrO2,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.11.008
4,17841,"A substantial conductivity loss (29%) was observed in the first 1000 h. Following which, conductivity remained relatively stable for the next 1000 h. Impedance analysis showed that the main contribution to the conductivity degradation was from grain conductivity.",Temporal stability of oxygen-ion conductivity in 1Nb2O5-10Sc2O3-89ZrO2,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2017.11.008
