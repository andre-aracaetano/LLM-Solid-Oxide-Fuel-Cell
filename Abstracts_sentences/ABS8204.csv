1,8204,A conceptual nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) cermet has been prepared by coating YSZ particles with metallic nickel using electroless coating technique.,Properties of Ni/YSZ porous cermets prepared by electroless coating technique for SOFC anode application,10.1007/s10853-007-1497-x
2,8204,Concentration of nickel was varied between 5 and 60 vol%.,Properties of Ni/YSZ porous cermets prepared by electroless coating technique for SOFC anode application,10.1007/s10853-007-1497-x
3,8204,"Bulk samples were prepared by uniaxial pressing followed by sintering in the temperature range 1,200-1,350 degrees C with a soaking time of 2-6 h. Thorough investigation on the electrical characteristics, thermal expansion behavior of the samples have been performed as a function of Ni-content in the cermet.",Properties of Ni/YSZ porous cermets prepared by electroless coating technique for SOFC anode application,10.1007/s10853-007-1497-x
4,8204,Thermal expansion behavior and conductivity measurement results suggest that the samples prepared by this technique are suitable for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode application at Ni concentration as low as 20 vol%.,Properties of Ni/YSZ porous cermets prepared by electroless coating technique for SOFC anode application,10.1007/s10853-007-1497-x
