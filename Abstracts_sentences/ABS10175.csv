1,10175,"The thermal and chemical stability of glasses in the BaO-Al(2)O(3)-La(2)O(3)-B(2)O(3)-SiO(2) system were investigated as well as bonding characteristics and wetting behavior to yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, to develop a suitable sealing glass for planar solid oxide fuel cell operating at 800-850 degreesC. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature, softening temperature and thermal expansion coefficient were found to depend on the B(2)O(3):SiO(2) ratio in glass composition; thus the bonding characteristics of the glass to YSZ were also influenced by this ratio.",Stable sealing glass for planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/S0022-3093(01)01042-0
