1,10931,A thin yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/gadolinia doped ceria (GDC) bi-layer membrane is fabricated through the slurry spin coating technique and used as an electrolyte of a solid oxide fuel cell with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta as the cathode.,Solid oxide fuel cell with a spin-coated yttria stabilized zirconia/gadolinia doped ceria bi-layer electrolyte,10.1039/d2ra02035a
2,10931,"The viscosity of the YSZ slurry is controlled by adding ethanol in the terpineol solvent, which shows a negligible effect on the thickness but a remarkable influence on the porosity of the YSZ film.",Solid oxide fuel cell with a spin-coated yttria stabilized zirconia/gadolinia doped ceria bi-layer electrolyte,10.1039/d2ra02035a
3,10931,The thickness of the YSZ layer increases with the YSZ content in the slurry.,Solid oxide fuel cell with a spin-coated yttria stabilized zirconia/gadolinia doped ceria bi-layer electrolyte,10.1039/d2ra02035a
4,10931,"The YSZ films are pre-sintered at various temperatures, and the one sintered at 1200 degrees C has a moderate interaction with the GDC slurry, forming a 10 mu m-thick YSZ/GDC bilayer with a low porosity and a low ohmic resistance.",Solid oxide fuel cell with a spin-coated yttria stabilized zirconia/gadolinia doped ceria bi-layer electrolyte,10.1039/d2ra02035a
5,10931,The corresponding single cell shows a maximum power density of 1480 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C.,Solid oxide fuel cell with a spin-coated yttria stabilized zirconia/gadolinia doped ceria bi-layer electrolyte,10.1039/d2ra02035a
