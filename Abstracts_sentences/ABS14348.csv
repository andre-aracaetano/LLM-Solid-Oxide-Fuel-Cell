3,14348,"For post-test analyses, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and analytic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were applied.",Sulphur poisoning of the SOFC cathode material La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.007
4,14348,Elemental depth profiles were obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).,Sulphur poisoning of the SOFC cathode material La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.007
5,14348,The decrease in the chemical oxygen exchange coefficient k(chem) by a factor of 10 during the course of 1000 h indicated that an accumulation of traces of sulphur (estimated to the range of ppb) in the form of SrSO4 can lead to a significant degradation even in nominally pure O-2-Ar.,Sulphur poisoning of the SOFC cathode material La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.007
6,14348,The exposure to 50 ppm of SO2 for 1000 h caused a severe degradation in k(chem) by a factor of 3000.,Sulphur poisoning of the SOFC cathode material La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.007
7,14348,"Post-test analyses showed that the perovskite phase La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta is decomposed into SrSO4 and La2O2SO4 within the first 500 nm of the surface, and a nano-crystalline Co-rich phase, which is located in the depth range of 500-1400 nm.",Sulphur poisoning of the SOFC cathode material La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.007
