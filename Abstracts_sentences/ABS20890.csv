4,20890,"Antimony was chosen due to its similar sterical behaviour, The structural changes of the alpha-Bi2O3 during heating and cooling treatments of the compositions (Bi2O3)(1-x)-(Sb2O3) (x) (for x= 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) were followed by IR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffractometry and thermal analysis.",Structural aspects of antimony doped Bi2O3,
5,20890,"The 400-600 cm(-1) region of the IR spectra presents intense and broad band envelopes in the case of all the annealed samples, while this envelope is broken into a number of sharper bands in the case of starting alpha-Bi2O3.",Structural aspects of antimony doped Bi2O3,
6,20890,The broad envelopes found in the case of doped-structures would normally be associated with highly polar bonds.,Structural aspects of antimony doped Bi2O3,
7,20890,and a large longitudinal transverse mode separation.,Structural aspects of antimony doped Bi2O3,
8,20890,These differences are more evidenced when the Sb2O3 content of the samples is higher.,Structural aspects of antimony doped Bi2O3,

11,20890,Some reflections may be assigned to a delta*-phase in an early stage of formation.,Structural aspects of antimony doped Bi2O3,
12,20890,The presence of Sb2O3 in the system promotes an oxygen release from Bi2O3 and enlarged the stabilization domain of the delta-phase.,Structural aspects of antimony doped Bi2O3,
