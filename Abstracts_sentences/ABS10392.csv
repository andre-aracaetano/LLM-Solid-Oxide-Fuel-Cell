1,10392,"This work focuses on a novel, co-sintered, all-ceramic solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) concept.",Investigation of LSM-8YSZ cathode within an all ceramic SOFC. Part I: Chemical interactions,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.02.004
2,10392,The objective is the understanding of interaction and degradation mechanisms of the cathode and current collector layers within the design during co-sintering.,Investigation of LSM-8YSZ cathode within an all ceramic SOFC. Part I: Chemical interactions,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.02.004
3,10392,"Half cells consisting of silicate mechanical support, lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) current collector, LSM mixed with 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) composite cathode and 8YSZ electrolyte were co-sintered at 1150 degrees C < T < 1250 degrees C. Crystallographically stable LSM compositions within the design were identified.",Investigation of LSM-8YSZ cathode within an all ceramic SOFC. Part I: Chemical interactions,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.02.004
4,10392,"However, the cathode and silicate/electrolyte interacted by interdiffusion of Zn (gas diffusion) and Mn (solid diffusion), and by the formation of several reaction phases (between silicate and cathode only).",Investigation of LSM-8YSZ cathode within an all ceramic SOFC. Part I: Chemical interactions,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.02.004
5,10392,Introducing silicate poisoning decreased the electrochemical performance of the cell by around 40%.,Investigation of LSM-8YSZ cathode within an all ceramic SOFC. Part I: Chemical interactions,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.02.004
6,10392,"This is likely due to the formation of the Zn- and Mn-rich phase in the cathode, but may also be caused by a higher ohmic resistance of the current collector.",Investigation of LSM-8YSZ cathode within an all ceramic SOFC. Part I: Chemical interactions,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2020.02.004
