1,15749,"The Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) oxides Sr(3.2-x)Ca(x)Ln(0.8)Fe(1.5)Co(1.5)O(10-delta) with x = 0 and 0.4 and Ln = La, Pr, and Nd, have been synthesized and the effect of Ca on their electrochemical properties as cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) has been investigated.",Effect of Ca substitution on the electrochemical properties of the Ruddlesden-Popper oxides Sr3.2-xCaxLn0.8Fe1.5Co1.5O10-δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.047
2,15749,The substitution of Ca for Sr in Sr(3.2-x)Ca(x)Ln(0.8)Fe(1.5)Co(1.5)O(10-delta) decreases the amount of oxygen loss on heating and the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC).,Effect of Ca substitution on the electrochemical properties of the Ruddlesden-Popper oxides Sr3.2-xCaxLn0.8Fe1.5Co1.5O10-δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.047
3,15749,"The phase instability of these materials at high temperature is a significant issue that restricts their application as SOFC cathodes, and the substitution of Ca effectively stabilizes the Sr(3.2-x)Ca(x)Ln(0.8)Fe(1.5)Co(1.5)O(10-delta) phase at 800 degrees C. Among the different lanthanides with and without Ca in Sr(3.2-x)Ca(x)Ln(0.3)Fe(1.5)Co(1.5)O(10-delta), the Ln = Nd samples exhibit an enhancement in cathode performance in SOFC compared to Ln = La and Pr samples, which may be attributed to the higher concentration of oxygen vacancies in the Ln = Nd samples.",Effect of Ca substitution on the electrochemical properties of the Ruddlesden-Popper oxides Sr3.2-xCaxLn0.8Fe1.5Co1.5O10-δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.047
