4,3744,La2Ni0.99Cu0.01O4+delta samples showed good electrochemical and physicochemical properties with respect to the undoped material and is potentially a promising cathode.,"Synthesis, structural analysis and electrochemical performance of low-copper content La2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ materials as new cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2009.05.082
5,3744,"Indeed, doping with such small amounts of copper (1%) into the nickel site led to the formation of pure phases and stabilized the material before and after use at high temperature under air.","Synthesis, structural analysis and electrochemical performance of low-copper content La2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ materials as new cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2009.05.082
6,3744,"In contrast, doping with higher amounts of copper (2%, 5% and 10%) led, after heating at 1000 degrees C for 48 h, to the formation of another phase resulting from the diffusion of copper into the YSZ electrolyte, limiting the interest to these materials as SOFC cathodes.","Synthesis, structural analysis and electrochemical performance of low-copper content La2Ni1-xCuxO4+δ materials as new cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2009.05.082
