3,2489,The flow geometry reduced the effect of cell distance and improved the uniformity of performance of single cells in both stacks.,Effect of flow geometry on anode-supported single chamber SOFCs arrayed as V-shape,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.108
4,2489,"The converse V-shape configuration was beneficial for maintaining the heat and the gases, in particular at low flow rates; the performance of the converse V-shape stack was better than that of the V-shape stack.",Effect of flow geometry on anode-supported single chamber SOFCs arrayed as V-shape,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.108
