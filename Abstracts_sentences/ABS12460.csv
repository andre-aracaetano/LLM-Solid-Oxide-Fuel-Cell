4,12460,We examined the crystallinity and uniformity of the Ni(B) layer on the plated core-shell powder and found that it had an amorphous-like structure.,Catalytic characteristics of Ni(B)-coated YSZ powder by neutral electroless plating,10.1007/s43207-020-00034-z
5,12460,"In addition, we evaluated the rate of carbon deposition and characteristics of the SOFC anode catalyst: the carbon deposition rate was 19.42%, H-2 selectivity was nearly 88% at 800 degrees C, and methane conversion was maintained at 100% at temperatures above 850 degrees C. It was ascertained that in the high-temperature region, which is the main operating temperature of SOFCs, the amorphous-like microstructure of the Ni(B) layer on the Ni(B)-YSZ core-shell powder played an important role in enhancing these properties.",Catalytic characteristics of Ni(B)-coated YSZ powder by neutral electroless plating,10.1007/s43207-020-00034-z
