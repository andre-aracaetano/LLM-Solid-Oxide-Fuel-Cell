1,11271,Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with thin La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolytes and (Ce0.6La0.4)O2-delta (LDC) barrier layers were studied.,Co-firing of anode-supported SOFCs with thin La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolytes,10.1149/1.2191132
2,11271,The cells were fabricated by first colloidally depositing an LDC/LSGM/LDC tri-layer on a NiO-LDC anode support and co-firing.,Co-firing of anode-supported SOFCs with thin La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolytes,10.1149/1.2191132
3,11271,Cathodes consisting of LSCF-LSGM (LSCF=La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta) were then deposited and fired.,Co-firing of anode-supported SOFCs with thin La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolytes,10.1149/1.2191132
4,11271,Cell tests in air and humidified hydrogen showed maximum power densities of 0.91 W/cm(2) at 700 degrees C and 0.60 W/cm(2) at 650 degrees C.,Co-firing of anode-supported SOFCs with thin La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolytes,10.1149/1.2191132
5,11271,The relatively good performance indicated that the LDC layers were effective in minimizing interdiffusion and reaction.,Co-firing of anode-supported SOFCs with thin La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolytes,10.1149/1.2191132
6,11271,"However, the open-circuit voltage of these cells was similar to 0.1 V lower than the Nernst potential; observations of electrolyte microstructure and composition indicated that this was due to electronic conductivity in the LSGM layer, resulting from Ni impurities that entered during co-firing with the NiO-LDC anode.",Co-firing of anode-supported SOFCs with thin La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolytes,10.1149/1.2191132
7,11271,"While the LDC layers were necessary, impedance measurements indicated that they substantially increased the cell ohmic resistance.",Co-firing of anode-supported SOFCs with thin La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolytes,10.1149/1.2191132
