2,15216,"The concentrations of electronic and ionic defects in PYBCN at variations of gaseous environment are obtained from the analysis of the experimental isothermal plots for equilibrium oxygen content (6 - delta) vs. oxygen partial pressure P-O2, in the ambient gaseous phase.",Advanced electrochemical properties of Pr0.9Y0.1BaCo1.8Ni0.2O6-δ - Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite as cathode material for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.11.255
3,15216,It is argued that nickel doping is beneficial for enhanced formation of vacancies in O2- positions controlling oxygen ion transport in the cobaltite.,Advanced electrochemical properties of Pr0.9Y0.1BaCo1.8Ni0.2O6-δ - Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite as cathode material for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.11.255
4,15216,The cobaltite based dual-phase composite with 30 wt% addition of samarium doped ceria Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) is found to have considerably reduced thermal expansion compared to the parent cobaltite.,Advanced electrochemical properties of Pr0.9Y0.1BaCo1.8Ni0.2O6-δ - Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite as cathode material for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.11.255
5,15216,"The impedance measurements show that the area specific resistance (ASR) of the composite decreases to 0.11 Omega cm(2) at 973 K with the activation energy 1.2 eV. Further increase of the temperature is accompanied by the decline of the activation energy to 0.9 eV, and ASR attains 0.045 Omega cm(2) at 1073 K.",Advanced electrochemical properties of Pr0.9Y0.1BaCo1.8Ni0.2O6-δ - Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite as cathode material for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.11.255
