1,16205,"The precursor of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 (LSGM1020) was prepared by phase transfer separation (PTS) process in NH4OH-(NH4)(2)CO3 solution, and the solid electrolyte with low content of impurity phase was obtained at low sintering temperature.",Preparation and characterization of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 oxygen-ion conductor,
2,16205,"XRD, Raman spectroscopy, DC four-probe, impedance spectroscopy (IS) and SEM were applied to analyze the crystal structure, ionic conductivity and microstructure, respectively.",Preparation and characterization of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 oxygen-ion conductor,
3,16205,"The XRD and Raman analysis show that LSGM1020 possesses rhombohedral structure, and its conductivity reached 0.12 S.cm(-1) at 800degreesC. A fine microstructure in the product was detected by SEM and IS study.",Preparation and characterization of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 oxygen-ion conductor,
4,16205,It can be concluded that the utilization of PTS process can lower the sintering temperature of the precursor and improve the microstructure of the final solid electrolyte.,Preparation and characterization of La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 oxygen-ion conductor,
