1,7954,"Aiming to lower the activation energy and expedite the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d (LSCF) cathodes for application in intermediatetemperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), Er0.4Bi1.6O3 (ESB) modified LSCF was prepared by infiltrating using organic solvents.",Modified La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes with the infiltration of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.121
2,7954,"The infiltration of ESB dramatically reduces the polarization resistances of LSCF cathodes (from 0.27 to 0.11 U cm2 at 700 degrees C, from 0.58 to 0.25 U cm2 at 650 degrees C), and lowers their activation energy (from 100.28 to 97.15 kJ mol-1).",Modified La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes with the infiltration of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.121
3,7954,"Also, ESB makes the rate-limiting step of LSCF cathodes at high frequency change from the charge transfer process on the cathode to the adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on cathode surface.",Modified La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathodes with the infiltration of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.121
4,7954,"The single cell with ESB infiltrated LSCF cathodes shows a peak power density of 469 mW cm-2 at 700 degrees C using humid hydrogen and air as fuels and oxidants, respectively, as well as a good short-term stability for 50 h.
