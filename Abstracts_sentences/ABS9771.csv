1,9771,"In this paper, the air flow distribution quality within a conventional tubular solid oxide fuel cell (T-SOFC) stack air flow path structure was analyzed by 3D calculating fluid dynamics (CFD) simulating.",Comparing the Air Flow Distribution Qualities Among Three Different Air Flow Path Configurations for Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.20964/2016.11.12
2,9771,The air flow field within the T-SOFC stack was of a typically turbulence characteristic.,Comparing the Air Flow Distribution Qualities Among Three Different Air Flow Path Configurations for Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.20964/2016.11.12
3,9771,"Both air flow distribution qualities among 36 T-SOFC units in stack level and over each T-SOFCs unit surface within the T-SOFC stacks with different air flow manifold configuration designs, such as 1in1out-line, 1in1out-Z, and 2in2out-Z type, were carefully compared through 3D simulation.",Comparing the Air Flow Distribution Qualities Among Three Different Air Flow Path Configurations for Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.20964/2016.11.12
4,9771,"2in2out-Z type air flow path structure was concluded to be a more suitable chooses for T-SOFC stack, because its smaller variation of x-velocity at each main plane than that in other type air flow path structures.",Comparing the Air Flow Distribution Qualities Among Three Different Air Flow Path Configurations for Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks,10.20964/2016.11.12
