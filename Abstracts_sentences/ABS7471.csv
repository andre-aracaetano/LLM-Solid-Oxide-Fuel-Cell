1,7471,"The two Alkaline Earth Metals (Aem) of Barium and Calcium are doped in a perovskite A site (such as La(0.7)Aem(0.3)Ti(0.5)Mn(0.4)Ni(0.1)O(3)) to be applied as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) electrodes to study the cation size implications in the resultant phase/s, electrochemical performances (as anode, cathode and in a symmetrical cell) and conductivities.","A-site cation influences on performance, structure and conductivity of a lanthanide-based perovskite electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227723
2,7471,"Despite having a theoretically closer dopant-host cation size match, Calcium doped perovskite (LCTMN) reveals lower phase purity, however, higher performances (of 97.4 vs 28 mW cm(-2)) are obtained in symmetrical cells.","A-site cation influences on performance, structure and conductivity of a lanthanide-based perovskite electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227723
3,7471,This fact is later majorly attributed to its superior anodic efficiency (of 115.8 vs 49 mW cm(-2)) obtained when both materials are assembled with the reference cathode of BSCF (Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3).,"A-site cation influences on performance, structure and conductivity of a lanthanide-based perovskite electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227723
4,7471,Further support is found in the analysis of the total impedances of the cells as well as the conductivities under oxidizing and reducing atmospheres.,"A-site cation influences on performance, structure and conductivity of a lanthanide-based perovskite electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227723
5,7471,The chemical composition proximity of the chosen perovskites with the benchmark cathode La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) supports the limiting factor of the anodic behavior.,"A-site cation influences on performance, structure and conductivity of a lanthanide-based perovskite electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227723
6,7471,The identification of two thermal regimes in the conductivity (in hydrogen) together with the specimen average performance and conductivity differences lead to formulate a model to directly estimate a relationship between these two variables (with errors of 5.3 and 6%).,"A-site cation influences on performance, structure and conductivity of a lanthanide-based perovskite electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227723
