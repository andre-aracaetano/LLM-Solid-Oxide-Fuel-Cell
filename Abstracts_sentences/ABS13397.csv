1,13397,"In the solid oxide fuel cell field, the gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) is widely used as interlayer between oxygen electrode and electrolyte materials, as for instance La2NiO4+delta (LNO) and 3 mol.% Y2O3-ZrO2 (TZ3Y), respectively.",Ceria doped with praseodymium instead of gadolinium as efficient interlayer for lanthanum nickelate SOFC oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.019
2,13397,"However, cation interdiffusion occurs between GDC and LNO/TZ3Y during their sintering steps at high temperature, which finally lowers the electrochemical performance of the cathode for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).",Ceria doped with praseodymium instead of gadolinium as efficient interlayer for lanthanum nickelate SOFC oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.019
3,13397,"In this paper, an alternative interlayer is proposed, the praseodymium doped ceria (PrDC with 30 at.% Pr).",Ceria doped with praseodymium instead of gadolinium as efficient interlayer for lanthanum nickelate SOFC oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.019
4,13397,"It is shown that reactivity occurs between PrDC and TZ3Y, but the compounds formed seem to favour the ORR.",Ceria doped with praseodymium instead of gadolinium as efficient interlayer for lanthanum nickelate SOFC oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.019
5,13397,"Besides, little reactivity is detected between LNO and PrDC.",Ceria doped with praseodymium instead of gadolinium as efficient interlayer for lanthanum nickelate SOFC oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.019
6,13397,"As a result, the total resistances, i.e. series and polarization resistance obtained with a LNO//PrDC//TZ3Y half-cell from 500 degrees C to 800 degrees C are much lower than those obtained with a LNO//GDC//TZ3Y half-cell, sintered in the same conditions.",Ceria doped with praseodymium instead of gadolinium as efficient interlayer for lanthanum nickelate SOFC oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.019
7,13397,"In addition, differences in the shape of the impedance diagrams are observed depending on the interlayer: this feature is discussed throughout the paper.",Ceria doped with praseodymium instead of gadolinium as efficient interlayer for lanthanum nickelate SOFC oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.019
