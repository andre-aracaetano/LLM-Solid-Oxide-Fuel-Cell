2,20443,"Currently, development of steam electrolysis technology via solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) is considered to be one of the most effective ways to produce hydrogen.",Electricity/hydrogen conversion by the means of a protonic ceramic electrolysis cell with Nd2NiO4 + δ-based oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.014
3,20443,"Here, we present testing of the SOEC based on a new combination of the functional materials, BaCe0.5Zr0.3Dy0.2O3-delta as a proton-conducting electrolyte and Nd(1.95)Ba(0.05)Nia(4+delta) (NBN) as an oxygen electrode, which are chemically and thermally compatible.",Electricity/hydrogen conversion by the means of a protonic ceramic electrolysis cell with Nd2NiO4 + δ-based oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.014
4,20443,"To demonstrate the performance capability and establish the most favorable operating conditions, the cell was comprehensively characterized within a wide range of temperatures (500-750 degrees C), applied electrolysis potentials (similar to 0.8-2 V) and water vapor partial pressure in anode atmospheres (0.03-0.5 atm).",Electricity/hydrogen conversion by the means of a protonic ceramic electrolysis cell with Nd2NiO4 + δ-based oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.014
5,20443,"The results reveal that a high current density 1.21 A cm(-2) is achieved under the selected conditions (750 degrees C, 1.6 V, 0.03 atm); it increases up to 1.40 A cm(-2) with the pH(2)O increasing from 0.03 to 0.5 atm.",Electricity/hydrogen conversion by the means of a protonic ceramic electrolysis cell with Nd2NiO4 + δ-based oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.014
6,20443,"Comparative analysis presented for similar SOEC systems allows considering the NBN as a highly attractive oxygen electrode, having a polarization resistance (R-p) of 0.05 Omega cm(2) at the selected conditions and promoting electrochemical steam electrolysis because no degradation of the R-p value (0.03 Omega cm(2)) at highly moisturizing conditions, pH(2)O = 0.50 atm.",Electricity/hydrogen conversion by the means of a protonic ceramic electrolysis cell with Nd2NiO4 + δ-based oxygen electrode,10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.014
