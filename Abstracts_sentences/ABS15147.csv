1,15147,"Gasification of fuel cane bagasse, the waste residue from fuel cane, a hybrid of wild and commercial clones of sugar cane, was carried out in a novel 50 kWe air-blown autothermal downdraft gasifier.","Speciation and distribution of alkali, alkali earth metals and major ash forming elements during gasification of fuel cane bagasse",10.1016/j.fuel.2011.05.031
2,15147,"The speciation and distribution of alkali, alkali earth metals and major ash forming elements during gasification were investigated to evaluate the extent of volatilisation of these elements into the syngas and to determine the likely impact on syngas fuelled solid oxide fuel cell systems.","Speciation and distribution of alkali, alkali earth metals and major ash forming elements during gasification of fuel cane bagasse",10.1016/j.fuel.2011.05.031
3,15147,Also assessed was the potential for defluidisation of the fuel bed due to agglomerate and deposit formation.,"Speciation and distribution of alkali, alkali earth metals and major ash forming elements during gasification of fuel cane bagasse",10.1016/j.fuel.2011.05.031
4,15147,"Chemical fractionation studies showed that 30% of the potassium was captured by aluminosilicates and was retained in the ash, thereby reducing the alkali loading in the syngas and that more than 50% of the alkali earth metals were released to the syngas.","Speciation and distribution of alkali, alkali earth metals and major ash forming elements during gasification of fuel cane bagasse",10.1016/j.fuel.2011.05.031
5,15147,"In contrast, although the major ash forming elements were transformed from acid insoluble to acid soluble forms during gasification they remained hard bound in the ash and less than 30% of each one was released into the gas phase.","Speciation and distribution of alkali, alkali earth metals and major ash forming elements during gasification of fuel cane bagasse",10.1016/j.fuel.2011.05.031
6,15147,"The composition of clinkers and agglomerates produced during gasification was investigated by SEM-EDX and XRD which confirmed the presence of the eutectic systems KAlSi2O6-SiO2, KAlSi2O6-CaMgSi2O6-SiO2 and CaMgSi2O6-NaAlSi3O8.","Speciation and distribution of alkali, alkali earth metals and major ash forming elements during gasification of fuel cane bagasse",10.1016/j.fuel.2011.05.031
7,15147,A preliminary model of the distribution behaviour during gasification of the ash forming elements has been developed.,"Speciation and distribution of alkali, alkali earth metals and major ash forming elements during gasification of fuel cane bagasse",10.1016/j.fuel.2011.05.031
