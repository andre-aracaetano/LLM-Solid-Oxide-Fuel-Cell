3,16443,Low-temperature sintering was necessitated due to the low melting point of copper and was achieved by the addition of transition metal oxides (TMOs) (Fe and Mn) to the GDC electrolyte.,Characterization of Fe- and Mn-doped GDC for low-temperature processing of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2009.02.023
4,16443,"The sinterability of TMO-doped GDC samples was evaluated over 900-1400 degrees C. Key functional properties - density, mechanical strength and electrical conductivity - of the doped GDC were determined.",Characterization of Fe- and Mn-doped GDC for low-temperature processing of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2009.02.023
5,16443,Acceptable levels of density (>95% of theoretical) and mechanical strength were achieved for the samples sintered at 900 degrees C.
