3,16466,We analyze the detailed structures and atomic charges to explain the mechanism of oxygen coverage effect.,First-principles study of oxygen coverage effect on hydrogen oxidation on Ni(111) surface,10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.01.238
4,16466,Our results indicate that higher oxygen coverage (in the range between 0 and 219) leads to lower oxidation reaction barriers.,First-principles study of oxygen coverage effect on hydrogen oxidation on Ni(111) surface,10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.01.238
5,16466,The main reason of the effect is the charge transfer between species and Ni surface was changed by the electron acceptor of co-adsorbed oxygen atoms.,First-principles study of oxygen coverage effect on hydrogen oxidation on Ni(111) surface,10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.01.238
