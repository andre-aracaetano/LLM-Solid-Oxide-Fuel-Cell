1,656,Energy storage systems (ESSs) were introduced to overcome the risks posed by energy curtailment.,Techno-economic assessment of energy storage systems in green buildings while considering demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113130
2,656,"In this paper, we compare the Levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for PEM Reversible Fuel Cells, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, and Lithium-Ion Batteries in three different locations in the United States (Tucson, Seattle, and Rochester) that are characterized by different energy consumption profiles.",Techno-economic assessment of energy storage systems in green buildings while considering demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113130
3,656,"This research examines three commercial buildings of different sizes: small, medium, and large, with three occupancy profiles: low, medium, and high energy consumption in each of the three locations.",Techno-economic assessment of energy storage systems in green buildings while considering demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113130
4,656,The objective is to quantify the impact of uncertain demand and uncertain financial parameters on the LCOS.,Techno-economic assessment of energy storage systems in green buildings while considering demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113130
5,656,The results show that all ESSs can represent an attractive alternative to energy curtailment regardless of the building size or the occupancy profile.,Techno-economic assessment of energy storage systems in green buildings while considering demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113130
6,656,"Further, the results show that fuel cells are a better fit for demand uncertainty as they are more resilient to changes and remain attractive despite that.",Techno-economic assessment of energy storage systems in green buildings while considering demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113130
7,656,"The uncertainty analysis showed that the minimum LCOS was $0.049/kWh, and it was for a PEM-RFC in a small building in Tucson under high energy consumption behavior.",Techno-economic assessment of energy storage systems in green buildings while considering demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113130
8,656,"Oppositely, the maximum LCOS was $0.679/ kWh, and that was for a large building in Seattle under high energy usage occupancy as well.",Techno-economic assessment of energy storage systems in green buildings while considering demand uncertainty,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113130
