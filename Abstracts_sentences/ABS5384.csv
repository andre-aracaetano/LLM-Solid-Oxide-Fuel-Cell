1,5384,Accurate oxygen-content analysis by means of a coulometric redox titration method specially devised for the purpose shows that as-synthesized (in 5% H-2/Ar) samples of the recently reported novel solid oxide fuel cells anode material Sr2MgMoO6-delta contain oxygen vacancies with a concentration of delta approximate to 0.05.,Oxygen-vacancy concentration in A2MgMoO6-δ double-perovskite oxides,10.1016/j.jssc.2009.04.016
2,5384,Oxygen contents and the resultant Mo-valence values are also analyzed for various A(2)MgMoO(6-delta) samples in order to reveal both the isovalent and aliovalent A-site cation substitution effects.,Oxygen-vacancy concentration in A2MgMoO6-δ double-perovskite oxides,10.1016/j.jssc.2009.04.016
