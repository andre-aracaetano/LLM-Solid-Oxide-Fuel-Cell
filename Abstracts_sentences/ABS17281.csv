1,17281,"The crystal structure, lattice constant, sinterability, microstructure, conductivity and cell performance of 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) with varying ratios of Li2O (n mol%, n = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.7, 2, 2.5, 3), i.e., n mol% Li(2)OYSZ, were investigated.","Effect of Li2O additions upon the crystal structure, sinterability and electrical properties of yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte",10.1039/c6ra24486f
2,17281,The results show that the Li+ can dissolve into the ZrO2 cubic lattice and cause lattice contraction due to the small radius of Li+.,"Effect of Li2O additions upon the crystal structure, sinterability and electrical properties of yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte",10.1039/c6ra24486f
3,17281,"The YSZ retained its cubic lattice until Li2O addition of 1.7 mol%, and the cubic-to-monoclinic transition was detected in cases of Li2O content more than 1.7 mol%, leading to the increase of the lattice parameter.","Effect of Li2O additions upon the crystal structure, sinterability and electrical properties of yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte",10.1039/c6ra24486f
4,17281,"Li2O addition of 0.25 and 0.5 mol% decreased the sintering temperature from the typical 1400 degrees C to 1265 degrees C and 1250 degrees C, and promoted both the densification and electrical conductivity of the YSZ samples.","Effect of Li2O additions upon the crystal structure, sinterability and electrical properties of yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte",10.1039/c6ra24486f
5,17281,"The conductivities of 0.25 mol% Li(2)OYSZ and 0.5 mol% Li(2)OYSZ samples at 800 degrees C were as high as 0.0275 S cm(-1) and 0.0313 S cm(-1), which are 1.26 and 1.43 times greater than that of pure YSZ, respectively.","Effect of Li2O additions upon the crystal structure, sinterability and electrical properties of yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte",10.1039/c6ra24486f
6,17281,Then the densification of the YSZ samples reduced gradually at Li2O content greater than 1 mol%.,"Effect of Li2O additions upon the crystal structure, sinterability and electrical properties of yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte",10.1039/c6ra24486f
7,17281,"For n mol% Li(2)OYSZ (n >= 1.7) samples, a dense and pure cubic phase ceramic could be achieved at sintering temperatures above 1400 degrees C due to the vaporization of Li2O at such high temperatures resulting from its high vapor pressure.","Effect of Li2O additions upon the crystal structure, sinterability and electrical properties of yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte",10.1039/c6ra24486f
8,17281,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with 0.25 mol% Li(2)OYSZ and 0.5 mol% Li(2)OYSZ electrolyte displayed open circuit voltages higher than 1.0 V at 800 degrees C, indicating the absence of electronic conductivity, and meanwhile exhibited much increased maximum power densities than that of the cell with pure YSZ electrolyte, implying that inclusion of a small amount of Li2O into YSZ electrolyte could be a desirable improvement approach for zirconia-based SOFC.","Effect of Li2O additions upon the crystal structure, sinterability and electrical properties of yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte",10.1039/c6ra24486f
