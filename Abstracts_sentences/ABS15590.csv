3,15590,"Results show that the increase of graphite particles size from 1 gm to 40 gm reduces TiC particle size from 2.68 mu m to 2.22 mu m by affecting the formation process of TiC. Moreover, the decrease of TiC particles size accelerates the fast formation of dense and continuous TiO2/Cr2O3 oxide layer, which bring down the mass gain (800 degrees C/100 h) from 2.03 mg cm(-2) to 1.18 mg cm(-2).",One new route to optimize the oxidation resistance of TiC/hastelloy (Ni-based alloy) composites applied for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnect by increasing graphite particle size,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.06.085

Therefore, the decrease of graphite particle size is one simple and effective route to optimize the oxidation resistance of composites, and meantime keeps suitable thermal expansion and good electrical conductivity.",One new route to optimize the oxidation resistance of TiC/hastelloy (Ni-based alloy) composites applied for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnect by increasing graphite particle size,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.06.085
