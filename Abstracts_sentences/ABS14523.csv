2,14523,"The phase and morphology evolution of the oxide nanofiber are characterized by Thermo-gravimetric-Differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-TR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively.",Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of (Pr0.9La0.1)2(Ni0.74Cu0.21Ga0.05)O4+δ Nanofiber Cathode,10.11862/CJIC.2018.043
3,14523,The results show that PLNCG nanofiber with an average diameter of 420 nm is produced after sintering the precursors at 950 degrees C for 5 h. The nanofiber cathode is formed with mesh-like morphology and keep good contact with the Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CGO) electrolyte after heat-treated at 1 000 degrees C for 2 h. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) results indicate that the nanofiber cathode exhibits superior performance than the powder cathode.,Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of (Pr0.9La0.1)2(Ni0.74Cu0.21Ga0.05)O4+δ Nanofiber Cathode,10.11862/CJIC.2018.043
4,14523,"The polarization resistance (R-P) of the nanofiber cathode is 0.134 Omega center dot cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air, which is 32% less than the PLNCG powder cathode (R-p=0.197 Omega center dot cm(2)).",Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of (Pr0.9La0.1)2(Ni0.74Cu0.21Ga0.05)O4+δ Nanofiber Cathode,10.11862/CJIC.2018.043
