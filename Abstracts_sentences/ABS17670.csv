2,17670,A widely used interconnect ceramic for SOFCs is doped lanthanum chromite.,"Preparation and properties of ceramic interconnecting materials, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-δ doped with GDC for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.091
3,17670,"In this paper, we report a doped lanthanum chromite, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-delta (LCC)+xwt.% Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (GDC) (x=0-10), with improved electrical conductivity and sintering capability.","Preparation and properties of ceramic interconnecting materials, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-δ doped with GDC for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.091
4,17670,"In this composite material system, LCC+GDC were prepared by an auto-ignition process and the electrical conductivity was characterized in air and in H-2.","Preparation and properties of ceramic interconnecting materials, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-δ doped with GDC for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.091
5,17670,"The LCC powders exhibited a better sintering ability and could reach a 94.7% relative density at 1400 degrees C for 4 h in air and with the increase of GDC content the relative density increased, reached 98.5% when the GDC content was up to 10wt.%.","Preparation and properties of ceramic interconnecting materials, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-δ doped with GDC for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.091
6,17670,The electrical conductivity of the samples dramatically increased with GDC addition until a maximum of 134.48 S cm(-1) in air at 900 degrees C when the materials contained 3 wt.% GDC.,"Preparation and properties of ceramic interconnecting materials, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-δ doped with GDC for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.091
7,17670,This is 5.5 times higher than pure LCC (24.63 S cm(-1)).,"Preparation and properties of ceramic interconnecting materials, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-δ doped with GDC for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.091
8,17670,"For the sample with a 1 wt.% GDC content, the conductivity in pure H-2 at 900 degrees C was a maximum 5.45 S cm(-1), which is also higher than that of pure LCC ceramics (4.72 S cm(-1)).","Preparation and properties of ceramic interconnecting materials, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-δ doped with GDC for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.091
9,17670,"The average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) increased with the increase of GDC content, ranging from 11.12 to 14.32 x 10(-6) K-1, the majority of which unfortunately did not match that of 8YSZ.","Preparation and properties of ceramic interconnecting materials, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-δ doped with GDC for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.091
10,17670,"The, oxygen permeation measurement presented a negligible oxygen ionic conduction, indicating that it is still an electronically conducting ceramic.","Preparation and properties of ceramic interconnecting materials, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-δ doped with GDC for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.091
11,17670,"Therefore, it is a very promising interconnect material for higher performance and cost-effectiveness for SOFCs.","Preparation and properties of ceramic interconnecting materials, La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-δ doped with GDC for IT-SOFCs",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.06.091
