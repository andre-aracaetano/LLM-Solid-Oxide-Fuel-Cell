3,10171,"Experimental results indicate that 1) ambient temperature, relative humidity, and thickness of the slurry have significant influence on the morphology of porous membrane; 2) the membrane with a thickness of 35 mu m prepared at 35 degrees C and relative humidity of 70-75% shows the lowest polarization resistance between the LSW/YSZ composite cathode and YSZ electrolyte; and 3) the honeycomb structure of composite cathodes is favorable for lowering the low-frequency resistance concerning diffusion processes at relatively low operating temperatures of 650 and 700 degrees C.
