1,15779,"Detailed process designs and mass/energy balances are developed using a consistent modeling framework and input parameter assumptions for biomass-based power generation at large scale (4536 dry metric tonnes per day switchgrass input), assuming future commercially mature component equipment performance levels.","Performance and cost analysis of future, commercially mature gasification-based electric power generation from switchgrass",10.1002/bbb.138
2,15779,"The simulated systems include two gasification-based gas turbine combined cycles (B-IGCC) designed around different gasifier technologies, one gasification-based solid oxide fuel cell cycle (B-IGSOFC), and a steam-Rankine cycle.","Performance and cost analysis of future, commercially mature gasification-based electric power generation from switchgrass",10.1002/bbb.138
3,15779,"The simulated design-point efficiency of the B-IGSOFC is the highest among all systems (51.8%, LHV basis), with modestly lower efficiencies for the B-IGCC design using a pressurized, oxygen-blown gasifier (49.5% LHV) and for the B-IGCC design using a low-pressure indirectly heated gasifier (48.6%, LHV).","Performance and cost analysis of future, commercially mature gasification-based electric power generation from switchgrass",10.1002/bbb.138
4,15779,The steam-Rankine system has a simulated efficiency of 33.0% (LHV).,"Performance and cost analysis of future, commercially mature gasification-based electric power generation from switchgrass",10.1002/bbb.138
5,15779,Detailed capital costs are estimated assuming commercially mature ('N-th plant') technologies for the two B-IGCC and the steam-Rankine systems.,"Performance and cost analysis of future, commercially mature gasification-based electric power generation from switchgrass",10.1002/bbb.138
6,15779,"B-IGCC systems are more capital-intensive than the steam-Rankine system, but discounted cash flow rate of return calculations highlight the total cost advantage of the B-IGCC systems when biomass prices are higher.","Performance and cost analysis of future, commercially mature gasification-based electric power generation from switchgrass",10.1002/bbb.138
7,15779,Uncertainties regarding prospective mature-technology costs for solid oxide fuel cells and hot gas sulfur clean-up technologies assumed for the B-IGSOFC performance analysis make it difficult to evaluate the prospective electricity generating costs for B-IGSOFC relative to B-IGCC.,"Performance and cost analysis of future, commercially mature gasification-based electric power generation from switchgrass",10.1002/bbb.138
8,15779,The rough analysis here suggests that B-IGSOFC will not show improved economics relative to B-IGCC at the large scale considered here.,"Performance and cost analysis of future, commercially mature gasification-based electric power generation from switchgrass",10.1002/bbb.138
