1,4494,A film percolation model is proposed for composite electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Film percolation for composite electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.03.036
2,4494,The model is developed to predict the percolation properties of 2D-infinite structures which represent the structural characteristics of composite electrodes of electrochemical devices such as SOFCs.,Film percolation for composite electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.03.036
3,4494,"The model can be used to estimate electrode properties, such as percolation probability, active three-phase boundary length and interfacial polarization resistance.",Film percolation for composite electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.03.036
4,4494,"Compared with the classic percolation theory, which is particularly applicable to 3D-infinite bulks, the model can explicitly capture the effects of thinly layered nature of composite electrodes, and describes a cross-over between 2D-infinite films and 3D-infinite bulks.",Film percolation for composite electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.03.036
5,4494,"It also permits the prediction within whole electrode composition range, and can be easily applied in SOFC modeling.",Film percolation for composite electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2011.03.036
