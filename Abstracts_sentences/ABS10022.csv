1,10022,"Using a large-scale, experimentally captured 3D microstructure data set, we implement the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to learn and generate 3D microstructures of solid oxide fuel cell electrodes.","Microstructure Generation via Generative Adversarial Network for Heterogeneous, Topologically Complex 3D Materials",10.1007/s11837-020-04484-y
2,10022,"The generated microstructures are visually, statistically, and topologically realistic, with distributions of microstructural parameters, including volume fraction, particle size, surface area, tortuosity, and triple-phase boundary density, being highly similar to those of the original microstructure.","Microstructure Generation via Generative Adversarial Network for Heterogeneous, Topologically Complex 3D Materials",10.1007/s11837-020-04484-y
3,10022,"These results are compared and contrasted with those from an established, grain-based generation algorithm (DREAM.3D).","Microstructure Generation via Generative Adversarial Network for Heterogeneous, Topologically Complex 3D Materials",10.1007/s11837-020-04484-y
4,10022,"Importantly, simulations of electrochemical performance, using a locally resolved finite element model, demonstrate that the GAN-generated microstructures closely match the performance distribution of the original, while DREAM.3D leads to significant differences.","Microstructure Generation via Generative Adversarial Network for Heterogeneous, Topologically Complex 3D Materials",10.1007/s11837-020-04484-y
5,10022,The ability of the generative machine learning model to recreate microstructures with high fidelity suggests that the essence of complex microstructures may be captured and represented in a compact and manipulatable form.,"Microstructure Generation via Generative Adversarial Network for Heterogeneous, Topologically Complex 3D Materials",10.1007/s11837-020-04484-y
