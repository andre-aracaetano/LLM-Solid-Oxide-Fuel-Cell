1,732,"A new integrated combined cooling, heating and power system which includes a solid oxide fuel cell, Stirling engine, steam turbine, linear Fresnel solar field and double effect absorption chiller is introduced and investigated from energy, exergy and thermodynamic viewpoints.","Introducing an integrated SOFC, linear Fresnel solar field, Stirling engine and steam turbine combined cooling, heating and power process",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.074
2,732,"In this process, produced electrical power by the fuel cell and steam turbines is 6971.8 kW. Stirling engine uses fuel cell waste heat and produces 656 kW power.","Introducing an integrated SOFC, linear Fresnel solar field, Stirling engine and steam turbine combined cooling, heating and power process",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.074
3,732,"In addition, absorption chiller is driven by waste heat of the Stirling engine and generates 2118.8 kW of cooling load.","Introducing an integrated SOFC, linear Fresnel solar field, Stirling engine and steam turbine combined cooling, heating and power process",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.074
4,732,Linear Fresnel solar field produces 961.7 kW of thermal power as a heat exchanger.,"Introducing an integrated SOFC, linear Fresnel solar field, Stirling engine and steam turbine combined cooling, heating and power process",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.074
5,732,"The results indicate that, electrical, energy and exergy efficiencies and total exergy destruction of the proposed system are 49.7%, 67.5%, 55.6% and 12560 kW, respectively.","Introducing an integrated SOFC, linear Fresnel solar field, Stirling engine and steam turbine combined cooling, heating and power process",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.074
6,732,"Finally, sensitivity analysis to investigate effect of the different parameters such as flow rate of inputs, outlet pressure of the components and temperature changes of the solar system on the hybrid system performance is also done.","Introducing an integrated SOFC, linear Fresnel solar field, Stirling engine and steam turbine combined cooling, heating and power process",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.074
