1,16791,Two pellets of yttria-stabilised zirconia in contact were heated to temperatures between 600 and 1000degreesC and the contact resistance over the interface was measured as a function of temperature and mechanical load.,Load induced changes in the contact resistance across an YSZ interface,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1165
2,16791,"The contact resistance decreased with increasing temperature, and the apparent activation energy was found to be higher during heating of a contact than during the subsequent cooling.",Load induced changes in the contact resistance across an YSZ interface,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1165
3,16791,Increasing the mechanical load on the contacts (at fixed temperature) resulted in a decrease of the contact resistance.,Load induced changes in the contact resistance across an YSZ interface,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1165
4,16791,The behaviour could be well fitted by a power law.,Load induced changes in the contact resistance across an YSZ interface,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1165
5,16791,The results obtained for the zirconia contacts are compared to similar experiments performed on an electronically conducting ceramic.,Load induced changes in the contact resistance across an YSZ interface,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1165
