1,14135,Air plasma spraying has been used to produce porous composite cathodes containing (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3-y (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Air plasma spray processing and electrochemical characterization of SOFC composite cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.061
2,14135,Preliminary investigations focused on determining the range of plasma conditions under which each of the individual materials could be successfully deposited.,Air plasma spray processing and electrochemical characterization of SOFC composite cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.061
3,14135,A range of conditions was thereby determined that was suitable for the deposition of a composite cathode from pre-mixed LSM and YSZ powders.,Air plasma spray processing and electrochemical characterization of SOFC composite cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.061
4,14135,A number of composite cathodes were produced using different combinations of parameter values within the identified range according to a Uniform Design experimental grid.,Air plasma spray processing and electrochemical characterization of SOFC composite cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.061
5,14135,Coatings were then characterized for composition and microstructure using EDX and SEM.,Air plasma spray processing and electrochemical characterization of SOFC composite cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.061
6,14135,"As a result of these tests, combinations of input parameter values were identified that are best suited to the production of coatings with microstructures appropriate for use in SOFC composite cathodes.",Air plasma spray processing and electrochemical characterization of SOFC composite cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.061
7,14135,A selection of coatings representative of the types of observed microstructures were then subjected to electrochemical testing to evaluate the performance of these cathodes.,Air plasma spray processing and electrochemical characterization of SOFC composite cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.061
8,14135,"From these tests, it was found that, in general, the coatings that appeared to have the most suitable microstructures also had the highest electrochemical performances, provided that the deposition efficiency of both phases was sufficiently high.",Air plasma spray processing and electrochemical characterization of SOFC composite cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.061
