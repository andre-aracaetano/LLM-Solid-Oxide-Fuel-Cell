1,2395,"Commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is impeded by severe cathode degradation from the poisoning effect of contaminants commonly encountered in air (such as H2O and CO2) and from other cell components (e.g., Cr species from chromium-containing interconnector).",An effective strategy to enhancing tolerance to contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.043
2,2395,Here we report our findings in unraveling the mechanism of Cr-poisoning of La.Sr-6.Co-4.Fe-2.O-8(3) (LSCF) cathodes using our unique in situ/operando surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.,An effective strategy to enhancing tolerance to contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.043
3,2395,"Further, we present an effective strategy to enhancing the tolerance to contaminants poisoning of LSCF cathode through infiltration of a hybrid catalyst coating, which is composed of a conformal film of perovskite PrNi.Mn-5.O-5(3) (PNM) and exsoluted PrOx nano-particles.",An effective strategy to enhancing tolerance to contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.043
4,2395,The coating is catalytically active to oxygen reduction reaction but inert to contaminant poisoning.,An effective strategy to enhancing tolerance to contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.043
5,2395,"When subjected to an accelerated Crpoisoning test, the cells with a hybrid catalyst-coated LSCF cathode show excellent peak power density (P-max of 0.71 Wcm(-2)) and significantly enhanced durability (degradation rate of 0.0434% h(-1) at 0.7 V), much better than those of cells with a bare LSCF cathode (P-max of similar to 0.46 Wcm(-2) and degradation rate of 0.4% h(-1) at 0.7 V).",An effective strategy to enhancing tolerance to contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.043
6,2395,The results suggest that surface modification of electrodes with a coating of rationally designed catalysts is a cost-effective approach to dramatically reducing electrode degradation caused by contaminations.,An effective strategy to enhancing tolerance to contaminants poisoning of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.043
