1,9964,The shipping industry is facing increasing demands to reduce its environmental footprints.,Component sizing and energy management for SOFC-based ship power systems,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114625
2,9964,This has resulted in adoption of new and more environmental friendly power sources and fuels for on-board power generation.,Component sizing and energy management for SOFC-based ship power systems,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114625
3,9964,"One of these novel power sources is the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) which has a great potential to act as a power source, thanks to its high efficiency and capability to handle a wide variety of fuel types.",Component sizing and energy management for SOFC-based ship power systems,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114625
4,9964,"However, SOFCs suffer from low transient capabilities and therefore have never been considered to be used as the main power source for maritime applications.",Component sizing and energy management for SOFC-based ship power systems,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114625
5,9964,"In this paper, novel component sizing, energy and power management approaches are proposed to enable the use of SOFCs as the main on-board power source for the first time in the literature and integrate them into the liquefied natural gas fueled Power and Propulsion System (PPS) of vessels.",Component sizing and energy management for SOFC-based ship power systems,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114625
6,9964,"The proposed component sizing approach determines the power ratings of the on-board sources (SOFC, gas engine and battery) considering size and weight limits, while the energy and power management approaches guarantee an optimal power split between different power sources and PPS stability while looking after battery aging.",Component sizing and energy management for SOFC-based ship power systems,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114625
7,9964,The results indicate that the combined proposed optimization-based approaches can yield up to 53% CO2 reduction and 21% higher fuel utilization efficiency compared to conventional diesel-electric vessels.,Component sizing and energy management for SOFC-based ship power systems,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114625
