1,9717,The effect of iso-octane pretreatment on the efficiency of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is important for selecting suitable pretreating technology.,Efficiency estimation of solid oxide fuel cell integrated with iso-octane pretreating system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.121298
2,9717,"In this work, oxidation index and equivalent fuel utilization for SOFC with pure iso-octane as fuel and pre-treated iso-octane as fuel are designed in a novel way, and then the stable operating condition and efficiency of SOFC integrated with iso-octane pretreating system are investigated based on the fuel composition and anode gas characteristics.",Efficiency estimation of solid oxide fuel cell integrated with iso-octane pretreating system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.121298
3,9717,"At low temperatures, solid carbon and methane are easy to be formed for iso-octane pretreatment, while H2 and CO are easy to be produced at high temperatures from thermodynamics.",Efficiency estimation of solid oxide fuel cell integrated with iso-octane pretreating system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.121298
4,9717,"Steam reforming of 1 mol of iso-octane can produce 17 mol of H2 and 8 mol of CO, and thus steam reforming of iso-octane has little effect on the efficiency of SOFC.",Efficiency estimation of solid oxide fuel cell integrated with iso-octane pretreating system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.121298
5,9717,"When the O/C ratio is 1.5 and the equivalent fuel utilization is 90%, the electrical efficiency of SOFC is 64.6% for steam reforming of iso-octane if the heat is provided by anode off-gas, which is 10.9% higher than that with the fuel from autothermal reforming of isooctane and 32.6% higher than that with the fuel from catalytic partial oxidation of iso-octane.",Efficiency estimation of solid oxide fuel cell integrated with iso-octane pretreating system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.121298
6,9717,"Through investigating the effect of iso-octane pretreating technology on the oxidation index of anode gas and real fuel utilizations of SOFC at different equivalent fuel utilizations, the accurate effect of iso-octane pretreatment on the efficiency of SOFC can be calculated and analyzed for iso-octane-fuelled SOFC, which can provide good guidance for the experimental process and practical application of iso-octane-fuelled SOFC.",Efficiency estimation of solid oxide fuel cell integrated with iso-octane pretreating system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2023.121298
