3,14025,"The pre-exponential factor of the ionic conductivity of each nanocomposite showed a linear correlation with one of the homological invariants corresponding to the three-dimensional (3D) connectivity of the ion-conductive CeO2 phase, i.e., 3D-beta(0).",Correlation between the Charge-Transport Properties and the 3D-Phase Connectivities in Patterned Pt/CeO2 Nanostructured Composites: Implications for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsanm.1c03036
4,14025,"The other descriptor for ionic transport, namely, the activation energy, could not be rationally attributed to any of the Betti numbers but mainly correlated with the local crystallinity at the Pt/CeO2 interface.",Correlation between the Charge-Transport Properties and the 3D-Phase Connectivities in Patterned Pt/CeO2 Nanostructured Composites: Implications for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsanm.1c03036
