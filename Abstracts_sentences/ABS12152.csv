5,12152,"In this work, a unique approach of fabricating a nanostructured Ni-YSZ anode is demonstrated by combining atomic layer deposition (ALD) and glancing angle deposition (GLAD) techniques whereby nickel nanoparticle sintering is prevented at high temperatures with as thin as 1.9 nm YSZ ALD coating on the nickel; the surface area of the resulting Ni-YSZ anode was found to increase more than 3 times that of a planar electrode.",Nanostructured Ni-YSZ by Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1149/2.0121512jss
6,12152,"In addition, the novel ALD/GLAD coating approach used here provides an ionic conductive YSZ electrolyte phase combined with an electrical conductive Ni phase whereby porosity can be controlled through deposition and post-deposition annealing.",Nanostructured Ni-YSZ by Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1149/2.0121512jss
7,12152,"In addition, the surface roughness of Ni-YSZ anode decreases with increasing YSZ coating layer thickness and it is unaffected by the post-deposition annealing process.",Nanostructured Ni-YSZ by Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1149/2.0121512jss
