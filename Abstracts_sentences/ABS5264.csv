4,5264,"Compared to bare Pt thin-film cathode, ALD alumina-overcoated Pt thin-film cathode provided similar to 3-times lower activation ASR and similar to 2-times lower effective electrical conductivity after 4-h operation at 550 degrees C. Despite increases in the thermo-mechanical stability of Pt thin-film cathode by ALD alumina overcoating, it was evaluated that the total ASR of ALD alumina-overcoated Pt thin-film cathode was lower than that of the bare Pt thin-film cathode only if cell dimension is below 0.95 cm(2) because of its lower current collecting performance in the in-plane direction.",Is Coating Oxide on Porous Metal Thin-Film for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathode a Panacea for Performance Enhancement?,10.1007/s12541-022-00628-z
