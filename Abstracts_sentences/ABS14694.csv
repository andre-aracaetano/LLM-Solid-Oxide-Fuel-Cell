1,14694,This paper is focused on the comparative analysis of data on electronic and ionic conduction in gadolinia-doped ceria (CGO) ceramics as well as on the electrochemical properties of various oxide electrodes in contact with ceria-based solid electrolytes.,Ceria-based materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004817506146
2,14694,"Properties of electrode materials, having thermal expansion compatible with that of doped ceria, are briefly reviewed.",Ceria-based materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004817506146
3,14694,"At temperatures below 1000 K, Ce0.90Gd0.10O2-delta (CGO10) was found to possess a better stability at reduced oxygen pressures than Ce0.80Gd0.20O2-delta (CGO20).",Ceria-based materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004817506146
4,14694,"Incorporation of small amounts of praseodymium oxide into Ce0.80Gd0.20O2-delta leads to a slight improvement of the stability of CGO20 at intermediate temperatures, but the difference between electrolytic domain boundaries of the Pr-doped material and CGO10 is insignificant.",Ceria-based materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004817506146
5,14694,"Since interaction of ceria-based ceramis with electrode materials, such as lanthanum-strontium manganites, may result in the formation of low-conductive layers at the electrode/electrolyte interface, optimization of electrode fabrication conditions is needed.",Ceria-based materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004817506146
6,14694,"A good electrochemical activity in contact with CGO20 electrolyte was pointed out for electrodes of perovskite-type La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta and LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3-delta, and LaCoO3-delta/La2Zr2O7 composites; surface modification of the electrode layers with praseodymium oxide results in considerable decrease of cathodic overpotentials.",Ceria-based materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1023/A:1004817506146
