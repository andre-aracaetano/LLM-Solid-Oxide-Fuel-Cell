3,20293,X-ray diffraction results showed that a single-phase fluorite structure formed at a relatively low calcination temperature which is 600 degrees C. Dense Ce0.8Gd0.2-xPrxO1.90 pellets were successfully prepared by sintering at 1400 degrees C for 6 h. The relative density of Ce0.8Gd0.2-xPrxO1.90 samples was over 94% of the theoretical density.,Synthesis and characterization of Pr/Gd co-doped ceria by using the citric acid-nitrate combustion method,10.1016/j.ssi.2018.09.012
