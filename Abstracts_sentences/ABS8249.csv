3,8249,The designed LaFe2O4-GDC heterostructure composite exhibits low-area-specific resistance and high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity at low operating temperatures.,Improved oxygen reduction reaction response of novel spinel structured LaFe2O4 and its heterostructure with Gd-doped-ceria-oxide by Ni foam support for PCFCs cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.11.322
4,8249,"We have demonstrated high-power densities of 835 mW-cm-2 and a current density of 2216 mA-cm2 at 550 & DEG;C for button-sized SOFC with H2 and atmospheric air fuels, and even possible operation at 400 & DEG;C. Moreover, the LaFe2O4-GDC heterostructure composite shows minimal proton migration energy and activation energy compared to individual LaFe2O4 and GDC, which help promote ORR activity.",Improved oxygen reduction reaction response of novel spinel structured LaFe2O4 and its heterostructure with Gd-doped-ceria-oxide by Ni foam support for PCFCs cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.11.322
5,8249,"Various transmission and spectroscopic measurements such as X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy, U-visible, Raman, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to understand the improved ORR electrocatalytic activity of LaFe2O4-GDC heterostructure composite.",Improved oxygen reduction reaction response of novel spinel structured LaFe2O4 and its heterostructure with Gd-doped-ceria-oxide by Ni foam support for PCFCs cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.11.322
