1,2133,The electrochemical activity of a new electrode material based on Pr5Mo3O16 + delta (P\MO) within the composition of a symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell (S-SOFC) of the electrolyte-supported design is studied.,A New Electroactive and Stable Electrode Based on Praseodymium Molybdate for Symmetrical SOFCs,10.1134/S102319352211009X
2,2133,"The model S-SOFC of the P\MO/Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95(GDC)/Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92(YSZ)/GDC/PMO composition demonstrated the maximum power density of 28 mW/cm(2) at 900 degrees C. To improve the power characteristics of S-SOFC, the porous buffer GDC layer is modified by the method of Pr6O11 infiltration.",A New Electroactive and Stable Electrode Based on Praseodymium Molybdate for Symmetrical SOFCs,10.1134/S102319352211009X
3,2133,It is found that the addition of electroactive Pr6O11 into the GDC buffer layer provides the three-fold increase in the fuel-cell power density with the maximum of 90 mW/cm(2) at 900 degrees C.,A New Electroactive and Stable Electrode Based on Praseodymium Molybdate for Symmetrical SOFCs,10.1134/S102319352211009X
4,2133,The 10 h life-time test of the model S-SOFC with the P\MO/GDC + Pr6O11/YSZ/GDC + Pr6O11/PMO composition carried out at a load of 0.7 V reveals the absence of any considerable degradation in fuel cell power characteristics.,A New Electroactive and Stable Electrode Based on Praseodymium Molybdate for Symmetrical SOFCs,10.1134/S102319352211009X
5,2133,The results obtained suggest that the new electrode material based on PMO holds promise for the development of S-SOFC.,A New Electroactive and Stable Electrode Based on Praseodymium Molybdate for Symmetrical SOFCs,10.1134/S102319352211009X
