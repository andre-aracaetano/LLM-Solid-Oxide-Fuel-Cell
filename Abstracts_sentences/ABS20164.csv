1,20164,"This study mainly aimed to elucidate the effects of strontium co-doping on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of erbium-doped ceria (Ce0.8Er0.2O2-delta).","Influence of strontium co-doping on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of erbium-doped ceria electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.023
2,20164,Ce1-x-yErxSryO2-delta co-doped electrolytes were synthesized through sol-gel-assisted citric acid-nitrate combustion technique and sintered at 1500 degrees C for 6 h. X-ray diffraction results confirmed that the sintered electrolytes possessed a cubic fluorite crystal structure.,"Influence of strontium co-doping on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of erbium-doped ceria electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.023
3,20164,"However, a perovskite secondary phase (SrCeO3) was observed in Ce0.8Er0.125Sr0.075O2-delta co-doped composition due to the low solubility limit of strontium (similar to 5 mol%) in ceria.","Influence of strontium co-doping on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of erbium-doped ceria electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.023
4,20164,UV-Vis spectroscopy showed that the co-doping of strontium from 0 mol% to 7.5 mol% increased the direct band gap from 3.41 eV to 3.43 eV.,"Influence of strontium co-doping on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of erbium-doped ceria electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.023
5,20164,"The relative densities and the grain size were in the range of 96.02-97.68% and 1.5-3.28 mu m, respectively, with increasing the strontium content from 0 mol% to 7.5 mol%.","Influence of strontium co-doping on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of erbium-doped ceria electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.023
6,20164,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the total resistance of Ce0.8Er0.2O2-delta increased as the strontium content increased.,"Influence of strontium co-doping on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of erbium-doped ceria electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.023
7,20164,Singly doped Ce0.8Er0.2O2-delta electrolyte exhibited the highest ionic conductivity of 18.22 mS/cm at 700 degrees C and the lowest activation energy of 0.55 eV within 600-800 degrees C among all other studied electrolytes.,"Influence of strontium co-doping on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of erbium-doped ceria electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.12.023
