2,12699,A similar to 50 nm thin LSC air electrode decorated onto a porosity graded Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 backbone via ultrasonic-assisted infiltration showed significantly flourished ORR and OER kinetics with prolific electrochemical performance compared to the cell with conventional LSC air electrode.,Designing the nano-scale architecture of the air electrode for high-performance and robust reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2023.122784
3,12699,"The SOC showed maximum power density of 2.24 W cm(-2) in the fuel cell mode and maximum current density of 4.57 A cm(-2) at an operating voltage of 1.6 V in the electrolysis mode at 750 degrees C. Results of the reversible cycling and galvanostatic stability tests indicate excellent durability, which is attributed to the elimination of detrimental O-2 pressure evolved at the air electrode/electrolyte interface.",Designing the nano-scale architecture of the air electrode for high-performance and robust reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2023.122784
