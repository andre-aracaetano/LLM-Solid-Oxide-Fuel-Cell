2,19988,This study developed SOEC-type reactors for conducting ethanol-assisted water electrolysis for the first time.,Elevated-temperature bio-ethanol-assisted water electrolysis for efficient hydrogen production,10.1016/j.cej.2022.134699
3,19988,"Conventional catalytic steam reforming of ethanol for hydrogen production consumes a lot of heat and includes a complicated process, while the ethanol-assisted water electrolysis can achieve thermoneutral operation at the electrolysis potential of 0.36 V and generate heat at the electrolysis potentials of above 0.36 V, simultaneously obtaining pure hydrogen from cathode chamber by one step.",Elevated-temperature bio-ethanol-assisted water electrolysis for efficient hydrogen production,10.1016/j.cej.2022.134699
4,19988,Micro-reformer constructed by loading fibrous catalysts within channeled anode supports performed efficient ethanol reforming to facilitate fuel oxidation on anode and hence promote steam electrolysis on cathode.,Elevated-temperature bio-ethanol-assisted water electrolysis for efficient hydrogen production,10.1016/j.cej.2022.134699
5,19988,"Employing Ni-based materials for both anode and cathode enables the co-sintering of three layers of SOEC components, resulting in low cell resistances and stable electrolysis at a record high current density of 3.0 A cm-2 under a low overall cell voltage of less than 1.3 V. Therefore, this study has demonstrated an efficient way to generate green hydrogen energy from renewables.",Elevated-temperature bio-ethanol-assisted water electrolysis for efficient hydrogen production,10.1016/j.cej.2022.134699
