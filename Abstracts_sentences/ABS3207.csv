1,3207,A strategy based on tape-casting and laser micro-processing was proposed to enhance the electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells by modifying the electrolytes with a windows structure and a dimples array structure.,Modification of electrolyte surface with windows and dimples array structure for SOFC based on YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.033
2,3207,"Scanning electron microscopy images of the windows structure indicated that the thickness of electrolyte in the thin areas was reduced from 220 gm to 75 pm, resulting in a significant decrease in ohmic resistance by a factor of 1.69 at 800 degrees C.",Modification of electrolyte surface with windows and dimples array structure for SOFC based on YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.033
3,3207,"In addition, three-dimensional profile images of the dimples array structure showed a remarkable increase in the electrode/electrolyte interface area that is directly related to the triple-phase boundaries.",Modification of electrolyte surface with windows and dimples array structure for SOFC based on YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.033
4,3207,"Furthermore, following the modifications in this work, the optimal cell in this study achieved an encouraging performance relative to that of the reference cell, with the peak power density increasing by a factor of 1.63 at 800 degrees C. These results implied that effective structural modification may be a promising approach for improving cell performance.",Modification of electrolyte surface with windows and dimples array structure for SOFC based on YSZ electrolyte,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.033
