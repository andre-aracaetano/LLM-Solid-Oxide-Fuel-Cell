1,12870,"(Ba0.5Sr0.5)(1-x)PrxCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta(BSPCFx; x=0.00-0.30) oxides were synthesized by a sol-gel thermolysis process using combination of PVA and urea, and were also investigated as cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells(IT-SOFCs).",Preparation and performance of Pr-doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/S1002-0721(10)60600-X
2,12870,X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that all the samples formed a single phase cubic pervoskite-type structure after being calcined at 950 degrees C for 5 h and the lattice constant decreased with the Pr content increasing.,Preparation and performance of Pr-doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/S1002-0721(10)60600-X
3,12870,The electrical conductivity of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta(BSCF) was greatly enhanced by Pr-doping.,Preparation and performance of Pr-doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/S1002-0721(10)60600-X
4,12870,"The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of BSPCFx was increased with the content of Pr increasing, and all the thermal expansion curves had an inflection at about 250-400 degrees C due to the thermal-induced lattice oxygen loss and the reaction of Co and Fe ion.",Preparation and performance of Pr-doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/S1002-0721(10)60600-X
