1,3672,It is shown that the electric conductivity of VT1-0 and Fe-18Cr-14Ni powder alloys varies within the range 6.3-8.8a (TM) 10(5) S/m and is 3-5 times higher than the conductivity of extensively used YSZ-Ni anode materials for solid-oxide fuel cells.,Strength and durability of VT1-0 and Fe-18Cr-14Ni powder alloys in high-temperature hydrogen,10.1007/s11003-012-9511-0
2,3672,It is shown that the negative influence of high temperatures on the mechanical characteristics of the investigated materials is much stronger than the influence of hydrogen.,Strength and durability of VT1-0 and Fe-18Cr-14Ni powder alloys in high-temperature hydrogen,10.1007/s11003-012-9511-0
3,3672,It is demonstrated that the ultimate strength and fatigue limit of the Fe-18Cr-14Ni material in high-temperature hydrogen are higher than the same characteristics of VT1-0 alloy and close the critical admissible strength (100 MPa) for solid-oxide fuel cells with anode-substrate.,Strength and durability of VT1-0 and Fe-18Cr-14Ni powder alloys in high-temperature hydrogen,10.1007/s11003-012-9511-0
