7,6184,"As a result of simple simulation considering the Nernst loss, the power density at 0.75 V was estimated to be 0.169 W/cm2 at Uf = 0.8 for a large-scall cell with di-mensions of 10 x 10 cm2, which is smaller than that for a button cell with a cathode diameter of 6 mm (0.730 W/ cm2 at Uf = 0.04).",Why is the performance different between small- and large-scale SOFCs?,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.141965
