1,18262,"This paper seeks to examine how the Mn-Co spinel interconnect coating microstructure can influence Cr contamination in an oxygen electrode of intermediate temperature solid oxide cells, at an operating temperature of 750 degrees C. A Mn-Co spinel coating is processed on Crofer 22 APU substrates by electrophoretic deposition, and subsequently sintered, following both the one-step and two-step sintering, in order to obtain significantly different densification levels.",Manganese-Cobalt Based Spinel Coatings Processed by Electrophoretic Deposition Method: The Influence of Sintering on Degradation Issues of Solid Oxide Cell Oxygen Electrodes at 750 째C,10.3390/ma14143836
2,18262,The electrochemical characterization is performed on anode-supported cells with an LSCF cathode.,Manganese-Cobalt Based Spinel Coatings Processed by Electrophoretic Deposition Method: The Influence of Sintering on Degradation Issues of Solid Oxide Cell Oxygen Electrodes at 750 째C,10.3390/ma14143836
3,18262,The cells were aged prior to the electrochemical characterization in contact with the spinel-coated Crofer 22 APU at 750 degrees C for 250 h. Current-voltage and impedance spectra of the cells were measured after the exposure with the interconnect.,Manganese-Cobalt Based Spinel Coatings Processed by Electrophoretic Deposition Method: The Influence of Sintering on Degradation Issues of Solid Oxide Cell Oxygen Electrodes at 750 째C,10.3390/ma14143836
4,18262,"Post-mortem analysis of the interconnect and the cell was carried out, in order to assess the Cr retention capability of coatings with different microstructures.",Manganese-Cobalt Based Spinel Coatings Processed by Electrophoretic Deposition Method: The Influence of Sintering on Degradation Issues of Solid Oxide Cell Oxygen Electrodes at 750 째C,10.3390/ma14143836
