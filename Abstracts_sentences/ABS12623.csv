2,12623,"Herein, three R-P structure oxides, Pr2-xSrxNi0.2Mn0.8O4 (x = 1, 1.2, and 1.5), are used as the semiconductor materials of single-component cells.",The Performance of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) Structured Pr2-xSrxNi0.2Mn0.8O4 for Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c04593
3,12623,The materials for the oxygen side are hybrid oxides consisting of R-P structure oxide and perovskite oxide.,The Performance of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) Structured Pr2-xSrxNi0.2Mn0.8O4 for Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c04593
4,12623,"The hydrogen side was exposed to the reduction atmosphere before the test, and the perovskite structure disappeared and the lattice parameters of the R-P structure changed, resulting in the formation of a new R-P structure and MnO2 or NiMn alloy.",The Performance of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) Structured Pr2-xSrxNi0.2Mn0.8O4 for Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c04593
5,12623,"In addition, Pr0.5Sr1.5Ni0.2Mn0.8O4 and reduced Pr0.5Sr1.5Ni0.2Mn0.8O4 exhibit the most content of oxygen vacancy.",The Performance of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) Structured Pr2-xSrxNi0.2Mn0.8O4 for Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c04593
6,12623,"For a single-component fuel cell (SCFC), the cell performance increased with the decrease in Pr content.",The Performance of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) Structured Pr2-xSrxNi0.2Mn0.8O4 for Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c04593
7,12623,"The SCFC composed of Pr0.5Sr1.5Ni0.2Mn0.8O4 shows the highest maximum power densities (P-max), which reached 206.6 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C.",The Performance of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) Structured Pr2-xSrxNi0.2Mn0.8O4 for Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c04593
8,12623,It is because the reduced Pr0.5Sr1.5Ni0.2Mn0.8O4 has the highest catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR).,The Performance of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) Structured Pr2-xSrxNi0.2Mn0.8O4 for Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c04593
9,12623,"Furthermore, the Pmax at 700 degrees C can reach a value of 198.1 mW cm(-2) in SOFC mode, and in the case of SOEC mode, the current density at 700 degrees C is as high as -390.8 mA cm(-2) with an applied electrolysis voltage of 1.3 V for the reversible single-component cell (RSCC) with Pr0.5Sr1.5Ni0.2Mn0.8O4 as the semiconducting electrocatalyst.",The Performance of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) Structured Pr2-xSrxNi0.2Mn0.8O4 for Reversible Single-Component Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c04593
