1,20540,One of the paramount obstacles to the commercialization of La1-xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-delta (LSGM)-based intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells is the high cost and low mechanical strength associated with the use of Ga2O3.,Beneficial effects of Mg-excess in La1-xSrxGa1-yMgy + zO3-δ as solid electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.02.042

5,20540,The microstructures revealed by SEM indicate an increased appearance of the Mg-rich second phase along the grain-boundaries with increasing Mg-excess level even though regular XRD could not discern the presence of this second phase.,Beneficial effects of Mg-excess in La1-xSrxGa1-yMgy + zO3-δ as solid electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.02.042
