1,8452,The aim of the present study is the measurement and understanding of sulfur poisoning phenomena in nickel/gadolinium-doped ceria (CGO) based solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) operating on reformate fuels.,Sulfur Poisoning of Electrochemical Reformate Conversion on Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Electrodes,10.1021/acscatal.7b02177
2,8452,"The sulfur poisoning behavior of commercial, high-performance electrolyte-supported cells (ESC) with Ni/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CGO10) anodes operated with different fuels was thoroughly investigated by means of current-voltage characteristics and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and compared with Ni/Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anodes.",Sulfur Poisoning of Electrochemical Reformate Conversion on Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Electrodes,10.1021/acscatal.7b02177
3,8452,Various methane and carbon monoxide containing fuels were used in order to elucidate the underlying reaction mechanism.,Sulfur Poisoning of Electrochemical Reformate Conversion on Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Electrodes,10.1021/acscatal.7b02177
4,8452,The analysis of the cell resistance increase in H-2/H2O/CO/CO2 fuel gas mixtures revealed that the poisoning behavior is mainly governed by an inhibited hydrogen oxidation reaction at low current densities.,Sulfur Poisoning of Electrochemical Reformate Conversion on Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Electrodes,10.1021/acscatal.7b02177
5,8452,"At higher current densities, the resistance increase becomes increasingly large, indicating a particularly severe poisoning effect on the carbon monoxide conversion reactions.",Sulfur Poisoning of Electrochemical Reformate Conversion on Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Electrodes,10.1021/acscatal.7b02177
6,8452,"However, the ability of Ni/CGO anodes to convert carbon monoxide even at H2S concentrations up to 20 ppm was demonstrated, while this was not possible for Ni/YSZ.",Sulfur Poisoning of Electrochemical Reformate Conversion on Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Electrodes,10.1021/acscatal.7b02177
7,8452,The sulfur poisoning behavior of Ni/CGO in reformate fuels was fully reversible for short exposure times.,Sulfur Poisoning of Electrochemical Reformate Conversion on Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Electrodes,10.1021/acscatal.7b02177
8,8452,"From methane steam re-forming experiments, it is deduced that the Ni surface is blocked and, thus, the water-gas shift reaction is fully deactivated as well.",Sulfur Poisoning of Electrochemical Reformate Conversion on Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Electrodes,10.1021/acscatal.7b02177
9,8452,"However, electrochemical CO oxidation on the CGO surface was shown to be still active.",Sulfur Poisoning of Electrochemical Reformate Conversion on Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Electrodes,10.1021/acscatal.7b02177
10,8452,The present results clearly demonstrate that the high sulfur tolerance of Ni/CGO not only is limited to H-2/H2O fuel systems but also extends to CO-containing gases.,Sulfur Poisoning of Electrochemical Reformate Conversion on Nickel/Gadolinium-Doped Ceria Electrodes,10.1021/acscatal.7b02177
