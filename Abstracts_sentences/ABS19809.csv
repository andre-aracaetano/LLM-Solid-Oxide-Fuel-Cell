3,19809,"Through X-ray diffraction, it was seen that Nb5+ has limited solubility in CeO2 which could be enhanced by codoping with Eu3+.","Defect evolution in Eu3+, Nb5+ doped and co-doped CeO2: X-ray diffraction, positron annihilation lifetime and photoluminescence studies",10.1039/c9qi00668k
4,19809,"From Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction data, the ceria lattice seems to expand on Eu3+ doping which could be explained taking into account the formation of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in stoichiometric ratios.","Defect evolution in Eu3+, Nb5+ doped and co-doped CeO2: X-ray diffraction, positron annihilation lifetime and photoluminescence studies",10.1039/c9qi00668k
5,19809,The observed lower than expected contraction in the Nb5+ doped samples is attributed to lattice expansion due to the creation of oxygen interstitials (OIs).,"Defect evolution in Eu3+, Nb5+ doped and co-doped CeO2: X-ray diffraction, positron annihilation lifetime and photoluminescence studies",10.1039/c9qi00668k
6,19809,PL studies in terms of the ratio of electric dipole transition (EDT) to magnetic dipole transition (MDT) intensities have shown that Eu3+ lacks inversion symmetry at Ce4+ which invokes the formation of OVs for charge compensation.,"Defect evolution in Eu3+, Nb5+ doped and co-doped CeO2: X-ray diffraction, positron annihilation lifetime and photoluminescence studies",10.1039/c9qi00668k
7,19809,"Interestingly, Nb5+ co-doping restored the inversion symmetry around the Eu3+ site by eliminating the formed OVs.","Defect evolution in Eu3+, Nb5+ doped and co-doped CeO2: X-ray diffraction, positron annihilation lifetime and photoluminescence studies",10.1039/c9qi00668k
8,19809,This is achieved by ion pair matching of the dopants.,"Defect evolution in Eu3+, Nb5+ doped and co-doped CeO2: X-ray diffraction, positron annihilation lifetime and photoluminescence studies",10.1039/c9qi00668k
