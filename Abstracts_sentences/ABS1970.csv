1,1970,"Recent research has shown that fuel cells using semiconductor-ionic conductor material (SIM) as electrolytes can achieve good performance due to the enhancement of ionic conductivity, and the Schottky junction is expected to block the electron conduction to further address the shorting circuit issue, but efficient characterization of the blocking electron ability of the Schottky junction is absent.",Characterizing the Blocking Electron Ability of the Schottky Junction in SnO2-SDC Semiconductor-Ionic Membrane Fuel Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c01344
2,1970,"In this work, SnO2-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) SIM was applied as an electrolyte membrane to assemble the semiconductor-ionic membrane fuel cell (SIMFC).",Characterizing the Blocking Electron Ability of the Schottky Junction in SnO2-SDC Semiconductor-Ionic Membrane Fuel Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c01344
3,1970,"Although the SnO2-SDC SIM electrolyte possessed certain electron conduction, such a device can also deliver an open circuit voltage above 1 V, and the maximum output power reached 1059 W cm(-2) at 550 degrees C without a shorting circuit problem.",Characterizing the Blocking Electron Ability of the Schottky Junction in SnO2-SDC Semiconductor-Ionic Membrane Fuel Cells,10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c01344
