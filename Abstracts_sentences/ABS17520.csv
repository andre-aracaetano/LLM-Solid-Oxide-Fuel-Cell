2,17520,"In this work, performance and stability of flat-tube SOCs during periodic cycles of CO(2 )electrolysis and hydrogen fuel discharge were studied.",High reversible cycling performance of carbon dioxide electrolysis by flat-tube solid oxide cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118969
3,17520,"The cell underwent 26 reversible cycles of operation for 624 h. When the cell was electrolyzed with a current density of-200 mA/ cm(2 )at 1.07 V, the CO yield was 205.79 sccm and the CO2 conversion rate reached 45.7%.",High reversible cycling performance of carbon dioxide electrolysis by flat-tube solid oxide cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118969
4,17520,"When the cell was operated in electrolysis mode, the degradation rate was 0.74 mV/h. Excluding the air heat consumption, the energy conversion efficiency was 81.42%; when the cell was operated at 0.6 slm hydrogen and +200 mA/cm(2), the degradation rate was 0.385 mV/h.",High reversible cycling performance of carbon dioxide electrolysis by flat-tube solid oxide cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118969
5,17520,"Compared with long-term constant current electrolysis, the alternate operation of charge and discharge used in this study is more typical of the actual application conditions.",High reversible cycling performance of carbon dioxide electrolysis by flat-tube solid oxide cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118969
