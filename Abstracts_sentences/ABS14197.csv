1,14197,"In order to develop high performance intermediate temperature (< 800 degrees C) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a lower fabrication cost, a pressurized spray process of ceramic suspensions has been established to prepare both dense yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte membranes and transition anode layers on NiO + YSZ anode supports.",Thin yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and transition layers fabricated by particle suspension spray,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.060
2,14197,A single cell with 10 mu m thick YSZ electrolyte on a porous anode support and similar to 20 mu m thick cathode layer showed peak power densities of only 212 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C and 407 mW cm(-2) for 800 degrees C.,Thin yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and transition layers fabricated by particle suspension spray,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.060
3,14197,"While a cell with 10 mu m thick YSZ electrolyte and a transition layer on the porous anode support using a ultra-fine NiO + YSZ powder showed peak power densities of 346 and 837 mW cm(-2) at 700 and 800 degrees C, respectively.",Thin yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and transition layers fabricated by particle suspension spray,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.060
4,14197,The dramatic improvement of cell performance was attributed to the much improved anode microstructure that was confirmed by both scanning electron microscopes (SEM) observation and impedance spectroscopy.,Thin yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and transition layers fabricated by particle suspension spray,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.060
5,14197,The results have demonstrated that a pressurized spray coating is a suitable technique to fabricate high performance SOFCs and at lower cost.,Thin yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and transition layers fabricated by particle suspension spray,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.060
