1,19758,"The oxygen electrodes from two solid oxide electrolysis stacks that performed high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) and produced hydrogen for 1000 and 2000 h, respectively, were examined using X-ray fluorescence, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), four-point resistivity, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman micro-spectroscopy to determine possible causes for the degradation in stack performance over the test periods.",Post-test evaluation of oxygen electrodes from solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.061
2,19758,"These techniques yielded information such as elemental distribution, oxidation state, phases present, electrode delamination, and porosity within the electrode layers.",Post-test evaluation of oxygen electrodes from solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.061
3,19758,"From these studies, we found two phenomena that were likely the cause of increasingly poor oxygen electrode performance over time.",Post-test evaluation of oxygen electrodes from solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.061
4,19758,"The first source of degradation was chromium substitution into the oxygen electrode bond layer, which serves to bond the cell to the flow field and interconnect.",Post-test evaluation of oxygen electrodes from solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.061
5,19758,This is caused by migration of a chromium species from the bipolar plate.,Post-test evaluation of oxygen electrodes from solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.061
6,19758,The effect of this is a significant increase in the electrical resistance of the bond layer material.,Post-test evaluation of oxygen electrodes from solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.061
7,19758,The other source of degradation identified was oxygen electrode delamination.,Post-test evaluation of oxygen electrodes from solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.061
8,19758,"The cause of electrode delamination, which is locally catastrophic to the operation of the cell, is unclear; however, we will discuss two possible mechanisms that might cause this phenomenon.",Post-test evaluation of oxygen electrodes from solid oxide electrolysis stacks,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.061
