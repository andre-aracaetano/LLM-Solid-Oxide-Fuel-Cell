1,15114,"Due to its high oxygen ion conductivity at elevated temperatures, samarium-doped ceria (SDC) is a very promising material for application in solid state electrochemical devices and especially in the electrolytes of solid oxide fuel cells.",Effects of Strontium Content on the Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of Samarium-Doped Ceria,10.3390/solids2030019
2,15114,Several prior studies have reported a further improvement in the ionic conductivity of SDC on doping with small amounts of strontium.,Effects of Strontium Content on the Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of Samarium-Doped Ceria,10.3390/solids2030019
3,15114,"It is suggested that strontium acts as a sintering aid-improving the microstructure of SDC-and as a scavenger of silicon impurities, decreasing its tendency to form resistive phases at grain boundaries.",Effects of Strontium Content on the Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of Samarium-Doped Ceria,10.3390/solids2030019
4,15114,"However, because of the range of preparation methods and the resulting differences in microstructure and silicon levels, some inconsistencies exist in the literature.",Effects of Strontium Content on the Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of Samarium-Doped Ceria,10.3390/solids2030019
5,15114,"Furthermore, the effect of strontium on the intrinsic (bulk) conductivity of SDC is not often discussed.",Effects of Strontium Content on the Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of Samarium-Doped Ceria,10.3390/solids2030019
6,15114,"To address these issues, a systematic, combined microstructural and conductivity study has been performed on a compositional series with a range of strontium contents, Ce0.8-xSm0.2SrxO2-delta (x = 0, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04).",Effects of Strontium Content on the Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of Samarium-Doped Ceria,10.3390/solids2030019
7,15114,A low temperature synthesis affording products with low silicon was employed.,Effects of Strontium Content on the Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of Samarium-Doped Ceria,10.3390/solids2030019
8,15114,Total bulk and grain boundary conductivity data were obtained over a wide temperature range.,Effects of Strontium Content on the Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of Samarium-Doped Ceria,10.3390/solids2030019
9,15114,"Increasing strontium content caused a general decrease in total and intrinsic conductivity, but there was an improvement in grain boundary conductivity at the lowest strontium levels.",Effects of Strontium Content on the Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of Samarium-Doped Ceria,10.3390/solids2030019
10,15114,"These results were interpreted by reference to the microstructures using, among other parameters, the blocking, and normalised blocking, factors.",Effects of Strontium Content on the Microstructure and Ionic Conductivity of Samarium-Doped Ceria,10.3390/solids2030019
