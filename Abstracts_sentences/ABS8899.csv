1,8899,Distribution of oxygen isotope 18O concentration which was labeled in lanthanum strontium manganese (LSM) - yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cathode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is predicted through numerical simulations using a three-dimensional microstructure which was reconstructed by a focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM).,Three-dimensional numerical simulation of oxygen isotope transport in lanthanum strontium manganese-Yttria-stabilized zirconia cathode of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.349
2,8899,"The electrochemical reaction under the SOFC operation is first numerically simulated, then the unsteady 18O transport is simulated by coupling self-diffusion by concentration gradient, migration by the electrochemical potential field, and electrochemical reaction at the triple phase boundaries.",Three-dimensional numerical simulation of oxygen isotope transport in lanthanum strontium manganese-Yttria-stabilized zirconia cathode of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.349
3,8899,"Predicted results were compared with the measured 18O concentration by a secondary ion mass spectrometry taken at the intermediate plane of the reconstructed 3D microstructure, which showed qualitative consistency between them.",Three-dimensional numerical simulation of oxygen isotope transport in lanthanum strontium manganese-Yttria-stabilized zirconia cathode of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.349
