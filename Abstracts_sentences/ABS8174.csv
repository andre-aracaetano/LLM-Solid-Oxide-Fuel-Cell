1,8174,"In this work, a novel Co/Sm-doped CeO2 (SDC)/Co trilayer of similar to 6 mu m is deposited by alternating electrodeposition and electrophoresis and oxidized to a Co3O4/SDC/Co3O4 trilayer structure.",Co3O4/Sm-Doped CeO2/Co3O4 Trilayer Coating on AISI 441 Interconnect for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.6b14562
2,8174,This coating is unique and effective in the following aspects: (1) The area specific resistance of the coated interconnect is more stable and lower than that of the uncoated interconnect after thermal treatment at 800 degrees C for 400 h. (2) The Co3O4/SDC/Co3O4 coating layer can effectively inhibit Cr diffusion and evaporation and significantly slow the oxidation rate of the interconnect.,Co3O4/Sm-Doped CeO2/Co3O4 Trilayer Coating on AISI 441 Interconnect for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.6b14562
3,8174,(3) The Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode in the electrolyte/cathode/interconnect half-cell retains its initial stoichiometry after 100 h of the thermal treatment.,Co3O4/Sm-Doped CeO2/Co3O4 Trilayer Coating on AISI 441 Interconnect for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.6b14562
4,8174,"Subsequently, the ohmic resistance R-Omega, high frequency polarization resistance R-H, and low frequency polarization resistance R-L of the half-cell with the Co3O4/SDC/Co3O4 coated interconnect are all smaller than those of the half cell with the bare interconnect.",Co3O4/Sm-Doped CeO2/Co3O4 Trilayer Coating on AISI 441 Interconnect for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.6b14562
5,8174,"The Co3O4/SDC/Co3O4 coating layer has great advantages to be used as a protective layer for the metallic interconnect in solid oxide fuel cells to improve cell performance, stability, and durability.",Co3O4/Sm-Doped CeO2/Co3O4 Trilayer Coating on AISI 441 Interconnect for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.6b14562
