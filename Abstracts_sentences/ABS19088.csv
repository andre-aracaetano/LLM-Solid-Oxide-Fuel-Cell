4,19088,"In the limiting case of free sintering, the constitutive law reduces to a conventional isotropic constitutive law The anisotropic constitutive law is used to calculate sintering deformation of a constrained film bonded to a rigid substrate and the compressive stress required in a sinter-forging experiment to achieve zero lateral shrinkage The results are compared with experimental data in the literature.",Predicting sintering deformation of ceramic film constrained by rigid substrate using anisotropic constitutive law,10.1016/j.actamat.2010.07.015
