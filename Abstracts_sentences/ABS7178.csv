1,7178,It is normally difficult to prepare nano-sized Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta(BSCF) oxide at high temperature due to its high surface activity.,A novel route to synthesize nano-crystalline Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ perovskite oxide at high temperature,
2,7178,"The complexing process, which has successfully applied in the synthesis of nano Sm0.15Ce0.85O1.925 with crystallite size down to 5 nm(1), just resulted in a coarse BSCF with crystallite size of 41.9 nm at 900 degrees C. We applied a novel process by simply modifying the solid precursor from the complexing process with concentrated nitric acid treatment.",A novel route to synthesize nano-crystalline Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ perovskite oxide at high temperature,
3,7178,The obtained BSCF powder had a crystallite size of similar to 25 nm even calcined at 1000 degrees C.,A novel route to synthesize nano-crystalline Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ perovskite oxide at high temperature,
4,7178,The small crystallite size is extremely promising to enhance the electrochemical performance of cathode for solid oxide fuel cell dramatically.,A novel route to synthesize nano-crystalline Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ perovskite oxide at high temperature,
