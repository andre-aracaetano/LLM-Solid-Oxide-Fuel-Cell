3,5977,"Herein, a novel A-site high entropy oxide, based on the cobalt-free PrBaFe2O5+& delta; (PBF) cathode, La0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Gd0.2BaFe2O5+& delta; (LPNSGBF), is proposed as a high catalyst activity and Cr-tolerance cathode for SOFC.",Utilizing High Entropy Effects for Developing Chromium-Tolerance Cobalt-Free Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.202304728
4,5977,"The anode-supported cell with the LPNSGBF cathode exhibits an excellent peak power density of 1020.69 mW cm(-2) at 800 & DEG;C, which is better than that of the PBF (794.96 mW cm(-2)).",Utilizing High Entropy Effects for Developing Chromium-Tolerance Cobalt-Free Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.202304728
5,5977,"Moreover, under the Cr-containing atmosphere, the outstanding stability of the single cell with the LPNSGBF for 100 h with a degradation rate of 0.17% h(-1), is much lower than the 0.79% h(-1) for that of the PBF cathode.",Utilizing High Entropy Effects for Developing Chromium-Tolerance Cobalt-Free Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/adfm.202304728
