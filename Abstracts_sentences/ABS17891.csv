1,17891,"Several commercial alloys including Ebrite, Crofer 22 APU, Haynes 230 and Haynes 242, which are candidates for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) interconnect materials, were isothermally and cyclically oxidized at 900 degrees C in the reducing atmosphere of Ar + 5 vol.% H-2 + 3 vol.% H2O corresponding to the SOFC anode environment.",Performance evaluation of several commercial alloys in a reducing environment,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.12.067
2,17891,Results indicate that these alloys exhibited good scale spallation resistance with the Ni-base alloys possessing better oxidation resistance over the Fe-base alloys.,Performance evaluation of several commercial alloys in a reducing environment,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.12.067
3,17891,Both Mn-Cr spinel and Cr2O3 were formed in the oxide scales of these alloys.,Performance evaluation of several commercial alloys in a reducing environment,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.12.067
