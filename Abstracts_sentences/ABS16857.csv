1,16857,Elemental enrichment behavior on the surface of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) was investigated in order to understand potential degradation mechanism of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes.,Mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode degradation,10.1557/jmr.2012.222
2,16857,Surface morphological changes were examined using scanning electron microscopy after heat treatment in the temperature range of 600-900 degrees C. Submicron-sized precipitates were formed on grain surfaces after heat treatment.,Mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode degradation,10.1557/jmr.2012.222
3,16857,Their shapes appeared to be aligned along the surface orientations of the underlying grains.,Mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode degradation,10.1557/jmr.2012.222
4,16857,Auger electron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy characterization revealed that the precipitate was strontium (Sr)-oxygen (O) based.,Mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode degradation,10.1557/jmr.2012.222
5,16857,The formation of Sr-O precipitates was found to increase with increasing temperature and oxygen partial pressure.,Mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode degradation,10.1557/jmr.2012.222
6,16857,A defect chemistry model is presented based on the observed phenomena.,Mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathode degradation,10.1557/jmr.2012.222
