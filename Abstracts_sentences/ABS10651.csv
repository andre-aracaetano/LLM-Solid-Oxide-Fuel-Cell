1,10651,The efficiency of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) can be improved by using a Ni-mesh between the ferritic steel interconnect and the Ni/YSZ anode.,Influence of Alloying Elements on the Behavior of Different Ferritic Steels as Candidate Materials for SOFC Interconnect,10.1007/s11085-017-9777-6
2,10651,"However, interdiffusion processes can lead to internal oxidation within the Ni-mesh and some microstructural changes, i.e., formation of an austenite zone and accelerated formation of sigma-phase at the ferrite/austenite interface.",Influence of Alloying Elements on the Behavior of Different Ferritic Steels as Candidate Materials for SOFC Interconnect,10.1007/s11085-017-9777-6
3,10651,These changes may adversely affect the performance of the cell during long-term operation.,Influence of Alloying Elements on the Behavior of Different Ferritic Steels as Candidate Materials for SOFC Interconnect,10.1007/s11085-017-9777-6
4,10651,The present work focused on the influence of certain alloying elements on the overall behavior of the ferritic steel under simulated SOFC operating conditions to define conditions to minimize sigma-phase formation without degrading the oxidation resistance and mechanical properties of the steel.,Influence of Alloying Elements on the Behavior of Different Ferritic Steels as Candidate Materials for SOFC Interconnect,10.1007/s11085-017-9777-6
5,10651,"The experimental results indicate that decreasing the amount of Cr and adjusting the amount of Nb, Si and W of the steel is a possible way to achieve that goal.",Influence of Alloying Elements on the Behavior of Different Ferritic Steels as Candidate Materials for SOFC Interconnect,10.1007/s11085-017-9777-6
