5,5607,"Among the various chemical compositions investigated in the (Y1-xCax)BaCo4-yZnyO7 system, the (Y0.5Ca0.5)BaCo2.5Zn1.5O7 composition offers a combination of good electrochemical performance and low TEC, while maintaining the phase stability at 600-800 degrees C for 120 h. The (Y0.5Ca0.5)BaCo2.5Zn1.5O7 + GDC (50: 50 wt. %) composite cathodes exhibit a maximum power density of similar to 450 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C in anode-supported single SOFC.",Characterization of (Y1-xCax)BaCo4-yZnyO7 as cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.08.089
