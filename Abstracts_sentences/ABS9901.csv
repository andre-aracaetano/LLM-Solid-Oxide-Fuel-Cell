4,9901,"Among the cathode materials in this study, the highest catalytic activity for the ORR is achieved with Sr2.7Ca0.3Nd0.3Fe1.4Co0.6O7.delta + Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (GDC) composite cathode with an area specific resistance of 0.034 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Long-term thermal stability test shows that no impurity forms when Sr(2.7-x)Ca(x)Ln(0.3)Fe(2-y)Co(y)O(7-delta) oxides were heated at 800 degrees C for 150 h in air.",Electrochemical properties of Sr2.7-xCaxLn0.3Fe2-yCoyO7-δ cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.11.129
