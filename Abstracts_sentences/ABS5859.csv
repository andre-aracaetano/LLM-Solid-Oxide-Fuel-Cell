1,5859,To quickly and accurately obtain the multi-dimensional state in a sealing reactor is critical for the safety and high performance of industrial system.,Machine learning based soft sensor and long-term calibration scheme: A solid oxide fuel cell system case,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.134
2,5859,"In this work, a generic machine learning based multi-dimensional soft sensor and a long-term calibration scheme is proposed by using the case of steam reforming solid oxide fuel cell (SR-SOFC) system.",Machine learning based soft sensor and long-term calibration scheme: A solid oxide fuel cell system case,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.134
3,5859,"Firstly, based on a validated SR-SOFC system model, the temporal-spatial temperature distribution (TSTD) characteristics are analyzed and a TSTD characteristic model is constructed by Multivariable Linear Regression.",Machine learning based soft sensor and long-term calibration scheme: A solid oxide fuel cell system case,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.134
4,5859,"Then, the central node temperature of the stack is estimated by applying the Least Square Support Vector Machine and the SR-SOFC stack temperature distribution is accurately obtained by explaining the TSTD characteristics model with the central node temperature.",Machine learning based soft sensor and long-term calibration scheme: A solid oxide fuel cell system case,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.134
5,5859,"In addition, the temperature distribution is calibrated by Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm to eliminate the estimation error resulting from stack degradation in a long term.",Machine learning based soft sensor and long-term calibration scheme: A solid oxide fuel cell system case,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.134
6,5859,"The simulation results show that the proposed method can obtain the SR-SOFC stack temperature distribution in time and effectively, the average error is less than 1 K. The proposed estimation strategy can be easily expanded to other scenarios with similar operation conditions.",Machine learning based soft sensor and long-term calibration scheme: A solid oxide fuel cell system case,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.134
