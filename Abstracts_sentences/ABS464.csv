1,464,The aim of this work was to achieve a deeper understanding of the heat transfer in a microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (mSOFC) stack based on the results obtained by means of a Computational Fluid Dynamics tool.,CFD ANALYSIS OF HEAT TRANSFER IN A MICROTUBULAR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL STACK,10.2478/cpe-2014-0022
2,464,"Stack performance predictions were based on simulations for a 16 anode-supported mSOFCs sub-stack, which was a component of the overall stack containing 64 fuel cells.",CFD ANALYSIS OF HEAT TRANSFER IN A MICROTUBULAR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL STACK,10.2478/cpe-2014-0022
3,464,"The emphasis of the paper was put on steady-state modelling, which enabled identification of heat transfer between the fuel cells and air flow cooling the stack and estimation of the influence of stack heat losses.",CFD ANALYSIS OF HEAT TRANSFER IN A MICROTUBULAR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL STACK,10.2478/cpe-2014-0022
4,464,Analysis of processes for different heat losses and the impact of the mSOFC reaction heat flux profile on the temperature distribution in the mSOFC stack were carried out.,CFD ANALYSIS OF HEAT TRANSFER IN A MICROTUBULAR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL STACK,10.2478/cpe-2014-0022
5,464,Both radiative and convective heat transfer were taken into account in the analysis.,CFD ANALYSIS OF HEAT TRANSFER IN A MICROTUBULAR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL STACK,10.2478/cpe-2014-0022
6,464,Two different levels of the inlet air velocity and three different values of the heat losses were considered.,CFD ANALYSIS OF HEAT TRANSFER IN A MICROTUBULAR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL STACK,10.2478/cpe-2014-0022
7,464,"Good agreement of the CFD model results with experimental data allowed to predict the operation trends, which will be a reliable tool for optimisation of the working setup and ensure sufficient cooling of the mSOFC stack.",CFD ANALYSIS OF HEAT TRANSFER IN A MICROTUBULAR SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL STACK,10.2478/cpe-2014-0022
