5,16918,Three elementary steps are considered to be involved in the cathode reaction: (i) Dissociation of molecular adsorbed oxygen into atom adsorbed oxygen on cathode surface; (ii) Bulk diffusion of adsorbed of O2- in the bulk LSCF phase; (iii) Oxygen ions transfer at the interface between the cathode and the electrolyte.,An investigation of oxygen reduction mechanism in nano-sized LSCF-SDC composite cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.153
6,16918,"For the cathodes sintered at 1073 K and 1173 K, the polar resistance in the medium frequency range was dominant and step (ii) is the rate determining step.",An investigation of oxygen reduction mechanism in nano-sized LSCF-SDC composite cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.153

8,16918,"The ratio of the polar resistance in the medium frequency range to the total cathode polar resistance decreases with increasing the calcination temperature, from 70.6% at 1073 K to 29.6% at 1473 K, but the ratio of the polar resistance in the low frequency range to the total cathode polar resistance increases with increasing the calcination temperature, from 4.9% at 1073 K to 58% at 1473 K, implying that the cathode process is limited by step (iii) when the cathode calcination temperature is at 1473 K.
