4,8891,"From the force-displacement curves, the glass transition temperature (T(g)) of the non-aged, sintered GC-9 glass is estimated to be between 700 degrees C and 750 degrees C, while that of the aged one is between 750 degrees C and 800 degrees C. Due to a crack healing effect of the residual glass at high temperature, the flexural strength of the sintered GC-9 glass at temperature of 650 degrees C to T(g) point is greater than that at room temperature.",High-temperature mechanical properties of a solid oxide fuel cell glass sealant in sintered forms,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.035
