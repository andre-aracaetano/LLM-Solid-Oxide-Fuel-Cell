4,2010,"We have shown that a button-sized SOFC fueled by H-2 and ambient air can provide 835 mW/cm(2) of power and 2216 mA/cm(2) of current at 550 & DEG;C, possibly functioning down to 450 & DEG;C. In addition, the oxygen vacancy formation energy and activation energy of the CMFA-ZnO heterostructure composite is lower than those of the individual CMFA and ZnO, facilitating ion transit.",Improved Ionic Transport Using a Novel Semiconductor Co0.6Mn0.4Fe0.4Al1.6O4 and Its Heterostructure with Zinc Oxide for Electrolyte Membrane in LT-CFCs,10.3390/nano13121887
