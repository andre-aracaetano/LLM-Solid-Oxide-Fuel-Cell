1,3128,"According to the characterization of the microstructure and properties of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) electrodes, it is essential to verify various processing variables to control microstructural parameters, such as particle size, composition and spatial distribution of the constituent phases of the electrode in order to reduce the ohmic and diffusional polarization losses of the unit-cell performance.",Effect of cathode current-collecting layer on unit-cell performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.015
2,3128,"From this viewpoint, a current-collecting layer with controlled microstructure very effectively enhances the unit-cell performance by reducing the ohmic and polarization resistance of the cathode.",Effect of cathode current-collecting layer on unit-cell performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.015
3,3128,"The maximum power density of a 5 cm x 5 cm unit-cell with the controlled current-collecting layer is similar to 1.5 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, while a unit-cell without the layer is much lower, viz., 0.9 W cm(-2).",Effect of cathode current-collecting layer on unit-cell performance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.015
