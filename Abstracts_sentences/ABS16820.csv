1,16820,"Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powders have been prepared by the sol-gel method, following two alternative procedures: a series of powders was obtained by drying the sol-gel solutions in air at 100 degrees C until dry residue, and another series of powders was obtained by scratching the thin films deposited on cylindrical wide flat glassy surfaces after evaporating to dryness in air at 100 degrees C for 2 h. Samples were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption at -196 degrees C and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.",Tailoring the properties of yttria-stabilized zirconia powders prepared by the sol-gel method for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.05.033

3,16820,Powders prepared by conventional drying of sol-gel solutions at 100 degrees C exhibit remarkably high values of specific surface area (up to 148 m(2) g(-1)).,Tailoring the properties of yttria-stabilized zirconia powders prepared by the sol-gel method for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.05.033

5,16820,"Values of fractal dimension follow the same trend and indicate that, in general, the texture of the samples is mainly microporous for the first series of samples and more ordered for the second one.",Tailoring the properties of yttria-stabilized zirconia powders prepared by the sol-gel method for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.05.033
6,16820,"Finally, in order to investigate the effect of the calcination temperature on the morphological and textural properties of 3 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia powders, once the 3YSZ powders were dried at 100 degrees C they were subjected to calcination at different temperatures.",Tailoring the properties of yttria-stabilized zirconia powders prepared by the sol-gel method for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.05.033
7,16820,The experimental results suggest that the removal of residual water and alcohol occluded within the powder particles as well as the elimination of gases produced during the calcination stage play a very important role in the development of the porosity and surface area of the samples.,Tailoring the properties of yttria-stabilized zirconia powders prepared by the sol-gel method for potential use in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.05.033
