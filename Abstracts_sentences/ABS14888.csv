1,14888,It is shown that the substitution of 5% ferroactive molybdenum cations for iron to the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - delta (LSCF) structure leads to a considerable increase in the electric conductivity.,Modifying the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodic Material by Ferroactive Molybdenum Cation,10.1134/S1023193522020112
2,14888,"Using the powder X-ray diffraction technique, the solubility limit of molybdenum in the structure of rhombohedral perovskite is found.",Modifying the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodic Material by Ferroactive Molybdenum Cation,10.1134/S1023193522020112
3,14888,It is noted that the transport characteristics of perovskite with the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.75Mo0.05O3 - delta (LSCFM5) composition are sufficient for using it as the cathode material in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT SOFCs).,Modifying the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathodic Material by Ferroactive Molybdenum Cation,10.1134/S1023193522020112
