1,1699,This study presents an energetic performance analysis for a combined power generation system consisting of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC).,A study on performance of solid oxide fuel cell-organic Rankine cycle combined system,10.1002/er.1490
2,1699,"In order to simulate the SOFC-ORC combined system under steady-state conditions, a mathematical model is developed.",A study on performance of solid oxide fuel cell-organic Rankine cycle combined system,10.1002/er.1490
3,1699,The developed model is used to determine the potential effects caused by the changes of the design parameters on the energetic performance of the combined system.,A study on performance of solid oxide fuel cell-organic Rankine cycle combined system,10.1002/er.1490
4,1699,"As design parameters, turbine inlet pressure, condenser temperature, fuel utilization, current density, compressor pressure ratio, and cell operating temperature are taken into account.",A study on performance of solid oxide fuel cell-organic Rankine cycle combined system,10.1002/er.1490
5,1699,"In this regard, the electrical power and First Law efficiency are estimated by parametrical analysis and discussed comprehensively.",A study on performance of solid oxide fuel cell-organic Rankine cycle combined system,10.1002/er.1490
6,1699,Results of these analyses show that the efficiency is increased about 14-25% by recovering SOFC waste heat through ORC based on investigated design parameter conditions.,A study on performance of solid oxide fuel cell-organic Rankine cycle combined system,10.1002/er.1490
