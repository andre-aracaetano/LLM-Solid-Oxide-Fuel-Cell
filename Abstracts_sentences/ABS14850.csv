1,14850,Mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIECs) show greatly enhanced electrochemical properties as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,A Nano-Structured SOFC Composite Cathode Prepared via Infiltration of La0.5Ba0.25Sr0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ into La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ for Extended Triple-Phase Boundary Area,10.1149/2.0851912jes
2,14850,"Among promising MIEC candidates, La0.5Ba0.25Sr0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LBSCF) is chosen as a cathode material in this study due to its high oxygen ion diffusivity and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.",A Nano-Structured SOFC Composite Cathode Prepared via Infiltration of La0.5Ba0.25Sr0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ into La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ for Extended Triple-Phase Boundary Area,10.1149/2.0851912jes
3,14850,"It is well known that the composite configuration with superior oxygen ion conductor, e.g., La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM), results in the improvement of cell performance.",A Nano-Structured SOFC Composite Cathode Prepared via Infiltration of La0.5Ba0.25Sr0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ into La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ for Extended Triple-Phase Boundary Area,10.1149/2.0851912jes
4,14850,"Here, we successfully fabricate the LBSCF-LSGM composite cathode by infiltration method at a low sintering temperature (< 800 degrees C), and thus nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the LSGM porous scaffold.",A Nano-Structured SOFC Composite Cathode Prepared via Infiltration of La0.5Ba0.25Sr0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ into La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ for Extended Triple-Phase Boundary Area,10.1149/2.0851912jes
5,14850,"A half-cell exhibits an extremely low area-specific resistances (ASRs) of 0.010, 0.020, and 0.049 degrees cm(2) at 700, 650, and 600 degrees C, respectively.",A Nano-Structured SOFC Composite Cathode Prepared via Infiltration of La0.5Ba0.25Sr0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ into La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ for Extended Triple-Phase Boundary Area,10.1149/2.0851912jes
6,14850,"Further, the peak power density about 0.9 W cm(-2) is attained at 700 degrees C, suggesting that infiltrated LBSCF-LSGM composite demonstrates sufficient ORR activities at an intermediate temperature and thus to be a highly promising cathode material for IT-SOFCs.",A Nano-Structured SOFC Composite Cathode Prepared via Infiltration of La0.5Ba0.25Sr0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ into La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ for Extended Triple-Phase Boundary Area,10.1149/2.0851912jes
