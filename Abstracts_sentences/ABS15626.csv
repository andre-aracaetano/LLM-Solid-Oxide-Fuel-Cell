4,15626,"The deposition area is reach to 4.1 mu m from the electrode/electrolyte interface after cathodic polarization with a current density of 400 mA cm(-2) for 1200 min. TEM results clearly demonstrate that the particles on LSM surface are MnCr2O4 spinels, which means that the Cr species would react with Mn from LSM and then lead to the structural damages of LSM cathode.",The investigation of Cr deposition and poisoning effect on Sr-doped lanthanum manganite cathode induced by cathodic polarization for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.112
5,15626,"A high polarization current of 800 mA cm(-2) significantly accelerates Cr deposition process, resulting in a wider deposition area of 5.9 mu m on LSM surface.",The investigation of Cr deposition and poisoning effect on Sr-doped lanthanum manganite cathode induced by cathodic polarization for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.112
6,15626,"The present results show that the Cr deposition occurs beyond the electrolyte/electrode interface, which reveals that the deposition of Cr species is driven by chemical reaction, not electrochemical reduction.",The investigation of Cr deposition and poisoning effect on Sr-doped lanthanum manganite cathode induced by cathodic polarization for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.112
