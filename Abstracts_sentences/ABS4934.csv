2,4934,A strategy is proposed for eliminating hotspots and reducing temperature gradients in SOFCs via inclusion of a material that exhibits a dramatic change in resistance near the desired maximum cell temperature.,Integrated thermal management strategy and materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.100
3,4934,Three PTC thermistor materials with transition temperatures near the maximum desirable SOFC operating temperature are identified and screened for compatibility with common SOFC materials.,Integrated thermal management strategy and materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.100
4,4934,All are found to be unsuitable because of reaction with the SOFC materials or unacceptably small PTC effect.,Integrated thermal management strategy and materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.100
