1,10847,We studied the application of LaCoO3 system cathode to improve the performance of segmented-in-series tubular type solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at high temperature (1173 K).,"Optimization of Segmented-in-series Tubular SOFCs with an (La, Sr)CoO3 System Cathode and the Generation Characteristics under Pressurization",10.5796/electrochemistry.77.1018
2,10847,"(La1-xSrx)CoO3 (LSC, x = 0.2 or more) was chosen to take advantage of two of its properties: high electric conductivity and favorable behavior of element diffusion to a cathode interlayer (CIL) of (Sm0.2Ce0.8)O-2 (SDC20).","Optimization of Segmented-in-series Tubular SOFCs with an (La, Sr)CoO3 System Cathode and the Generation Characteristics under Pressurization",10.5796/electrochemistry.77.1018
3,10847,The cell stack performances were compared using LSC and (La0.5Sr0.2Ca0.25)MnO3 (LSCM) to cathode current collection layer (CCCL).,"Optimization of Segmented-in-series Tubular SOFCs with an (La, Sr)CoO3 System Cathode and the Generation Characteristics under Pressurization",10.5796/electrochemistry.77.1018
4,10847,The modification of cell stack structure composed of effective generation part and interconnector part was also examined.,"Optimization of Segmented-in-series Tubular SOFCs with an (La, Sr)CoO3 System Cathode and the Generation Characteristics under Pressurization",10.5796/electrochemistry.77.1018
5,10847,The area specific resistance (ASR) of the overall cell stack resistance with LSC modifying a stack structure decreased 18% than that of the stack using LSCM with conventional structure at atmospheric pressure.,"Optimization of Segmented-in-series Tubular SOFCs with an (La, Sr)CoO3 System Cathode and the Generation Characteristics under Pressurization",10.5796/electrochemistry.77.1018
6,10847,"In a pressurized test of the cell stack fabricated with LSC, an increase of pressure resulted in a decrease of the ASR.","Optimization of Segmented-in-series Tubular SOFCs with an (La, Sr)CoO3 System Cathode and the Generation Characteristics under Pressurization",10.5796/electrochemistry.77.1018
7,10847,"As a result of comparing the pressurized performances of LSCM CCCL/(LSCM-10YSZ) CIL, LSCM/SDC20 and LSC/SDC20, the effect of ASR decrease by pressurization fell as the cell stack performances improve.","Optimization of Segmented-in-series Tubular SOFCs with an (La, Sr)CoO3 System Cathode and the Generation Characteristics under Pressurization",10.5796/electrochemistry.77.1018
8,10847,"We also found, however, that the cell stack fabricated with LSC will require improvements in long-term durability and thermal cycle characteristics.","Optimization of Segmented-in-series Tubular SOFCs with an (La, Sr)CoO3 System Cathode and the Generation Characteristics under Pressurization",10.5796/electrochemistry.77.1018
