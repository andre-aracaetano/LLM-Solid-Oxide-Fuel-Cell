2,15935,Perovskite materials are characterized by mixed electronic-ionic conductivity that combined to the high intrinsic catalytic activity of Ni allows to achieve high reaction rates.,Investigation composite Ni-doped perovskite anode catalyst for electrooxidation of hydrogen in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.021
3,15935,Suitable power densities of about 420 mW/cm(2) for the direct oxidation of hydrogen were achieved at 800 degrees C. Temperature programmed reduction analysis carried out in hydrogen reveals that the catalyst at 800 degrees C has totally lost the perovskite structure showing formation of substructures such as NiOOH and NiLa2O4.,Investigation composite Ni-doped perovskite anode catalyst for electrooxidation of hydrogen in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.021
