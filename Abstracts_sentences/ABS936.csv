2,936,"With this method, high-quality ceramic electrolyte membranes can be prepared at 1100 degrees C, thus enabling the fabrication of entire cells in a single step.",Fabrication of one-step co-fired proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with the assistance of microwave sintering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.08.020
3,936,"The microwave sintering method not only enhances electrolyte densification but also improves the cathode/electrolyte interface, which is critical for improving fuel cell performance.",Fabrication of one-step co-fired proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with the assistance of microwave sintering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.08.020
4,936,The power output of the co-sintered cell prepared under the microwave conditions (up to 449 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C) was significantly higher than that of the cell fabricated using the traditional co-sintering method (approximately 292 mW cm(-2) at the same temperature).,Fabrication of one-step co-fired proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with the assistance of microwave sintering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.08.020
5,936,"Electrochemical analysis revealed that the enhanced electrolyte density and the improved cathode/electrolyte interface achieved by using the microwave sintering technique decrease both the ohmic resistance and the polarisation resistance of the cell, leading to good fuel cell performance.",Fabrication of one-step co-fired proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with the assistance of microwave sintering,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.08.020
