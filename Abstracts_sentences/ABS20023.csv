3,20023,Modern 9% Cr-steels have sufficient creep strength however their corrosion resistance particularly in H2O containing oxidising environments (e. g. up to 25% H2O in the combustion of biomass or the oxyfuel process) needs further improvement.,Improved oxidation resistance of ferritic-martensitic steels in water vapour containing environments via diffusion coatings,10.3184/096034012X13315446390033
4,20023,"A large number of studies have shown that the corrosion resistance of 9% Cr-steels in water vapour containing combustion environments is inferior to that in dry atmospheres, due to the formation of a volatile Cr-species of the type CrO2(OH)(2).",Improved oxidation resistance of ferritic-martensitic steels in water vapour containing environments via diffusion coatings,10.3184/096034012X13315446390033
5,20023,"This investigation starts from the idea of a shift of partial pressure of CrO2(OH)(2) to lower values if the solid oxide phase on the alloy surface is a manganese-chromium-spinel scale, so that at 630 degrees C the formation of volatile chromium species can be suppressed.",Improved oxidation resistance of ferritic-martensitic steels in water vapour containing environments via diffusion coatings,10.3184/096034012X13315446390033
