1,2055,"A nonmetal doping strategy was exploited for the conventional La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-delta (LSF) cathode, allowing high performance for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs).",Tailoring cobalt-free La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ cathode with a nonmetal cation-doping strategy for high-performance proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/sus2.79
2,2055,"Unlike previous studies focusing on the utilization of metal oxides as dopants, phosphorus, which is a nonmetal element, was used as the cation dopant for LSF by partially replacing Fe ions to form the new La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9P0.1O3-delta (LSFP) compound.",Tailoring cobalt-free La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ cathode with a nonmetal cation-doping strategy for high-performance proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/sus2.79
3,2055,The H-SOFC using the LSFP cathode showed a two-fold peak power density as compared to that using the LSF cathode.,Tailoring cobalt-free La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ cathode with a nonmetal cation-doping strategy for high-performance proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/sus2.79
4,2055,Both experimental studies and first-principle calculations were used to unveil the mechanisms for the high performance of the LSFP cells.,Tailoring cobalt-free La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ cathode with a nonmetal cation-doping strategy for high-performance proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1002/sus2.79
