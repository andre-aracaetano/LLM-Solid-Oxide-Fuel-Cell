1,32,The feasibility of conversion of propane to propylene in a fuel cell using yttrium-doped barium cerate as the proton-conducting electrolyte and platinum as anode and cathode catalysts was investigated.,Conversion of propane to propylene in a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.fuel.2006.06.012
2,32,"The distribution of gas products from anode outlet was analyzed by gas chromatography and, discussed under open circuit conditions and when discharging the fuel cell.",Conversion of propane to propylene in a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.fuel.2006.06.012
3,32,"Under open circuit conditions, because there were only chemically catalytic reactions and thermal reactions in the anode chamber, the gas slate was little selective to propylene.",Conversion of propane to propylene in a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.fuel.2006.06.012
4,32,"However, the propylene selectivity was obviously enhanced when discharging the fuel cell, through activating the electro-catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.",Conversion of propane to propylene in a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.fuel.2006.06.012
5,32,The propylene yield obtained from the electro-catalytic reaction reached 70-80%.,Conversion of propane to propylene in a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.fuel.2006.06.012
6,32,"In addition, relatively good fuel cell performances were achieved.",Conversion of propane to propylene in a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.fuel.2006.06.012
7,32,The influences of the operating temperature and propane flow rate on the fuel cell performances were also discussed.,Conversion of propane to propylene in a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.fuel.2006.06.012
