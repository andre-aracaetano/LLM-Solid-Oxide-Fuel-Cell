1,3600,Porous composites of Sr0.88Y0.08TiO3-delta (YST) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were formed by tape-casting methods and examined as potential anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC).,Characterization of YSZ-YST composites for SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.033
2,3600,"Even after calcination to 1773 K, the YSZ and YST crystallites remain as separate phases, as demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDX analysis.",Characterization of YSZ-YST composites for SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.033

4,3600,"Cells with anodes having 50-wt.% YST and 80-wt.% YST were tested and shown to yield good open-circuit voltages (OCV), although the power densities in H-2 and CH4 between 973 and 1173 K were modest.",Characterization of YSZ-YST composites for SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.033
