1,6038,A method for sealing solid oxide fuel cells with silver wire gaskets was developed and tested.,Silver wire seal design for planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.05.038
2,6038,"The 1.6 mm diameter gaskets were fitted into machined channels, 1.5 mm deep in the interconnect plates.",Silver wire seal design for planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.05.038
3,6038,The channels were machined into 430 stainless steel plate along the edge of both surfaces and around alternate gas inlets.,Silver wire seal design for planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.05.038
4,6038,"The interconnect plates were 6.35 mm thick, 152.4 mm long and 76.2 mm wide.",Silver wire seal design for planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.05.038
5,6038,A one-cell-stack was assembled for pressure testing with a stainless steel sheet in place of the ceramic membrane.,Silver wire seal design for planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.05.038
6,6038,The gas connections were brazed to the stack with a nickel-chromium brazing alloy.,Silver wire seal design for planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.05.038
7,6038,"The apparatus was bolted together and tested for gas leakage at 137.8 kPa between room temperature and 500 degreesC. At room temperature, the measured leak rate was 5.14 kPa min(-1).",Silver wire seal design for planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.05.038
8,6038,"With the stack heated to 500 degreesC, the leak rate decreased to 75.8 Pa min(-1).",Silver wire seal design for planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.05.038
