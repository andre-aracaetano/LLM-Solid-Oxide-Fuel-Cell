2,16179,The mixed electronic and oxide ionic conductivity in CeO2 was significantly improved through the double doping of Mn and Fe.,"A Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense nanofilm as an improved active anode for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c3ra40257f
3,16179,"Although the solid solubility limit of Mn was approximately 20 mol%, no impurity phase was observed at 30 mol% Mn when Mn was co-doped with 10 mol% Fe; this result suggests that the solubility limit of Mn was expanded through the addition of Fe.","A Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense nanofilm as an improved active anode for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c3ra40257f
4,16179,The nano-sized Fe- and Mn-doped CeO2 (CMF) film was highly active toward the anode reaction despite its high density.,"A Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense nanofilm as an improved active anode for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c3ra40257f
5,16179,"In addition, the CMF thin film was effective in preventing Ni diffusion into the LaGaO3 electrolyte film; CMF therefore exhibits bi-functional properties for solid oxide fuel cells with LaGaO3 perovskite electrolyte films.","A Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense nanofilm as an improved active anode for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c3ra40257f
6,16179,"Furthermore, the insertion of a CMF dense film between the Ni-Fe substrate and the LSGM (La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3) electrolyte resulted in a significant increase in the power density of the cell, particularly at intermediate temperatures.","A Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense nanofilm as an improved active anode for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c3ra40257f

10,16179,The high power density of the cell was explained by the enhanced anodic activity.,"A Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense nanofilm as an improved active anode for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c3ra40257f
11,16179,"Compared with porous anodes, the nano-sized film showed a significantly lower overpotential because of the improved oxygen ion conductivity and charge-transfer steps.","A Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense nanofilm as an improved active anode for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c3ra40257f
12,16179,"Therefore, the nano-sized CMF dense film described here can serve as a unique active anode material.","A Ce(Mn,Fe)O2 dense nanofilm as an improved active anode for metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c3ra40257f
