1,453,Fuel cells offer the possibility of zero-emissions electricity generation and increased energy security.,Fuel cell materials and components,10.1016/j.actamat.2003.08.004
2,453,We review here the current status of solid oxide (SOFC) and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEMFC) fuel cells.,Fuel cell materials and components,10.1016/j.actamat.2003.08.004
3,453,"Such solid electrolyte systems obviate the need to contain corrosive liquids and are thus preferred by many developers over alkali, phosphoric acid or molten carbonate fuel cells.",Fuel cell materials and components,10.1016/j.actamat.2003.08.004
4,453,Dramatic improvements in power densities have been achieved in both SOFC and PEMFC systems through reduction of the electrolyte thickness and architectural control of the composite electrodes.,Fuel cell materials and components,10.1016/j.actamat.2003.08.004
5,453,"Current efforts are aimed at reducing SOFC costs by lowering operating temperatures to 500-800 degreesC, and reducing PEMFC system complexity be developing 'water-free' membranes which can also be operated at temperatures slightly above 100 degreesC.
