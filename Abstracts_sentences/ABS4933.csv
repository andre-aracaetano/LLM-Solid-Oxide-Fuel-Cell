1,4933,The demand for electric vehicles has inspired extensive efforts to develop solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for transportation.,Direct octane fuel cells: A promising power for transportation,10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.02.006
2,4933,"However, the high cost of hydrogen fueled SOFC systems and the deactivation of Ni-YSZ anodes in hydrocarbon fuels hinder the progress of SOFCs' development and commercialization.",Direct octane fuel cells: A promising power for transportation,10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.02.006
3,4933,"Here, we report a unique multi-functional anode for SOFCs that allows direct utilization of transportation fuels (iso-octane) without co-feeding O-2 and CO2, demonstrating a peak power density of similar to 0.6 W/cm(2) at 750 degrees C.",Direct octane fuel cells: A promising power for transportation,10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.02.006
4,4933,"The multi-functional anode is derived from a conventional NiO-YSZ anode with BaCO3 modification in the anode support, creating a catalytically active conformal coating of BaZr1-xYxO3-delta (BZY) on YSZ and nano-islands of BaO on Ni surface, which greatly promote reforming of octane and oxidation of the reformed fuels.",Direct octane fuel cells: A promising power for transportation,10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.02.006
5,4933,"Further, the simple and cost-effective modification process can be readily adopted in the fabrication of the state-of-the-art NiO-YSZ supported cells.",Direct octane fuel cells: A promising power for transportation,10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.02.006
