1,20287,"In this work, lanthanum calcium strontium titanates (La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3; LSCTA-) are modified with zinc, manganese and chromium (1%; 5%) for their application as solid oxide fuel cell anodes.","Synthesis, characterization, fabrication, and electrochemical performance of transition metal doped LSCTA- as anode candidates for SOFCS",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124875
2,20287,These compositions are characterized by X-ray diffraction that indicate successful doping of metals onto the parent (LSCTA-) material without a change in the crystallography and leading to a lattice contraction depending on metal element and amount.,"Synthesis, characterization, fabrication, and electrochemical performance of transition metal doped LSCTA- as anode candidates for SOFCS",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124875
3,20287,Fabrication of the electrodes from the LSCTA- on yttria-stabilized zirconia plates is done by air spraying.,"Synthesis, characterization, fabrication, and electrochemical performance of transition metal doped LSCTA- as anode candidates for SOFCS",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124875
4,20287,"The electrode performance of the materials is checked under reducing atmosphere (dry; 5% H-2/Ar, humidified; 4% H2O/H-2) and at different sintering (1200 and 1250 degrees C) and operating (750-650 degrees C) temperatures.","Synthesis, characterization, fabrication, and electrochemical performance of transition metal doped LSCTA- as anode candidates for SOFCS",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124875
5,20287,"The materials sintered at high temperature (1250 degrees C) show comparatively lower polarization resistances (RP) under humidified atmosphere, hence indicate better electrode performance in the presence of steam.","Synthesis, characterization, fabrication, and electrochemical performance of transition metal doped LSCTA- as anode candidates for SOFCS",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124875
6,20287,"Among these doped compositions, polarization resistance is found lower for LSCTA-modified with 1% Zn than all other doped compositions.","Synthesis, characterization, fabrication, and electrochemical performance of transition metal doped LSCTA- as anode candidates for SOFCS",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124875
7,20287,"Overall, the polarization resistance of both LSCTA-with 1% Zn (23 Omega cm(2)) and 5% Zn (25 Omega cm(2)) at 750 degrees Cis found lower in comparison to the value reported at 900 degrees C for parent material (45 Omega cm(2)) under humidified atmosphere.","Synthesis, characterization, fabrication, and electrochemical performance of transition metal doped LSCTA- as anode candidates for SOFCS",10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124875
