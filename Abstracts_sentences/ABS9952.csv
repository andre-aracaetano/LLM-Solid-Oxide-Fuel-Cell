3,9952,"The stack power output initially increased 3.7% during the first 34h probably due to electrode activation processes improving cell performance under polarization during the early stage of operation, and then gradually decreased.",One thousand-hour long term characteristics of a propane-fueled solid oxide fuel cell hot zone,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.098
4,9952,It has been clearly illustrated that operating condition of constant current is more beneficial to the long term performance test.,One thousand-hour long term characteristics of a propane-fueled solid oxide fuel cell hot zone,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.098
5,9952,"Further, based on thermodynamics analysis, the electromotive force of nickel oxidation is 13.2 V for the stack voltage at the stack temperature of 740 degrees C. From the initial current-power curve data, it can be derived that if the hot zone durability test was performed at constant current of 9 A from the beginning, the stack degradation rate would be 15% per 1000 h. The 1000-h durability test and analysis can better understand how to run longer term stability on the hot zone and guide the optimization of hot zone operating conditions.",One thousand-hour long term characteristics of a propane-fueled solid oxide fuel cell hot zone,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.098
