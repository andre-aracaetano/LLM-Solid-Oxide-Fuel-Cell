2,4790,The model structures consisted of micrometer-scale columns and nanoscale branches of ionically conducting materials that were coated with a mixed-conducting material.,Finite-Element Modeling of Idealized Infiltrated Composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3076133
3,4790,The structures approximate an ionic-conductor matrix infiltrated first with the same ionic-conductor material and then with a mixed conductor.,Finite-Element Modeling of Idealized Infiltrated Composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3076133
4,4790,"Increasing the length of the ionically conducting nanobranches, and hence, the surface area of the infiltrated mixed conductor, resulted in a factor of similar to 10 polarization resistance decrease compared to mixed-conductor-coated columns without ionically conducting nanobranches.",Finite-Element Modeling of Idealized Infiltrated Composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3076133
5,4790,"For many solid oxide fuel cell relevant temperatures (500-900 degrees C), cathode geometries, and materials, the cathode resistance was limited by surface oxygen exchange and hence, was inversely proportional to the mixed-conductor surface area.",Finite-Element Modeling of Idealized Infiltrated Composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3076133
6,4790,"However, for cathode columns or branches with large enough aspect ratios, ionic-conduction losses also limited the polarization resistance.",Finite-Element Modeling of Idealized Infiltrated Composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3076133
7,4790,The characteristic length of nanostructured cathodes was found to depend on the cathode surface area ratio in addition to the traditional bulk diffusion constant to surface exchange constant ratio (D/k).,Finite-Element Modeling of Idealized Infiltrated Composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3076133
8,4790,"Lastly, the effects of materials properties, particularly ionic conductivity and surface resistance, were investigated and discussed for common cathode materials.",Finite-Element Modeling of Idealized Infiltrated Composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3076133
