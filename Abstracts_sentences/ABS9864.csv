1,9864,"In this study, a novel interconnector design is proposed, which is named as the X-type interconnector.",A novel interconnector design of SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.252
2,9864,The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) models are established for the conventional interconnector and the X-type interconnector.,A novel interconnector design of SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.252
3,9864,"The results indicate that the design of the X-type interconnector is beneficial to the transport of gas in SOFC, which has a higher oxygen concentration under rib than that of the conventional interconnector.",A novel interconnector design of SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.252
4,9864,"Furthermore, compared with the X-type interconnector, the potential difference in cathode is larger for the conventional interconnector, which indicates that the X-type interconnector reduces the current path and improves the performance of SOFC.",A novel interconnector design of SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.252
5,9864,"For any porosity and conductivity of anode and cathode, the X-type interconnector is superior to the conventional interconnector.",A novel interconnector design of SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.252
6,9864,"Moreover, when the cathode conductivity is smaller, the advantage of the X-type interconnector becomes more remarkable.",A novel interconnector design of SOFC,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.252
