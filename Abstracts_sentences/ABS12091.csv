1,12091,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are potentially the most efficient technology for direct conversion of hydrocarbons to electricity.,A robust fuel cell operated on nearly dry methane at 500 °C enabled by synergistic thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis,10.1038/s41560-018-0262-5
2,12091,"While their commercial viability is greatest at operating temperatures of 300-500 degrees C, it is extremely difficult to run SOFCs on methane at these temperatures, where oxygen reduction and C-H activation are notoriously sluggish.",A robust fuel cell operated on nearly dry methane at 500 °C enabled by synergistic thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis,10.1038/s41560-018-0262-5
3,12091,Here we report a robust SOFC that enabled direct utilization of nearly dry methane (with similar to 3.5% H2O) at 500 degrees C (achieving a peak power density of 0.37W cm(-2)) with no evidence of coking after similar to 550 h operation.,A robust fuel cell operated on nearly dry methane at 500 °C enabled by synergistic thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis,10.1038/s41560-018-0262-5
4,12091,The cell consists of a PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta nanofibre-based cathode and a BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta-based multifunctional anode coated with Ce0.90Ni0.05Ru0.05O2 (CNR) catalyst for reforming of CH4 to H-2 and CO.,A robust fuel cell operated on nearly dry methane at 500 °C enabled by synergistic thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis,10.1038/s41560-018-0262-5
5,12091,"The high activity and coking resistance of the CNR is attributed to a synergistic effect of cationic Ni and Ru sites anchored on the CNR surface, as confirmed by in situ/operando experiments and computations.",A robust fuel cell operated on nearly dry methane at 500 °C enabled by synergistic thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis,10.1038/s41560-018-0262-5
