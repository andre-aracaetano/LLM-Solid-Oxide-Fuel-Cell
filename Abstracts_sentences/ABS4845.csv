1,4845,"Molten In, Pb, and Sb were examined as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) that operate between 973 and 1173 K.",Molten-Metal Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/ie100457t
2,4845,The results for these metals were compared with those reported previously for molten Sn electrodes.,Molten-Metal Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/ie100457t
3,4845,"Cells were operated under battery conditions, with dry He or N-2 flow in the anode compartment, to characterize the electrochemical oxidation of the metals at the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-electrolyte interface.",Molten-Metal Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/ie100457t
4,4845,"In most cases, the open-circuit voltages (OCVs) were close to that based on equilibrium between the metals and their oxides.",Molten-Metal Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/ie100457t
5,4845,"With Sn and In, the cell impedances increased dramatically at all temperatures after drawing current due to formation of insulating, oxide barriers at the electrolyte interface.",Molten-Metal Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/ie100457t
6,4845,"Similar results were observed for Pb at 973 and 1073 K, but the impedance remained low even after PbO formation at 1173 K because this is above the melting temperature of PbO. Similarly, the impedances of molten Sb electrodes at 973 K were low and unaffected by current flow because of the low melting temperature of Sb2O3.",Molten-Metal Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/ie100457t
7,4845,The potential of using molten-metal electrodes for direct-carbon fuel cells and for energy-storage systems is discussed.,Molten-Metal Electrodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/ie100457t
