6,14540,"Using La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) perovskite oxide as the cathode to assess the boron deposition and poisoning, the results indicate that the polarization performance of the LSCF cathode for the O-2 reduction reaction in the presence of Bi and Zn doped glass is very stable with a negligible change in the microstructure of the electrodes.",New zinc and bismuth doped glass sealants with substantially suppressed boron deposition and poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta02951h
7,14540,"In contrast, in the case of conventional borosilicate glass, boron preferentially deposits in the electrode/electrolyte region under cathodic polarization, forming primarily LaBO3, disintegrating the perovskite structure and significantly degrading the electrochemical activity of the LSCF cathodes.",New zinc and bismuth doped glass sealants with substantially suppressed boron deposition and poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta02951h
8,14540,"Doping Bi or Zn remarkably reduces the boron volatility of the glass, thus effectively inhibiting the poisoning of boron species on the microstructure and electrocatalytic activity of SOFC cathodes such as LSCF.",New zinc and bismuth doped glass sealants with substantially suppressed boron deposition and poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta02951h
