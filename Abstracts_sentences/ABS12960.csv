5,12960,"Due to the low detection limits and therefore high analytical sensitivity, wavelength dispersive electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) provides a precise method to determine element distribution, absolute element concentration and changes between the reference material and aged cells on a microstructural level by element mappings and concentration profiles.",WDX Studies on Ceramic Diffusion Barrier Layers of Metal Supported SOECs,10.1002/fuce.200800118
6,12960,The results of this work show considerable concentration gradients in the metal grains caused by mass exchange during cell operation.,WDX Studies on Ceramic Diffusion Barrier Layers of Metal Supported SOECs,10.1002/fuce.200800118
7,12960,"Diffusion can be inhibited significantly by integrating different ceramic DBLs of doped LaCrO3-type or doped LaMnO3-type perovskite, either by vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) or physical vapour deposition technique (PVD).",WDX Studies on Ceramic Diffusion Barrier Layers of Metal Supported SOECs,10.1002/fuce.200800118
