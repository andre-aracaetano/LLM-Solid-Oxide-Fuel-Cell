1,5606,Thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) behavior of a newly developed ferritic stainless steel (Crofer 22 H) for planar solid oxide fuel cell (pSOFC) interconnect is investigated.,Thermo-mechanical fatigue properties of a ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.038
2,5606,TMF tests under various combinations of cyclic mechanical and thermal loadings are conducted in air at a temperature range of 25 degrees C-800 degrees C. Experimental results show the number of cycles to failure for non-hold-time TMF loading is decreased with an increase in the minimum stress applied at 800 degrees C.,Thermo-mechanical fatigue properties of a ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.038
