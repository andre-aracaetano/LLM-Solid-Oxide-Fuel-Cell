1,13955,Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (SLT-GDC) composite anodes were synthesized by solid state reaction and the effect of percolation on electro-catalytic activity and redox stability was investigated.,Electrochemical performance and redox stability of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
2,13955,"The percolation threshold of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3 and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta in the composite calculated based on the Kusy's percolation theory is 10.7 vol.% and 17.4 vol.%, respectively.",Electrochemical performance and redox stability of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
3,13955,The area specific resistance (ASR) of the SLT-GDC composite anode at 800 degrees C in H-2 decreased up to 15 vol.% GDC in a SLT matrix because GDC has a much higher electro-catalytic activity than SLT.,Electrochemical performance and redox stability of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
4,13955,"However, the samples which showed GDC percolation, including samples with 20 and 33 vol.% GDC in a SLT matrix, showed very high ASR values.",Electrochemical performance and redox stability of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
5,13955,The lowest ASR value was obtained for the anode with 15 vol.% GDC in a SLT matrix because this anode showed a mixed percolation region and had good connectivity to both electronic and ionic compounds.,Electrochemical performance and redox stability of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
6,13955,"Moreover, the anode with the 15 vol.% GDC in a SLT matrix has very stable activity with a deviation of only 0.5% in ASR during repeated redox cycling.",Electrochemical performance and redox stability of Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
