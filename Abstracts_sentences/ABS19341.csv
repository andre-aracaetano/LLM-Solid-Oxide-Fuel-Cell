1,19341,The present paper focuses on the redox properties of perovskite-related oxides and presents a solution model that connects integral thermodynamic properties that are measured calorimetrically with partial thermodynamic quantities that are measured by equilibration methods.,Redox energetics of perovskite-related oxides,10.1039/b106422n
2,19341,The model allows us to extract significant features of the redox energetics of non-stoichiometric oxides.,Redox energetics of perovskite-related oxides,10.1039/b106422n
3,19341,"It is shown that the redox behavior, e. g. the composition-partial-pressure isotherms, is independent of the stability of the non-stoichiometric oxides and as a first approximation is directly given by the relative stability of the oxidation states involved.",Redox energetics of perovskite-related oxides,10.1039/b106422n
4,19341,"The stability of a given oxidation state is related to the structure of the oxide, and the large difference in redox behavior between hexagonal and cubic SrMnO3-delta is rationalized.",Redox energetics of perovskite-related oxides,10.1039/b106422n
5,19341,"Whereas both the enthalpy and entropy of oxidation in general depend on temperature, a number of systems can be adequately described using an ideal solution approach.",Redox energetics of perovskite-related oxides,10.1039/b106422n
6,19341,This implies that composition-independent enthalpic and entropic terms can be used as first approximations to describe the redox energetics of non-stoichiometric oxides.,Redox energetics of perovskite-related oxides,10.1039/b106422n
7,19341,"In order to illustrate the approach an overview of the redox energetics of selected La(1-x)Ae(x)MO(3-delta) phases (Ae alkaline earth, M transition metal) of interest in connection with solid oxide fuel cell and gas separation membrane applications is given.",Redox energetics of perovskite-related oxides,10.1039/b106422n
