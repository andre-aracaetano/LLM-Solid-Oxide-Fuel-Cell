2,16125,"Via a synthetic method based on thermal decomposition of metal complexes with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as the complexant, phase-pure SMMO was readily obtained.",Synthesis and characterization of Sr2MgMoO6-δ -: An anode material for the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.2195882
3,16125,"Oxygen vacancies are introduced by reduction with 5% H-2 at 800 degrees C. With a 300 mu m thick La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 disk as the electrolyte and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta as the cathode, the SMMO anode showed power densities of 0.84 W/cm(2) in H-2 and 0.44 W/cm(2) in CH4 at 800 degrees C. Moreover, it performed stably on power cycling and tolerated sulfur and moisture well.",Synthesis and characterization of Sr2MgMoO6-δ -: An anode material for the solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.2195882
