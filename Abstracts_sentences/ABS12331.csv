4,12331,The influence of thermal annealing on structural properties of films was studied.,Nanostructured YSZ thin films for solid oxide fuel cells deposited by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.088
5,12331,"The activation energy measured for electrical conduction through the grains (1.14 eV) was similar to that obtained in bulk of YSZ, but for conduction through the grain boundaries it acquires a value of 0.79 eV, increasing the total conductivity of the material up to 0.033 S/cm at 650 degrees C. These activation energy values are related to the small grain size and the close boundaries obtained at the optimized conditions.",Nanostructured YSZ thin films for solid oxide fuel cells deposited by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis,10.1016/j.ssi.2008.01.088
