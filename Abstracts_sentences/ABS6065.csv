2,6065,A total of six candidate metal-organic precursors for zirconia and three for yttria were investigated.,YSZ layers by pulsed-MOCVD on solid oxide fuel cell electrodes,10.1016/S0257-8972(02)00908-8
3,6065,Three precursor solutions for YSZ were identified as desirable for pulsed-MOCVD processing.,YSZ layers by pulsed-MOCVD on solid oxide fuel cell electrodes,10.1016/S0257-8972(02)00908-8
4,6065,"Under optimal deposition conditions, precursor conversion efficiency of 90% was achieved at film growth rates of 6-7.5 mum h(-1) at deposition temperature of 525 degreesC. Film growth rates were detemrined from in situ color shift method, and by scanning electron microscope examination of the deposited layer.",YSZ layers by pulsed-MOCVD on solid oxide fuel cell electrodes,10.1016/S0257-8972(02)00908-8
