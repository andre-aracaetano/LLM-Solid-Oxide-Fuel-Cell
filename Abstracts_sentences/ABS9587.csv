1,9587,In this paper a dynamic model of a single solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is developed using a volume element methodology.,Single solid oxide fuel cell modeling and optimization,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.113
2,9587,"It consists of a set of algebraic and ordinary differential equations derived from physical laws (e.g., the first law of thermodynamics, Fick's law, and Fourier's law), which allow for the prediction of the temperature and pressure spatial distribution inside the single SOFC, as functions of geometric and operating parameters.",Single solid oxide fuel cell modeling and optimization,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.113
3,9587,"The thermodynamic model is coupled with an electrochemical model that is capable of determining the voltage, current, and power output.",Single solid oxide fuel cell modeling and optimization,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.113
4,9587,"Based on the simulation results, the internal configuration (structure of the positive electrode-electrolyte-negative electrode assembly) and the operating conditions (air stoichiometric ratio and fuel utilization factor), as well as their impact on the performance of the single SOFC are discussed.",Single solid oxide fuel cell modeling and optimization,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.113
5,9587,Optimal geometric and operating parameters are obtained so that electrical power of the single SOFC at the nominal operating point is maximized.,Single solid oxide fuel cell modeling and optimization,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.113
6,9587,"The method used is general and the fundamental optimization results are sharp, showing up to a 357% single SOFC performance variation within the studied parameters' range, therefore these findings show the potential to use the model as a tool for future SOFC design, simulation and optimization.",Single solid oxide fuel cell modeling and optimization,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.113
