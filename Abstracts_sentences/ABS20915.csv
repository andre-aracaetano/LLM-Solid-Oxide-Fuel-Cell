1,20915,"The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of sintered BSCF ceramics (Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1 - xO3 - delta, 0 <= x <= 0.8) were simultaneously measured as a function of pO(2) (10(-5) <= pO(2) <= 1 atm) at 500 degrees C, 700 degrees C and 900 degrees C. All samples exhibited a positive Seebeck coefficient over the range of pO(2) and temperature examined, which indicates the predominance of p-type conduction.","Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of BSCF (Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3-δ, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) as a function of temperature and partial oxygen pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.023
2,20915,"In all cases, conductivity increased with increasing PO2, ranging from a minimum of similar to 0.6 S/cm (x = 0, pO(2)= 10(-5) atm, T = 900 degrees C) to a maximum of similar to 36 S/cm (x = 0.8, pO(2) = 1 atm, and T = 900 degrees C).","Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of BSCF (Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3-δ, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) as a function of temperature and partial oxygen pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.023
3,20915,"At low temperatures and high pO(2), conductivity was approximately proportional to pO(2)(1/4), which was attributed to the reduction of B-site cations from their tetravalent to trivalent state.","Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of BSCF (Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3-δ, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) as a function of temperature and partial oxygen pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.023
4,20915,"At low pO(2) and high temperature, the conductivity exhibited positive deviations from the pO(2)(1/4) dependence.","Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of BSCF (Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3-δ, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) as a function of temperature and partial oxygen pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.023
5,20915,"At 500 degrees C and x <= 0.6, the Seebeck coefficient (Q) decreased linearly with increasing log pO(2).","Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of BSCF (Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3-δ, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) as a function of temperature and partial oxygen pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.023
6,20915,"At 700 and 900 degrees C, Q vs. log pO(2) curves exhibited maxima at 10(-3)<10(-1) atm, and the maxima shifted to higher pO(2) as x increased.","Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of BSCF (Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3-δ, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) as a function of temperature and partial oxygen pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.023
7,20915,"A simple p-type polaron hopping model, assuming negligible contribution from n-type or ionic carriers, was used to extract the carrier concentration of the x = 0.8 sample from the measured thermopower data.","Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of BSCF (Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3-δ, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) as a function of temperature and partial oxygen pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.023
8,20915,"The calculated hole mobility for the x = 0.8 sample was less than 0.1 cm(2)/Vs, confirming a p-type polaron-hopping model.","Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of BSCF (Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3-δ, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) as a function of temperature and partial oxygen pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.023
9,20915,"This analysis, as well as analysis of Jonker plots, suggested that hole mobility decreased with decreasing pO(2).","Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of BSCF (Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3-δ, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) as a function of temperature and partial oxygen pressure",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.023
