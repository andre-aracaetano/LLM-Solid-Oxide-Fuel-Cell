1,14583,Nickel-cermet anode-supported inicrotubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode exhibit high power density at temperatures <= 650 degrees C. Current collecting is a major obstacle toward the integration of these single cells in a cube-shaped modules such integration would finally lead to a higher volumetric power density.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Current Collectors via Ag Infiltration for Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Intermediate Temperature Operation,10.1149/1.3184149
