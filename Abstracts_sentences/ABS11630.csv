1,11630,"One of the distinct advantages of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is their ability to directly oxidize CO in addition to H-2, which allows them to be run on syngas mixtures.",Isolating the impact of CO concentration in syngas mixtures on SOFC performance via internal reforming and direct oxidation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.107
2,11630,"However, membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) models typically neglect CO electrochemistry in the presence of H-2 and H2O, assuming that the water gas-shift reaction proceeds faster than sluggish CO electro-oxidation.",Isolating the impact of CO concentration in syngas mixtures on SOFC performance via internal reforming and direct oxidation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.107
3,11630,"In this paper, however, we demonstrate with a comprehensive 1D-MEA model that CO electro-oxidation cannot be neglected in syngas mixtures, particularly at high current densities for high CO-content syngas.",Isolating the impact of CO concentration in syngas mixtures on SOFC performance via internal reforming and direct oxidation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.107
4,11630,"We first demonstrate that incoming CO is not all shifted to form H-2 before reaching the triple-phase boundary, as previously assumed, due to the equilibrium limitation of the water gas-shift reaction at 800 degrees C.",Isolating the impact of CO concentration in syngas mixtures on SOFC performance via internal reforming and direct oxidation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.107
5,11630,"Furthermore, we confirm that direct oxidation of CO contributes non-negligible current relative to H-2 at high anode overpotentials in syngas mixtures.",Isolating the impact of CO concentration in syngas mixtures on SOFC performance via internal reforming and direct oxidation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.107
6,11630,"Together these results show that CO electro-oxidation plays an important role in SOFC performance not only via water gas-shift reforming, but also via direct oxidation even when H-2 is present.",Isolating the impact of CO concentration in syngas mixtures on SOFC performance via internal reforming and direct oxidation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.107
7,11630,This work suggests that accurate models for both surface reforming and direct electro-oxidation of CO in SOFC anodes must be included in order to capture performance when using syngas mixtures.,Isolating the impact of CO concentration in syngas mixtures on SOFC performance via internal reforming and direct oxidation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.107
