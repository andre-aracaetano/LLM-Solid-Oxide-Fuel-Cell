2,21041,The desired result of our testing was to find an effective method to reduce the quantity of sulfur in natural gas to less than 100 ppb volume (0.1 ppm volume).,Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
3,21041,An amount of 100 ppb sulfur is the maximum limit permitted for Siemens Westinghouse solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
4,21041,"The tested adsorbents include some that rely only on physical adsorption such as activated carbon, some that rely on chemisorption such as heated zinc oxide, and some that may use both processes.",Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
5,21041,The testing was performed on an engineering scale with beds larger than those used for typical laboratory tests.,Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
6,21041,All tests were done at about 3.45 barg (50 psig).,Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
7,21041,The natural gas used for testing was from the local pipeline in Pittsburgh and averaged 6 ppm volume total sulfur.,Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
8,21041,"The primary sulfur species were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), isopropyl mercaptan, tertiary butyl mercaptan, and tetrahydrothiophene.",Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
9,21041,Some tests required several months to achieve a sulfur breakthrough of the bed.,Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
10,21041,"It was found that DMS always came through a desulfurizer bed first, independent of adsorption process.",Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
11,21041,"Since the breakthrough of DMS always exceeds the 100 ppb SOFC sulfur limit before other sulfurs were detected, an index was created to rate the adsorbents in units of ppm DMS x absorbent bed volume.",Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
12,21041,This index is useful for calculating the expected adsorbent bed lifetime before sulfur breakthrough when the inlet natural gas DMS content is known.,Results of testing various natural gas desulfurization adsorbents,10.1361/10599490419199
