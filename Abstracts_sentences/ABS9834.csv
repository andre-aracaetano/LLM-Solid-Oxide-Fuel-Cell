3,9834,The objective of this work was to develop nickel/yttria stabilised zirconia (Ni/YSZ) anodes with high porosity and homogeneous phase distribution by atmospheric plasma spraying for MSCs.,Development of plasma sprayed Ni/YSZ anodes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2016.09.014
4,9834,"Various feedstock material approaches were explored in this study, both with single injection as well as separate injection of different feedstock materials, and with and without the use of pore formers to create additional porosity.",Development of plasma sprayed Ni/YSZ anodes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2016.09.014
5,9834,The advantages and issues with each material route were investigated and discussed.,Development of plasma sprayed Ni/YSZ anodes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2016.09.014
6,9834,It was shown that agglomerated Ni/YSZ/polyester feedstock material resulted in the best distribution of Ni and YSZ in the anode microstructure with homogeneous porosity.,Development of plasma sprayed Ni/YSZ anodes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2016.09.014
7,9834,"Subsequently, the Ni/YSZ/polyester material route with different amounts and size distributions of polyester was chosen to develop anode symmetrical cells using a commercial zirconia sheet as support for electrochemical testing.",Development of plasma sprayed Ni/YSZ anodes for metal supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2016.09.014
