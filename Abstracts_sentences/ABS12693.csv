1,12693,"A new glass-ceramic composition containing Si, Mg, Ca, Na, Al, Zr, and B is presented here as sealant for planar SOFCs/SOECs, with the aim of joining the metallic interconnect (Crofer22APU) to the solid oxide cell (YSZ electrolyte or CGO barrier layer).",A Ba-free sealing glass with a high coefficient of thermal expansion and excellent interface stability optimized for SOFC/SOEC stack applications,10.1111/ijac.12853
2,12693,"Characteristic temperature, thermo-mechanical properties, and compositional variations are reviewed and discussed by thermal analyses and insitu XRD, in order to design and optimize the sealing profile and reduce the residual porosity.",A Ba-free sealing glass with a high coefficient of thermal expansion and excellent interface stability optimized for SOFC/SOEC stack applications,10.1111/ijac.12853
3,12693,The glass after heat treatment partially devitrifies into augite and nepheline with residual glass phase of around 64.3%; after crystallization the glass-ceramic sealant has a coefficient of thermal expansion of 12.8x10(-6)K(-1) and it is compliant with the other materials typically used for stack components.,A Ba-free sealing glass with a high coefficient of thermal expansion and excellent interface stability optimized for SOFC/SOEC stack applications,10.1111/ijac.12853
4,12693,"This work shows that the developed glass-ceramic can successfully join the ceramic cell with the Crofer22APU (preoxidized and alumina coating), proven by tests on small and large-scale samples.",A Ba-free sealing glass with a high coefficient of thermal expansion and excellent interface stability optimized for SOFC/SOEC stack applications,10.1111/ijac.12853
5,12693,No signs of unwanted reactions at the glass-metal and the glass-cell interface are observed and sufficient gas tightness is achieved.,A Ba-free sealing glass with a high coefficient of thermal expansion and excellent interface stability optimized for SOFC/SOEC stack applications,10.1111/ijac.12853
