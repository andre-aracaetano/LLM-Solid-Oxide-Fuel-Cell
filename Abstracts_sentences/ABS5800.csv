1,5800,The oxygen exchange kinetics of thin films of the oxygen-deficient double perovskite PrBaCo2O5+delta (PBCO) have been determined by electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) and by oxygen-isotope exchange and depth profiling (IEDP).,Oxygen exchange kinetics of epitaxial PrBaCo2O5+δ thin films -: art. no. 024103,10.1063/1.2163257
2,5800,"Microstructural studies indicate that the PBCO films, prepared by pulsed laser deposition, have excellent single-crystal quality and epitaxial nature.",Oxygen exchange kinetics of epitaxial PrBaCo2O5+δ thin films -: art. no. 024103,10.1063/1.2163257
3,5800,"The ECR and IEDP measurements reveal that the PBCO films have high electronic conductivity and rapid surface exchange kinetics, although the ECR data indicate the presence of two distinct kinetic pathways.",Oxygen exchange kinetics of epitaxial PrBaCo2O5+δ thin films -: art. no. 024103,10.1063/1.2163257
4,5800,The rapid surface kinetics compared with those of other perovskites suggest the application of PBCO as a cathode material in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Oxygen exchange kinetics of epitaxial PrBaCo2O5+δ thin films -: art. no. 024103,10.1063/1.2163257
