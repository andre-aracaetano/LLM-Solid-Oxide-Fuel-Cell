5,4452,"By increasing inlet fuel flow rate, the temperature gradient and power density improve, but less electrical efficiency with higher carbon deposition is predicted.",Alternative Concept for SOFC with Direct Internal Reforming Operation: Benefits from Inserting Catalyst Rod,10.1002/aic.12091
6,4452,The feed with low inlet steam/carbon ratio enhances good system performances but also results in high potential for carbon formation; this gains great benefit of DIR-SOFC with inserted catalyst because the rate of carbon deposition is remarkably low.,Alternative Concept for SOFC with Direct Internal Reforming Operation: Benefits from Inserting Catalyst Rod,10.1002/aic.12091
