3,8357,"At intermediate nodes, instead of solving the relaxed NLP subproblem, the BBEx algorithm calculates the residual exergy, which is a valid lower bound to an energetic objective function.",Combined Branch and Bound Method and Exergy Analysis for Energy System Design,10.1021/ie301232t
4,8357,This approach provides a lower bound at lower computational cost than the traditional branch and bound (BB) method and satisfies the constraint of system wide thermal autonomy.,Combined Branch and Bound Method and Exergy Analysis for Energy System Design,10.1021/ie301232t
5,8357,The numerical performance of the proposed method is compared with the classical BB and the total enumeration on a design problem of a wood based fuel cell power plant The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is a promising and efficient method for solving process synthesis problems in energy system design.,Combined Branch and Bound Method and Exergy Analysis for Energy System Design,10.1021/ie301232t
