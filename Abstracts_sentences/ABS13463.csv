1,13463,High-power density and high durability are the main targets for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) development at Forschungszentrum Julich.,Materials development for advanced planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02156.x
2,13463,"Power density has been further increased by variation of the material composition of perovskite-based cathodes (Sr content, Co content, substoichiometry) and by optimization of the diffusion barrier (Gd-substituted ceria) between an electrolyte and a cathode.",Materials development for advanced planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02156.x
3,13463,The application of dense diffusion barrier layers significantly improved the performance.,Materials development for advanced planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02156.x
4,13463,"The associated avoidance of SrZrO3 formation, however, contributed only to a small extent to the improvement of durability of SOFCs with LSCF cathodes.",Materials development for advanced planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02156.x
5,13463,The redox stability of anode-supported SOFCs has been addressed in two ways: (a) conventional Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia anode substrates have been investigated to explore the limits of re-oxidation and to determine the degree of oxidation at which no damages occur.,Materials development for advanced planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02156.x
6,13463,"(b) Alternative anodes and anode substrates are under development, which basically consist of mixed-conducting ceramics.",Materials development for advanced planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02156.x
7,13463,"Avoiding the high amount of nickel decreases the probability of failure, but does not automatically lead to redox-stable anodes.",Materials development for advanced planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02156.x
8,13463,The differences in the materials' properties of such ceramics in oxidizing and reducing environment are addressed.,Materials development for advanced planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02156.x
