1,17673,We have developed high-performance oxygen electrodes for reversible solid oxide cells.,Further improvement in performances of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ - doped ceria composite oxygen electrodes with infiltrated doped ceria nanoparticles for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.066
2,17673,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) center dot (CeO2)(0.8)(SmO1.5)(0.2) (SDC) composite scaffolds were infiltrated with SDC nanoparticles.,Further improvement in performances of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ - doped ceria composite oxygen electrodes with infiltrated doped ceria nanoparticles for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.066
3,17673,"The electrode with 30 vol% load of SDC nanoparticles exhibited very low overpotentials, eta <= 0.010 V for anodic and vertical bar eta vertical bar <= 0.030 V for cathodic reactions at 0.7 A cm(-2) and 800 degrees C, which was ascribed to a noticeable increase in the exchange current densities.",Further improvement in performances of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ - doped ceria composite oxygen electrodes with infiltrated doped ceria nanoparticles for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.066
4,17673,The electrodes have shown very stable performance under anodic oxygen evolution operation at -0.5 A cm(-2) and 750 degrees C for 400 h. Such electrodes developed are extremely promising oxygen electrodes for R-SOC ever reported.,Further improvement in performances of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ - doped ceria composite oxygen electrodes with infiltrated doped ceria nanoparticles for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.066
