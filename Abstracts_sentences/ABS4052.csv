1,4052,Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes of solid oxide fuel cells are fabricated by a wet infiltration technique and the ability of the infiltration technique to control the anode microstructure is quantitatively demonstrated by a detailed three-dimensional microstructural analysis.,Improved controllability of wet infiltration technique for fabrication of solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2017.06.054
2,4052,"The microstructural analysis reveals favorable aspects of the infiltrated anodes, such as larger triple-phase boundary density and sufficiently large pore size, and they are mostly unachievable by the conventional powder-mixing and sintering approaches.",Improved controllability of wet infiltration technique for fabrication of solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2017.06.054
3,4052,The improved controllability of the infiltration technique is expected to be useful to tailor porous microstructures to meet the multiple requirements for transport and electrochemical reactions within the anodes.,Improved controllability of wet infiltration technique for fabrication of solid oxide fuel cell anodes,10.1016/j.scriptamat.2017.06.054
