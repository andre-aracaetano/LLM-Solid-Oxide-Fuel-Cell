1,14256,High proton conductivity and good chemical stability are keys to development of new electrolytes for PC-SOFCs as the next-future energy generation systems.,"Blocking effect in promising proton conductors based on Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82-xRxO9-δ (R = Y3+, Gd3+, Sm3+, Nd3+) ordered perovskites for PC-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.121
2,14256,"However, the extensive use of new polycrystalline materials as solid electrolytes is still avoided, since the grain boundary response usually leads to a decrease in total conductivity due to electrical blocking effect.","Blocking effect in promising proton conductors based on Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82-xRxO9-δ (R = Y3+, Gd3+, Sm3+, Nd3+) ordered perovskites for PC-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.121
3,14256,"Here, we present our results on the space-charge modeling of impedance spectroscopy data obtained for Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82-xRxO9-delta proton conducting ceramics, where x = 0, 0.30 and R = Y3+, Gd3+, Sm3+, Nd3+ are doping agents.","Blocking effect in promising proton conductors based on Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82-xRxO9-δ (R = Y3+, Gd3+, Sm3+, Nd3+) ordered perovskites for PC-SOFCs",10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.121
