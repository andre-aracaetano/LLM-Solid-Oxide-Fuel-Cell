12,18966,"In this paper, energy performance and optimal PV capacity are assessed for a ZNE home in all 16 climate zones of California established by California Energy Commission (CEC).","Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
13,18966,"The ZNE measurements for all four scenarios are based on three metrics of energy evaluation: (1) site energy (energy measured by the meter used at the building site); (2) source energy (raw fuel consumption at the source of energy generation to account for energy loss in production and distribution); and (3) time dependent valuation (TDV) of energy, which has been developed by the CEC to comply with its building energy efficiency standards.","Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
14,18966,"The TDV of each energy type depends on the time of use, climate, grid constraints, and other factors that reflect its societal value at any given hour of the year.","Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
15,18966,The PV size required by each ZNE metric is calculated and compared.,"Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
16,18966,The results proved that relying on some gas in addition to electricity improves the practicality of required PV for ZNE homes particularly in regions with high heating demands.,"Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
17,18966,"It was found that depending on the energy metric (site, source, and TDV),a different arrangement is required for the most efficient ZNE performance.","Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
18,18966,"Unlike the site metric, using source and TDV metrics where electricity is more valuable than gas shows that having both gas and electricity significantly reduces the PV size.","Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
19,18966,This encourages investment in introduction of more renewable gas in the grid as one possible solution to achieving ZNE in individual homes.,"Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
20,18966,"The great impact of an mCHP SOFC on a ZNE home in terms of reliability and feasibility points to the need for research, development, and commercialization to reduce the cost of mCHP SOFCs in residential application.","Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
21,18966,"Also, the addition of a battery does not reduce the PV size with site and source metrics; it only reduces the electric grid reliance.","Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
22,18966,"However, with TDV, where the time of energy consumption affects its value, not only does it reduce grid reliance during peak hours, but also less PV is required to achieve ZNE.","Integrated solid oxide fuel cell, solar PV, and battery storage system to achieve zero net energy residential nanogrid in California",10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119577
