1,11190,"In this article we review work on oxyanion (carbonate, borate, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, silicate) doping in perovskite materials beginning with early work on doping studies in superconducting cuprates, and extending to more recent work on doping into perovskite-type solid oxide fuel cell materials.",Oxyanions in perovskites: from superconductors to solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4dt03036b
2,11190,"In this doping strategy, the central atom of the oxyanion group occupies the perovskite B cation site, with the associated oxide ions filling 3 (carbonate, nitrate, borate) or 4 (phosphate, sulphate, silicate) of the available 6 anion sites around this site, albeit displaced so as to achieve the required geometry for the oxyanion.",Oxyanions in perovskites: from superconductors to solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4dt03036b
3,11190,"We highlight the potential of this doping strategy to prepare new systems, stabilize phases that cannot be prepared under ambient pressure conditions, and lead to modifications to the electronic and ionic conductivity.",Oxyanions in perovskites: from superconductors to solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4dt03036b
4,11190,"We also highlight the need for further work in this area, in particular to evaluate the carbonate content of perovskite phases in general.",Oxyanions in perovskites: from superconductors to solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4dt03036b
