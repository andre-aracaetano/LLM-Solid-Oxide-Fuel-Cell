3,8764,"The addition of EDTA to the chloride electrolyte significantly shifts the reduction reaction potential of cobalt in a more negative direction while slightly altering the discharging potential of manganese and most importantly, shortening to a great extent the discharge potential difference between Co2+ and Mn-2.",An Electrochemical Investigation of the EDTA Influence on the Cobalt-Manganese Electrodeposition in Aqueous Chloride Electrolytes,10.20964/2017.09.51
4,8764,"Also, it is crucial to control the [Co-2]/[EDTA] ratio to form completely complexed cobalt ions and a very small amount of complexed manganese ions, and thus to promote the deposition of the Co-Mn alloy.",An Electrochemical Investigation of the EDTA Influence on the Cobalt-Manganese Electrodeposition in Aqueous Chloride Electrolytes,10.20964/2017.09.51
