1,18922,"The interaction of oxygen in the gas phase with double perovskites LnBaCo(2)O(6 - delta) (Ln = Pr, Sm, Gd) was studied by the isotope exchange method with gas phase equilibration in the temperature range of 600-850 degrees C and the oxygen pressure range of 1.3 .10(-3)-6.6.10(-2) atm.","Oxygen isotope exchange and diffusion in LnBaCo2O6-δ (Ln = Pr, Sm, Gd) with double perovskite structure",10.1016/j.ssi.2017.03.022
2,18922,The oxygen nonstoichiometry of the oxides was determined by means of the thermogravimetric analysis as a function of oxygen partial pressure and temperature in the ranges -3 <= log(Po-2/atm),"Oxygen isotope exchange and diffusion in LnBaCo2O6-δ (Ln = Pr, Sm, Gd) with double perovskite structure",10.1016/j.ssi.2017.03.022

4,18922,The influence of the oxygen nonstoichiometry on the heterogeneous exchange rate and the oxygen tracer diffusion coefficient was discussed.,"Oxygen isotope exchange and diffusion in LnBaCo2O6-δ (Ln = Pr, Sm, Gd) with double perovskite structure",10.1016/j.ssi.2017.03.022
5,18922,The rate-determining stage of the oxygen surface exchange kinetics for PrBaCo2O6 (-) (delta) was found to be different in comparison with SmBaCo2O6 (-) (delta) and GdBaCo2O6 (-) (delta).,"Oxygen isotope exchange and diffusion in LnBaCo2O6-δ (Ln = Pr, Sm, Gd) with double perovskite structure",10.1016/j.ssi.2017.03.022
