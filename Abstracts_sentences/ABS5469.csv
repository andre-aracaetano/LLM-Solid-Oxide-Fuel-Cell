3,5469,"The results show that Pd nanoparticles (20-80 nm) were uniformly distributed in the porous YSZ structure; and such nano-structured composite cathodes were highly active for the O-2 reduction reaction, with polarization resistances (R-E) of 0.11 and 0.22 Omega cm(2) at 750 and 700 degrees C and activation energy of 105 kJ mol(-1) that is significantly lower than those for the conventional perovskite-based cathodes (130-201 kJ mol(-1)).",Novel nano-structured Pd plus yttrium doped ZrO2 cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2007.10.016
