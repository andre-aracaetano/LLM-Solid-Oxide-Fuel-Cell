6,19825,"The precipitation with 1 M (NH4)(2)C2O4 agent, using ultrasonic intensity at 150 W cm(-2), provided single phase BaCeO3 with crystallite size of 18.4 nm after calcination at 900 degrees C for 4 h. The electrochemical performance of the BaCeO3 cell under steam electrolysis condition (controlled voltage from OCV to 1.5 V; 20% H2O, 40% H-2, and 40% N-2) was measured (600-800 degrees C) and the activation energy of conduction was calculated to be 0.78 eV.
