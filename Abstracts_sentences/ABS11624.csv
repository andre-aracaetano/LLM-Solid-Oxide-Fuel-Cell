1,11624,Rare information is available in the literature on the cell performance of the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using apatites known for their good electrical conductivity as electrolyte materials.,"Effects of Nb5+, Mo6+, and W6+ dopants on the germanate-based apatites as electrolyte for use in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.06.123
2,11624,"In this study, La0.5Ge5.5Nb0.5O26.5, La9.5Ge5.5Mo0.5O26.75, and La9.5Ge5.5W0.5O26.75 ceramics were prepared and characterized.","Effects of Nb5+, Mo6+, and W6+ dopants on the germanate-based apatites as electrolyte for use in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.06.123
3,11624,"The results indicated that the La9.5Ge5.5Nb0.5O26.5 and La9.5Ge5.5W0.5O26.75 ceramics reported hexagonal phase, while the La0.5Ge5.5Mo0.5O26.75 ceramic demonstrated triclinic symmetry.","Effects of Nb5+, Mo6+, and W6+ dopants on the germanate-based apatites as electrolyte for use in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.06.123
4,11624,"Among the apatities evaluated, La0.5Ge5.5Nb0.5O26.5 sintered at 1450 degrees C showed the best conduction with an electrical conductivity value of 0.045 S/cm at 800 degrees C. Button cells of Nio-sDC/La0.5Ge5.5Nb0.5O26.5/LSCF-SDC were built and revealed good structural integrity.","Effects of Nb5+, Mo6+, and W6+ dopants on the germanate-based apatites as electrolyte for use in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.06.123
5,11624,"The total ohmic resistance (R-0) and interfacial polarization resistance (R-P) of the cell read 0.428 and 0.174 Omega cm(2) and 0.871 and 1.164 Omega cm(2), respectively at 950 and 800 degrees C.","Effects of Nb5+, Mo6+, and W6+ dopants on the germanate-based apatites as electrolyte for use in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.06.123
6,11624,The maximum power densities (MPD) of the single cell at 950 and 800 degrees C were respectively 0.363 and 0.095 W cm (-2).,"Effects of Nb5+, Mo6+, and W6+ dopants on the germanate-based apatites as electrolyte for use in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.06.123
7,11624,"Without optimizing the anode and cathode as well as hermetic sealing of the cell against the gas, the study found the performance of the single cell with the pure La9.5Ge5.5Nb0.5O26.5 as its electrolyte material superior to those of the SOFC cells with a YSZ electrolyte of comparable thickness shown in the literature.","Effects of Nb5+, Mo6+, and W6+ dopants on the germanate-based apatites as electrolyte for use in solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.06.123
