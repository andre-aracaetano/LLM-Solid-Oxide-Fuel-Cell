1,18697,"La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 (LSCM) has been applied as hydrogen electrode (cathode) material in solid oxide electrolysis cells operating with different steam concentrations (20, 40, 60 and 80 vol.% absolute humidity (AH)) using 40 sccm H-2 carrier gas at 800, 850 and 900 degrees C, respectively.",La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 as hydrogen electrode for solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.12.085
2,18697,Impedance spectra and voltage-current curves were measured as a function of cell electrolysis current density and steam concentration to characterize the cell performance.,La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 as hydrogen electrode for solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.12.085
3,18697,The cell resistance decreased with the increase in electrolysis current density while increased with the increase in steam concentration under the same electrolysis current density.,La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 as hydrogen electrode for solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.12.085
4,18697,"At 1.6 V applied electrolysis voltage, the maximum consumed current density increased from 431 mA cm(-2) for 20 vol.% AH to 593 mA cm(-2) for 80 vol.% AH at 850 degrees C. Polarization and impedance spectra experiments revealed that LSCM-YSZ hydrogen electrode played a major role in the electrolysis reaction.",La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 as hydrogen electrode for solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.12.085
