1,16186,"Electro-catalytic nanoparticles can be produced in oxide anodes for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) by an-ex-solution method, i.e., by incorporating metals into a perovskite oxide phase in air followed by the reduction of the perovskite oxide.",Ex-solution of Ni nanoparticles in a La0.2Sr0.8Ti1-xNixO3-δ alternative anode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.10.016
2,16186,"In this study, we used a Ni ex-solution method with a La and Ni co-doped SrTiO3 (La0.2Sr0.8Ti1 - xNixO3 - delta, x = 0-02) anode for SOFC The parameters and mechanisms of the Ni ex-solution were investigated by varying the ex-solution temperature (800-1300 degrees C) and time (3-24 h).",Ex-solution of Ni nanoparticles in a La0.2Sr0.8Ti1-xNixO3-δ alternative anode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.10.016
3,16186,The degrees of Ni ex-solution and Ti reduction were dependent on time and temperature.,Ex-solution of Ni nanoparticles in a La0.2Sr0.8Ti1-xNixO3-δ alternative anode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.10.016
4,16186,Ni ex-solution reaction was relatively faster than Ti reduction which required a higher temperature or a longer time.,Ex-solution of Ni nanoparticles in a La0.2Sr0.8Ti1-xNixO3-δ alternative anode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.10.016
5,16186,XRD analysis was used to observe the changes in the lattice parameter of La0.2Sr0.8Ti1 - xNixO3 - delta after the ex-solution process.,Ex-solution of Ni nanoparticles in a La0.2Sr0.8Ti1-xNixO3-δ alternative anode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.10.016
6,16186,"The electrochemical performance of an electrolyte (Sc-stabilized zirconia)-supported cell with the La0.2Sr0.8Ti1 - xNixO3 - delta anode with x = 0.1 showed that the total cell resistance is high, due mostly to the anode resistance.",Ex-solution of Ni nanoparticles in a La0.2Sr0.8Ti1-xNixO3-δ alternative anode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.10.016
7,16186,"The maximum power density at 800 degrees C is also relatively low, similar to 150 mW/cm(2), due to the thick (similar to 300 mu m) electrolyte and the low level of anodic performance.",Ex-solution of Ni nanoparticles in a La0.2Sr0.8Ti1-xNixO3-δ alternative anode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2013.10.016
