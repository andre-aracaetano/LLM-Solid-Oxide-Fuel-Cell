1,20128,"While Cr poisoning of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at SOFC cathodes is widely agreed to involve deactivation of oxygen exchange sites, the degradation mechanism remains ambiguous.",The Influence of Cr-Additives on the Polarization Resistance of Praseodymium-Doped Ceria Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac67b2
2,20128,"Here, we selected an alternative cathode material Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-delta, free of Sr segregation, to systematically investigate the effect of Cr-induced degradation in ORR.",The Influence of Cr-Additives on the Polarization Resistance of Praseodymium-Doped Ceria Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac67b2
3,20128,"We expand on our previous studies in which the acidity/basicity of binary additives was found to be a strong indicator of the rate of oxygen surface exchange, by electrochemically investigating the ORR activity of the PCO cathode by impedance spectroscopy.",The Influence of Cr-Additives on the Polarization Resistance of Praseodymium-Doped Ceria Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac67b2
4,20128,"Serial infiltration with acidic Cr-based oxides was found to degrade ORR activity as reflected in a 20-fold increase in area specific resistance (ASR) without corresponding changes in activation energy, with the opposite trend obtained with Ca-based oxides.",The Influence of Cr-Additives on the Polarization Resistance of Praseodymium-Doped Ceria Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac67b2
5,20128,"Detected changes in total capacitance, attributed to changes in surface capacitance, also suggest depressed/enhanced PCO surface redox behavior with Cr/Ca-based infiltrants.",The Influence of Cr-Additives on the Polarization Resistance of Praseodymium-Doped Ceria Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac67b2
6,20128,"Taken together, these results point to a more universal source of ORR poisoning/activation, based on acidity/basicity, rather than physical blocking of active sites.",The Influence of Cr-Additives on the Polarization Resistance of Praseodymium-Doped Ceria Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac67b2
7,20128,"With this improved understanding, one can expect progress to be made in the coming years in optimizing means for protecting catalytic surfaces from degradation and/or improving their performance.",The Influence of Cr-Additives on the Polarization Resistance of Praseodymium-Doped Ceria Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ac67b2
