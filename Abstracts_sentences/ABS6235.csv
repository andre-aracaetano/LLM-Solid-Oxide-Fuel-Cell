3,6235,"The oxygen migration barrier in bulk SSM50, which is predicted by the nudged elastic band (NEB) method, is the lowest, while the adsorption energy of O-2 molecular on SSM50 (100) surface is the lowest among the considered doping systems, indicating the potential application of SSM50 as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC).",Theoretical study on SmxSr1-xMnO3 as a potential solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.146
