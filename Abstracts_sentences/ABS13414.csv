5,13414,"The kinetic factors for formation of new phases are considered to be as follows; the Si component in the fuel can be a trigger to form MnSiO3 which worked at the nucleation points, and the valence changes of manganese in the electrolyte proceed the decomposition cycles consisting of two phase separation in the zirconia, pulverization of manganese-rich phase and detachment of zirconia-based oxides.","Stability of Sc2O3 and CeO2 co-doped ZrO2 electrolyte during the operation of solid oxide fuel cells: Part II the influences of Mn, Al and Si",10.1016/j.ssi.2011.09.024
