4,15159,"The cathode materials were applied to the as-sprayed half-cells fly screen-printing and heat-treated at 800 C for 2 h. The cell components and performance were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, leakage test, ac impedance and electrochemical polarization at temperatures between 500 and 700 C. The half-inch button cells exhibit a maximum power density in excess of 0.50 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C and 0.92 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C operated with humidified hydrogen fuel, respectively.",High performance metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by thermal spray,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.067
