7,3146,"Two pastes, one made from a fine yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) and the other from a combination of a fine YSZ, a coarser nickel oxide and activated carbon, have been characterised using the Benbow/Bridgwater model and their parameters have been unified through adjustment of their solids loading.",The unification of paste rheologies for the co-extrusion of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2008.07.038
