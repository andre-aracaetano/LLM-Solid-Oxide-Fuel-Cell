1,6127,"In this study, Ca3Co4O9+ (CCO) and La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 (LSC) have been mixed as mass fraction by 1:1, to prepare novel two-phase composites with high electrical conductivity and low thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), for potential application in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.",A New Composite Material Ca3Co4O9+δ+La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 Developed for Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201300031
2,6127,"The conductivity of the composite, Ca3Co4O9+ (50wt.%)+La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 (50wt.%) (CCO-LSC50), is improved to be three times that of single phase CCO material.",A New Composite Material Ca3Co4O9+δ+La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 Developed for Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201300031
3,6127,"And, the TEC of CCO-LSC50 has been effectively improved to be 15.3x10(-6)degrees C-1, about 20% lower than single phase LSC cathode, which ensures better chemical compatibility with adjacent electrolyte.",A New Composite Material Ca3Co4O9+δ+La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 Developed for Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201300031
4,6127,"As a result, compared with pure LSC and CCO cathodes, CCO-LSC50 composite cathode improves the electrochemical performance, a percentage of 16 and 84%, respectively, according to the impedance spectra experiments.",A New Composite Material Ca3Co4O9+δ+La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 Developed for Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201300031
5,6127,"In addition, cathodic overpotential and oxygen reduction kinetics have also been researched to reveal what is driving the results.",A New Composite Material Ca3Co4O9+δ+La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 Developed for Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201300031
6,6127,The microstructures and phases of cathodes were also compared and analyzed.,A New Composite Material Ca3Co4O9+δ+La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 Developed for Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1002/fuce.201300031
