5,16685,"They contain elements such as Rare Earths, Mn, A], and Ti as microalloying elements, designed to produce a thin surface oxide layer with specific characteristics: high mechanical strength; excellent adhesion to the metallic substrate; low growth rate (interconnect durability must be around 40,000 h); high chemical resistance (to avoid Cr depletion and electrode poisoning) and, low area specific resistance (ASR < 10(-1) Omega.cm(2)).",ASR evaluation of different kinds of coatings on a ferritic stainless steel as SOFC interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.07.096
6,16685,"However, long-term performance of commercial and even speciality ferritic stainless steels remains insufficient, and therefore surface treatments and/or coatings are required.",ASR evaluation of different kinds of coatings on a ferritic stainless steel as SOFC interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.07.096
7,16685,"These treatments have several important tasks, with the most important being to stabilize condensed-phase Cr(Ill) compounds in order to limit formation of volatile Cr (VI) compounds, which are responsible of SOFC cathode poisoning.",ASR evaluation of different kinds of coatings on a ferritic stainless steel as SOFC interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.07.096
8,16685,"This paper deals with the efficacy of two different kind of promising coatings: reactive element oxide nanolayers, produced by metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD); and, dual segment coatings (CrAlYO + CoMnO), obtained by filtered arc deposition for the CrAlYO bottom segment and filtered arc-assisted electron beam physical vapour deposition for the CoMnO top segment.",ASR evaluation of different kinds of coatings on a ferritic stainless steel as SOFC interconnects,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.07.096
