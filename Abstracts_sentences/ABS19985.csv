1,19985,Deposition processes of chromium (Cr) species for the system chromia-forming alloy metallic interconnect/Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM) electrode/3 mol,Deposition of chromium species at Sr-doped LaMnO3 electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells I.: Mechanism and kinetics,10.1149/1.1394012
2,19985,"% Y2O3-ZrO2 (TZ3Y) electrolyte have been investigated under various conditions at 900 degreesC. Deposition of Cr species preferentially occurred on the zirconia electrolyte surface under both cathodic (O-2 reduction) and anodic (O-2 oxidation) polarization, and formed deposit rings at the edge of the LSM electrode.",Deposition of chromium species at Sr-doped LaMnO3 electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells I.: Mechanism and kinetics,10.1149/1.1394012

5,19985,89 mum for 129 h. Cr was not detected on the surface of the LSM electrode or inside the electrode body under the conditions studied.,Deposition of chromium species at Sr-doped LaMnO3 electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells I.: Mechanism and kinetics,10.1149/1.1394012
6,19985,"In the absence of polarization potentials, Cr deposits were also found on the zirconia electrolyte sur face heated at 1100 degreesC but not at 900 degreesC. In all cases, energy despersive spectrometry analysis indicated that deposits mainly consisted of Cr and/or Cr-Mn, indicating the formation of Cr2O3 and (Cr,Mn)(3)O-4-type spinel phases.",Deposition of chromium species at Sr-doped LaMnO3 electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells I.: Mechanism and kinetics,10.1149/1.1394012
7,19985,The results clearly demonstrated that the deposition of Cr species at the LSM electrode/TZ3Y electrolyte is not dominated by electrochemical reduction of high valent Cr vapor species to Cr2O3 in competition with O-2 reduction.,Deposition of chromium species at Sr-doped LaMnO3 electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells I.: Mechanism and kinetics,10.1149/1.1394012
8,19985,"The driving force for the Cr deposition processes is most likely related to the Mn species, in particular the Mn2+ ions, generated under polarization potentials or at high temperatures.",Deposition of chromium species at Sr-doped LaMnO3 electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells I.: Mechanism and kinetics,10.1149/1.1394012
