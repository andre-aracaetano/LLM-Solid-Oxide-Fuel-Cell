1,13176,"In this work, a kind of thin K-type thermocouple and self-developed CAS-I sealant were used to assembly solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks and temperatures of unit cells inside a planar SOFC stack were measured.",Temperature Measurement and Distribution Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201100127
2,13176,The open circuit voltage testing of the stack and characterization of the interface between sealant and components suggested excellent sealing effect by applying the developed method.,Temperature Measurement and Distribution Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201100127
3,13176,The effect of discharging direct-current on temperature and temperature distribution inside the designed SOFC stack was investigated.,Temperature Measurement and Distribution Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201100127
4,13176,The results showed that the discharging current had a great impact and the gas flow rate had a slight impact on the temperatures of unit cells.,Temperature Measurement and Distribution Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201100127
5,13176,Temperature distribution of unit cells inside the stack was much non-uniform and there is a significant temperature difference between various components of the stack and heating environment.,Temperature Measurement and Distribution Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201100127
6,13176,"The relationship between temperatures and cell performance showed that the worse the cell performance, the higher the cell surface temperature.",Temperature Measurement and Distribution Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201100127
7,13176,"When the stack was discharged at a constant current and the temperature of cell surface was over 950 degrees C, the higher the temperature, the more drop the corresponding voltage.",Temperature Measurement and Distribution Inside Planar SOFC Stacks,10.1002/fuce.201100127
