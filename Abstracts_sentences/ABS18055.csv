1,18055,An elementary reaction-based solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) model that is coupled with cathodic elementary heterogeneous reactions and electrochemical elementary charge transfer reactions for a CO/CO2 mixture gas is developed.,Experimental characterization and modeling of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2012.10.107
2,18055,"This model is calibrated and validated using experimental data obtained in a button cell for various CO/CO2 gas mixtures at 650, 700 and 750 degrees C. To obtain further information for electrode design and optimization, cell performance improvement and product composition tuning, the effects of operating conditions on the cell performance and the detailed species concentration distribution are predicted.",Experimental characterization and modeling of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2012.10.107
