1,3256,"Strontium-doped samarium cobaltite (Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3, SSC) has attracted increasing attention as cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) due to its mixed-conduction characteristics and relatively high ionic conductivity.",Sol-gel processing of Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3 film,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.041
2,3256,"In this paper, sol-gel-derived SSC films were deposited on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates from an alkoxide solution of strontium isopropoxide, samarium isopropoxide and cobalt isopropoxide.",Sol-gel processing of Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3 film,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.041
3,3256,"The alkoxide solution was chelated with 2-ethylacetoacetate (CH3COCH2COOC2H5), and the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) addition on the crystallization behavior and microstructure evolution of SSC films was investigated.",Sol-gel processing of Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3 film,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.041
4,3256,"XRD, TGA and SEM measurements indicated that single-perovskite phase SSC films were formed when the films were heated at 700 degrees C, and PEG could significantly refine the crystalline size of the SSC film from around 100-50 nm.",Sol-gel processing of Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3 film,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.07.041
