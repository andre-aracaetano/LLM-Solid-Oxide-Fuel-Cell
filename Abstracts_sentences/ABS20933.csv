1,20933,An original iron conversion coating process has been recently developed to enhance the functional properties of ferritic stainless steels for use as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell interconnects.,Effect of additive particle size on the CuO-accelerated formation of LaFeO3 perovskite conversion coatings in molten carbonate baths,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.06.029
2,20933,The conversion process produces a dense LaFeO3 perovskite layer grown above a spinel oxide underlayer by an immersion treatment in specially-formulated molten carbonate baths at around 600 degrees C. Galvanic coupling with a coarse CuO powder added to the bath has been earlier proved to be an effective approach to significantly reduce conversion times and coating thicknesses onto a 18Cr Type IC41 ferritic stainless steel substrate.,Effect of additive particle size on the CuO-accelerated formation of LaFeO3 perovskite conversion coatings in molten carbonate baths,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.06.029
3,20933,Further investigations on the CuO acceleration effects on the K41 steel are reported in the present work focusing on the effect of CuO particle size on the conversion times and coating structure.,Effect of additive particle size on the CuO-accelerated formation of LaFeO3 perovskite conversion coatings in molten carbonate baths,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.06.029
4,20933,Studies carried out with different concentrations and particle sizes of the CuO additive have indicated that conversion coating kinetics is strongly affected by the CuO particle size highlighting thus the fact that CuO did not fully dissolve in the carbonate bath and that galvanic coupling effects took place prevalently with CuO particles dispersed in the molten bath.,Effect of additive particle size on the CuO-accelerated formation of LaFeO3 perovskite conversion coatings in molten carbonate baths,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.06.029
5,20933,Dramatic reduction in conversion times could be obtained through CuO nanoparticle additions to the bath.,Effect of additive particle size on the CuO-accelerated formation of LaFeO3 perovskite conversion coatings in molten carbonate baths,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.06.029
6,20933,"The shortest conversion time of < 3 h was achieved by adding 6 mol% nano CuO, at 610 degrees C. As consequence, perovskite coatings with thicknesses well below 10 mu m could be produced due to minimal substrate corrosion and spinel underlayer growth during the short conversion processes in the nano CuO-containing salt baths.",Effect of additive particle size on the CuO-accelerated formation of LaFeO3 perovskite conversion coatings in molten carbonate baths,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.06.029
7,20933,This structural refinement could play an important role for improving dimensional stability and functional properties of perovskite coatings in SOFC interconnect applications.,Effect of additive particle size on the CuO-accelerated formation of LaFeO3 perovskite conversion coatings in molten carbonate baths,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.06.029
