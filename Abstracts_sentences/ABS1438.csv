1,1438,Several solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems can be considered for the NH3 utilization.,Comparative Study of Ammonia-fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1002/fuce.201600165
2,1438,"In this study, the catalytic activity and long-term stability of the NH3 decomposition reactor with the Ni/Y2O3-based catalysts and the autothermal NH3 cracker with the Co-Ce-Zr composite oxide catalyst were investigated.",Comparative Study of Ammonia-fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1002/fuce.201600165
3,1438,"Moreover, the NH3 decomposition reactor and the autothermal NH3 cracker were combined with the SOFC stack and their performances of the stack were compared to those fueled with NH3 and H-2/N-2.",Comparative Study of Ammonia-fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1002/fuce.201600165
4,1438,"The power output of each SOFC stack was over 200 W. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the direct NH3-fueled SOFC stack was stable for 1,000 h at 770 degrees C without significant degradation.",Comparative Study of Ammonia-fueled Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems,10.1002/fuce.201600165
