4,14475,"The findings show that compared to the traditional un-gradient channel anode (un-GCA) cell, the GCA cell results in more uniform gas distribution and better diffusion of fuel gases, particularly H-2, CH4 and H2O. Because of the improved gas diffusion in the anode electrode, the GCA (12 mu m) cell exhibits a 2.34 % improvement in power density compared to the un-GCA cell at 800 degrees C and 0.6 V. Additionally, after increasing the mole fractions of H-2 and CH4 in the fuel gas, the power density of the GCA (12 mu m) cell is improved by 2.42 % compared with that of the un-GCA cell under the same condition.",Optimizing fuel transport and distribution in gradient channel anode of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ces.2023.119558
5,14475,"This study provides clear evidence that incorporating the gradient channel structure in the anode can effectively enhance gas transport, minimize localized gas aggregation and eventually improve the performance of SOFC.",Optimizing fuel transport and distribution in gradient channel anode of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ces.2023.119558
