1,13736,Low apparent density Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) powders of different morphology and microstructure are derived from a glycine-nitrate process using Ce(NO3)(3) and Ce(NH4)(2)(NO3)(6) as the cerium sources.,Highly active Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 powders of very low apparent density derived from mixed cerium sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.082
2,13736,"When the molar ratio of the two cerium precursors is around 1:1, the derived SDC powders can be readily sintered to high density, exhibiting the highest conductivities (similar to 0.084 and similar to 0.020 S cm(-1) at 800 and 600 degrees C, respectively) with an activation energy of similar to 0.70 eV. When the molar ratio of Ce(NO3)(3) to Ce(NH4)(2)(NO3)(6) was adjusted to 3:1, the derived SDC powders have the lowest apparent density (36.0 +/- 0.5 mg cm(-3)), best suited for preparation of dense, thin-film SDC electrolyte membranes on porous anode substrates, a critical step toward low-cost fabrication of high-performance SOFCs.",Highly active Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 powders of very low apparent density derived from mixed cerium sources,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.082
