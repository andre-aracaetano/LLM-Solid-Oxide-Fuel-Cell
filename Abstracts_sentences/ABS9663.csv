4,9663,The estimated velocity of the plume head was in the range of (0.5-1.5)x10(4) m/s depending on ambient pressures.,Preparation of doped LaGaO3 films by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/S0257-8972(03)00158-0
5,9663,The films deposited on the NiO substrate consisted of many particles and crystalline structure of LaGaO3 was obtained for post annealed films at 1000 degreesC for 6 h. A slight difference in stoichiometry between the target and the film was found by secondary ion mass spectroscopy.,Preparation of doped LaGaO3 films by pulsed laser deposition,10.1016/S0257-8972(03)00158-0
