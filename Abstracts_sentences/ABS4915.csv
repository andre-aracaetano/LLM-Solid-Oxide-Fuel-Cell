1,4915,The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has a problem in durability of the ceramics used as its cell materials because its operating temperature is very high and the cell temperature fluctuation induces thermal stress in the ceramics.,Analytical investigation on cell temperature control method of planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.enconman.2005.11.007
2,4915,"The cell temperature distribution in the SOFC, therefore, should be kept as constant as possible during variable load operation through control of the average current density in the cell.",Analytical investigation on cell temperature control method of planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.enconman.2005.11.007
3,4915,"Considering this fact, the authors numerically optimize the operating parameters of air utilization and the inlet gas temperature of the planar SOFC by minimizing the cell temperature shift from its nominal value and propose a new cell temperature control method that adopts these optimum operating parameters for each average current density.",Analytical investigation on cell temperature control method of planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.enconman.2005.11.007
4,4915,"The effectiveness of the proposed method is very high and the temperature variation is suppressed to a very low level without lowering the single cell voltage for both the co-flow and counter-flow type cells, indicating that the proposed cell temperature control method makes variable load operation of the planar SOFC possible.",Analytical investigation on cell temperature control method of planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.enconman.2005.11.007
