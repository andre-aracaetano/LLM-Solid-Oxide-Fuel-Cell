2,16738,"Herein, we report the development of a highly active bifunctional oxygen electrode by combining the spinel-type CoFe2O4 and the cubic fluorite structured Er0.4Bi1.6O3-delta (CFO-ESB) for applications in reversible SOCs at reduced temperatures.",Highly promoted electrocatalytic activity of spinel CoFe2O4 by combining with Er0.4Bi1.6O3 as a bifunctional oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta07494f
3,16738,X-ray diffraction analysis showed that CFO had a good chemical compatibility with the ESB phase.,Highly promoted electrocatalytic activity of spinel CoFe2O4 by combining with Er0.4Bi1.6O3 as a bifunctional oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta07494f
4,16738,"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and O-2-temperature-programmed desorption results revealed that the incorporation of ESB into CFO increased the number of chemisorbed oxygen species, thereby promoting their catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).",Highly promoted electrocatalytic activity of spinel CoFe2O4 by combining with Er0.4Bi1.6O3 as a bifunctional oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta07494f
5,16738,"These results were consistently confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, wherein the low polarization resistance of the CFO-ESB electrode in the YSZ electrolyte was observed (e.g., similar to 0.29 omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C).",Highly promoted electrocatalytic activity of spinel CoFe2O4 by combining with Er0.4Bi1.6O3 as a bifunctional oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta07494f
6,16738,"Consequently, the reversible SOC prepared using the CFO-ESB oxygen electrodes showed excellent performances in both the fuel cell (similar to 1.0 W cm(-2) peak power density) and electrolysis cell (similar to 1.5 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V) modes at 700 degrees C. These results are one of the best values among the spinel-based oxygen electrode adopted cells reported to date, demonstrating highly efficient ORR and OER bifunctionality of the CFO-ESB.",Highly promoted electrocatalytic activity of spinel CoFe2O4 by combining with Er0.4Bi1.6O3 as a bifunctional oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta07494f
