2,10127,Present work deals with the oxygen vacancy of this compound synthesized by using the EDTA-Citrate method.,Oxygen stoichiometry of Ba0.50Sr0.50Co0.80Fe0.20O3-δ obtained by EDTA-citrate method and measured by X-ray and neutron diffraction,10.1007/s10967-015-4310-3
3,10127,"To obtain a single-phase sample, three portions of the compound were calcined at 700, 800 and 900 A degrees C. Only the sample calcined at 900 A degrees C showed a single phase.",Oxygen stoichiometry of Ba0.50Sr0.50Co0.80Fe0.20O3-δ obtained by EDTA-citrate method and measured by X-ray and neutron diffraction,10.1007/s10967-015-4310-3
4,10127,"The stoichiometry of the single-phase sample, in particular of the oxygen atom, was determined by applying the combined X-ray and neutron Rietveld refinement to X-ray and neutron powder diffraction patterns measured with the sample.",Oxygen stoichiometry of Ba0.50Sr0.50Co0.80Fe0.20O3-δ obtained by EDTA-citrate method and measured by X-ray and neutron diffraction,10.1007/s10967-015-4310-3
