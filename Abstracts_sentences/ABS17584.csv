3,17584,Doping Pr1-ySmyNi1-xCoxO3-delta by Sm results in suppression o the fast channel of oxygen diffusion along extended defects due o Sm segregation in their vicinity For nanocomposites moderate doping by Sm enhances fast oxygen diffusion in fluorite phase domains and along perovskite-fluorite interface due to a higher disordering caused by incorporation of both Pr arid Sm cations into Y-doped ceria.,Sm-doped praseodymium nickelates-cobaltites and their nanocomposites with Y-doped ceria as promising cathode materials,10.1080/10584587.2016.1184506
