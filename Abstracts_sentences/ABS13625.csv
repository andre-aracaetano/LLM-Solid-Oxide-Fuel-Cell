1,13625,"The Ca2.9-xBi0.1PrxCo4O9-delta (CBPxC, x = 0-0.6) oxides were prepared by sol-gel method, as the potential cathode of anode-supported intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Performance evaluation of Ca2.9-xBi0.1PrxCo4O9-δ cathode for anode-supported intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.133699
2,13625,"The electrochemical performance test showed that the CBPxC oxide sintered at 700 degrees C for 10 h could form a single-phase crystal structure, and when the doping ratio of Pr ion was x = 0.4, the CBPxC cathode on the SDC electrolyte sintered at 950 degrees C for 5 h obtained the minimum interface polarization resistance (about 0.406 Omega center dot cm(2) at 800 degrees C).",Performance evaluation of Ca2.9-xBi0.1PrxCo4O9-δ cathode for anode-supported intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.133699
3,13625,"Meanwhile, on the basis of the above conditions, we had fabricated Ni0.95Cu0.05Ox-SDC/SDC/CBP0.4C single cell with the optimized CBPxC (x = 0.4) cathode, in which the SDC electrolyte thickness was 55.6 mu m.",Performance evaluation of Ca2.9-xBi0.1PrxCo4O9-δ cathode for anode-supported intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.133699
4,13625,"The maximum power densities of the single cell reached 0.705 W/cm(2) and 0.570 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C and 750 degrees C, the corresponding polarization resistances were 0.051 Omega center dot cm(2) and 0.153 Omega center dot cm(2), respectively.",Performance evaluation of Ca2.9-xBi0.1PrxCo4O9-δ cathode for anode-supported intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.133699
5,13625,This suggested that CBP0.4C was a very promising cathode material for IT-SOFCs.,Performance evaluation of Ca2.9-xBi0.1PrxCo4O9-δ cathode for anode-supported intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matlet.2022.133699
