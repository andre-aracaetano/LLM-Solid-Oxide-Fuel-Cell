2,9782,We have found that the partial replacement of Sr2+ by La3+ results in a substantial decrease in the total electrical conductivity due to a decrease in the hole charge carrier concentration.,High-temperature electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity in oxygen redox reaction of La-doped Sr2FeCo0.5Mo0.5O6-δ,10.1007/s10008-022-05284-x
3,9782,Detailed analysis of the high- and low-frequency parts of the impedance spectra at pO(2) = 0.1-1 atm and 873-1173 K has revealed different rate-limiting steps in the oxygen redox reaction for SFCM and LSFCM resulted from different oxygen vacancy concentrations in these materials.,High-temperature electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity in oxygen redox reaction of La-doped Sr2FeCo0.5Mo0.5O6-δ,10.1007/s10008-022-05284-x
