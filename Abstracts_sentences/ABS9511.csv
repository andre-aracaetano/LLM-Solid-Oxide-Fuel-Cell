2,9511,The presence of CO2 in O-2 flow reduces the LSC and LSM cell performance and increases polarization resistance.,A comparison on effects of CO2 on La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+δ and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.09.023
3,9511,"CO2 impedes oxygen dissociative adsorption on the LSC cathode, whereas CO2 inhibits dissociation of adsorbed oxygen molecule or diffusion of O-species on the LSM cathode.",A comparison on effects of CO2 on La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+δ and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.09.023
4,9511,CO2 adsorption on the LSC cathode obeys Temkin model in 550-650 degrees C and Freundlich model in 700-800 degrees C. Different CO2 adsorption behaviors are ascribed to the change in LSC structure and the change in oxygen reduction mechanism.,A comparison on effects of CO2 on La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+δ and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.09.023

6,9511,The differences in the effects and affecting mechanisms of CO2 on LSM and LSC are related to their differences in composition and structure.,A comparison on effects of CO2 on La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+δ and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.09.023
