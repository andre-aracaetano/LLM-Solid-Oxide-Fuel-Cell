1,6830,"In order to enhance the electrochemical performance of cobalt-free Bi0.7Sr0.3FeO3-delta (BSFO) cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), a composite cathode consisting of BSFO and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) is developed.",Experimental study and first-principles calculation of enhanced electrochemical properties of Bi0.7Sr0.3FeO3-δ (BSFO) - La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ (LSM) composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233898
2,6830,"The optimized polarization resistance of the composite cathode (0.11 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C) is found to be only 61 % that of pure BSFO (0.18 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C), indicating a significant improvement in performance.",Experimental study and first-principles calculation of enhanced electrochemical properties of Bi0.7Sr0.3FeO3-δ (BSFO) - La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ (LSM) composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233898
3,6830,"The first-principles calculation indicates that the enhanced electrochemical performance is mainly due to the domain of low oxygen vacancy formation energies of BSFO-LSM-L interfaces (E-vac, -3.63 eV) and LSM (E-vac, 3.11 eV).",Experimental study and first-principles calculation of enhanced electrochemical properties of Bi0.7Sr0.3FeO3-δ (BSFO) - La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ (LSM) composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233898
4,6830,The anode-supported single cell of NiO-SDC/SDC/BSFO-LSM shows a peak power density of 825.83 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C using wet H-2 (similar to 3 vol% H2O) as fuels and ambient air as oxidants.,Experimental study and first-principles calculation of enhanced electrochemical properties of Bi0.7Sr0.3FeO3-δ (BSFO) - La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ (LSM) composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233898
5,6830,"In addition, the single cell exhibits a good stability at the electric current density 400 mA cm(-2) for 50 h measured at 650 degrees C.",Experimental study and first-principles calculation of enhanced electrochemical properties of Bi0.7Sr0.3FeO3-δ (BSFO) - La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ (LSM) composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233898
