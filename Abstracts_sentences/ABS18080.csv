1,18080,"The dependence of flexural strength, fracture toughness, hardness and densification behaviour of 8YSCZ/Al2O3 composite on Al2O3 content was examined using fine-grained 8 mol% yttria-stabilized cubic zirconia (8YSCZ) doped with 0, 1, 5 and 10 wt% Al2O3.","The flexural strength, fracture toughness, hardness and densification behaviour of various amount of Al2O3-doped 8YSCZ/Al2O3 composites used as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.matdes.2004.10.011
2,18080,The densification behaviour of 8YSCZ/Al2O3 composites in the temperature range 1250-1400 degrees C was studied.,"The flexural strength, fracture toughness, hardness and densification behaviour of various amount of Al2O3-doped 8YSCZ/Al2O3 composites used as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.matdes.2004.10.011
3,18080,"It was seen that Al2O3 contents up to 1 wt% enhanced densification, but further increase in Al2O3 contents led to a decrease in densification.","The flexural strength, fracture toughness, hardness and densification behaviour of various amount of Al2O3-doped 8YSCZ/Al2O3 composites used as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.matdes.2004.10.011
