2,18515,"The simulation was conducted for various parameters such as the strain, temperature, yttria concentration, and potential parameter, and in addition, the biaxial and hydrostatic cases were considered.",Optimum strain state for oxygen diffusion in yttria-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.03.012
3,18515,"For a uniaxial strain, the oxygen diffusion was enhanced in the tensile direction whereas it was hindered in the compressive direction.",Optimum strain state for oxygen diffusion in yttria-stabilised zirconia,10.1016/j.ssi.2011.03.012
