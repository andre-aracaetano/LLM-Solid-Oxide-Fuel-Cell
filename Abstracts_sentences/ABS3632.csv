1,3632,High-temperature fuel cells are a promising technology due to their high energy efficiency and low environmental impacts compared to conventional engines.,Test and Modelling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Durability: A Focus on Interconnect Role on Global Degradation,10.3390/en15082762
2,3632,"Nevertheless, they have a limited lifetime which reduces the use to a few application fields.",Test and Modelling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Durability: A Focus on Interconnect Role on Global Degradation,10.3390/en15082762
3,3632,"Among them, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have had a recent development at the industrial level in two possible configurations: anode- and electrolyte-supported design.",Test and Modelling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Durability: A Focus on Interconnect Role on Global Degradation,10.3390/en15082762
4,3632,"Considering the impossibility to experimentally distinguish the effects of every degradation mechanism on global cell performance, each layer should be tested singularly through ex situ tests and then assembled into a virgin cell to evaluate its role on the whole system by in situ tests.",Test and Modelling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Durability: A Focus on Interconnect Role on Global Degradation,10.3390/en15082762
5,3632,"However, this procedure results as quite complex, and some further microstructural changes could occur during cell sintering.",Test and Modelling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Durability: A Focus on Interconnect Role on Global Degradation,10.3390/en15082762
6,3632,"In order to overcome these constraints, the proposed approach paired ex situ experimental observations on a single element with modelling results on global SOFC.",Test and Modelling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Durability: A Focus on Interconnect Role on Global Degradation,10.3390/en15082762
7,3632,"As a case study, CoMnO/Crofer22 APU and CuMnO/AISI 441 interconnect samples were tested, measuring their resistance variation for some hundreds of hours, followed by a detailed post-mortem microstructural analysis.",Test and Modelling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Durability: A Focus on Interconnect Role on Global Degradation,10.3390/en15082762
8,3632,"Based on a previously validated local model, SIMFC (SIMulation of Fuel Cells), the durability of commercial anode- and electrolyte-supported cells was simulated, adding specific degradation functions only for the interconnects in order to highlight their influence on SOFC performance.",Test and Modelling of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Durability: A Focus on Interconnect Role on Global Degradation,10.3390/en15082762
