1,18244,"The effect of Ca2+ and Zn2+ cations substitution on the sinterability, thermal expansion and electrical properties of La0.85Sr0.15-xCaxCr1-yZnyO3 as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) interconnect materials was investigated.",Effect of Ca2+ and Zn2+ cations substitution on the properties of La0.85Sr0.15CrO3 as SOFC interconnect,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.02.095
2,18244,The results showed that the bulk densities of La0.85Sr0.15-xCaxCrO3 increased with increasing Ca content and a maximum electrical conductivity value of 20.1 S/cm at 800 degrees C was obtained when x = 0.05.,Effect of Ca2+ and Zn2+ cations substitution on the properties of La0.85Sr0.15CrO3 as SOFC interconnect,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.02.095
3,18244,The transition metal Zn substituted in Cr-site further optimized the sinterability and increased the bulk density by 25% when Zn content was up to 0.09.,Effect of Ca2+ and Zn2+ cations substitution on the properties of La0.85Sr0.15CrO3 as SOFC interconnect,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.02.095
