2,6924,The chemical potential of the ions is modified to incorporate their finite size effect.,Interdiffusion across Electrode-Electrolyte Interface in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Incorporating the Finite Size Effect of the Ions,10.1149/2.0461814jes
3,6924,A slight difference is observed in the cation interdiffusion profiles with and without considering the finite size effect of ions.,Interdiffusion across Electrode-Electrolyte Interface in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Incorporating the Finite Size Effect of the Ions,10.1149/2.0461814jes
4,6924,"However, interestingly the consideration of the finite size effect of ions results in significant variations of the electric potential which first decreases and then increases sharply at the electrode end away from the interface.",Interdiffusion across Electrode-Electrolyte Interface in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Incorporating the Finite Size Effect of the Ions,10.1149/2.0461814jes
5,6924,These investigations are explained on the basis of the concentration gradients which turn out to be non-trivial despite relatively small changes in the concentration profiles themselves.,Interdiffusion across Electrode-Electrolyte Interface in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Incorporating the Finite Size Effect of the Ions,10.1149/2.0461814jes
6,6924,"Furthermore, the finite size effect of ions is captured in terms of an effective activity coefficient for respective ions, and this provides an estimate of non-ideality arising due to the ion size.",Interdiffusion across Electrode-Electrolyte Interface in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Incorporating the Finite Size Effect of the Ions,10.1149/2.0461814jes
7,6924,It is expected that such considerations of non-ideality may help the development of more realistic models of electrode-electrolyte interface which in turn may contribute to a better design of solid oxide fuel cells and accurate prediction of their performance.,Interdiffusion across Electrode-Electrolyte Interface in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Incorporating the Finite Size Effect of the Ions,10.1149/2.0461814jes
