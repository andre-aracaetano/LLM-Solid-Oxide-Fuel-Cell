1,7300,For the proper function of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) their structural integrity must be maintained during their whole lifetime.,Strength of an electrolyte supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.075
2,7300,"Any cell fracture would cause leakage and partial oxidization of the anode, leading to a reduced performance, if not catastrophic failure of the whole stack.",Strength of an electrolyte supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.075
3,7300,"In this study, the mechanical strength of a state of the art SOFC, developed and produced by Hexis AG/Switzerland, was investigated with respect to the influence of temperature and ageing, whilst for the anode side of the cell the strength was measured under reducing and oxidizing atmospheres.",Strength of an electrolyte supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.075
4,7300,"Ball-on-3-Ball bending strength tests and fractography conducted on anode and cathode half-cells revealed the underlying mechanisms, which lead to cell fracture.",Strength of an electrolyte supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.075
5,7300,They were found to be different for the cathode and the anode side and that they change with temperature and ageing.,Strength of an electrolyte supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.075
6,7300,"Both anode and cathode sides exhibit the lowest strength at T = 850 degrees C, which is greatly reduced to the initial strength of the bare electrolyte.",Strength of an electrolyte supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.075
7,7300,This reduction is the consequence of the formation of cracks in the electrode layer which either directly penetrate into the electrolyte (anode side) or locally increase the stress intensity level of pre-existing flaws of the electrolytes at the interface (cathode side).,Strength of an electrolyte supported solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.07.075
