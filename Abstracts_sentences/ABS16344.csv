2,16344,"In this study, yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin film, 1-2 mum thick, electrolyte has been prepared on dense and porous substrates using a combination of colloidal suspensions and polymer precursors at annealing temperatures <1000 degrees C. Use of processing temperatures <1000degreesC minimizes interfacial reactions between electrolyte and anode/cathode materials.",Low-temperature processing of thin-film electrolyte for electrochemical devices,10.1149/1.1697904
3,16344,The conductivity of the thin film annealed at 900degreesC was measured and was the same as that of bulk YSZ and the processing temperature to obtain such conductivity was as low as 400degreesC.
