3,1931,"The resulting negative Gibbs energy is favorable to reactions between gaseous phosphorus (considered to be P-2) and CH3Cl, predicting the generation of phosphorus trichloride (PCl3).",Mechanism of Phosphorus and Chlorine Passivating a Nickel Catalyst: A Density Functional Theory Study,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.222
4,1931,"However, the binding energies between P/Cl and nickel show that the PCl3 formed is not stable, so chlorine combined with P under these conditions at nickel surface is therefore expected to inhibit passivation by phosphorus.",Mechanism of Phosphorus and Chlorine Passivating a Nickel Catalyst: A Density Functional Theory Study,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.222
