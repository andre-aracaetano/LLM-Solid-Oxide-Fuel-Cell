1,913,"Porous Pt, Ni, and lanthanum strontium cobaltite (LSC) are evaluated as electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells at the low temperature range under 500 degrees C. Porous metal electrodes 150 nm thick are prepared by sputtering.","Evaluation of porous platinum, nickel, and lanthanum strontium cobaltite as electrode materials for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.08.111
2,913,Porous LSC was deposited to a typical thickness of 1.5 mu m by pulsed laser deposition as the cathode.,"Evaluation of porous platinum, nickel, and lanthanum strontium cobaltite as electrode materials for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.08.111
3,913,"In terms of fuel cell performance, we confirm that Pt is the best material for both the cathode and the anode under 400 degrees C, but LSC outperforms Pt as a cathode at temperatures over 450 degrees C in our configurations.","Evaluation of porous platinum, nickel, and lanthanum strontium cobaltite as electrode materials for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.08.111
