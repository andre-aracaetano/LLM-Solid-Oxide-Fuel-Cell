1,20363,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which operate in the medium temperature range from 300 degrees C to 500 C-degrees, are effective in shortening startup time and reducing fuel gas.",Surface oxide ion conduction of BaCe0.5Pr0.3Y0.2O3-δ thin film with complex mixed valence states,10.35848/1347-4065/ad1fae
2,20363,"In order to realize a practical electrolyte with high oxide ion conductivity, we have investigated the ionic conductivity of c-axis oriented BaCe0.5Pr0.3Y0.2O3-delta (BCPY) thin films with complex mixed valence states prepared on Al2O3 (0001) substrates by RF magnetron sputtering.",Surface oxide ion conduction of BaCe0.5Pr0.3Y0.2O3-δ thin film with complex mixed valence states,10.35848/1347-4065/ad1fae
3,20363,The amount of oxygen vacancies on the surface in the as-deposited BCPY thin film was evaluated to be similar to 6.7% by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and defect chemical analysis.,Surface oxide ion conduction of BaCe0.5Pr0.3Y0.2O3-δ thin film with complex mixed valence states,10.35848/1347-4065/ad1fae
4,20363,The as-deposited film exhibited relatively high ionic conductivity (sigma T) of more than 10(-1) S center dot K cm(-1) and activation energy (E A) of similar to 0.57 eV in the medium temperature range by thermal activation process on the surface.,Surface oxide ion conduction of BaCe0.5Pr0.3Y0.2O3-δ thin film with complex mixed valence states,10.35848/1347-4065/ad1fae
5,20363,"The energy separation between the top of the VB and the Fermi level was much larger than E (A), indicating that the BCPY thin film is a pure oxide ion conductor without the contribution of electron or hole carriers.",Surface oxide ion conduction of BaCe0.5Pr0.3Y0.2O3-δ thin film with complex mixed valence states,10.35848/1347-4065/ad1fae
6,20363,These results indicate that the c-axis oriented BCPY thin film can be applied to electrolyte of SOFC operating in the medium temperature range.,Surface oxide ion conduction of BaCe0.5Pr0.3Y0.2O3-δ thin film with complex mixed valence states,10.35848/1347-4065/ad1fae
