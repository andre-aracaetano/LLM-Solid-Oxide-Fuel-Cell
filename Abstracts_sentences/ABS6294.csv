1,6294,"Structural properties of rare earth niobates (RE3NbO7, RE=Y, Er, Yb, Lu) have been studied using selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).","Local Structure of Rare Earth Niobates (RE3NbO7, RE=Y, Er, Yb, Lu) for Proton Conduction Applications",10.1002/fuce.201200136
2,6294,SAED patterns show diffuse scattering features along the [111] direction of the pure fluorite (Fm3m) structure due to a short-range ordering of anion vacancies in the fluorite structure or the change of coordination number around some cations.,"Local Structure of Rare Earth Niobates (RE3NbO7, RE=Y, Er, Yb, Lu) for Proton Conduction Applications",10.1002/fuce.201200136
3,6294,"The latter is related to the presence of small domains of pyrochlore phase (Fd-3m), which are observed in the HRTEM images.","Local Structure of Rare Earth Niobates (RE3NbO7, RE=Y, Er, Yb, Lu) for Proton Conduction Applications",10.1002/fuce.201200136
