1,11251,"The manufacturing of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and its main components at low temperature are very important to optimise the performance of material, cell and lower the cost.",Doped Zirconia/Ceria Electrolyte Fabricated at Low Temperature,
2,11251,"The cubic full dense yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, one of the most popular electrolyte in SOFC, is obtained by three-step sintering process at 1 200-1 300 degrees C from nano powders, which needs to be dense at 1 400-1 450 degrees C by traditional sintering process.",Doped Zirconia/Ceria Electrolyte Fabricated at Low Temperature,
3,11251,"The scandia stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) and gadolinia doped ceria (GDC) electrolytes are sintered to be full dense respectively at low temperature of 900 degrees C and 800 degrees C from 3nm powders of ScSZ and by sintering additives, which, now, are widely used in SOFC process.",Doped Zirconia/Ceria Electrolyte Fabricated at Low Temperature,
