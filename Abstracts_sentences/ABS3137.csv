2,3137,The electrolyte was yttria-stabilized zirconia with a thickness ranging from 40-500 mu m. Power densities of over 400 mW/cm(2) were obtained with the Li/Co sulfide based material and gas analysis demonstrated hydrogen sulfide destruction levels in excess of 75%.,Anode materials for a hydrogen sulfide solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1392017
3,3137,"Cell performance was noted to degrade slightly over time, which can be attributed to air leaks within the experimental system or delamination of the electrodes.",Anode materials for a hydrogen sulfide solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1392017
