1,7340,Nanocomposite oxygen electrodes consisting of Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM) and Ce0.8Gd0.O-2(1.9) (GDC) are investigated for use in high-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) to achieve high performance and high durability in steam electrolysis and reversible operations.,Highly active and durable La0.4Sr0.6MnO3-δ and Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 nanocomposite electrode for high-temperature reversible solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.030
2,7340,"The nanocomposite electrode structure is realized by using spray pyrolized LSM-GDC nanocomposite particles, which are secondary particles formed by LSM and GDC crystallites.",Highly active and durable La0.4Sr0.6MnO3-δ and Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 nanocomposite electrode for high-temperature reversible solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.030
3,7340,"Two LSM-GDC nanocomposite electrodes with different LSM chemical composition, i.e., La0.4Sr0.6MnO3-delta (LS64M) and La0.4Sr0.6MnO3-delta (LS46M), are examined in steam electrolysis operation.",Highly active and durable La0.4Sr0.6MnO3-δ and Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 nanocomposite electrode for high-temperature reversible solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.030
4,7340,The SOC with LS46M-GDC nanocomposite electrode shows superior performance to that with LS64M-GDC nanocomposite electrode; its current density reaches 1.73 A cm(-2) at 800 degrees C at 1.3 V under 40% humidity condition.,Highly active and durable La0.4Sr0.6MnO3-δ and Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 nanocomposite electrode for high-temperature reversible solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.030
5,7340,"Also, LS46M-GDC nanocomposite electrode, where LSM had a Sr-rich chemical composition, stably operated in continuous electrolysis mode and in reversible fuel cell and electrolysis modes.",Highly active and durable La0.4Sr0.6MnO3-δ and Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 nanocomposite electrode for high-temperature reversible solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.030
6,7340,The superior performance and durability might be due to the high catalytic activity of LS46M and to its nanocomposite structure with an extensive electrochemical active region.,Highly active and durable La0.4Sr0.6MnO3-δ and Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 nanocomposite electrode for high-temperature reversible solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.030
