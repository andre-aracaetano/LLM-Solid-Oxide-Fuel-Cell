4,2309,Redox-stable La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Sc0.1O3-delta (LSFSc) oxides are introduced as symmetric electrode catalysts onto the internal surfaces of porous 430L substrates and YSZ backbones using the solution impregnation method.,Novel metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with impregnated symmetric La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Sc0.1O3-δ electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.12.020
5,2309,The maximum power density is 0.65 W cm(-2) measured at 800 degrees C. Impedance analyses show that the anode polarizations are the largest losses while the cathode polarizations make negligible contribution to the total cell resistances.,Novel metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells with impregnated symmetric La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Sc0.1O3-δ electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.12.020
