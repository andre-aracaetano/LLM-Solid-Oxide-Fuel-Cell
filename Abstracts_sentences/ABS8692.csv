1,8692,The paper reports a new concept of planar-tubular solid oxide fuel cell (PT-SOFC).,Development and Fabrication of a New Concept Planar-tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (PT-SOFC),10.1002/fuce.201000152
2,8692,"Emphasis is on the fabrication of the required complex configuration of Ni-yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) porous anode support by tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) based gelcasting, particularly the effects of solid loading, amounts of monomers and dispersant on the rheological behaviour of suspension, the shrinkage of a wet gelcast green body upon drying, and the properties of final sample after sintering at 1350 degrees C and reduction from NiO-YSZ to Ni-YSZ.",Development and Fabrication of a New Concept Planar-tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (PT-SOFC),10.1002/fuce.201000152
3,8692,The results show that the gelcasting is a powerful method for preparation of the required complex configuration anode support.,Development and Fabrication of a New Concept Planar-tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (PT-SOFC),10.1002/fuce.201000152
4,8692,"The anode support resulted from an optimised suspension with the solid loading of 25 vol% has uniform microstructure with 37% porosity, bending strength of 44 MPa and conductivity of 300 S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C, meeting the requirements for an anode support of SOFC.",Development and Fabrication of a New Concept Planar-tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (PT-SOFC),10.1002/fuce.201000152
5,8692,"Based on the as-prepared anode support, PT-SOFC single cell of Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSCF has been fabricated by slurry coating and co-sintering technique.",Development and Fabrication of a New Concept Planar-tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (PT-SOFC),10.1002/fuce.201000152
6,8692,"The cell peak power density reaches 63, 106 and 141 mW cm(-2) at 700, 750 and 800 degrees C, respectively, using hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.",Development and Fabrication of a New Concept Planar-tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (PT-SOFC),10.1002/fuce.201000152
