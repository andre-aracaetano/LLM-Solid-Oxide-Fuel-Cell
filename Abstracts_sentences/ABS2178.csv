1,2178,A lanthanum and calcium co-doped A-site deficient strontium titanate (LSCTA-) was used as alternative anode material in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) with an active area of 100 cm(2).,Short Stack and Full System Test Using aCeramic A-Site Deficient Strontium Titanate Anode,10.1002/fuce.201400183
2,2178,"Cell performance was tested in both short (5 cell) stack configuration, as well as a full HEXIS Galileo system (nominally 1kWAC).",Short Stack and Full System Test Using aCeramic A-Site Deficient Strontium Titanate Anode,10.1002/fuce.201400183
3,2178,"Impregnation with various electrocatalysts, such as nickel and ceria, yielded promising fuel cell performance at this scale.",Short Stack and Full System Test Using aCeramic A-Site Deficient Strontium Titanate Anode,10.1002/fuce.201400183
4,2178,The system test initially produced 70% of the nominal output power and is to the authors' knowledge the first all-oxide SOFC test on this scale.,Short Stack and Full System Test Using aCeramic A-Site Deficient Strontium Titanate Anode,10.1002/fuce.201400183
5,2178,The strontium titanate backbone provides sufficient electronic conductivity to ensure acceptable ohmic losses.,Short Stack and Full System Test Using aCeramic A-Site Deficient Strontium Titanate Anode,10.1002/fuce.201400183
