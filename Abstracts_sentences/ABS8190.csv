1,8190,"Protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells (PCMFCs) based on oxide proton conductors exhibit more advantages than traditional solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on oxygen-ion conducting electrolytes, such as low activation energy and high energy efficiency.","Stable, easily sintered BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells by gel-casting and suspension spray",10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.11.154
2,8190,"In order to develop a simple and cost-effective route to fabricate PCMFCs with SrCo0.9Sb0.1O3-delta (SCS) cubic perovskite cathode, a dense BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-delta (BCZYZn) electrolyte was fabricated in situ metal oxide on a porous anode support by gel-casting and suspension spray, which is cost-effective, easy to realize, and suitable for mass-production.","Stable, easily sintered BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells by gel-casting and suspension spray",10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.11.154
3,8190,"The key part of this process is to directly spray well-mixed suspension of BaCO3, CeO2, ZrO2, Y2O3 and ZnO instead of pre-synthesized BCZYZn ceramic powder on the anode substrate.","Stable, easily sintered BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells by gel-casting and suspension spray",10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.11.154
4,8190,"With SCS cubic perovskite cathode synthesized by gel-casting on the bi-layer, single cells were assembled and tested with H-2 as fuel and the static air as oxidant.","Stable, easily sintered BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-δ electrolyte-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells by gel-casting and suspension spray",10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.11.154
5,8190,"An open-circuit potential of 0.987 V, a maximum power density of 364 mW cm(-2), and a low polarization resistance of the electrodes of 0.07 Omega cm(2) was achieved at 700 degrees C.
