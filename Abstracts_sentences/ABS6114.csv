2,6114,"We demonstrate a low-temperature (<30 degrees C) process for controlling internal stress in an archetypal fast-ion conductor, crystalline Y2O3-doped ZrO2 (YDZ), which allows us to form stable suspended nanomembranes akin to those fabricated at high temperature (>550 degrees C).",Monolithic Integration of Nanoscale Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes onto Polymer Scaffolds through Stress Control,10.1021/nn404401c
3,6114,"Such a low-temperature synthesis method then enables us to monolithically integrate the suspended oxide-ion conducting membranes onto polyimide (Kapton by DuPont), a polymer vastly different physical properties than that of a ceramic.",Monolithic Integration of Nanoscale Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes onto Polymer Scaffolds through Stress Control,10.1021/nn404401c
4,6114,Integrated functional heterostructure solid oxide fuel cells operable below the glass transition temperature of the polymer are demonstrated.,Monolithic Integration of Nanoscale Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes onto Polymer Scaffolds through Stress Control,10.1021/nn404401c
5,6114,"Our results describe a mechanistic low-temperature processing route for forming stable multifunctional membrane structures, applicable to the realization of various energy conversion and sensing devices and structural skins for miniature autonomous systems.",Monolithic Integration of Nanoscale Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Membranes onto Polymer Scaffolds through Stress Control,10.1021/nn404401c
