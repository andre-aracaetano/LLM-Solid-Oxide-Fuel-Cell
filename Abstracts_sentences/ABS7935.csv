2,7935,"However, carbon deposition and low conversion ratio are potential problems for this technology.",Combined methane reforming by carbon dioxide and steam in proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells for syngas/power co-generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.244
3,7935,"Apart from using functional catalytic layer in the SOFC to enhance CH4 dry reforming, adding H2O into the fuel stream could facilitate the CH4 conversion and enhance the co-generation performance of the SOFC.",Combined methane reforming by carbon dioxide and steam in proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells for syngas/power co-generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.244
4,7935,"In this work, the effects of adding H2O to the CO2-CH4 fuel on the performance of a tubular proton conducting SOFC are studied numerically.",Combined methane reforming by carbon dioxide and steam in proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells for syngas/power co-generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.244
5,7935,Results show that the CH4 conversion is improved from 0.830 to 0.898 after adding 20% H2O to the anode.,Combined methane reforming by carbon dioxide and steam in proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells for syngas/power co-generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.244
6,7935,"Meanwhile, the current density is increased from 2832 A m(-2) to 3064 A m(-2) at 0.7 V. Sensitivity studies indicate that the H-2:CO ratio can be effectively controlled by the amount of H2O addition and the H-2 starvation can be alleviated, especially at high current density conditions.",Combined methane reforming by carbon dioxide and steam in proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells for syngas/power co-generation,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.244
