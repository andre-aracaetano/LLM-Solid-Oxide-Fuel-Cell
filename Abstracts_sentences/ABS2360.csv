2,2360,"The power-conditioning system (PCS) model comprises the comprehensive transient models of PSOFC, balance-of-plant and power-electronics subsystems (BOPS and PES, respectively) and application load (AL).",A Multidiscipline and Multi-rate Modeling Framework for Planar Solid-oxide-fuel-cell based Power-Conditioning System for Vehicular APU,10.1177/0037549708097713
3,2360,"It can be used for resolving the interactions among PSOFC, BOPS, PES and AL, control design and system optimization and studying fuel-cell durability.",A Multidiscipline and Multi-rate Modeling Framework for Planar Solid-oxide-fuel-cell based Power-Conditioning System for Vehicular APU,10.1177/0037549708097713
4,2360,"The PCS model has several key properties including: (i) it can simultaneously predict spatial as well as temporal dynamics; (ii) it has two levels of abstraction: comprehensive (for detailed dynamics) and reduced-order (for fast simulation); and (iii) the fast-simulation model can be implemented completely in Simulink/Matlab environment, thereby significantly reducing the cost as well as time and provides the avenue for real-time simulation and integration with vehicular power-train models employing the widely used ADVISOR.",A Multidiscipline and Multi-rate Modeling Framework for Planar Solid-oxide-fuel-cell based Power-Conditioning System for Vehicular APU,10.1177/0037549708097713
