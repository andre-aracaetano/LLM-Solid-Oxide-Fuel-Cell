1,16525,"Dual-ion electrolytes with oxygen ion and proton-conducting properties are among the innovative solid oxide electrolytes, which exhibit a low Ohmic resistance at temperatures below 550 degrees C. Ba-Co(0.4)Fe(0.4)Zr(0.4)Y(0.1)O(3-delta )with a perovskite-phase cathode has demonstrated efficient triple-charge conduction (H+/O2-/e(-)) in a high-performance low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC).",Application of a Triple-Conducting Heterostructure Electrolyte of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.1Fe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ and Ca0.04Ce0.80Sm0.16O2-δ in a High-Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acsami.0c10061
2,16525,"Here, we designed another type of triple-charge conducting perovskite oxide based on Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.1Fe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1O3-delta (BSCFZY), which formed a heterostructure with ionic conductor Ca0.04Ce0.80Sm0.16O2-delta (SCDC), showing both a high ionic conductivity of 0.22 S cm(-1) and an excellent power output of 900 mW cm(-2) in a hybrid-ion LT-SOFC.",Application of a Triple-Conducting Heterostructure Electrolyte of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.1Fe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ and Ca0.04Ce0.80Sm0.16O2-δ in a High-Performance Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/acsami.0c10061
