1,11167,"Suppression of chromium vaporization from oxidation scales formed on ferritic stainless steel, when used on the cathode side of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC), is a most important issue, since gaseous chromium species cause deposition of chromium oxide on electrolyte or electrode materials.",Chromium vaporization of bare and of coated iron-chromium alloys at 1073 K,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.12.010
2,11167,This phenomenon leads to deterioration of the cell performance.,Chromium vaporization of bare and of coated iron-chromium alloys at 1073 K,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.12.010
3,11167,The chromium vaporization rates of bare and of coated iron-chromium alloys were measured at 1073 K.,Chromium vaporization of bare and of coated iron-chromium alloys at 1073 K,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.12.010
4,11167,"The effect of ceramic coating layers, deposited by low-cost aerosol spraying or by dip coating, was evaluated and the morphology of the coating layer was observed.",Chromium vaporization of bare and of coated iron-chromium alloys at 1073 K,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.12.010
5,11167,"Lanthanum strontium manganese oxide (LSM: La0.65Sr0.3MnO3), lanthanum strontium cobalt iron oxide (LSCF: La0.6Sr0.4CoFe0.2O3) and manganese cobalt oxide (MCO: MnCo2O4) coatings, formed from submicron powders, decreased chromium vaporization by a factor of as much as 21-40 at 1073 K. Manganese cobalt oxide and lanthanum strontium chromium oxide (La0.7Sr0.3CrO3) coating, formed from powders prepared by a glycine nitrate combustion synthesis, reduced chromium vaporization by factors of only 2-3 because the coating layers were porous.",Chromium vaporization of bare and of coated iron-chromium alloys at 1073 K,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.12.010
