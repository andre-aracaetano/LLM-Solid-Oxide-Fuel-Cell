1,13609,"In this paper we report the successful incorporation of silicon into SrMO3 (M = Co, Mn) leading to a structural change from a hexagonal to a cubic perovskite.","Synthesis of silicon doped SrMO3 (M = Mn, Co): stabilization of the cubic perovskite and enhancement in conductivity",10.1039/c1dt10253b
2,13609,"For M = Co, the cubic phase was observed for low doping levels (3%), and these doped phases showed very high conductivities (up to approximate to 350 Scm(-1) at room temperature).","Synthesis of silicon doped SrMO3 (M = Mn, Co): stabilization of the cubic perovskite and enhancement in conductivity",10.1039/c1dt10253b
3,13609,"However, annealing studies at intermediate temperatures (700-800 degrees C), indicated that the cubic phase was metastable with a gradual transformation to a hexagonal cell on annealing.","Synthesis of silicon doped SrMO3 (M = Mn, Co): stabilization of the cubic perovskite and enhancement in conductivity",10.1039/c1dt10253b
4,13609,Further work showed that co-doping with Fe resulted in improved stability of the cubic phase; a composition SrCo0.85Fe0.1Si0.05O3-y displayed good stability at intermediate temperatures and a high ;conductivity (approximate to 150 Scm(-1) at room temperature).,"Synthesis of silicon doped SrMO3 (M = Mn, Co): stabilization of the cubic perovskite and enhancement in conductivity",10.1039/c1dt10253b
5,13609,"For M = Mn, the work showed that higher substitution levels were required to form the cubic perovskite (approximate to 15% Si doping), although in these cases the phases were shown to be stable to annealing at intermediate temperatures.","Synthesis of silicon doped SrMO3 (M = Mn, Co): stabilization of the cubic perovskite and enhancement in conductivity",10.1039/c1dt10253b
6,13609,"Conductivity measurements again showed an enhancement in the conductivity on Si doping, although the conductivities were lower (approximate to 0.3-14 Scm(-1) in the range 20-800 degrees C) than the cobalt containing systems.","Synthesis of silicon doped SrMO3 (M = Mn, Co): stabilization of the cubic perovskite and enhancement in conductivity",10.1039/c1dt10253b
7,13609,The conductivities of both systems suggest potential for use as cathode materials in solid oxide fuel cells.,"Synthesis of silicon doped SrMO3 (M = Mn, Co): stabilization of the cubic perovskite and enhancement in conductivity",10.1039/c1dt10253b
