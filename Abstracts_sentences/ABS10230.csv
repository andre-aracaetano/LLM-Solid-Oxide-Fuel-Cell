1,10230,"In this study, the properties of BaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (SAB) glasses incorporated with CaO and V2O5 as the network modifier and additive, respectively, are evaluated.",Physical and sealing properties of BaO-Al2O3-SiO2-CaO-V2O5 glasses for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.094
2,10230,The electrical resistivities of the glasses decrease upon the addition of CaO but increase upon increasing their V2O5 content because the V5+ species lower the ionic mobility of the glasses.,Physical and sealing properties of BaO-Al2O3-SiO2-CaO-V2O5 glasses for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.094
3,10230,"The addition of V2O5 improves the wettability of the glasses on the Crofer 22 APU substrate, and thus, increases the fracture strength at the glass-Crofer 22 APU couple.",Physical and sealing properties of BaO-Al2O3-SiO2-CaO-V2O5 glasses for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.094
4,10230,"Among the glasses evaluated, the SAB glass with a CaO content of 20 wt% and V2O5 content of 2 wt% (SABCa20V2) present excellent sealing properties because it adheres well to both the Zr-0.92-Y0.08O2-delta (YSZ) and Crofer 22 APU substrates; no pores, cracks, or interfacial phases are present at the interfaces, confirming the good chemical and thermal compatibility of the glass-substrate pairs at high temperatures.",Physical and sealing properties of BaO-Al2O3-SiO2-CaO-V2O5 glasses for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.094
5,10230,"After SAB-Ca20V2 is sealed on the Crofer 22 APU substrate at 850 degrees C, the leakage rate of the glass is low (<0.015 sccm,cm1 at 800 degrees C for 200 h), indicating negligible deterioration of its sealing efficiency and revealing its remarkable potential for use in solid oxide fuel cell applications.",Physical and sealing properties of BaO-Al2O3-SiO2-CaO-V2O5 glasses for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.094
