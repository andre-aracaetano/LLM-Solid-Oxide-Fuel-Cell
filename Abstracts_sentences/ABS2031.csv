5,2031,The magnitude of this arc increased linearly with the applied current density due to the decreased oxygen partial pressure at the interface of the cathode and the electrolyte.,New insights in the polarization resistance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.054
6,2031,It is found that the performance of the fuel cell in air is mainly determined by the oxygen diffusion process.,New insights in the polarization resistance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.054
7,2031,Elimination of this process by flowing pure oxygen to the cathode improved the cell performance significantly.,New insights in the polarization resistance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.054
8,2031,"At 750 degrees C, for a fuel cell with a laser-deposited Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) interlayer, an extraordinarily high power density of 2.6W cm(-2) at 0.7 V was achieved in flowing oxygen, as a result of reduced ohmic and polarization resistance of the fuel cell, which were 0.06 Omega cm(2) and 0.03 Omega cm(2), respectively.",New insights in the polarization resistance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.054
9,2031,The results indicate that microstructural optimization of the LSCF cathode or adoption of a new cell design which can mitigate the oxygen diffusion limitation in the cathode might enhance cell performance significantly.,New insights in the polarization resistance of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.054
