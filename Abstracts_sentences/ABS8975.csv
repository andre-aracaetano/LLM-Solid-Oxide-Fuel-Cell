1,8975,Conductive perovskite oxides have received much attention as promising candidates for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes.,Metal-oxide nanocomposite catalyst simultaneously boosts the oxygen reduction reactivity and chemical stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2022.140611
2,8975,"However, they show chemical instability due to the segregation of A-site cations on the surface at high temperatures, which causes their performance to degrade.",Metal-oxide nanocomposite catalyst simultaneously boosts the oxygen reduction reactivity and chemical stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2022.140611
3,8975,"Moreover, the high activation barrier to ox-ygen reduction reactions makes these materials more difficult to use as electrodes at lower temperatures (less than 700 degrees C).",Metal-oxide nanocomposite catalyst simultaneously boosts the oxygen reduction reactivity and chemical stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2022.140611
4,8975,"Herein, by combining two general techniques: nanoparticle infiltration and atomic layer deposition (ALD), we significantly improve both the durability and reactivity of a state-of-the-art perovskite oxide, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF).",Metal-oxide nanocomposite catalyst simultaneously boosts the oxygen reduction reactivity and chemical stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2022.140611
5,8975,"Ag nanocatalysts are dispersed onto an LSCF cathode via wet infiltration, after which they are covered with a thin ZrO2 layer via ALD to prevent the agglomeration of nanocatalysts and the segregation of Sr ions.",Metal-oxide nanocomposite catalyst simultaneously boosts the oxygen reduction reactivity and chemical stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2022.140611
6,8975,"Accordingly, the Ag/ZrO2 nanocomposite-deposited LSCF cathode shows the electrode resistance of 0.085 Omega cm2 at 650 degrees C over 200 h, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the near-record level among all nanocatalyst-infiltrated LSCF cathode to date.",Metal-oxide nanocomposite catalyst simultaneously boosts the oxygen reduction reactivity and chemical stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2022.140611
7,8975,"Our result suggests a new research direction to fully utilize nanocatalysts and perovskite oxides in SOFCs, which can be a shortcut to their commercialization.",Metal-oxide nanocomposite catalyst simultaneously boosts the oxygen reduction reactivity and chemical stability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.cej.2022.140611
