1,12941,Layered perovskite oxides have received extensive attention as promising cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) because of their faster diffusion coefficient and oxygen transport kinetics.,The effect of calcium doping on the improvement of performance and durability in a layered perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05684a
2,12941,"With the goals of enhancing electrochemical properties and improving the durability, this study focuses on the effect of calcium (Ca) doping in PrBa0.5Sr0.5-xCaxCo2O5+delta (x = 0 and 0.25) layered perovskite oxides through an investigation of their structural characteristics, electrical properties, redox behavior, electrochemical performances, and stability.",The effect of calcium doping on the improvement of performance and durability in a layered perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05684a
3,12941,"In the temperature range of 100-750 degrees C, the electrical conductivity of PrBa0.5Sr0.25Ca0.25Co2O5+delta (PBSCaCO) is higher than that of Ca-free PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta (PBSCO).",The effect of calcium doping on the improvement of performance and durability in a layered perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05684a
4,12941,"The area specific resistance (ASR) value of PBSCaCO-GDC (0.079 Omega cm(2)) is lower than that of PBSCO-GDC (0.093 Omega cm(2)) at 600 degrees C, based on a GDC electrolyte.",The effect of calcium doping on the improvement of performance and durability in a layered perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05684a
5,12941,"Moreover, PBSCaCO-GDC achieves a good performance of 1.83 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C. PBSCaCO shows a stable power output without observable degradation for 100 h. On the basis of these results, the PBSCaCO cathode is an excellent candidate for IT-SOFC applications.",The effect of calcium doping on the improvement of performance and durability in a layered perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta05684a
