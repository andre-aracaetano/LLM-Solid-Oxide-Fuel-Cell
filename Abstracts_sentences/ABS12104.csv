1,12104,Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a bilayered yttria-doped bismuth (YDB) and gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) composite electrolyte film were developed.,Anode-supported SOFCs with Y2O3-doped Bi2O3/Gd2O3-doped CeO2 composite electrolyte film,10.1149/1.2146668
2,12104,"The cell with an YDB/GDC composite electrolyte film (84 mu m GDC+16 mu m YDB) showed an increase of 68-96 mV in open-circuit voltage in the operating temperature range of 700-500 degrees C, compared with that with a single GDC electrolyte film (similar to 99 mu m).",Anode-supported SOFCs with Y2O3-doped Bi2O3/Gd2O3-doped CeO2 composite electrolyte film,10.1149/1.2146668
3,12104,"Using Pt as the cathode, the cell with the YDB/GDC composite electrolyte also showed much lower electrode polarization resistance than that with the single GDC electrolyte and almost the same ohmic resistance as the latter.",Anode-supported SOFCs with Y2O3-doped Bi2O3/Gd2O3-doped CeO2 composite electrolyte film,10.1149/1.2146668
4,12104,"As a result of the combined effects of these factors, the cell with an YDB/GDC composite electrolyte can achieve 0.6 similar to 1.5 times higher maximum power density than that with a single GDC electrolyte in the operating temperature range of 700-500 degrees C.
