1,17243,"In this work, the method of chemical deposition from the gas phase of organometallic compounds (CVDOM) was used to obtain thin electrolyte films of zirconia stabilized by yttria (YSZ) on a supporting electrode.",Formation of solid electrolyte films on porous supporting electrodes,10.1134/S1023193509050164
2,17243,"Tetrakis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)zirconium and tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)yttrium often termed as zirconium (IV) Zr(dpm)(4) and yttrium (III) Y(dpm)(3) dipivaloylmethanates were used as precursors for film deposition.",Formation of solid electrolyte films on porous supporting electrodes,10.1134/S1023193509050164
3,17243,Gas-tight electrolyte films were obtained on a supporting anode with a thickness of 4-10 mu m at moderate deposition temperatures of 500-700A degrees C. An electrochemical cell was prepared and tested using the obtained films.,Formation of solid electrolyte films on porous supporting electrodes,10.1134/S1023193509050164
4,17243,"The cell allowed obtaining the power density values of 680, 360, and 175 mW/cm(2) at the temperatures of 800, 700, and 600A degrees C, accordingly.",Formation of solid electrolyte films on porous supporting electrodes,10.1134/S1023193509050164
