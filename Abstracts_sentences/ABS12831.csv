1,12831,Praseodymium oxides (Pr4O7 and Pr6O11) were added into Ni-Mo-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) anode.,Effect of Pr addition into Ni based anode on direct methanol fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.113846
2,12831,The single cell with PrO-Ni-Mo-SDC as the anode and SDC-carbonate composite as the electrolyte showed a higher cell performance and a lower polarization resistance with H-2 as the fuel.,Effect of Pr addition into Ni based anode on direct methanol fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.113846
3,12831,"It is hypothesized that PrO-Ni-Mo-SDC possesses more lattice oxygen atoms, and the Ce4+ and Ni2+ in PrO-Ni-Mo-SDC have lower reduction temperatures than those in Ni-Mo-SDC.",Effect of Pr addition into Ni based anode on direct methanol fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.113846
4,12831,"Using methanol as the fuel, the maximum power density of the single cell with PrO-Ni-Mo-SDC as the anode was 594 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, which was slightly lower than that of the single cell with Ni-Mo-SDC as the anode.",Effect of Pr addition into Ni based anode on direct methanol fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.113846
5,12831,"However, the single cell with PrO-Ni-Mo-SDC as the anode showed a better stability, which is probably due to its better coking resistance.",Effect of Pr addition into Ni based anode on direct methanol fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.113846
6,12831,The amount and the graphitization degree of the carbon deposited on PrO-Ni-Mo-SDC were lower than those of the carbon on Ni-Mo-SDC.,Effect of Pr addition into Ni based anode on direct methanol fueled solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.113846
