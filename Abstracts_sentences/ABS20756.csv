1,20756,The performance of a Sr(2)Fet(5)Mo(0.5)O(6-delta) (SFMO) perovskite anode has been investigated under solid oxide fuel cell conditions while operating on CO and syngas fuels using periodic density functional theory and microkinetic modeling.,Reaction kinetics of the electrochemical oxidation of CO and syngas fuels on a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ perovskite anode,10.1039/c5ta05056a
2,20756,Three surface models with different Fe/Mo ratios and oxygen vacancies on the gas exposed surface layer are used to identify the active site and electro-oxidation mechanism for CO and a mixture of CO and H-2.,Reaction kinetics of the electrochemical oxidation of CO and syngas fuels on a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ perovskite anode,10.1039/c5ta05056a
3,20756,Calculated current densities suggest that SFMO anodes exhibit lower performance while operating on CO compared to H-2 fuel and a surface with a higher Mo concentration in the top most layer exhibits a higher activity for both fuels.,Reaction kinetics of the electrochemical oxidation of CO and syngas fuels on a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ perovskite anode,10.1039/c5ta05056a
4,20756,"Furthermore, the model predicts that desorption of CO2 and formation of an oxygen vacancy, which is found to be the charge transfer step, is rate-controlling for CO electro-oxidation at operating voltage.",Reaction kinetics of the electrochemical oxidation of CO and syngas fuels on a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ perovskite anode,10.1039/c5ta05056a
5,20756,The CO oxidation activity can thus be improved by increasing the Mo content or by adding small amounts of an active transition metal on the surface that facilitates the oxygen vacancy formation process by delocalizing the electrons at the vacant site.,Reaction kinetics of the electrochemical oxidation of CO and syngas fuels on a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ perovskite anode,10.1039/c5ta05056a
6,20756,"In the presence of a mixture of CO, H-2 and H2O gas, the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O,= CO2 + H-2) is rapid at operating voltage and H-2 electro-oxidation contributes mostly to the overall observed electrochemical activity, while CO is primarily chemically oxidized to CO2.",Reaction kinetics of the electrochemical oxidation of CO and syngas fuels on a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ perovskite anode,10.1039/c5ta05056a
7,20756,A higher Mo content in the SFMO surface promotes again a higher activity for syngas fuels with high CO content.,Reaction kinetics of the electrochemical oxidation of CO and syngas fuels on a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-δ perovskite anode,10.1039/c5ta05056a
