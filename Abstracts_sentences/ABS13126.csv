1,13126,"Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM)+ YSZ cathode, and Ni + YSZ anode were fabricated and their performance was evaluated between 650 and 800 degrees C with humidified hydrogen as the fuel and air as the oxidant.","Polarization effects in intermediate temperature, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.1391566
2,13126,Maximum power densities measured were similar to 1.8 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C and similar to 0.82 W/cm(2) at 650 degrees C. Voltage (V) vs. current density (i) traces were nonlinear; V vs. i exhibited a concave-up curvature,"Polarization effects in intermediate temperature, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.1391566

7,13126,"It is shown that in anode-supported cells, the initial concave-up curvature can be due either to activation or concentration polarization, or both.","Polarization effects in intermediate temperature, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.1391566
8,13126,"By contrast, in cathode-supported cells, the initial concave-up curvature is entirely due to activation polarization.","Polarization effects in intermediate temperature, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.1391566
9,13126,"From the experimentally observed V vs. i traces for anode-supported cells, effective binary diffusivity of gaseous species on the anodic side was estimated to be between similar to 0.1 cm(2)/s at 650 degrees C and similar to 0.2 cm(2)/s at 800 degrees C.","Polarization effects in intermediate temperature, anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells",10.1149/1.1391566
