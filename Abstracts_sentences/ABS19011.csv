1,19011,"Experimental data on half-cells consisting of YSZ electrolyte pellets and slurry-coated cathodes, and a-simplified theoretical model were used to give an insight into the kinetics of oxygen reduction in solid electrolyte composite cathodes.",Influence of the temperature on oxygen reduction on SOFC composite electrodes: Theoretical and experimental analysis,10.1115/1.2786461
2,19011,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarizations were used to evaluate the main electro-chemical parameters of the cathodic process in a temperature range between 500 degrees C and 900 degrees C.,Influence of the temperature on oxygen reduction on SOFC composite electrodes: Theoretical and experimental analysis,10.1115/1.2786461
3,19011,"The experimental results show that the oxygen reaction is not under activation control at low temperatures, and other phenomena, such as the transfer of oxygen ions to and through the solid electrolyte in the composite cathode, occur and retard the overall rate of oxygen reduction.",Influence of the temperature on oxygen reduction on SOFC composite electrodes: Theoretical and experimental analysis,10.1115/1.2786461
4,19011,This working hypothesis was assessed using a simplified theoretical model of the cathode that accounts for charge transfer mass transfer and conduction.,Influence of the temperature on oxygen reduction on SOFC composite electrodes: Theoretical and experimental analysis,10.1115/1.2786461
