1,5623,A single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) with micropatterned electrodes on the electrolyte has been fabricated by a microfluidic lithography technique.,Single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell with micropatterned interdigitated electrodes,10.1149/1.2180537
2,5623,Microchannels formed by contacting the polydimethylsiloxane mold with a polished substrate of YSZ disk were filled with the well-dispersed suspensions of the cathode and the anode.,Single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell with micropatterned interdigitated electrodes,10.1149/1.2180537
3,5623,"The suspensions solidified upon solvent evaporation through the mold, resulting in the SC-SOFC with interdigitated micropatterned electrodes in an area of 5 x 5 mm in which each electrode had 100 mu m line width with anode-to-cathode distances of 50 mu m. I-V characteristics of the SC-SOFC were analyzed using a dc source meter.",Single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell with micropatterned interdigitated electrodes,10.1149/1.2180537
