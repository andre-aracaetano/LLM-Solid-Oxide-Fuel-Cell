1,8565,"The mechanical properties of thin film gadolinia doped ceria (Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9, GDC) electrolyte, for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), with different levels of sintering density were investigated by the nanoindentation technique.",Effect of Sintering Temperature on the Mechanical Properties of Film Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Electrolyte for SOFCs Using Nanoindentation,
2,8565,"Electrolyte thin film supported on Ni-GDC cermet was made by co-sintering at several temperatures between 1350 and 1450 degrees C. The microstructures of the electrolyte films and the cells performances were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM and current-voltage tests, respectively.",Effect of Sintering Temperature on the Mechanical Properties of Film Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Electrolyte for SOFCs Using Nanoindentation,
3,8565,"In order to determine the mechanical properties, a Berkovich indenter was used at different applied loads (30, 50 and 100 mN).",Effect of Sintering Temperature on the Mechanical Properties of Film Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Electrolyte for SOFCs Using Nanoindentation,
4,8565,"Plastic deformation took place, so Oliver and Pharr equations must be applied to evaluate the hardness and Young's modulus of the electrolyte film.",Effect of Sintering Temperature on the Mechanical Properties of Film Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Electrolyte for SOFCs Using Nanoindentation,
5,8565,The residual nanoindentations were observed by optical microscope (M.O.) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM).,Effect of Sintering Temperature on the Mechanical Properties of Film Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Electrolyte for SOFCs Using Nanoindentation,
