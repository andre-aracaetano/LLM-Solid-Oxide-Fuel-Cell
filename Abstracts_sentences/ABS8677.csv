3,8677,"In the course of this project, stable cell operation was achieved with CO/CO2/N-2 gas compositions at 800 degrees C and 750 degrees C as well as acceptable performance, though test results with H-2/H2O/N-2 gas mixtures were not reached.",SOFC operation with carbon oxides: Experimental analysis of performance and degradation,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.04.036
4,8677,Electrochemical impedance measurements revealed high polarization resistances to be the cause of this differences in performance.,SOFC operation with carbon oxides: Experimental analysis of performance and degradation,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.04.036
5,8677,"The combination of carbon monoxide and hydrogen as reactants in fuel mixtures results in rapid performance degradation: a performance reduction of 27% was recognizable within 6 h. Additionally, a 100 h test at 700 degrees C with CO/CO2/N-2 =",SOFC operation with carbon oxides: Experimental analysis of performance and degradation,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.04.036
6,8677,"20/10/70 vol% in polarization conditions (50 mAcm(-2)) is also presented, wherein there was continuous degradation at a rate of 17.2% over 100 h. Scanning electron investigations showed significant influences on the microstructure as carbon led to an enlargement of the nickel components and the coverage of the catalyst surfaces, respectively.",SOFC operation with carbon oxides: Experimental analysis of performance and degradation,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.04.036
