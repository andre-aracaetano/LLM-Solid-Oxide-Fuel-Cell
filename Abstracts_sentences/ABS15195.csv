1,15195,"High entropy perovskite oxides (HEPOs) have been proposed to serve as improved cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs); however, the larger compositional design space introduced by HEPOs urges for a better understanding of the correlation among the composition, phase stability and resulting properties of HEPO cathodes.",Tailoring high-temperature stability and electrical conductivity of high entropy lanthanum manganite for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/d1ta07275g
2,15195,"In this work, a series of LaMnO3 based HEPOs (HEALMOs) were designed systematically to investigate the effect of the A site high entropy composition on the structure and thermochemical/electrical properties of HEALMO materials.",Tailoring high-temperature stability and electrical conductivity of high entropy lanthanum manganite for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/d1ta07275g
3,15195,The results show that the high entropy effect manifests itself on top of the conventional doping effect.,Tailoring high-temperature stability and electrical conductivity of high entropy lanthanum manganite for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/d1ta07275g
4,15195,"First of all, neither the Goldschmidt tolerance factor nor the cation size difference can be used simply to predict the formation ability of single-phase HEALMOs.",Tailoring high-temperature stability and electrical conductivity of high entropy lanthanum manganite for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/d1ta07275g
5,15195,"Meanwhile, HEALMOs may exhibit higher crystallographic symmetry with much higher cation size differences and at Goldschmidt tolerance factor values deviating more largely from 1.",Tailoring high-temperature stability and electrical conductivity of high entropy lanthanum manganite for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/d1ta07275g
6,15195,"Secondly, while high-temperature stability including both resistance to elemental segregation and chemical compatibility with 8YSZ is affected by the A site cation size difference in a similar way to that of conventional perovskite oxides, HEALMOs show much enhanced stability at larger A site cation size differences.",Tailoring high-temperature stability and electrical conductivity of high entropy lanthanum manganite for solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1039/d1ta07275g
