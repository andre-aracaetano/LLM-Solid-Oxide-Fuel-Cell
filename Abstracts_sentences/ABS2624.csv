1,2624,Nanoscale yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte film was deposited by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) on a porous anodic aluminum oxide supporting substrate for solid oxide fuel cells.,Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition of Nanoscale Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Porous Substrate,10.1021/am508710s
2,2624,"The minimum thickness of PEALD-YSZ electrolyte required for a consistently high open circuit voltage of 1.17 V at 500 degrees C is 70 nm, which is much thinner than the reported thickness of 180 nm using nonplasmatic ALD and is also the thinnest attainable value reported in the literatures on a porous supporting substrate.",Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition of Nanoscale Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Porous Substrate,10.1021/am508710s
3,2624,"By further reducing the electrolyte thickness, the grain size reduction resulted in high surface grain boundary density at the cathode/electrolyte interface.",Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition of Nanoscale Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Porous Substrate,10.1021/am508710s
