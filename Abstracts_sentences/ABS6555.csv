1,6555,"Antimony was doped to barium strontium ferrite to produce ferrite-based perovskites with a composition of Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe1-xSbxO3-delta (x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1) as novel cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Antimony doped barium strontium ferrite perovskites as novel cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.01.122
2,6555,"The perovskite properties including oxygen nonstoichiometry (delta), mean valence of B-site, tolerance factors, thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and electrical conductivity (sigma) are explored as a function of antimony content.",Antimony doped barium strontium ferrite perovskites as novel cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.01.122
3,6555,"By defect chemistry analysis, the TECs decrease since the variable oxygen vacancy concentration is decreased by Sb doping, and s decreases with x due to the reduced charge concentration of Fe4+ content.",Antimony doped barium strontium ferrite perovskites as novel cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.01.122
4,6555,"Consequently, the electro-chemical performance was substantially improved and the interfacial polarization resistance was reduced from 0.213 to 0.120 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C with Sb doping.",Antimony doped barium strontium ferrite perovskites as novel cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.01.122
5,6555,The perovskite with x = 1.0 is suggested as the most promising composition as SOFC cathode material.,Antimony doped barium strontium ferrite perovskites as novel cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.01.122
