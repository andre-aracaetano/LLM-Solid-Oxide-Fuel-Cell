2,1082,"We designed and evaluated an SOFC system operated at 800degreesC, which uses cells and heat exchangers of micro-tubes with the outer-diameter of 2.4 mm.",Design and evaluation of an electric vehicle using solid oxide fuel cells,10.1252/jcej.35.1290
3,1082,"We found that a compact SOFC system (55.8 kg, 0.064 ml) can supply a maximum power of 64 kW for driving and that the system efficiency is 3-4 times higher than an internal combustion engine (ICE) system with a power output less than 20 kW.",Design and evaluation of an electric vehicle using solid oxide fuel cells,10.1252/jcej.35.1290
