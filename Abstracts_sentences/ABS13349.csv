1,13349,An anode functional layer (AFL) is inserted between anode substrate and electrolyte thin-film to increase the triple phase boundary (TPB) for anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Effect of Anode Thickness on Polarization Resistance for Metal-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0431704jes
2,13349,"On the other hand, better mechanical robustness, redox tolerance, rapid thermal cycling and cost reduction are expected for metal-supported SOFCs.",Effect of Anode Thickness on Polarization Resistance for Metal-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0431704jes
3,13349,"The anode thickness of metal-supported cells (MSCs) is more important than the AFL thickness of anode-supported cells (ASCs), since the metallic substrate does not have TPB.",Effect of Anode Thickness on Polarization Resistance for Metal-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0431704jes
4,13349,"In the present work, the metal-supported microtubular SOFCs with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3(LSCF)-(Ce0.9Gd0.1)O-1.95(GDC) cathode, GDC electrolyte, BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BCY) blocking layer and Ni-GDC anode on Ni substrate were investigated.",Effect of Anode Thickness on Polarization Resistance for Metal-Supported Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.0431704jes
5,13349,The significant decrease in polarization resistance with increasing the anode thickness from 10 to 16 mu m was confirmed by the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis for the metal-supported microtubular SOFCs operated at 550 degrees C.
