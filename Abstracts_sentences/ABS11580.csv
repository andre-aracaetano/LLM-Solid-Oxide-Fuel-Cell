2,11580,"Herein, a facile method, modified room temperature solid-state reaction (M-RTSSR) was proposed for synthesizing highly active BZCYYb nanopowders.",A facile method to synthesize BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-d (BZCYYb) nanopowders for the application on highly conductive proton- conducting electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.09.149
3,11580,"Pure perovskite BZCYYb powders can be obtained at a low calcination temperature of 950 degrees C and a short dwelling time of 3 h. The highly active character allows the sintering temperature of BZCYYb electrolytes decrease from 1550 degrees C to 1450 degrees C, thus effectively suppressing the Ba evaporation and promoting the grain growth.",A facile method to synthesize BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-d (BZCYYb) nanopowders for the application on highly conductive proton- conducting electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.09.149
