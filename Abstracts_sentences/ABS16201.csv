1,16201,"Electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of calcium-doped YFeO3, a potential cathode material in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), are measured as function of temperature and composition in air to resolve conflicts in the literature both on the nature of conduction (n- or p-type) and the types of defects (majority and the minority) present.",Electrical conductivity of Ca-doped YFeO3,
2,16201,"Compositions of Y1-xCaxFeO3-delta with x = 0.0, 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 are studied in the temperature range from 625 to 1250 K. All Y1-xCaxFeO3-delta samples show p-type semiconducting behaviour.",Electrical conductivity of Ca-doped YFeO3,
3,16201,Addition of Ca up to 5% dramatically increases the conductivity of YFeO3; increase is more gradual up to 10%.,Electrical conductivity of Ca-doped YFeO3,
4,16201,A second phase Ca2Fe2O5 appears in the microstructure for Ca concentrations in excess of 11%.,Electrical conductivity of Ca-doped YFeO3,
