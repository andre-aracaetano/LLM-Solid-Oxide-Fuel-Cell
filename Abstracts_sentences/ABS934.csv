1,934,"Bilayered electrolyte membranes composed of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3 - delta, (BZCY) and Ce0.8Sm0.2O2 - delta (SDC) were evaluated for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), and the influence of the membrane architecture on the cell performance was investigated.",Bilayered BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ/Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ electrolyte membranes for solid oxide fuel cells with high open circuit voltages,10.1016/j.memsci.2014.11.059
2,934,The electrochemical testing results showed that the electron-blocking ability of BZCY layer depends on its exact location in the fuel cell.,Bilayered BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ/Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ electrolyte membranes for solid oxide fuel cells with high open circuit voltages,10.1016/j.memsci.2014.11.059
3,934,"The partial internal short circuit was nearly totally eliminated for the cell with BZCY layer located at the anode side, and the corresponding cell exhibited a high open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.0 V at 700 degrees C.",Bilayered BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ/Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ electrolyte membranes for solid oxide fuel cells with high open circuit voltages,10.1016/j.memsci.2014.11.059
