1,16013,Composites formed by infiltration of 45 wt % La(0.8)Sr(0.2)Cr(0.5)Mn(0.5)O(3) (LSCM) into a 65% porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) scaffold were investigated in order to understand the reasons this material is able to provide excellent anode performance in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Investigation of the Structural and Catalytic Requirements for High-Performance SOFC Anodes Formed by Infiltration of LSCM,10.1149/1.3065971
2,16013,Scanning electron microscopy showed that the LSCM forms a film over the YSZ after calcination at 1473 K but that this film undergoes cracking to expose a long three-phase boundary after reduction at 1073 K. Coulometric titration demonstrated that the reduction of LSCM and La(0.8)Sr(0.2)MnO(3) occurred over a similar range of P(O(2)) and that reduction is the likely cause for film cracking.,Investigation of the Structural and Catalytic Requirements for High-Performance SOFC Anodes Formed by Infiltration of LSCM,10.1149/1.3065971
