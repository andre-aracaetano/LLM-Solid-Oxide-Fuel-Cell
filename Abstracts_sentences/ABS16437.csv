1,16437,"Mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIECs) can be found in many applications of interest to solid state ionics, ranging from separation membranes, to solid oxide fuel cells and oxygen sensors.","Electrical conductivity relaxation measurements: Statistical investigations using sensitivity analysis, optimal experimental design and ECRTOOLS",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.020
2,16437,"The performance of such MIEC-based devices is closely linked to fundamental transport and electrocatalytic properties such as the oxygen diffusion coefficient D and oxygen exchange rate k, which can be estimated using electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR).","Electrical conductivity relaxation measurements: Statistical investigations using sensitivity analysis, optimal experimental design and ECRTOOLS",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.020
3,16437,"In this article, the statistical quality of k and D obtained using ECR is studied via asymptotic statistical methods.","Electrical conductivity relaxation measurements: Statistical investigations using sensitivity analysis, optimal experimental design and ECRTOOLS",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.020
4,16437,"In particular, optimal experimental design (OED) is used to design experiments, which minimize the uncertainty on the estimated k and D, by selecting optimal sample size and experimental time span.","Electrical conductivity relaxation measurements: Statistical investigations using sensitivity analysis, optimal experimental design and ECRTOOLS",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.020
5,16437,"Furthermore, robust OED is introduced as a tool to reduce the uncertainty on the estimated k and D when some prior information on the two quantities is available such as their literature values or their bounds in a given temperature range.","Electrical conductivity relaxation measurements: Statistical investigations using sensitivity analysis, optimal experimental design and ECRTOOLS",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.020
6,16437,"In addition, it is shown that the sensitivity analysis can be used as a graphical tool to investigate the measurability of k and D and that the parameters governing the sensitivity are linked to the Biot number, the diffusion and reaction timescales.","Electrical conductivity relaxation measurements: Statistical investigations using sensitivity analysis, optimal experimental design and ECRTOOLS",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.020
7,16437,"Similarly, flush time limitations can be linked to the Biot number and the ratio between the characteristic timescale of the flush process.","Electrical conductivity relaxation measurements: Statistical investigations using sensitivity analysis, optimal experimental design and ECRTOOLS",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.020
8,16437,"All calculations are carried out with ECRTOOLS a freely available MATLAB toolbox which allows the estimation of k and D from ECR data, the evaluation of the quality of the estimated parameters and OED.","Electrical conductivity relaxation measurements: Statistical investigations using sensitivity analysis, optimal experimental design and ECRTOOLS",10.1016/j.ssi.2013.03.020
