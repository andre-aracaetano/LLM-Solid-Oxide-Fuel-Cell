1,18956,"The phase stability and compatibility of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) composite cathodes of lanthanum nickelate, La2NiO4+delta (LNO), and ceria-gadolinium oxide, Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CGO10), have been investigated by high resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD).",In situ compatibility studies of lanthanum nickelate with a ceria-based electrolyte for SOFC composite cathodes,10.1039/c2jm14384d
2,18956,No reaction was observed between LNO and CGO10 at temperatures of up to 900 degrees C when the composite is open to an ambient air environment.,In situ compatibility studies of lanthanum nickelate with a ceria-based electrolyte for SOFC composite cathodes,10.1039/c2jm14384d
3,18956,"However, in a sealed capillary environment the 50 : 50 wt% LNO:",In situ compatibility studies of lanthanum nickelate with a ceria-based electrolyte for SOFC composite cathodes,10.1039/c2jm14384d
4,18956,"CGO10 composite undergoes a partially reversible reaction at temperatures of 750 degrees C and above, whereby LNO decomposes to La2O3 and Ni.",In situ compatibility studies of lanthanum nickelate with a ceria-based electrolyte for SOFC composite cathodes,10.1039/c2jm14384d
5,18956,Changes in the CGO10 Bragg peaks indicate that this component is actively involved in this process.,In situ compatibility studies of lanthanum nickelate with a ceria-based electrolyte for SOFC composite cathodes,10.1039/c2jm14384d
6,18956,This study shows that the phase stability of LNO: CGO10 composites is highly dependent on oxygen partial pressure.,In situ compatibility studies of lanthanum nickelate with a ceria-based electrolyte for SOFC composite cathodes,10.1039/c2jm14384d
7,18956,"In addition, it is observed that ex-situ XRD is insufficient to determine the presence of reactivity in composite cathodes and that high resolution in situ XRD measurements are required to obtain details of the complexity of phase stability in SOFC composite cathodes.",In situ compatibility studies of lanthanum nickelate with a ceria-based electrolyte for SOFC composite cathodes,10.1039/c2jm14384d
