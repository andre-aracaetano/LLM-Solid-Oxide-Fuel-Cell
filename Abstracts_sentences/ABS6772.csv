3,6772,"The highest electrical conductivity values of 2041.2, 1877.4, and 1764.3 S/cm at 700, 800 and 900 degrees C can be achieved by samples with 3 wt% impregnated LSTM on Ni (R)/8YSZ.",Microstructural and electrochemical properties of impregnated La0.4Sr0.6Ti0.8Mn0.2O3±d into a partially removed Ni SOFC anode substrate,10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.157250
4,6772,"From the XPS analysis, the existence of a Ti metal peak on the surface of LSTM was only measured for the LSTM (3 wt%)-Ni (R)/8YSZ sample, metallic titanium on the surface can improve the electrical catalytic reaction.",Microstructural and electrochemical properties of impregnated La0.4Sr0.6Ti0.8Mn0.2O3±d into a partially removed Ni SOFC anode substrate,10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.157250
