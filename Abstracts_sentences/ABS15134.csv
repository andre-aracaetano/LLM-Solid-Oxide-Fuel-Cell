1,15134,"Single-cell solid oxide fuel cell experiments using thin-film, sputter-deposited Ni pattern anodes microfabricated on single-crystal yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte disks have been performed to examine the electrochemical oxidation of H-2, CO, and CO/H-2 mixtures.","Electrochemical oxidation of H2, CO, and CO/H2 mixtures on patterned Ni anodes on YSZ electrolytes",10.1149/1.2170577
2,15134,Porous lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM)/YSZ cathodes have been used and characterized in separate symmetric cell experiments such that Ni anode overpotentials and impedances can be isolated.,"Electrochemical oxidation of H2, CO, and CO/H2 mixtures on patterned Ni anodes on YSZ electrolytes",10.1149/1.2170577
3,15134,"Post-test scanning electron microscopy imaging revealed that at the high temperatures (735-850 degrees C), the 100-nm thin Ni patterns broke up into interconnected regions resulting in three-phase boundary lengths that roughly correlated with the original coverage area of the pretested dense Ni patterns.","Electrochemical oxidation of H2, CO, and CO/H2 mixtures on patterned Ni anodes on YSZ electrolytes",10.1149/1.2170577
4,15134,"Electrochemical characterization for H-2, CO, and CO/H-2 oxidation under dry and wet (similar to 4% H2O) feeds showed that the interconnected anode overpotentials and polarization resistances correlated with the original Ni pattern area for the various pattern geometries.","Electrochemical oxidation of H2, CO, and CO/H2 mixtures on patterned Ni anodes on YSZ electrolytes",10.1149/1.2170577
