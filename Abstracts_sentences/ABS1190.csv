1,1190,A thermally self-sustaining miniature power generation device was developed utilizing a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) placed in a controlled thermal environment provided by a spiral counterflow Swiss roll heat exchanger and combustor.,A Thermally Self-Sustaining Miniature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3081425
2,1190,"With the single-chamber design, fuel/oxygen crossover due to cracking of seals via thermal cycling is irrelevant and coking on the anode is practically eliminated.",A Thermally Self-Sustaining Miniature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3081425
3,1190,Appropriate SOFC operating temperatures were maintained even at low Reynolds numbers (Re) via combustion of the fuel cell effluent at the center of the Swiss roll.,A Thermally Self-Sustaining Miniature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3081425
4,1190,Both propane and higher hydrocarbon fuels were examined.,A Thermally Self-Sustaining Miniature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3081425
5,1190,Extinction limits and thermal behavior of the integrated system were determined in equivalence ratio-Re parameter space and an optimal regime for SOFC operation were identified.,A Thermally Self-Sustaining Miniature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3081425
6,1190,SOFC power densities up to 420 mW/cm(2) were observed at low Re.,A Thermally Self-Sustaining Miniature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3081425
7,1190,These results suggest that single-chamber SOFCs integrated with heat-recirculating combustors may be a viable approach for small-scale power generation devices.,A Thermally Self-Sustaining Miniature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.3081425
