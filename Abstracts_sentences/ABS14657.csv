5,14657,"The ionic conductivity of Pr0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta (PSF) was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3- (LSF) at 973 K. To evaluate these materials as cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), the chemical compatibility of LnSF with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was investigated.","The effect of A-site cation (Ln = La, Pr, Sm) on the crystal structure, conductivity and oxygen reduction properties of Sr-doped ferrite perovskites",10.1016/j.ssi.2012.02.028
6,14657,"Despite significant differences in ionic and electronic conductivity, the performance of the symmetric cells with composite cathodes formed by infiltration of doped LnFeO(3) into YSZ and calcination to 1123 K were essentially independent of the transport properties of the cathode materials, exhibiting an identical impedance of 0.08 Omega.cm(2) at 973 K.
