3,2115,Subsequent microwave-assisted rapid thermal annealing at 650-1000 degrees C resulted in crack-free 70 nm thin films.,Rapid densification of sol-gel derived yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films,10.1016/j.tsf.2015.06.036
4,2115,"A maximum density of approximately 95% was achieved within 5 min at 1000 degrees C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth analysis on the thin films showed that the shorter annealing times, as opposed to conventional heating, resulted in lower Si concentrations at the top surface and at the substrate interface.",Rapid densification of sol-gel derived yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films,10.1016/j.tsf.2015.06.036
