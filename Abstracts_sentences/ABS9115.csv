1,9115,"Here, a flow type atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor was used to deposit 1-10 nm thick porous ZrO2 overcoats within tire pores of conventional La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x (LSCF)-infiltrated Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes.",Atomic Layer Deposited Zirconia Overcoats as On-Board Strontium Getters for Improved Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Nanocomposite Cathode Durability,10.1021/acsaem.0c00558
2,9115,Both coated and uncoated cathodes displayed initial 650 degrees C polarization resistance (R-p) values of 0.09 +/- 0.03 Omega cm(2).,Atomic Layer Deposited Zirconia Overcoats as On-Board Strontium Getters for Improved Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Nanocomposite Cathode Durability,10.1021/acsaem.0c00558
3,9115,"However, improved stability was observed for cells with zirconia overcoats <= 5 nm thick.",Atomic Layer Deposited Zirconia Overcoats as On-Board Strontium Getters for Improved Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Nanocomposite Cathode Durability,10.1021/acsaem.0c00558
4,9115,"Specifically, 1000 h, symmetric cell, open-circuit, 650 degrees C R-p degradation rates decreased from 45%/kh for uncoated LSCF-GDC nanocomposite cathodes (NCCs) to 28%/kh, 18%/kh, and 12%/kh for identical LSCF-GDC NCCs with 1, 2, and 5 nm of zirconia overcoat, respectively.",Atomic Layer Deposited Zirconia Overcoats as On-Board Strontium Getters for Improved Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Nanocomposite Cathode Durability,10.1021/acsaem.0c00558
5,9115,"In contrast, identical LSCF-GDC NCCs with 10 nm of zirconia overcoat displayed 650 degrees C R(p )degradation rates of 87%/kh.",Atomic Layer Deposited Zirconia Overcoats as On-Board Strontium Getters for Improved Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Nanocomposite Cathode Durability,10.1021/acsaem.0c00558
6,9115,Scanning electron microscopy and controlled atmosphere impedance tests showed no significant changes in the LSCF infiltrate particle size or microporosity gas concentration polarization resistance with 1000 h of 650 C aging.,Atomic Layer Deposited Zirconia Overcoats as On-Board Strontium Getters for Improved Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Nanocomposite Cathode Durability,10.1021/acsaem.0c00558
7,9115,"Instead, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that zirconia overcoats decreased the amount of surface Sr on the LSCF, and X-ray diffraction detected SrZrO3 in samples with 5 or 10 nm thick zirconia overcoats.",Atomic Layer Deposited Zirconia Overcoats as On-Board Strontium Getters for Improved Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Nanocomposite Cathode Durability,10.1021/acsaem.0c00558
8,9115,"Hence, the lower degradation rates of LSCF-GDC NCCs with 1-5 nm thick zirconia overcoats were attributed to cleanup of deleterious surface Sr from the LSCF surface via the formation of SrZrCO3, while the higher degradation rates of LSCF-GDC NCCs with 10 nm thick zirconia overcoats were attributed to the accumulation of excessive amounts of SrZrO3 hindering oxygen incorporation into the LSCF.",Atomic Layer Deposited Zirconia Overcoats as On-Board Strontium Getters for Improved Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Nanocomposite Cathode Durability,10.1021/acsaem.0c00558
