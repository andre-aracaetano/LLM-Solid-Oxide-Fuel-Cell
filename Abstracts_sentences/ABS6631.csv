5,6631,"The importance of the cathode support layer is revealed, because this layer significantly decreases the oxygen gas-phase resistance within the cathode (at positions under the interconnect ribs) in the direction normal to the cathode/electrolyte interface as well as the electron resistance inside the cathode (at positions under the air channel) in the same direction.",SOFC Cell Design Optimization Using the Finite Element Method Based CFD Approach,10.1002/fuce.201300160
6,6631,"It is concluded that wider and thinner gas channels enable a more compact design with only a slightly decreased cell current density (per cross-sectional electrode/electrolyte interface area), i.e. a considerably increased volumetric cell current can be achieved.",SOFC Cell Design Optimization Using the Finite Element Method Based CFD Approach,10.1002/fuce.201300160
