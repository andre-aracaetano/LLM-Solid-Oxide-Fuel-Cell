1,1745,The aim of the work was to develop a mathematical model for computing the steady-state voltage - current characteristics of a planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and to determine the performance of a new SOFC design.,Simulation of the steady-state behaviour of a new design of a single planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1515/pjct-2016-0011
2,1745,The design involves cross-flow bipolar plates.,Simulation of the steady-state behaviour of a new design of a single planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1515/pjct-2016-0011
3,1745,Each of the bipolar plates has an air channel system on one side and a fuel channel system on the other side.,Simulation of the steady-state behaviour of a new design of a single planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1515/pjct-2016-0011
4,1745,The proposed model was developed using the ANSYS-Fluent commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software supported by additional Fuel Cell module.,Simulation of the steady-state behaviour of a new design of a single planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1515/pjct-2016-0011
5,1745,The results confirm that the model can well simulate the diagonal current path.,Simulation of the steady-state behaviour of a new design of a single planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1515/pjct-2016-0011
6,1745,The effects of temperature and gas flow through the channels and a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) structure were taken into account.,Simulation of the steady-state behaviour of a new design of a single planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1515/pjct-2016-0011
7,1745,It was shown that a significant increase of the MEA temperature at high current density can lead to hot spots formation and hence electrode damage.,Simulation of the steady-state behaviour of a new design of a single planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1515/pjct-2016-0011
