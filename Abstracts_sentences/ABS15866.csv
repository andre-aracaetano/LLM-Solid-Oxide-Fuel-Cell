1,15866,One of challenges in improving the performance and cost-effectiveness of SOFCs (Solid Oxide Fuel Cells) is the development of suitable interconnect materials.,"Metallic Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Performance of Reactive Element Oxide Coating During 10, 20 and 30 Months Exposure",10.1007/s11085-012-9308-4
2,15866,"Chromia-forming alloys and especially ferritic stainless steels, like Crofer22APU, are considered to be among the most promising candidate materials as interconnects in SOFC stacks.","Metallic Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Performance of Reactive Element Oxide Coating During 10, 20 and 30 Months Exposure",10.1007/s11085-012-9308-4
3,15866,"However, the performance of chromia-forming materials can be limited by the low electronic conductivity of the oxide scale (high ASR-area specific resistance-value).","Metallic Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Performance of Reactive Element Oxide Coating During 10, 20 and 30 Months Exposure",10.1007/s11085-012-9308-4
4,15866,"Such degradation is unacceptable regarding the long-term operation (> 40,000 h).","Metallic Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Performance of Reactive Element Oxide Coating During 10, 20 and 30 Months Exposure",10.1007/s11085-012-9308-4
5,15866,"A previous study demonstrated that in air, the addition of a nanometric reactive element oxide (La2O3) layer applied by Metal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition (MOCVD) drastically improved both corrosion rate and electrical properties of Crofer22APU for 100 h at 800 degrees C. In the present study, coating performances were checked after 10 months (7,700 h), 20 months (15,400 h) and 30 months (23,100 h) exposure in air at 800 degrees C.","Metallic Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Performance of Reactive Element Oxide Coating During 10, 20 and 30 Months Exposure",10.1007/s11085-012-9308-4
6,15866,"The corrosion products were characterized by SEM, EDX and XRD.","Metallic Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Performance of Reactive Element Oxide Coating During 10, 20 and 30 Months Exposure",10.1007/s11085-012-9308-4

8,15866,"The study demonstrates that the Crofer22APU alloy has a good oxidation resistance after 23,100 h in air but this alloy has a high ASR value equal to 0.410 Omega cm(2).","Metallic Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Performance of Reactive Element Oxide Coating During 10, 20 and 30 Months Exposure",10.1007/s11085-012-9308-4
9,15866,The coatings composed of thin reactive element oxides made of La2O3 or Y2O3 resulted in an important improvement in the high temperature oxidation resistance; the ASR values are equal to 0.180 and 0.160 Omega cm(2) respectively.,"Metallic Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell: Performance of Reactive Element Oxide Coating During 10, 20 and 30 Months Exposure",10.1007/s11085-012-9308-4
