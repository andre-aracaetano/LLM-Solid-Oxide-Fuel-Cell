However, they are vulnerable to degradation by chromium deposition and poisoning by volatile Cr species from chromia-forming metallic interconnects.",Highly active and stable (La0.24Sr0.16Ba0.6)(Co0.5Fe0.44Nb0.06)O3-δ (LSBCFN) cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells prepared by a novel mixing synthesis method,10.1039/c3ta10230k
3,15095,"Here we report the development of a new mixed ionic and electronic conductor, lanthanum strontium barium cobalt ferrite niobium perovskite, (La0.24Sr0.16Ba0.6)(Co0.5Fe0.44Nb0.06)O3-delta (LSBCFN), prepared by a novel direct mixing synthesis of (La0.6Sr0.4)(Co0.2Fe0.8)O3-delta (LSCF) and Ba(Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1)O3-delta (BSCN).",Highly active and stable (La0.24Sr0.16Ba0.6)(Co0.5Fe0.44Nb0.06)O3-δ (LSBCFN) cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells prepared by a novel mixing synthesis method,10.1039/c3ta10230k
4,15095,"The electrical conductivity of LSBCFN is 124 S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C, which is significantly higher than 11 S cm(-1) measured on BSCN at the same temperature.",Highly active and stable (La0.24Sr0.16Ba0.6)(Co0.5Fe0.44Nb0.06)O3-δ (LSBCFN) cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells prepared by a novel mixing synthesis method,10.1039/c3ta10230k
5,15095,"The new LSBCFN cathode which combines the structural stability and activity of BCFN and the high conductivity of LSCF not only exhibits better electrochemical activity for the O-2 reduction reaction than either LSCF or BCFN in the temperature range of 600-900 degrees C, but most importantly, it shows excellent stability and tolerance toward chromium deposition and poisoning under SOFC operation conditions.",Highly active and stable (La0.24Sr0.16Ba0.6)(Co0.5Fe0.44Nb0.06)O3-δ (LSBCFN) cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells prepared by a novel mixing synthesis method,10.1039/c3ta10230k
