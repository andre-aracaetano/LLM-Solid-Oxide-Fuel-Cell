1,16367,This work focuses on the role of CO and CO2 usually present in syngas generated by biomass gasification when they are flowed in a Ni-YSZ-based SOPC.,"Effects of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane on nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cells performance for direct coupling with a gasifier",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.06.009
2,16367,"Polarization, power versus intensity and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements are performed and the theoretical aspect is enhanced with comparison with values of the Nernst potentials of the two H2O/H-2 and CO2/CO couples.","Effects of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane on nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cells performance for direct coupling with a gasifier",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.06.009
3,16367,"The CO as electrochemical reactant is clearly highlighted, and also compared to H2.","Effects of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane on nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cells performance for direct coupling with a gasifier",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.06.009
4,16367,"Indeed, power density values of 460 mW cm(-2) and 540 mW cm(-2) are obtained at 750 C when the cell is fueled with a 50% CO-50% N-2 mixture and a 50% H-2-50% N-2 mixture respectively, and the use of CO leads to higher power density values when the percentage of the fuel in the Fuel/N-2 mixture is lower than 27%, the use of higher amounts of CO inducing a large increase of the total resistance of the cell.","Effects of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane on nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cells performance for direct coupling with a gasifier",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.06.009
5,16367,The impact on the efficiency of the cell of the presence of CH4 is also examined using electrochemical measurements.,"Effects of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane on nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cells performance for direct coupling with a gasifier",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.06.009
6,16367,"Finally, power density values of 502 mW cm(-2) is obtained at 750 degrees C when the cell is fueled with a 50% N2-20% CO-17% H-2-10% CO2-3% CH4 mixture which appears to a be a realistic composition corresponding to the exhaust of the gasifier.","Effects of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane on nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia-based solid oxide fuel cells performance for direct coupling with a gasifier",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.06.009
