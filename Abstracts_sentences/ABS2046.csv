1,2046,"The disadvantages of cobalt-based and barium-based perovskite oxides in solid oxide fuel cells are the large thermal expansion coefficients, low structure stability, and poor CO2 tolerance, although they have excellent oxygen reduction activity.",Evaluation of La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-δ + Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as a potential cobalt-free composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.085
2,2046,"To reduce the impact of these detrimental effects, cobalt-free La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-delta (LBFZ) was investigated as a potentially promising cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Evaluation of La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-δ + Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as a potential cobalt-free composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.085
3,2046,"The TEC of LBFZ is 18.9 x 10(-6) IC-1, which is lower than other widely used cobalt-containing cathode materials.",Evaluation of La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-δ + Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as a potential cobalt-free composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.085
4,2046,The electrode performance can be further improved by incorporating Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) to form a composite.,Evaluation of La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-δ + Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as a potential cobalt-free composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.085
5,2046,"Systematic study suggests that composite cathodes containing 40 wt% SDC exhibited the best electrode performance (R-p = 0.12 Omega cm(2)) when they were fired at 1050 degrees C for 2 h, correlating to a peak power density of 839 mW cm(-2) based on the single cell with the configuration NiO-YSZ/YSZ/SDC/LBFZ-SDC at 700 degrees C. Also, LBFZ SDC demonstrated excellent chemical stability upon exposure to 1% CO2 at 550 C for 100 h, and the electrochemical testing also demonstrated better CO2 tolerance than Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta(BSCF).",Evaluation of La0.4Ba0.6Fe0.8Zn0.2O3-δ + Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as a potential cobalt-free composite cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.085
