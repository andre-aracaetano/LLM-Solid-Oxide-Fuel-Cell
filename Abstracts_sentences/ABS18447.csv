1,18447,Thermal expansion of several compositions of Sr and Mg-doped LaGaO(3) including an A-site deficient composition (La(0.9)Sr(0.1))(0.98)(Ga(0.8)Mg(0.2))O(2.821) were measured in the temperature range from 298 to 1273 K.,Thermal expansion of doped lanthanum gallates,10.1007/s12034-010-0062-4
2,18447,"The effect of doping on thermal expansion was studied by varying the composition at one site of the perovskite structure (either A or B), while keeping the composition at the other site invariant.",Thermal expansion of doped lanthanum gallates,10.1007/s12034-010-0062-4
3,18447,"Thermal expansion varied nonlinearly with temperature and exhibited an inflexion between 550 and 620 K, probably related to the change in crystal structure from orthorhombic to rhombohedral.",Thermal expansion of doped lanthanum gallates,10.1007/s12034-010-0062-4
4,18447,"The dependence of average thermal expansion coefficient (alpha (av)) on the dopant concentration on either A or B site of the perovskite structure was found to be linear, when the composition at the other site was kept constant.",Thermal expansion of doped lanthanum gallates,10.1007/s12034-010-0062-4
5,18447,Mg doping on the B-site had a greater effect on the average thermal expansion coefficient than Sr doping on the A-site.,Thermal expansion of doped lanthanum gallates,10.1007/s12034-010-0062-4
6,18447,Cation deficiency at the A-site decreases thermal expansion when compositions at both sites are held constant.,Thermal expansion of doped lanthanum gallates,10.1007/s12034-010-0062-4
