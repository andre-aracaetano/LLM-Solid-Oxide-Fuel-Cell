1,3583,Infiltration of ceramicmaterials into a pre-formed ceramic scaffold is an effective way of fabricating a solid oxide fuel cell with nano-structured ceramic electrodes by avoiding detrimental interfacial reactions through low-temperature processing for achieving high performance using hydrogen as well as a carbonaceous fuel.,Fabrication and characterisation of a large-area solid oxide fuel cell based on dual tape cast YSZ electrode skeleton supported YSZ electrolytes with vanadate and ferrite perovskite-impregnated anodes and cathodes,10.1039/c4ta04789c
2,3583,"However, there are significant concerns about the applicability of this method because of the difficulty in fabricating a large-area gas-tight but thin electrolyte between two highly porous ceramic and the multiple repetitions of infiltration process.",Fabrication and characterisation of a large-area solid oxide fuel cell based on dual tape cast YSZ electrode skeleton supported YSZ electrolytes with vanadate and ferrite perovskite-impregnated anodes and cathodes,10.1039/c4ta04789c
3,3583,"Here, a large-area (5 cm by 5 cm) scaffold with a thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte sandwiched between two identical porous structures is prepared by tape casting and co-firing, and then solution precursors are impregnated into the porous scaffolds to prepare nano-structured La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSF) and La0.7Sr0.3VO3-delta (LSVred).",Fabrication and characterisation of a large-area solid oxide fuel cell based on dual tape cast YSZ electrode skeleton supported YSZ electrolytes with vanadate and ferrite perovskite-impregnated anodes and cathodes,10.1039/c4ta04789c
4,3583,The thus prepared solid oxide fuel cell with 10 wt% ceria + 1 wt% Pd as a catalyst in anodes shows a peak power of 489 mW cm(-2) (similar to 6 W per cell) at 800 degrees C using H-2 as a fuel and air as an oxidant.,Fabrication and characterisation of a large-area solid oxide fuel cell based on dual tape cast YSZ electrode skeleton supported YSZ electrolytes with vanadate and ferrite perovskite-impregnated anodes and cathodes,10.1039/c4ta04789c
5,3583,"This large-area fuel cell retained the integrity of the thin electrolyte and high performance after the reducing-oxidation cycle at 900 degrees C, showing superiority over the conventional Ni(O)-YSZ based support.",Fabrication and characterisation of a large-area solid oxide fuel cell based on dual tape cast YSZ electrode skeleton supported YSZ electrolytes with vanadate and ferrite perovskite-impregnated anodes and cathodes,10.1039/c4ta04789c
