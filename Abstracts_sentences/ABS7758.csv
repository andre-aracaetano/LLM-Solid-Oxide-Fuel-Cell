1,7758,SmBaCo2O5+delta (SBCO) was synthesized as a cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC) via the EDTA-glycine process.,Synthesis and Properties of SmBaCo2O5+δ Cathode Material via EDTA-Glycine Process,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201310142
2,7758,"The structure and properties of the material were measured by thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), four-probe DC method, and AC impedance spectroscopy.",Synthesis and Properties of SmBaCo2O5+δ Cathode Material via EDTA-Glycine Process,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201310142
3,7758,The results indicated that a stable perovskite phase was formed after the initial powder was calcined at 850 degrees C for 5 h. The obtained powders revealed fine particles with good dispersion and homogeneous size distribution.,Synthesis and Properties of SmBaCo2O5+δ Cathode Material via EDTA-Glycine Process,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201310142
4,7758,SBCO had excellent high temperature chemical compatibility with Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte.,Synthesis and Properties of SmBaCo2O5+δ Cathode Material via EDTA-Glycine Process,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201310142
5,7758,The electrical conductivities of the SBCO reached 668-382 S.cm(-1) in the temperature range 500-800 degrees C. A symmetric half cell with SDC as electrolyte and SBCO as electrode was characterized by good three-phase interface bonding and high cathode catalytic activity.,Synthesis and Properties of SmBaCo2O5+δ Cathode Material via EDTA-Glycine Process,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201310142
6,7758,"A polarization resistance of 0.0688 Omega.cm(2) was achieved at 750 degrees C for the SBCO, far below that of SBCO synthesized by solid state reaction method (SSR), with an activation energy (E-a) of 122.21 kJ.mol(-1).",Synthesis and Properties of SmBaCo2O5+δ Cathode Material via EDTA-Glycine Process,10.3866/PKU.WHXB201310142
