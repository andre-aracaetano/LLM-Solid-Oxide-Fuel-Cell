4,18312,The observed temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient is attributed to changes in carrier concentration caused by a thermally excited charge disproportionation of Co3+ ions and by the ionic compensation of induced oxygen vacancies.,STRUCTURE AND ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES OF LA1-XSRXCO1-YFEYO3 .1.
