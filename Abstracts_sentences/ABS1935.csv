1,1935,"A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack can exhibit both anodic and cathodic leakages, i.e. a fuel leak from the anode side and an air leak from the cathode side of the stack, respectively.",Analysis of Leakages in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack in a System Environment,10.1002/fuce.201400072
2,1935,This study describes the results of an in-situ leakage analysis conducted for a planar SOFC stack during 2000 hours of operation in an actual system environment.,Analysis of Leakages in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack in a System Environment,10.1002/fuce.201400072
3,1935,The leakages are quantified experimentally at nominal system operating conditions by conducting composition analysis and flow metering of gases for both fuel and air subsystems.,Analysis of Leakages in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack in a System Environment,10.1002/fuce.201400072
4,1935,"Based on the calculated atomic hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the fuel and air gases, it is found that the fuel leakages are mostly selective by nature: the leaking fuel gas does not have the same composition as the fuel system gas.",Analysis of Leakages in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack in a System Environment,10.1002/fuce.201400072
5,1935,"A simple diffusive leakage model, based on the leakage being driven by concentration differences weighted by diffusion coefficients, is applied to quantify the amount of leakages.",Analysis of Leakages in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack in a System Environment,10.1002/fuce.201400072
6,1935,The leakage model provides a good correspondence with the experimental results of the gas analysis.,Analysis of Leakages in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stack in a System Environment,10.1002/fuce.201400072
