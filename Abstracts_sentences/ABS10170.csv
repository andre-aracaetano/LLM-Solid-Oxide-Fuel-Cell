1,10170,"In this paper, the electrochemical reactivity between La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF) and cobalt-coated stainless steel was investigated in air at 700 degrees C. The cobalt electrodeposition onto ferritic stainless steel has an important role in decreasing of chromium poisoning on the cathode side of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",The electrochemical behavior of cobalt electrodeposits on 430 stainless steel as solid oxide fuel cell interconnect,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2013.07.007
