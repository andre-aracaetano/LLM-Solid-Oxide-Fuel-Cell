1,2109,"Porous Crofer Fe22Cr stainless steel supports for tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) were developed and tested successfully under hydrogen fuel with 50% humidification at 800 degrees C. Corrosion resistance and stability as a function of operation lifetime, porosity and thermal cycling were studied through the investigation of oxide growth and microstructure.",High temperature stability of porous metal substrates under highly humidified hydrogen conditions for metal supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.06.014
2,2109,Oxidation reactions followed subparabolic kinetics and substrates with porosities between 25 and 40% showed long-term stability over 4500 h and suitable properties for metal-supported SOFC technology application.,High temperature stability of porous metal substrates under highly humidified hydrogen conditions for metal supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.06.014
