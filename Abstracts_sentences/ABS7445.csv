1,7445,We here report the energy storage characteristics of a new all ceramic iron-air redox battery comprising of a reversible solid oxide fuel cell as the charger/discharger and a Fe-FeOx redox couple as the chemical storage bed.,A novel intermediate-temperature all ceramic iron-air redox battery: the effect of current density and cycle duration,10.1039/c4ra02768j
2,7445,The effects of current density and cycle duration on specific energy and round trip efficiency of the new battery have been systematically studied at 650 degrees C and 550 degrees C.,A novel intermediate-temperature all ceramic iron-air redox battery: the effect of current density and cycle duration,10.1039/c4ra02768j
