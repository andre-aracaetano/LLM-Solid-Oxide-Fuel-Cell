1,8487,A novel anode with microchanneled structure has been prepared by a mesh-assisted phase-inversion process.,Microchanneled anode supports of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2014.02.013
2,8487,"The uniform microchannels templated by mesh apertures cross the anode, and act as efficient gas diffusion pathways, with one end open and the other end stopped with a less porous layer, which functions as a support for thin electrolyte film and provides anode reaction sites.",Microchanneled anode supports of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2014.02.013
3,8487,"The solid oxide fuel cell supported on the microchanneled anode produced the maximum power densities of 550, 772 and 936 mW/cm(2) at 750,800 and 850 C respectively, and no concentration polarization was found, suggesting there is efficient gas diffusion within the anode support.",Microchanneled anode supports of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2014.02.013
