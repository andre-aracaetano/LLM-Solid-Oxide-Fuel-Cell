1,14954,"H2S in biogas was removed by sludge-loaded biofiltration, rendering the biogas suitable for catalytic reforming into a mixture of CO and H-2 syngas that was then applied for the generation of electricity using a solid oxide fuel cell or for the chemical synthesis of methanol.",On-site Removal of H2S from Biogas Produced by Food Waste using an Aerobic Sludge Biofilter for Steam Reforming Processing,10.1007/s12257-009-0134-8
2,14954,"The biogas was anaerobically produced in a 2 m(3) bioreactor at 35 degrees C for 2 years using restaurant food waste from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), and the concentration of H2S in the biogas ranged from 612 to 1,500 ppmv (Avg. 1,060 ppmv).",On-site Removal of H2S from Biogas Produced by Food Waste using an Aerobic Sludge Biofilter for Steam Reforming Processing,10.1007/s12257-009-0134-8
