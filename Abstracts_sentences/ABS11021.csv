2,11021,The D-50 of LDC45 powders prepared via co-precipitation method was 1.36 mu m and the particles size distribution of LDC45 powders was rather narrow.,Improved electrochemical performance of NiO-La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ composite anodes for IT-SOFC through the introduction of a La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ interlayer,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.03.060
3,11021,"Applying the results of an extensive investigation of screen-printing technique, a sufficiently thin and sufficiently dense LDC45 interlayer was fabricated via screen-printing using a PTFE scraper, a screen of 260 mesh, and CIVIC as the paste binder.",Improved electrochemical performance of NiO-La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ composite anodes for IT-SOFC through the introduction of a La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ interlayer,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.03.060
4,11021,"Additionally, an investigation of the sintering process revealed that the properties of the LDC45 interlayer can be significantly improved by sintering at 1400 degrees C for 3 h. The EIS results demonstrated that the implementation of the LDC45 interlayer in SOFC electrodes decreased their ohmic resistance and accelerated the charge transfer process.",Improved electrochemical performance of NiO-La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ composite anodes for IT-SOFC through the introduction of a La0.45Ce0.55O2-δ interlayer,10.1016/j.electacta.2008.03.060
