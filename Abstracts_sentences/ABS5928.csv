1,5928,"NiCu/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CGO) catalysts were prepared by different techniques with the aim to develop a bifunctional catalyst, characterized both by catalytic and anodic properties for integrated biogas SOFC process.",Ceria-gadolinia supported NiCu catalyst: A suitable system for dry reforming of biogas to feed a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC),10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.03.028
2,5928,"Catalytic measurements have been performed in CO2 reforming of CH4, using a fixed bed reactor at a reaction temperature ranging from 650 to 800 degrees C. Results revealed that NiCu/CGO system is a promising catalyst for the conversion of biogas mixtures at temperature suitable to be used in low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC).",Ceria-gadolinia supported NiCu catalyst: A suitable system for dry reforming of biogas to feed a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC),10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.03.028
3,5928,"Characterization data clearly demonstrated that NiCu alloy forms by reduction of NiCuOx mixed oxide patches, while catalytic testing showed carbon-free operation at 800 degrees C (GHSV = 6600 h(-1)) when CO2-rich biogas mixtures are used.",Ceria-gadolinia supported NiCu catalyst: A suitable system for dry reforming of biogas to feed a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC),10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.03.028
4,5928,"By a thermodynamic evaluation of the different reaction kinetics, the poor efficiency of the catalyst in promoting the carbon gasification by CO2 reaction has been assessed.",Ceria-gadolinia supported NiCu catalyst: A suitable system for dry reforming of biogas to feed a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC),10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.03.028
5,5928,Characterization of spent catalysts shed light both on the reasons of deactivation phenomena occurring with time over the catalysts and on the deactivation kinetics under the adopted experimental conditions.,Ceria-gadolinia supported NiCu catalyst: A suitable system for dry reforming of biogas to feed a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC),10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.03.028
