1,14053,"Porous Ni-YSZ (YSZ-yttria-stabilized zirconia) films were fabricated by reactive co-sputtering of a Ni and a Zr-Y target, followed by sequentially annealing in air at 900 degrees C and in vacuum at 800 degrees C.",Thin porous Ni-YSZ films as anodes for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpcs.2008.07.005
2,14053,The Ni-YSZ films comprised small grains and pores that were tens of nanometers in size.,Thin porous Ni-YSZ films as anodes for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpcs.2008.07.005
3,14053,The porous Ni-YSZ films were used as an anode on one side of a YSZ electrolyte disc and a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thick film was used as a cathode on the other side of the disc to form solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Thin porous Ni-YSZ films as anodes for a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpcs.2008.07.005
