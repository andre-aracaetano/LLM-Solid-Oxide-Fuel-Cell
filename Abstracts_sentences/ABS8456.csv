1,8456,"Direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells (DC-SOFCs) with a liquid Sb anode have many advantages over other types of SOFCs; however, their electrolyte faces corrosion by liquid Sb and Sb2O3.",Hot corrosion of yttria-stabilized zirconia by liquid antimony and antimony oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226764
2,8456,"To evaluate the tolerance of the electrolyte to the liquid Sb and Sb2O3, 8 mol.% Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte (YSZ) discs are prepared and evaluated at 750 degrees C for up to 100 h in both chemical and electrochemical modes, simulating DC-SOFC operating conditions.",Hot corrosion of yttria-stabilized zirconia by liquid antimony and antimony oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226764
3,8456,"In the chemical mode, the corrosion by liquid Sb causes Y dissolution from YSZ into the liquid Sb, while the YSZ experiences a phase transformation from cubic to tetragonal structure and grain boundary crack on the surface.",Hot corrosion of yttria-stabilized zirconia by liquid antimony and antimony oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226764
4,8456,"Liquid Sb2O3 is more corrosive than liquid Sb, penetrating additionally the grain boundaries into a depth around 15 mu m. In the electrochemical mode, liquid Sb is separated from YSZ by a layer (similar to 150 mu m) of liquid Sb2O3 formed during cell operation.",Hot corrosion of yttria-stabilized zirconia by liquid antimony and antimony oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226764
5,8456,"The liquid Sb2O3 layer so formed corrodes YSZ in the same way as in the chemical mode, but the corrosion is intensified with the presence of a current, resulting in a top porous layer (similar to 15 mu m) on YSZ surface with a grain boundary penetration layer (similar to 100 mu m) underneath.",Hot corrosion of yttria-stabilized zirconia by liquid antimony and antimony oxide,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226764
