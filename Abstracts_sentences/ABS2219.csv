1,2219,"We have examined the use of Cu-Ni alloys as anodes for the direct oxidation of methane in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) at 1073 K. Ceramic-metal (cermet) composites having alloy compositions of 0, 10, 20, 50 and 100% Ni were exposed to dry methane at 1073 K for 1.5 h to demonstrate that carbon formation is greatly suppressed on the Cu-Ni alloys compared to that of pure Ni.",Cu-Ni cermet anodes for direct oxidation of methane in solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1445170
2,2219,Increased reduction temperatures also reduced the carbon formation on the alloys.,Cu-Ni cermet anodes for direct oxidation of methane in solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1445170
3,2219,The performance of a fuel cell made with a Cu(80%)-Ni(20%) cermet was tested in dry methane for 500 h and showed a significant increase in power density with time.,Cu-Ni cermet anodes for direct oxidation of methane in solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1445170
4,2219,Impedance spectra of similar fuel cells suggest that small carbon deposits are formed with time and that the increase in performance is due to enhanced electronic conductivity in the anode.,Cu-Ni cermet anodes for direct oxidation of methane in solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1445170
