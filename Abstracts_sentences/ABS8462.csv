3,8462,"BNF exists as a multiphase structure composed of a monoclinic phase and a cubic phase at room temperature, and then undergoes a phase transformation to a cubic structure starting at similar to 400 degrees C, which is maintained at temperatures up to 900 degrees C during a thermal cycle between room temperature and 900 degrees C; while it retains the cubic perovskite lattice structure on cooling from 900 degrees C to room temperature.",BaNb0.05Fe0.95O3-δ as a new oxygen reduction electrocatalyst for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta11447c
