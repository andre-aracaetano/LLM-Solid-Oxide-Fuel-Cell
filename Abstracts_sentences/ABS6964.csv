2,6964,Accurate fault diagnostic and prognostic technologies are two important tools to improve SOFC durability.,Fault diagnosis and prognostic of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.080
3,6964,"In literature, plenty of diagnosis techniques for SOFC systems have been successfully designed.",Fault diagnosis and prognostic of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.080
4,6964,"However, no literature studies SOFC fault prognosis approaches.",Fault diagnosis and prognostic of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.080
5,6964,"In this paper a unified fault diagnosis and prognosis strategy is presented to identify faults (anode poisoning, cathode humidification or normal) and predict the remaining useful life for SOFC systems.",Fault diagnosis and prognostic of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.080
6,6964,"Using a squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier, a diagnosis model is built to identify SOFC different types of faults.",Fault diagnosis and prognostic of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.080
