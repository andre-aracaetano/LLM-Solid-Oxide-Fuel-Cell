1,19259,The potential of interactive layers of mixed-conducting oxides for improving the performance of air electrodes of solid oxide cells in the intermediate-temperature range is demonstrated.,Enhanced Intermediate-Temperature Electrochemical Performance of Air Electrodes for Solid Oxide Cells with Spray-Pyrolyzed Active Layers,10.1021/acsami.9b22966
2,19259,"Active layers of Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CGO), Ce0.8Pr0.2O2-delta (CPO), and SrFe0.9Mo0.1O3-delta (SFM) with thickness in the range 200-400 nm are deposited on CGO-based electrolyte by spray pyrolysis, followed by deposition of a SFM/CGO composite air electrode by painting.",Enhanced Intermediate-Temperature Electrochemical Performance of Air Electrodes for Solid Oxide Cells with Spray-Pyrolyzed Active Layers,10.1021/acsami.9b22966
3,19259,"The morphologies and phase composition of the active layers are examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy microanalysis.",Enhanced Intermediate-Temperature Electrochemical Performance of Air Electrodes for Solid Oxide Cells with Spray-Pyrolyzed Active Layers,10.1021/acsami.9b22966
4,19259,"The electrochemical performance of the electrolyte-electrode assemblies is determined by impedance spectroscopy in the range 600-800 degrees C. Significant improvements in the performance of the electrode process and the geometrically normalized ohmic conductance are observed for the assembly with a CPO active layer with mixed-oxide-ionic-electronic conductivity, especially in the low-temperature range, attributable to extension of the surface path of the electrochemical reactions.",Enhanced Intermediate-Temperature Electrochemical Performance of Air Electrodes for Solid Oxide Cells with Spray-Pyrolyzed Active Layers,10.1021/acsami.9b22966
5,19259,"The CGO intermediate layer also improves performance but to a lesser degree, most likely due to better ionic-current collection in comparison to the assemblies with either SFM as the active layer or no active layer.",Enhanced Intermediate-Temperature Electrochemical Performance of Air Electrodes for Solid Oxide Cells with Spray-Pyrolyzed Active Layers,10.1021/acsami.9b22966
