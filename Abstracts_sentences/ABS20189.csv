8,20189,"As it was revealed by the peaks observed in the mass spectra (m/z = 43, 58, 27, 42, 15), the weight losses in the temperature range (60-194 degrees C, 194-277 degrees C, 277-350 degrees C) can be attributed to the evolvement of acetone.",Thermal decomposition study by DTA-TG-MS of cerium[III] acetylacetonate used as ceria thin film precursor,
9,20189,"The last stage, in the temperature range from 350 degrees C to 720 degrees C, is attributed to the acetic ion and carbon dioxide evolvement, as it was suggested by the MS peaks at m/z values (45, 43, 15) and m/z=44, respectively.",Thermal decomposition study by DTA-TG-MS of cerium[III] acetylacetonate used as ceria thin film precursor,
