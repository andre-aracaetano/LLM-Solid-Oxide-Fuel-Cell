5,9596,The oxygen diffusivity in the oxide scale was also evaluated by the stable isotope oxygen (O-18(2)) diffusion in the scale.,Evaluation of Laves-phase forming Fe-Cr alloy for SOFC interconnects in reducing atmosphere,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.041
6,9596,The chemical diffusion coefficients of isotope oxygen in the oxide scale showed the smaller value for the Laves-phase forming alloy (D = 7.0 x 10(-13) cm(2) s(-1)) than that for SUS430 (D = 4.6 x 10(-12) cm(2) s(-1)) at 1073 K. A relatively high diffusivity of oxygen was estimated in the Mn-Cr spinel oxide on the top surface of oxide scales.,Evaluation of Laves-phase forming Fe-Cr alloy for SOFC interconnects in reducing atmosphere,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.041
