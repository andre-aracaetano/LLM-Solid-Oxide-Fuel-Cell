1,7784,"Metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells have several advantages, which could potentially increase the overall competitiveness of the technology, compared to their cermet-supported counterparts.",Development of Bi-layer Metal Substrate Architectures for Suspension Plasma Sprayed Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700187
2,7784,"However, surface imperfections and rapid oxidation of the metal supports at operating temperatures are factors that affect the electrochemical performance and durability of the cells.",Development of Bi-layer Metal Substrate Architectures for Suspension Plasma Sprayed Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700187
3,7784,"In this study, we have developed bi-layer metal supports consisting of a thin, finely structured top layer and a thicker, more coarsely structured bottom layer.",Development of Bi-layer Metal Substrate Architectures for Suspension Plasma Sprayed Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700187
4,7784,"The fine top layer has small surface pore sizes which facilitate the deposition of defect-free electrolyte layers, while the coarse layer provides greater open porosity and larger pore sizes to facilitate mass transport and to decrease the rate of oxidation.",Development of Bi-layer Metal Substrate Architectures for Suspension Plasma Sprayed Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700187
5,7784,"An open circuit voltage (OCV) as high as 1.105V at 750 degrees C in 3% humidified hydrogen is reported in this study, which deviates from the Nernst potential by only 5 mV. This result shows that the bi-layer support has the potential to minimize electrode and electrolyte defects, which are known to be detrimental to cell performance.",Development of Bi-layer Metal Substrate Architectures for Suspension Plasma Sprayed Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700187
6,7784,"In addition, the bi-layer supports show better oxidation resistance compared to benchmark finely-structured single-layer supports fabricated in this study for comparison.",Development of Bi-layer Metal Substrate Architectures for Suspension Plasma Sprayed Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700187
