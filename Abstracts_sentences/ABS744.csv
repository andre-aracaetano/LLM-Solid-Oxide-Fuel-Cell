1,744,"A theoretical model for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a bi-layer electrolyte is developed and analytical solutions of various important relationships, such as I V relationship, distribution of oxygen partial pressure in the bi-layer electrolyte, leakage current density etc. are obtained.",An analytical model for solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layer electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.084
2,744,"Based on the assumptions of constant ionic conductivity and reversible electrodes, the model takes into considerations of transports of both ions and electrons in the electrolyte.",An analytical model for solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layer electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.084
3,744,The modeling results are compared with both experimental data and results from other models in the literature and very good agreements are obtained.,An analytical model for solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layer electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.084
