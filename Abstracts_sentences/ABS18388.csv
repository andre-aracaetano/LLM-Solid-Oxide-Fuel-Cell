3,18388,"It was found that the substitution of the A-site cation La in La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-delta by Sm and especially by Ba leads to a strong enhancement of the surface exchange kinetics, whereas a variation of the Co/Fe ratio between 0 and 1 has only little effect on this quantity at temperatures around 750 S C. Furthermore, it has been studied how the electrochemical activation effect, i.e., the strong reduction of the surface exchange resistance after application of a large dc bias, depends on composition.",Quantitative comparison of mixed conducting SOFC cathode materials by means of thin film model electrodes,10.1149/1.2752974
