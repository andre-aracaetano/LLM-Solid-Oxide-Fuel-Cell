1,7500,The degradation mechanism of anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cells is investigated in the present work.,Degradation Mechanism of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell In Planar-Cell Channel-Type Setup,10.1002/fuce.201300005
2,7500,We fabricate a large-area (10cmx10cm) cell and carry out a long-term test with the assembly components.,Degradation Mechanism of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell In Planar-Cell Channel-Type Setup,10.1002/fuce.201300005
3,7500,"A constant current of approximate to 0.4Acm(-2) is applied to the cell for approximate to 3,100h, and the furnace temperature is controlled in the sequence 750-800-750 degrees C to investigate the effect of operating temperature and thermal cycling on the degradation rate.",Degradation Mechanism of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell In Planar-Cell Channel-Type Setup,10.1002/fuce.201300005
4,7500,Impedance spectra and current-voltage characteristics are measured during the operation in order to trace any increase in Ohmic and non-Ohmic resistance as a function of time.,Degradation Mechanism of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell In Planar-Cell Channel-Type Setup,10.1002/fuce.201300005
5,7500,"The degradation rate is rapid during the operation at the higher temperature of approximate to 800 degrees C compared to that during the operation at approximate to 750 degrees C. Even after cooling down to approximate to 750 degrees C, that rate is still accelerated.",Degradation Mechanism of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell In Planar-Cell Channel-Type Setup,10.1002/fuce.201300005
6,7500,The main contribution to the cell degradation is from an increase in the Ohmic resistance.,Degradation Mechanism of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell In Planar-Cell Channel-Type Setup,10.1002/fuce.201300005
7,7500,"Postmaterial analyses indicate that the cathode is delaminated at the electrolyte/cathode interface, which is attributed to the difference in thermal expansion coefficient (TEC).",Degradation Mechanism of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell In Planar-Cell Channel-Type Setup,10.1002/fuce.201300005
8,7500,"Thus, the present results emphasize the importance of matching the TEC between cell layers, especially under severe operating conditions such as long duration and complex thermal cycling.",Degradation Mechanism of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell In Planar-Cell Channel-Type Setup,10.1002/fuce.201300005
