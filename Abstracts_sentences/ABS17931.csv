1,17931,"By combination of supercritical drying route and coprecipitation synthesis method, ultrafine Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC20) nano-powders are successfully prepared using (NH4)(2)CO3 as the precipitant.",Low temperature fabrication of dense gadolinia-doped ceria electrolyte with enhanced electrical conductivity,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.182
2,17931,"The as-synthesized powder has a specific surface area of 113.4 m(2) g(-1) and an average crystalline size of similar to 6 nm after calcination at 400 degrees C, together with other favorable properties like high dispersibility, weak agglomeration and remarkable flowability.",Low temperature fabrication of dense gadolinia-doped ceria electrolyte with enhanced electrical conductivity,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.182
3,17931,"The powder shows high sintering activity, where the relative density reaches similar to 99.9% with an average grain size of similar to 100 nm after sintered at 900 degrees C for 4 h. Low temperature sintering not only suppresses grain growth but also improves electrical performance of the electrolyte.",Low temperature fabrication of dense gadolinia-doped ceria electrolyte with enhanced electrical conductivity,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.182
4,17931,"The sample sintered at 900 degrees C exhibits high electrical conductivity of 5.39 S m(-1) at 700 degrees C, which is superior to most of the reported ceria-based electrolyte.",Low temperature fabrication of dense gadolinia-doped ceria electrolyte with enhanced electrical conductivity,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.182
