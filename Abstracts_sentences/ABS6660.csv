1,6660,"A novel atomic layer deposition (ALD) process was developed for fabricating quaternary cobalt oxide (La1-xSrx)CoO3-delta thin films having the eye on future applications of such films in e.g. solid oxide fuel cell cathodes, oxygen separation membranes or thermocouples.","Atomic layer deposition of quaternary oxide (La,Sr)CoO3-δ thin films",10.1039/c5dt00436e
2,6660,"The deposition parameters and the conditions of a subsequent annealing step were systematically investigated, and using the thus optimized parameters the cation stoichiometry in the films could be accurately tuned.","Atomic layer deposition of quaternary oxide (La,Sr)CoO3-δ thin films",10.1039/c5dt00436e
3,6660,"The most detailed study was conducted for x = 0.7, i.e. the composition with the highest application potential within the (La1-xSrx)CoO3-delta system.","Atomic layer deposition of quaternary oxide (La,Sr)CoO3-δ thin films",10.1039/c5dt00436e
