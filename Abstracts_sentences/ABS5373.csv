1,5373,"Recent demonstrations of direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuels have stimulated an automotive interest in solid oxide fuel cells for reformerless auxiliary power units with high power density, high chemical-to-electrical efficiency, and low exhaust emissions.",Application of Fourier-based transforms to impedance spectra of small-diameter tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1372212
2,5373,"Furthermore, recent designs with small-diameter oxide tubes appear to be well-suited to accommodate repeated cycling under rapid changes in electrical load and in cell operating temperatures.",Application of Fourier-based transforms to impedance spectra of small-diameter tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1372212
3,5373,"To understand the limiting transient processes in these small-tube fuel cell designs, we applied an analysis approach which requires no a priori equivalent circuit model assumptions.",Application of Fourier-based transforms to impedance spectra of small-diameter tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1372212
4,5373,"This approach was applied to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data measured from such cells in the temperature range from 585 to 888 degreesC. In this way, the complex, overlapping arc EIS details (seen in Cole-Cole plots) were transformed in a network-model-independent way into a spectrum of relaxation times.",Application of Fourier-based transforms to impedance spectra of small-diameter tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1372212
5,5373,"We extended the deconvolution method to allow peak fitting and integration to calculate the resistances of individual processes within the cathode polarization, which becomes limiting in comparison to either anode or electrolyte at temperatures below about 700 degreesC. With the new results, the process with the highest apparent activation energy can be targeted to improve cathode development.",Application of Fourier-based transforms to impedance spectra of small-diameter tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.1372212
