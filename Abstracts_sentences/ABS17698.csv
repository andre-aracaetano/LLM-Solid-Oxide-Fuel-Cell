1,17698,The solid oxide cell (SOC) could play a vital role in energy storage when the share of intermittent electricity production is high.,Reactivating the Ni-YSZ electrode in solid oxide cells and stacks by infiltration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.01.021
2,17698,"However, large-scale commercialization of the technology is still hindered by the limited lifetime.",Reactivating the Ni-YSZ electrode in solid oxide cells and stacks by infiltration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.01.021
3,17698,"Here, we address this issue by examining the potential for repairing various failure and degradation mechanisms occurring in the fuel electrode, thereby extending the potential lifetime of a SOC system.",Reactivating the Ni-YSZ electrode in solid oxide cells and stacks by infiltration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.01.021
4,17698,We successfully infiltrated the nickel and yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet electrode in commercial cells with Gddoped ceria after operation.,Reactivating the Ni-YSZ electrode in solid oxide cells and stacks by infiltration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.01.021
5,17698,By this method we fully reactivated the fuel electrode after simulated reactant starvation and after carbon formation.,Reactivating the Ni-YSZ electrode in solid oxide cells and stacks by infiltration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.01.021
6,17698,"Furthermore, by infiltrating after 900 h of operation, the degradation of the fuel electrode was reduced by a factor of two over the course of 2300 h. Lastly, the scalability of the concept is demonstrated by reactivating an 8-cell stack based on a commercial design.",Reactivating the Ni-YSZ electrode in solid oxide cells and stacks by infiltration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.01.021
