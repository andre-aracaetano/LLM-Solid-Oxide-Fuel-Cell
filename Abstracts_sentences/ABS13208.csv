1,13208,"To improve the electrochemical performance of LSM-based anode-supported single cells, a systematic approach was taken for optimising processing and materials parameters.",Optimisation of processing and microstructural parameters of LSM cathodes to improve the electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.016
2,13208,"Four parameters were investigated in more detail: (1) the LSM/YSZ mass ratio of the cathode functional layer, (2) the grain size of LSM powder for the cathode current collector layer, (3) the thickness of the cathode functional layer and the cathode current collector layer, and (4) the influence of calcination of YSZ powder used for the cathode functional layer.",Optimisation of processing and microstructural parameters of LSM cathodes to improve the electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.016
3,13208,Results from electrochemical measurements performed between 700 and 900 degrees C with H-2 (3 vol.% H2O) as fuel gas and air as the oxidant showed that the performance was the highest using an LSM/YSZ mass ratio of 50/50.,Optimisation of processing and microstructural parameters of LSM cathodes to improve the electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.016
4,13208,A further increase of the electrochemical performance was obtained by increasing the grain size of the outer cathode current collector layer: the highest performance was achieved with non-ground LSM powder.,Optimisation of processing and microstructural parameters of LSM cathodes to improve the electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.016
5,13208,"In addition, it was found that the thickness of the cathode functional layer and cathode current collector layer also affects the electrochemical performance, whereas no obvious detrimental effects occurred with the different qualities of YSZ powder for the cathode functional layer.",Optimisation of processing and microstructural parameters of LSM cathodes to improve the electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.016
6,13208,"The highest performance, i.e. 1.50 +/- 0.05 A cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and 700 mV, was obtained with a cathode functional layer, characterised by an LSM/YSZ mass ratio of 50/50, a d(90) of the LSM powder of 1.0 mu m, non-calcined YSZ powder, and a thickness of about 30 mu m, and a cathode current collector layer, characterised by d(90) of the LSM powder of 26.0 mu m (non-ground), and a thickness of 50-60 mu m. Also interesting to note is that the use of non-ground LSM for the cathode current collector layer and non-calcined YSZ powder for the cathode functional layer obviously simplifies the production route of this type of fuel cell.",Optimisation of processing and microstructural parameters of LSM cathodes to improve the electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.016
