1,9887,Solid oxide fuel cells are suggested as potential devices for revolutionizing the way electric power is produced for stationary and mobile uses.,A doped cobaltite for enhanced SOFCs fed with dry biogas,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142927
2,9887,"While this technology has made significant progress since its first demonstration in the 1980s, certain issues still need to be resolved, primarily the flexibility in using fuels, especially those derived from biological sources.",A doped cobaltite for enhanced SOFCs fed with dry biogas,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142927
3,9887,"To address this issue, we proposed the use of a modified perovskite material, La1.5Sr1.5Co1.5Ni0.5O7 +/-delta (LSCN), which offers enhanced resistance to carbon cracking while preserving the existing manufacturing chain and electrical performance of commercial cells.",A doped cobaltite for enhanced SOFCs fed with dry biogas,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142927
4,9887,"A combination of physicochemical, morphological, and electrochemical experiments provided insight into the behaviour of LSCN.",A doped cobaltite for enhanced SOFCs fed with dry biogas,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142927
5,9887,Its key strengths included excellent performance (e.g. > 650 mW cm(-2)) and no significant carbon deposits on the anode and LSCN during 400-hour testing of a coated commercial cell.,A doped cobaltite for enhanced SOFCs fed with dry biogas,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142927
6,9887,The analysis of in-depth changes in the LSCN surface and bulk after thermochemical treatments indicated that this material can be seamlessly integrated with commercial cells.,A doped cobaltite for enhanced SOFCs fed with dry biogas,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142927
