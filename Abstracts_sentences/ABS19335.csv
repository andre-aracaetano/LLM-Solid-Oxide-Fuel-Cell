3,19335,"Here, a series of novel quadruple metal-doped bismuth vanadium system materials Bi2V1-4x(CuNiNbTi)(x)O5.5-delta (0 <= x <= 0.1) are prepared through a traditional solid state reaction method, aiming to enhance the phase and redox stability under reducing atmosphere.",Redox Stability and Electrical Properties of a Series of Novel Quadruple Dopant BIMEVOX: Bi2V1-4x(CuNiNbTi)xO5.5-δ,10.1002/pssa.202300915
4,19335,"The results reveal that multiple-metal-doping can stabilize the tetragonal phase of Bi2VO5.5 to room temperature and show good phase and structural stabilities under inert or high oxygen partial pressure atmospheres, as well as pure oxide ion conduction which is slightly lower than that of the parent material.",Redox Stability and Electrical Properties of a Series of Novel Quadruple Dopant BIMEVOX: Bi2V1-4x(CuNiNbTi)xO5.5-δ,10.1002/pssa.202300915
5,19335,"However, under a reducing environment, the Bi2V1-4x(CuNiNbTi)(x)O5.5-delta materials would still undergo a phase decomposition, yielding elemental bismuth impurity, and introducing strong electronic conduction.",Redox Stability and Electrical Properties of a Series of Novel Quadruple Dopant BIMEVOX: Bi2V1-4x(CuNiNbTi)xO5.5-δ,10.1002/pssa.202300915
