1,14442,Ni0.9Fe0.1 alloy-supported solid oxide fuel cells with NiTiO3 (NTO) infiltrated into the cell support from 0 to 4 wt.% are prepared and investigated for CH4 steam reforming activity and electrochemical performance.,Enhanced methane steam reforming activity and electrochemical performance of Ni0.9Fe0.1-supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated Ni-TiO2 particles,10.1038/srep35981
2,14442,The infiltrated NiTiO3 is reduced to TiO2-supported Ni particles in H-2 at 650 degrees C.,Enhanced methane steam reforming activity and electrochemical performance of Ni0.9Fe0.1-supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated Ni-TiO2 particles,10.1038/srep35981
3,14442,"The reforming activity of the Ni0.9Fe0.1-support is increased by the presence of the TiO2-supported Ni particles; 3 wt.% is the optimal value of the added NTO, corresponding to the highest reforming activity, resistance to carbon deposition and electrochemical performance of the cell.",Enhanced methane steam reforming activity and electrochemical performance of Ni0.9Fe0.1-supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated Ni-TiO2 particles,10.1038/srep35981
4,14442,"Fueled wet CH4 at 100 mL min(-1), the cell with 3 wt.% of NTO demonstrates a peak power density of 1.20 W cm(-2) and a high limiting current density of 2.83 A cm(-2) at 650 degrees C. It performs steadily for 96 h at 0.4 A cm(-2) without the presence of deposited carbon in the Ni0.9Fe0.1-support and functional anode.",Enhanced methane steam reforming activity and electrochemical performance of Ni0.9Fe0.1-supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated Ni-TiO2 particles,10.1038/srep35981
5,14442,Five polarization processes are identified by deconvoluting and data-fitting the electrochemical impedance spectra of the cells under the testing conditions; and the addition of TiO2-supported Ni particles into the Ni0.9Fe0.1-support reduces the polarization resistance of the processes ascribed to CH4 steam reforming and gas diffusion in the Ni0.9Fe0.1-support and functional anode.,Enhanced methane steam reforming activity and electrochemical performance of Ni0.9Fe0.1-supported solid oxide fuel cells with infiltrated Ni-TiO2 particles,10.1038/srep35981
