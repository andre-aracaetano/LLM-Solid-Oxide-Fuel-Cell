1,1973,A single chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) micro-stack with three series-wound cells has been prepared and operated in methane-oxygen-nitrogen mixture.,Effects of the single chamber SOFC stack configuration on the performance of the single cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.05.028
2,1973,A maximum power output of 282 mW was generated at the furnace temperature of 800 degrees C. A mutual effect was found among the three cells.,Effects of the single chamber SOFC stack configuration on the performance of the single cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.05.028
3,1973,Cell 2 between Cell 1 and Cell 3 produced a maximum power density of 215 mWcm(-2) which was higher than other cells.,Effects of the single chamber SOFC stack configuration on the performance of the single cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.05.028
