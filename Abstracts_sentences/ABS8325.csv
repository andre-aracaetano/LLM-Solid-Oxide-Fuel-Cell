1,8325,"Analytical transmission electron microscopy, in particular with the combination of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), has been performed to investigate the microstructure and microchemistry of the interfacial region between the cathode (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3, LSCF) and the electrolyte (Gd-doped ceria, GDC).",Two types of diffusions at the cathode/electrolyte interface in IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jssc.2011.07.021
2,8325,"Two types of diffusions, mutual diffusion between cathode and electrolyte as well as the diffusion along grain boundaries, have been clarified.",Two types of diffusions at the cathode/electrolyte interface in IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jssc.2011.07.021
3,8325,These diffusions suggest that the chemical stability of LSCF and GDC are not as good as previously reported.,Two types of diffusions at the cathode/electrolyte interface in IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jssc.2011.07.021
4,8325,The results are more noteworthy if we take into consideration the fact that such interdiffusions occur even during the sintering process of cell preparation.,Two types of diffusions at the cathode/electrolyte interface in IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jssc.2011.07.021
