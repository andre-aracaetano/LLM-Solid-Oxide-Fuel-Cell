4,4423,"This study focuses mainly on the hydrogen production zone which assesses four different system designs in two different operation modes of the facility: Car as Power Plant (CaPP) mode, corresponding to the open period of the facility which uses fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) as energy and water producers while parked; and Pump mode, corresponding to the closed period which compresses the hydrogen and pumps to the vehicle's fuel tank.",Fuel cell electric vehicle as a power plant and SOFC as a natural gas reformer: An exergy analysis of different system designs,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.107
5,4423,These system designs differ by the reforming technology: the existing catalytic reformer (CR) and a solid oxide fuel cell operating as reformer (SOFCR); and the option of integrating a carbon capture and storage (CCS).,Fuel cell electric vehicle as a power plant and SOFC as a natural gas reformer: An exergy analysis of different system designs,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.107
6,4423,Results reveal that the SOFCR unit significantly reduces the exergy destruction resulting in an improvement of efficiency over 20% in SOFCR-based system designs compared to CR-based system designs in both operation modes.,Fuel cell electric vehicle as a power plant and SOFC as a natural gas reformer: An exergy analysis of different system designs,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.107
7,4423,"It also mitigates the reduction in system efficiency by integration of a CCS unit, achieving a value of 2% whereas, in CR-based systems, is 7-8%.",Fuel cell electric vehicle as a power plant and SOFC as a natural gas reformer: An exergy analysis of different system designs,10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.107
