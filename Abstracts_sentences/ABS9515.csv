1,9515,"The reduction of the operating temperatures of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has attracted global research attention and inspired considerable efforts toward the development of new materials for low-temperature (LT) operation, such as K2NiF4-type electrode La2NiO4 (LNO).",Built-in electric field-assisted heterostructure electrolyte based on K2NiF4-type La2NiO4 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-023-10812-0
2,9515,"In this study, to explore the ion-conducting capability of LNO as an SOFC electrolyte while simultaneously maintaining good catalytic activity, a p-n heterostructure composite was constructed by incorporating p-type LNO with n-type ZnO.",Built-in electric field-assisted heterostructure electrolyte based on K2NiF4-type La2NiO4 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-023-10812-0
3,9515,The as-prepared LNO-ZnO exhibited a bulk heterostructure with a favorable biphasic distribution and a number of heterointerface contacts.,Built-in electric field-assisted heterostructure electrolyte based on K2NiF4-type La2NiO4 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-023-10812-0
4,9515,"When the as-prepared LNO-ZnO was applied as the electrolyte layer in the SOFC, it exhibited a maximum fuel cell power density of 707 mW cm(-2) with an open-circuit voltage of 1.04 V at 550 & DEG;C, as well as considerable stability.",Built-in electric field-assisted heterostructure electrolyte based on K2NiF4-type La2NiO4 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-023-10812-0
5,9515,"According to further measurements, the energy band structures of the two semiconductors and the rectifying characteristics of the LNO-ZnO heterostructure were investigated.",Built-in electric field-assisted heterostructure electrolyte based on K2NiF4-type La2NiO4 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-023-10812-0
6,9515,The results revealed that the electrolyte functionality of LNO-ZnO is realized predominantly by the built-in electric field of the p-n heterojunction to transport ions while simultaneously blocking electrons.,Built-in electric field-assisted heterostructure electrolyte based on K2NiF4-type La2NiO4 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-023-10812-0
7,9515,Our results thus demonstrated that K2NiF4-type LNO can serve not only as an electrode but also as an electrolyte and suggested that the built-in electric field-assisted heterostructure is a feasible approach for developing LT-SOFC materials.,Built-in electric field-assisted heterostructure electrolyte based on K2NiF4-type La2NiO4 for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10854-023-10812-0
