1,1867,"Ln(0.5)Sr(0.5)Fe(0.8)Cu(0.2)O(3-delta) (LnSFC, Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd) perovskite oxide as a cobalt-free cathode was systematically evaluated for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC).","Cobalt-free perovskite Ln0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1007/s11581-019-03314-9
2,1867,"XRD results show that PrSFC presents the cubic structure, while NdSFC, SmSFC, and GdSFC present an orthorhombic structure.","Cobalt-free perovskite Ln0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1007/s11581-019-03314-9
3,1867,The conductivity of the four samples is in accordance with the GdSFC < SmSFC < NdSFC < PrSFC relationship.,"Cobalt-free perovskite Ln0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1007/s11581-019-03314-9
4,1867,AC impedance testing was performed using a symmetrical fuel cell of the structure LnSFC/Ce0.9Sm0.1O1.95(SDC)/LnSFC.,"Cobalt-free perovskite Ln0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1007/s11581-019-03314-9
5,1867,"The polarization resistance values of PrSFC, NdSFC, SmSFC, and GdSFC are 0.036, 0.089, 0.097, and 0.160 omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, respectively.","Cobalt-free perovskite Ln0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1007/s11581-019-03314-9
6,1867,"Then, SDC electrolyte-support single cell was fabricated and the power densities of PrSFC, NdSFC, SmSFC, and GdSFC cathodes were 364, 311, 254 and 104 mW cm(-2), respectively, at 800 degrees C.","Cobalt-free perovskite Ln0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1007/s11581-019-03314-9
7,1867,"Our preliminary experiment results show that LnSFC oxide meets the requirements of the electrode, and it can be a possible cathode for IT-SOFC.","Cobalt-free perovskite Ln0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1007/s11581-019-03314-9
