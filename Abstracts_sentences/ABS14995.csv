1,14995,Scandium stabilized zirconium (10ScSZ) thin ceramic films were deposited by e-beam evaporation of (ZrO2)(0.90)(Sc2O3)(0.10) micro powder (particle size 0.5 divided by 0.7 mu m).,Scandium stabilized zirconium thin films formation by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023
2,14995,The influence of deposition rate on formed thin films microstructure and electrical properties was studied.,Scandium stabilized zirconium thin films formation by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023
3,14995,10ScSZ thin films were deposited on two types of different substrates: optical quartz (SiO2) and Alloy-600 (Fe-Ni-Cr) substrates.,Scandium stabilized zirconium thin films formation by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023
4,14995,Deposition rate was changed from 2 to 16 angstrom/s to test its influence on thin film formation and its properties.,Scandium stabilized zirconium thin films formation by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023
5,14995,The microstructure of formed 10ScSZ thin ceramic films was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).,Scandium stabilized zirconium thin films formation by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023
6,14995,Electrical parameters of formed thin ceramics were investigated in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1.0 MHz (in temperature range from 473 to 873 K).,Scandium stabilized zirconium thin films formation by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023
7,14995,The ionic conductivity of the deposited electrolyte 10ScSZ thin films was determined by impedance spectroscopy.,Scandium stabilized zirconium thin films formation by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023
8,14995,It was determined that the deposition rate (in range from 2 to 16 angstrom/s) has influence on crystallite size.,Scandium stabilized zirconium thin films formation by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023
9,14995,It increases by increasing the deposition rate from 18.4 to 26.9 nm.,Scandium stabilized zirconium thin films formation by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023
10,14995,The XRD measurements show that the formed 10ScSZ thin films do not repeat the crystallographic phase of the initial evaporated powder material-it is changes from rhombohedra (initial powder) to cubic (the formed thin films).,Scandium stabilized zirconium thin films formation by e-beam technique,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023
