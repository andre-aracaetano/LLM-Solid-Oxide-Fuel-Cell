1,18672,"In this study, pure CeO2 and Ce0.85La0.10M0.05O2 (M: Sm3+, Gd3+, Dy3+) solid electrolytes were synthesized using the sol-gel method and sintered at 1350 degrees C for 12 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used for crystal structure characterization of the ceramic solid electrolytes.","Synthesis and characterization of CeLaMO2 (M: Sm, Gd Dy) compounds for solid ceramic electrolytes",10.2298/PAC2004314K
