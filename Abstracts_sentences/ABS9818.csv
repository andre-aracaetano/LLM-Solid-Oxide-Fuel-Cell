1,9818,Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9(SDC) powder was prepared with an oxalate coprecipitation route.,Sintering of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9,
2,9818,"SDC solid solutions were sintered at various temperatures ranging from 1100 similar to 1450 degrees C, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), density measurements, and electrical conductivity measurements.",Sintering of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9,
3,9818,The optimized processing parameters for densification were to uniaxially press the sample at 200 similar to 400 MPa and sinter it at 1350 similar to 1400 degrees C for 4 h. The density of the sintered p ellets was > 90% of the theoretical density; their soakage was < 0.5 %; and the average grain size was 1 similar to 2 mu m.,Sintering of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9,
4,9818,The conductivities of the typical sintered specimen were 0.0133 and 0.0211 S (.),Sintering of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9,
5,9818,"cm(-1) at 550 and 600 degrees C, respectively; Its activation energy for ionic conductivity was 0.62 eV.",Sintering of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9,
6,9818,The dense SDC bulk material could be used as the electrolyte layer of low temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Sintering of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9,
