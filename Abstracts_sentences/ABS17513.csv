1,17513,"A simulation model has been developed for the analysis of heat, flow and mass transfer coupled with the electrochemical reactions and current collection of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) located in a double-tube type testing device.",CFD Analysis of a Tubular-Type Testing Unit for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE164
2,17513,"The simulation model was used to examine the influence of the current collection conditions and gas flow rates on the temperature and concentration fields in the device, and on the resulting cell performance.",CFD Analysis of a Tubular-Type Testing Unit for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE164
3,17513,The results indicated that the high flow rate of air induced a great temperature gradient near the cell surface.,CFD Analysis of a Tubular-Type Testing Unit for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE164
4,17513,"It was also pointed out that the low flow rate of fuel significantly lowered the cell performance through the concentration field, especially when the flow channel for fuel gas was not enough long.",CFD Analysis of a Tubular-Type Testing Unit for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE164
5,17513,The mathematical simulation of the phenomena occurring in the testing device as well as at the cell can be a strong measure for precise interpretation of the experimental results and the development of SOFCs.,CFD Analysis of a Tubular-Type Testing Unit for SOFC,10.1252/jcej.07WE164
