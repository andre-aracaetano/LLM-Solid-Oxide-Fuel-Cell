1,6896,The Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode functional layer in solid oxide fuel cells produced by pulsed laser-deposition was studied using three-dimensional tomography.,Three-dimensional microstructure of high-performance pulsed-laser deposited Ni-YSZ SOFC anodes,10.1039/c4cp02251c
2,6896,"Anode feature sizes of similar to 130 nm were quite small relative to typical anodes, but errors arising in imaging and segmentation were shown using a sensitivity analysis to be acceptable.",Three-dimensional microstructure of high-performance pulsed-laser deposited Ni-YSZ SOFC anodes,10.1039/c4cp02251c
3,6896,Electrochemical characterization showed that these cells achieved a relatively high maximum power density of 1.4 W cm(-2) with low cell resistance at an operating temperature of 600 degrees C.,Three-dimensional microstructure of high-performance pulsed-laser deposited Ni-YSZ SOFC anodes,10.1039/c4cp02251c
4,6896,"The tomographic data showed anode three-phase boundary density of similar to 56 mu m(-2), more than 10 times the value observed in conventional Ni-YSZ anodes.",Three-dimensional microstructure of high-performance pulsed-laser deposited Ni-YSZ SOFC anodes,10.1039/c4cp02251c
5,6896,"Anode polarization resistance values, predicted by combining the structural data and literature values of three-phase boundary resistance in an electrochemical model, were consistent with measured electrochemical impedance spectra, explaining the excellent intermediate-temperature performance of these cells.",Three-dimensional microstructure of high-performance pulsed-laser deposited Ni-YSZ SOFC anodes,10.1039/c4cp02251c
