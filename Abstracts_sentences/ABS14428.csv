1,14428,"Oxygen ion conductivity of doped ceria is observed to be two-three orders of magnitude higher than yttria stabilized zirconia, the most widely used solid electrolyte material at temperatures below 600 degrees C. Gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) is known to be one of the most promising solid electrolyte materials for operation of solid oxide fuel cells below 600 degrees C. To understand the atomic defect migration in GDC, we have used total energy calculations within the framework of density functional theory to follow oxygen vacancy migration in GDC.",A density functional study of defect migration in gadolinium doped ceria,10.1039/b924534k
2,14428,We report activation energies for various oxygen vacancy migration pathways in GDC.,A density functional study of defect migration in gadolinium doped ceria,10.1039/b924534k

4,14428,"Due to the comparable ionic radii of Gd3+ and host Ce4+ ions, the first nearest neighbor site with respect to the dopant cation is found to be the most favorable oxygen vacancy formation site.",A density functional study of defect migration in gadolinium doped ceria,10.1039/b924534k
