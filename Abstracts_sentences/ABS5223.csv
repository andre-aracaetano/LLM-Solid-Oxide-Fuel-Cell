1,5223,Solid oxide fuel cells produced at Riso National Laboratory have been tested as electrolysis cells by applying an external voltage.,Performance and durability of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1149/1.2216562
2,5223,Results on initial performance and durability of such reversible solid oxide cells at temperatures from 750 to 950 degrees C and current densities from -0.25 A/cm(2) to -0.50 A/cm(2) are reported.,Performance and durability of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1149/1.2216562
3,5223,"The full cells have an initial area specific resistance as low as 0.27 Omega cm(2) for electrolysis operation at 850 degrees C. During galvanostatic long-term electrolysis tests, the cells were observed to passivate mainly during the first similar to 100 h of electrolysis.",Performance and durability of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1149/1.2216562
4,5223,Cells that have been passivated during electrolysis tests can be partly activated again by operation in fuel cell mode or even at constant electrolysis conditions after several hundred hours of testing.,Performance and durability of solid oxide electrolysis cells,10.1149/1.2216562
