1,3762,"In this paper, six novel modified exergy relations are explored to determine the precise estimation of exergy destruction and to identify which component has the most improvement potential.","Energy, exergy, and sustainability a novel comparison of conventional gas turbine with fuel cell integrated hybrid power cycle",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.268
2,3762,"For this, three power generation cycles are considered, i.e., simple gas turbine (SGT), recuperated gas turbine (RGT), are compared with a novel hybrid system (SOFC-RGT: Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-RGT), which operates with fuel flexibility as well as enhanced work-output and thermal efficiency.","Energy, exergy, and sustainability a novel comparison of conventional gas turbine with fuel cell integrated hybrid power cycle",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.268
3,3762,"For energy, exergy, and sustainability studies, numerical modeling is conducted using MATLAB.","Energy, exergy, and sustainability a novel comparison of conventional gas turbine with fuel cell integrated hybrid power cycle",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.268
4,3762,"At rp = 4, TIT = 1250 K, an exclusive comparison has been made between proposed configurations based on ther-modynamic modeling and exergy-based sustainability index.","Energy, exergy, and sustainability a novel comparison of conventional gas turbine with fuel cell integrated hybrid power cycle",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.268
5,3762,"It is found that with the in-clusion of a recuperator and a fuel cell in the proposed cycles, the thermal and sustainability performance tend to increase significantly.","Energy, exergy, and sustainability a novel comparison of conventional gas turbine with fuel cell integrated hybrid power cycle",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.268
6,3762,"Whereas, exergy destruction increases but has minimal impact on comparing thermal performance and sustainability index.","Energy, exergy, and sustainability a novel comparison of conventional gas turbine with fuel cell integrated hybrid power cycle",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.268
7,3762,"In terms of sustainability, RGT is 30.76% more sustainable than SGT, while SOFC-GT is 63.39% more sustainable than RGT.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.","Energy, exergy, and sustainability a novel comparison of conventional gas turbine with fuel cell integrated hybrid power cycle",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.07.268
