1,10513,"Renewable energy projects are at the crux of all Chinese-funded investment in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for some 56% of all Chinese-led investments globally.","Sustainability and affordability of Chinese-funded renewable energy project in sub-Saharan Africa: a hybridized solid oxide fuel cell, temperature sensors, and lithium-based solar system approach",10.1007/s11356-023-27661-3
2,10513,"However, the prevailing problem is that about 568 million people were still without electricity access in 2019 across urban and rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa, which does not commensurate with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG7) of ensuring affordable and clean energy for all.","Sustainability and affordability of Chinese-funded renewable energy project in sub-Saharan Africa: a hybridized solid oxide fuel cell, temperature sensors, and lithium-based solar system approach",10.1007/s11356-023-27661-3
3,10513,"Previous studies have assessed and improved the efficiency of integrated power generation systems often combined on three levels, power plant, solar panel, and fuel cells, and integrated into national grids or off-grid systems for a sustainable supply of power.","Sustainability and affordability of Chinese-funded renewable energy project in sub-Saharan Africa: a hybridized solid oxide fuel cell, temperature sensors, and lithium-based solar system approach",10.1007/s11356-023-27661-3
4,10513,This study has included a lithium-ion storage system as a key component in a hybridized renewable energy generation system for the first time that has proven to be efficient and investment worthy.,"Sustainability and affordability of Chinese-funded renewable energy project in sub-Saharan Africa: a hybridized solid oxide fuel cell, temperature sensors, and lithium-based solar system approach",10.1007/s11356-023-27661-3
