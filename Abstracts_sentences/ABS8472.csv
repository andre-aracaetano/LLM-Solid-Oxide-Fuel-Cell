1,8472,"Lanthanum silicate (La9.33Si6O26) nanocrystals with apatite structure for high performance electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells have been successfully synthesized through a solvothermal process using lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)(3).6H(2)O), tetraethyl orthosilicate and acetic acid as staring materials.",Synthesis of Oxyapatite La9.33Si6O26 Nanocrystals via Solvothermal Method,
2,8472,"The as-synthesized lanthanum silicate nanocrystals were structurally characterized by XRD, TEM, HRTEM and FESEM.",Synthesis of Oxyapatite La9.33Si6O26 Nanocrystals via Solvothermal Method,
3,8472,"It has been found that the lanthanum silicate nanocrystals were well-dispersed, quasi-spherical in shape and had a narrow size distribution.",Synthesis of Oxyapatite La9.33Si6O26 Nanocrystals via Solvothermal Method,
4,8472,"Furthermore, the as-synthesized nanoparticles exhibited high sinterability and 95 % of theoretical density was obtained when they were sintered at 1200 degrees C for 6 h, about 450 degrees C lower than that derived from conventional solid-state reactions.",Synthesis of Oxyapatite La9.33Si6O26 Nanocrystals via Solvothermal Method,
