1,5095,"In the present study, (La, Sr)CoO3 material was screen-printed as a cathode and as current-collecting layers for planar-type low-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Structural optimization of (La, Sr)CoO3-based multilayered composite cathode for solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.108
2,5095,The compositional effects of the cathode functional and current-collecting layer on unit-cell performance were investigated using AC and DC polarization experiments.,"Structural optimization of (La, Sr)CoO3-based multilayered composite cathode for solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.108
3,5095,"Two different cathode (La, Sr)CoO3 materials, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 and La0.8Sr0.4CoO3, were examined, and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 was found to be more effective for increasing the electrocatalytic activation and collection efficiency of the current produced in the cathode reaction.","Structural optimization of (La, Sr)CoO3-based multilayered composite cathode for solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.108
4,5095,"Furthermore, a well-designed architecture for the current-collecting layer was very effective in increasing unit-cell performance by reducing the contact resistance between SOFC cathodes and interconnects.","Structural optimization of (La, Sr)CoO3-based multilayered composite cathode for solid-oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.108
