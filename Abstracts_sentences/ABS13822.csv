1,13822,"A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) offers an attractive route to convert chemical energy into electrical energy; however, its commercial application is often limited by the large mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) between the cathode and electrolyte and the insufficient activity of cathodes.",Rational Design of Two-Layer Fe-Doped PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O6-δ Double Perovskite Oxides for High-Performance Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c07564
2,13822,"Fe-doped PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O6-delta (PBCC) are promising cathode materials due to their high conductivity and excellent oxygen-reduction activity, in which Fe doping in PBCC can decrease the TEC to achieve better compatibility with the electrolyte, but excessive Fe will inhibit the oxygen kinetics.",Rational Design of Two-Layer Fe-Doped PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O6-δ Double Perovskite Oxides for High-Performance Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c07564
3,13822,"Here, we construct a two-layer PBCC cathode (TLC), which consists of a high Fe content layer with good thermal compatibility to electrolytes and a low Fe content layer with high ionic and electronic conductivity.",Rational Design of Two-Layer Fe-Doped PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O6-δ Double Perovskite Oxides for High-Performance Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c07564
4,13822,"Compared to homogeneous PBCC electrodes, the cell with TLC has a lower activation energy and a higher peak power density (1259.3 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C).",Rational Design of Two-Layer Fe-Doped PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O6-δ Double Perovskite Oxides for High-Performance Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c07564
5,13822,"Meanwhile, it exhibits admirable stability up to 200 h in constant potential mode (0.8 V), and importantly, no discernible degradation is observed in further stability tests in the constant current mode (444 mA cm(-2)) for 200 h.",Rational Design of Two-Layer Fe-Doped PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O6-δ Double Perovskite Oxides for High-Performance Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c07564
6,13822,The results reveal that the TLC based on double perovskite Fe-doping isostructural oxide is a promising candidate electrode for SOFC.,Rational Design of Two-Layer Fe-Doped PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O6-δ Double Perovskite Oxides for High-Performance Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c07564
