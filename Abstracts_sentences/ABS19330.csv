1,19330,The effect of (La0.85Sr0.15)(0.9)MnO3 (LSM) coating layer on the electric properties of the Fe-16Cr alloy (SUS430) and Fecralloy((R)) was examined in air.,Effect of slurry-coated LaSrMnO3 on the electrical property of Fe-Cr alloy for metallic interconnect of SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.032
2,19330,"The LSM layer was coated on the Fe-Cr alloys by slurry-dipping process and was sintered at 1200 degreesC. When the LSM-coated SUS 430 was sintered in Ar atmosphere with H-2, the phase separation of the LSM coating layer was observed, which increased the area specific resistance.",Effect of slurry-coated LaSrMnO3 on the electrical property of Fe-Cr alloy for metallic interconnect of SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.032
3,19330,The decomposed LSM phase changed to a stable phase with increasing the holding time at 750 degreesC in air.,Effect of slurry-coated LaSrMnO3 on the electrical property of Fe-Cr alloy for metallic interconnect of SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.032
4,19330,"When the LSM-coated SUS430 was heat-treated in air at 1000 degreesC after the sintering, the stable LSM-coated SUS 430 showed a low area-specific resistance (ASR) and maintained almost a constant value for 2600 h.",Effect of slurry-coated LaSrMnO3 on the electrical property of Fe-Cr alloy for metallic interconnect of SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.032
5,19330,The area specific resistances of the LSM-coated Fe-Cr alloys depend on the interfacial oxide layer formed between LSM and alloys.,Effect of slurry-coated LaSrMnO3 on the electrical property of Fe-Cr alloy for metallic interconnect of SOFC,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.07.032
