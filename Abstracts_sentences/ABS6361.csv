1,6361,The conventional Ni-Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92 anode in solid oxide fuel cells fueled with hydrocarbon fuels is prone to suffer from carbon deposition.,Nanoengineering modification of Ni-YSZ anode using in-situ solvothermal process in solid oxide fuel cells with internally reformed fuel,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.141986
2,6361,"In this work, we employed an in-situ solvothermal method to decorate the Ni-Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92 anode with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95-delta nanoparticles to improve its resistance to carbon deposition and thus improve the electrochemical performance of the cell.",Nanoengineering modification of Ni-YSZ anode using in-situ solvothermal process in solid oxide fuel cells with internally reformed fuel,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.141986
3,6361,This method generates small Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95-delta particles and at the same time does not block the gas diffusion channels.,Nanoengineering modification of Ni-YSZ anode using in-situ solvothermal process in solid oxide fuel cells with internally reformed fuel,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.141986
4,6361,"The Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95-delta-decorated anode showed enhanced long-term stability in methane with no significant performance degradation after 700 at 750 degrees C, whereas an untreated Ni-Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92 anode only worked for less than 8 h under the same conditions.",Nanoengineering modification of Ni-YSZ anode using in-situ solvothermal process in solid oxide fuel cells with internally reformed fuel,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.141986
5,6361,The addition of Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95-delta nanoparticles was found to enhance internal reforming reactions of methane by the distribution of relaxation times technique.,Nanoengineering modification of Ni-YSZ anode using in-situ solvothermal process in solid oxide fuel cells with internally reformed fuel,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.141986
