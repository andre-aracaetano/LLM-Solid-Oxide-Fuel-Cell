5,5712,"Among all of compositions, the Eu0.8Ca0.2BaCo2O5+delta sample exhibits the best catalytic ORR activity, as evidenced by a low area-specific resistance of 0.028 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. A single cell with the Eu0.8Ca0.2BaCo2O5+delta cathode delivers a maximum power density of 1210 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, and can be steadily operated over a period of 100 hat a constant voltage of 0.5 V. These results demonstrate their promising application as cathode candidates for IT-SOFCs.",Positive effects of calcium-doping on the cathode performance of layered perovskite Eu1-xCaxBaCo2O5+δ for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.06.143
