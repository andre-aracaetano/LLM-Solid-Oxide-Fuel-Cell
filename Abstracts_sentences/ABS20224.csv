1,20224,"In this work, the synthesis and the structural, morphological and electrical characterization of Ce1-xSmxO2-delta solid solution, with x = 0, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30 mol, are reported.","Structural, morphological and electrical characterization of ceria-based nanostructured thin films obtained by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis",10.1016/j.bsecv.2018.06.004
2,20224,"Nanocrystalline, homogeneous, and adherent samarium doped cerium oxide thin films were deposited onto glass (Pyrex (R)) substrates by a simple and cost effective ultrasonic spray pyrolysis system, at a low substrate temperature of 450 degrees C and further annealing treatment at 500 degrees C for 2 h. For all the samples, X-ray diffraction results showed the formation of single phase and well crystalline thin films, with cubic fluorite type structure.","Structural, morphological and electrical characterization of ceria-based nanostructured thin films obtained by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis",10.1016/j.bsecv.2018.06.004
3,20224,Scanning electron microscopy analyses showed homogeneous surfaces for all the samples; from SEM micrographs crystallite sizes were found to be in the range 23-37 nm.,"Structural, morphological and electrical characterization of ceria-based nanostructured thin films obtained by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis",10.1016/j.bsecv.2018.06.004
4,20224,"From atomic force microscopy, surface roughness in the range of 20-95 nm was measured and the formation of smooth films with an average grain size of 45 nm was observed.","Structural, morphological and electrical characterization of ceria-based nanostructured thin films obtained by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis",10.1016/j.bsecv.2018.06.004
5,20224,"For the best sample in the solid solution, high oxygen ion conductivity of 1.71 x 10(-1) S cm(-1), at 450 degrees C, was determined by impedance spectroscopy, with an activation energy of 0.93 eV. Results suggest that these films may have a potential application as electrolytes in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, IT-SOFC.","Structural, morphological and electrical characterization of ceria-based nanostructured thin films obtained by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis",10.1016/j.bsecv.2018.06.004
