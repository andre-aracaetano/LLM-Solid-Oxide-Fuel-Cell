1,12064,"Gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) nanocubes with highly reactive {001) facets were synthesized as an anode material for solid-oxide fuel cells by organic-ligand-assisted hydrothermal treatment with a water-soluble amino acid, 6-amino hexanoic acid (AHA).",High-performance Ni nanocomposite anode fabricated from Gd-doped ceria nanocubes for low-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.03.007
2,12064,An aerosol technique was applied to fabricate a NiO-GDC nanocube composite with water as a green solvent.,High-performance Ni nanocomposite anode fabricated from Gd-doped ceria nanocubes for low-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.03.007
3,12064,"The NiO-GDC nanocube composite was easily sintered even at a temperature of 1100 degrees C, while the conventional NiO-GDC composite covered with the most stable {1 1 1) facets was sintered at 1300 degrees C. Sintering at such a low temperature inhibited undesirable coarsening of NiO and GDC particles, resulting in an enlarged, triple-phase boundary (TPB).",High-performance Ni nanocomposite anode fabricated from Gd-doped ceria nanocubes for low-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.03.007
4,12064,The NiO-GDC nanocube composite anode with the enlarged TPB exhibited a rather low area specific resistance of 0.14 Omega cm(2) compared with the conventional NiO-GDC composite anode's resistance of 0.58 Omega cm(2) when operated at 600 degrees C.
