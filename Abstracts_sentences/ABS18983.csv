1,18983,We present and discuss the results of ab initio DFT plane-wave supercell calculations of the atomic and molecular oxygen adsorption and diffusion on the LaMnO3 (001) surface which serves as a model material for a cathode of solid oxide fuel cells.,Adsorption of atomic and molecular oxygen on the LaMnO3(001) surface:: ab initio supercell calculations and thermodynamics,10.1039/b804378g
2,18983,The dissociative adsorption of O-2 molecules from the gas phase is energetically favorable on surface Mn ions even on a defect-free surface.,Adsorption of atomic and molecular oxygen on the LaMnO3(001) surface:: ab initio supercell calculations and thermodynamics,10.1039/b804378g
3,18983,"The surface migration energy for adsorbed O ions is found to be quite high, 2.0 eV.",Adsorption of atomic and molecular oxygen on the LaMnO3(001) surface:: ab initio supercell calculations and thermodynamics,10.1039/b804378g
4,18983,We predict that the adsorbed O atoms could penetrate the electrode first plane when much more mobile surface oxygen vacancies (migration energy of 0.69 eV) approach the O ions strongly bound to the surface Mn ions.,Adsorption of atomic and molecular oxygen on the LaMnO3(001) surface:: ab initio supercell calculations and thermodynamics,10.1039/b804378g
5,18983,The formation of the O vacancy near the O atom adsorbed atop surface Mn ion leads to an increase of the O-Mn binding energy by 0.74 eV whereas the drop of this adsorbed O atom into a vacancy possesses no energy barrier.,Adsorption of atomic and molecular oxygen on the LaMnO3(001) surface:: ab initio supercell calculations and thermodynamics,10.1039/b804378g
6,18983,Ab initio thermodynamics predicts that at typical SOFC operation temperatures (similar to 1200 K) the MnO2 (001) surface with adsorbed O atoms is the most stable in a very wide range of oxygen gas pressures (above 10(-2) atm).,Adsorption of atomic and molecular oxygen on the LaMnO3(001) surface:: ab initio supercell calculations and thermodynamics,10.1039/b804378g
