5,14508,One important finding is that the CH4 assisting is effective in lowering the equilibrium potential of SOEC thus greatly reduces the electrical power consumption for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis.,Modeling of CH4-assisted SOEC for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.026

7,14508,The CH4-assisted SOFEC can generate electrical power and syngas simultaneously at a low current density of less than 600 Am-2 and at 1123 K.,Modeling of CH4-assisted SOEC for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.026
8,14508,"In addition, different from conventional SOEC, whose performance weakly depends on the anode gas flow rate, the CH4-assisted SOFEC performance is sensitive to the anode gas flow rate (i.g. peak current density is achieved at an anode flow rate of 70 SCCM at 1073 K).",Modeling of CH4-assisted SOEC for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.026
