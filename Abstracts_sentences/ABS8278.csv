3,8278,Experimental characterization of symmetrical button cells through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates an electrode polarization resistance R-p = 3.9 omega cm(2) at 940 K and R-p = 10.9 omega cm(2) at 890 K.,Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of Electrospun La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Nanorod Cathodes for Intermediate Temperature - Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201800205
4,8278,"The impedance results, measured from 890 K up to 1,200 K, show that the depressed Gerischer behavior is not an intrinsic feature of the electrode, since it appears only at certain well defined temperatures, and then it tends to disappear for other operating temperatures.",Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of Electrospun La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Nanorod Cathodes for Intermediate Temperature - Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201800205

7,8278,"The latter circuit allows to assess separately the impedance contribution of the electrode bulk, associated to the Gerischer element, and of the electrode/electrolyte interface, associated to the RQ element.",Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of Electrospun La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Nanorod Cathodes for Intermediate Temperature - Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201800205
8,8278,"Both the related polarization resistances are larger with the electrospun LSCF 3-D random nanorod electrode, rather than with an electrospun LSCF electrode with unbroken nanofibers laying neatly in-plane over the electrolyte.",Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of Electrospun La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Nanorod Cathodes for Intermediate Temperature - Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201800205
