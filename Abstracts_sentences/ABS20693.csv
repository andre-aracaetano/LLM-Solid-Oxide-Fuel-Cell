1,20693,Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) are high-temperature electrolysers (HTEs) which use ceramic electrolytes characterized by high protonic conductivity.,Characterization and testing of glass-ceramic sealants for protonic ceramic electrolysis cells applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.240
2,20693,"Compared with other HTEs (e.g., solid oxide electrolysis cells, SOECs), PCEC devices work at considerably lower temperatures (i.e., 350-600 degrees C compared with 700900 degrees C of SOEC).",Characterization and testing of glass-ceramic sealants for protonic ceramic electrolysis cells applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.240
3,20693,"Nowadays, studies related to PCEC have been confined to the lab scale, with only a few attempts to scale up this technology.",Characterization and testing of glass-ceramic sealants for protonic ceramic electrolysis cells applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.240
4,20693,A single repeating unit (SRU) or a stack of large area PCEC cells is still a technological challenge and the formulation of appropriate sealants to join ceramic cells and metallic interconnects is necessary to fulfil this task.,Characterization and testing of glass-ceramic sealants for protonic ceramic electrolysis cells applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.240
5,20693,"In this study, three compositions of Si-based glass-ceramic (two Na-rich and one Ba-rich) have been chemically and thermomechanically tested with materials for PCEC electrolyte (Ba(Ce,Zr)1-yMyO3-delta) and a ferritic stainless steel interconnect (FSS, AISI441).",Characterization and testing of glass-ceramic sealants for protonic ceramic electrolysis cells applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.240
6,20693,"Afterwards, the joined sample were characterized using SEM-EDX and XRD.",Characterization and testing of glass-ceramic sealants for protonic ceramic electrolysis cells applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.240
7,20693,"One of the studied compositions, a Si-based glass-ceramic containing also Na and Zr, showed promising results.",Characterization and testing of glass-ceramic sealants for protonic ceramic electrolysis cells applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.240
8,20693,The results of the microstructural analyses highlighted excellent compatibility with both the BCZY72 electrolyte and the AISI441 stainless steel after joining and ageing of 1000 h at 600 degrees C in static air.,Characterization and testing of glass-ceramic sealants for protonic ceramic electrolysis cells applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.240
9,20693,"Moreover, this glass-ceramic system has been joined with AISI441 steel and characterized at 600 degrees C with the application of a voltage and different atmospheres.",Characterization and testing of glass-ceramic sealants for protonic ceramic electrolysis cells applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.240
10,20693,Good compatibility of the glass-ceramic with the AISI441 was highlighted by the microstructural characterization also in these conditions.,Characterization and testing of glass-ceramic sealants for protonic ceramic electrolysis cells applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.240
