3,6464,The relative contents of cubic and hexagonal phases are significantly correlated with the zirconium content (x).,Rational design of the self-assembled BaCo1-xZrxO3-δ (x=0.8-0.2) nanocomposites as the promising low/intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.11.005
4,6464,"Therein, BaCo1-xZrxO3-delta nanocomposites exhibit relatively low content differences among pemvskite phases when x = 0.4 (cubic/hexagonal = 62:38) and x = 0.2 (hexagonal/cubic = 69:31) nanocomposites, which can form more extensive heteminterfaces for promoting oxygen adsorption, dissociation and reduction reaction.",Rational design of the self-assembled BaCo1-xZrxO3-δ (x=0.8-0.2) nanocomposites as the promising low/intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.11.005
5,6464,"When further applied as cathode, the cell with BaCo1-xZrxO3-delta nanocomposites achieve 2265-598 mW cm(-2) (800-600 degrees C) when x = 0.2 as a promising IT-SOFC cathode, and 315-148 mW cm(-2) (550-500 degrees C) when x = 0.4 as a promising LT-SOFC cathode.",Rational design of the self-assembled BaCo1-xZrxO3-δ (x=0.8-0.2) nanocomposites as the promising low/intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.11.005
