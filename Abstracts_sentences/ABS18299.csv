1,18299,"FeRu alloy (FRA) nanoparticles surface decorated Ruddlesden-Popper type layer perovskite PrSrFe1-xRuxO4+delta (RP-PSFeRu) was prepared by in-situ reduction of the cubic (Pr0.5Sr0.5)(0.9)-Fe0.9Ru0.1O3-delta (P-PSFeRu) in H-2 at 800 degrees C. When used as the SOFC anode material, it has excellent catalytic activity for H-2 and hydrocarbon fuels.",In-situ exsolved FeRu alloy nanoparticles on Ruddlesden-Popper oxides for direct hydrocarbon fuel solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.242
2,18299,"The La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta-electrolyte supported SOFC single cell with RP-PSFeRu-FRA-GDC composite anode can deliver a maximum power density of 0.75 and 0.50 W cm(-2) in wet H-2 and C3H8 at 800 degrees C, respectively.",In-situ exsolved FeRu alloy nanoparticles on Ruddlesden-Popper oxides for direct hydrocarbon fuel solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.242
3,18299,"Furthermore, the single cell shows a stability outputs at a constant current load of 0.5 A cm(-2) in wet H-2 and 0.15 A cm(-2) in wet C3H8 fuels, indicating an exceptional stability and cooking resistance.",In-situ exsolved FeRu alloy nanoparticles on Ruddlesden-Popper oxides for direct hydrocarbon fuel solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.242
