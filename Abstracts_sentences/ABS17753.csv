4,17753,"In the case studies, the impact of air and fuel inlet temperatures, steam reforming, and operation voltages on thermal stresses were studied.",Analysis of Residual and Operational Thermal Stresses in a Planar SOFC,10.1115/1.4025051
5,17753,Weibull statistics were used for the prediction of failure probabilities and design considerations.,Analysis of Residual and Operational Thermal Stresses in a Planar SOFC,10.1115/1.4025051
6,17753,"Base case geometry for the electrolyte-supported cell was 50, 150, and 50 mu m for anode, electrolyte, and cathode thicknesses, respectively, and for the anode-supported cell 1000, 20, and 50 mu m, respectively.",Analysis of Residual and Operational Thermal Stresses in a Planar SOFC,10.1115/1.4025051
7,17753,"Analysis of residual stresses showed that, compared with the anode-supported cell, the electrolyte-supported cell experienced considerably higher stress levels in the anode and cathode due to the thick electrolyte, while the stress levels in the electrolyte were lower.",Analysis of Residual and Operational Thermal Stresses in a Planar SOFC,10.1115/1.4025051
8,17753,"For the anode-supported cell, maximum stress levels were 57, -12, and -678 MPa in the anode, cathode, and electrolyte, respectively, with negative values indicating compressive and positive values, tensile stresses.",Analysis of Residual and Operational Thermal Stresses in a Planar SOFC,10.1115/1.4025051

10,17753,"With a failure probability of 1E-6 and an electrolyte thickness of 10 mu m, the minimum allowable anode thickness was estimated to be 1000 mu m. For an electrolyte-supported cell, optimal thicknesses of electrolyte and anode were considered to be 100 and 100 mu m, respectively, while the thickness of the cathode showed low impact.",Analysis of Residual and Operational Thermal Stresses in a Planar SOFC,10.1115/1.4025051
11,17753,"During operation, the stress levels were reduced considerably, since high operating temperatures reduce the temperature difference to the sintering temperature (1250 degrees C).",Analysis of Residual and Operational Thermal Stresses in a Planar SOFC,10.1115/1.4025051
12,17753,"Concerning the presence of methane in the fuel and the effect of steam reforming, small amounts of methane-as low as 10% of molar mass-were found to induce a cooling effect with correspondingly high gradients.",Analysis of Residual and Operational Thermal Stresses in a Planar SOFC,10.1115/1.4025051
13,17753,"With 45% methane in the fuel, the tensile stress level in the anode was about 130 MPa; the impact of thermal gradients was considered to be 40 MPa and the cooling effect also 40 MPa.",Analysis of Residual and Operational Thermal Stresses in a Planar SOFC,10.1115/1.4025051
