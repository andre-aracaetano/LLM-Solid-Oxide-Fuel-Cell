1,9174,"The operation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) using a reformed fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) mixture a biodiesel-like fuel, has been successfully demonstrated.",Operation of a solid oxide fuel cell on a reformed FAME mixture,10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.09.024
2,9174,This project had two main aspects: 1) determining the fuel reforming activity of a pyrochlore catalyst deposited onto a monolith; and 2) operating a SOFC on reformed fuel gas.,Operation of a solid oxide fuel cell on a reformed FAME mixture,10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.09.024
3,9174,"Prior to integrated testing, parametric reforming studies of the FAME mixture were conducted using both Rh/gamma-Al2O3 and Rh-substituted pyrochlore catalyst powders to determine the operating conditions to maximize syngas selectivity.",Operation of a solid oxide fuel cell on a reformed FAME mixture,10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.09.024
4,9174,"Using the same pyrochlore catalyst as in the parametric studies, a monolith reformer converted 0.5 cm(3) min(-1) of the FAME mixture into mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas).",Operation of a solid oxide fuel cell on a reformed FAME mixture,10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.09.024
5,9174,The syngas generated in the reformer was sent to an anode supported SOFC (H.C. Starck Ceramics GmbH & Co.),Operation of a solid oxide fuel cell on a reformed FAME mixture,10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.09.024
6,9174,The SOFC operated on 98% H-2/2% H2O for baseline testing before and after switching to the reformed FAME mixture for 100 h of operation.,Operation of a solid oxide fuel cell on a reformed FAME mixture,10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.09.024
7,9174,"The results presented here demonstrate that FAME mixture can be successfully reformed to power a SOFC, making them a viable fuel for a SOFC-based auxiliary power unit that is both greenhouse gas neutral and renewable.",Operation of a solid oxide fuel cell on a reformed FAME mixture,10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.09.024
