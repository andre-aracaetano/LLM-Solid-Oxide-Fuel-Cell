6,6386,"The cathode performance was improved by increasing the thickness of the composite electrode, and the polarisation resistance was decreased by extending the active triple phase boundary line through the application of a coarse layer of YSZ particles on the electrolyte surface before the composite cathode was applied.",Performance/structure correlation for composite SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02361-0
7,6386,"The performance proved to be sensitive to structural changes at 700 and 850 degrees C, whereas the effect of the structure was limited at 1000 degrees C. Values as low as 0.07 Omega cm(2) at 1000 degrees C and 0.50 Omega cm(2) at 850 degrees C were obtained in air at an overvoltage of -50 mV. Two simple models relating performance, percolation and triple phase boundary length were used for the interpretation of the results and for assessing the potential for further improvement of the performance by optimising the microstructure.",Performance/structure correlation for composite SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0378-7753(96)02361-0
