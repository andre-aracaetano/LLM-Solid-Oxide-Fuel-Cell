8,17086,The proposed strategy to pre-reduce the anode at elevated temperature (800 degrees C) and then decrease to lower operation temperature (750 degrees C) is demonstrated to effectively mitigate the Co-Fe nano particles coarsening and could presumably slow down the anode polarization resistance degradation.,Exploration of Co-Fe alloy precipitation and electrochemical behavior hysteresis using Lanthanum and Cobalt co- substituted SrFeO3- δ SOFC anode,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.05.019
