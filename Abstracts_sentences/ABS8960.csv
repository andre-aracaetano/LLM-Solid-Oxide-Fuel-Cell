1,8960,"Gd-doped ceria (GDC, Ce0.86Gd0.14O2 - delta) films are deposited on conductive substrates by RF-magnetron sputtering and their across-plane electrical conductivities (perpendicular to film plane) are measured as a function of temperature (300 <= T <= 400 degrees C) and oxygen partial pressure (Po-2) to assess the feasibility of their use as an electrolyte in miniaturized solid oxide fuel cells (micro-SOFCs).",Electrical conductivity of RF-sputtered Gd-doped ceria film measured in across-plane mode,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.07.006
2,8960,"The films deposited at relatively high T = 500 degrees C, deposited on either dense or porous substrate, show columnar grains with diameter 200 nm.",Electrical conductivity of RF-sputtered Gd-doped ceria film measured in across-plane mode,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.07.006
3,8960,The magnitude of conductivities in air is similar to those of pellet-form GDC.,Electrical conductivity of RF-sputtered Gd-doped ceria film measured in across-plane mode,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.07.006
4,8960,"However, the electronic conductivities of GDC films in low Po-2 are higher than that of pellet.",Electrical conductivity of RF-sputtered Gd-doped ceria film measured in across-plane mode,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.07.006
