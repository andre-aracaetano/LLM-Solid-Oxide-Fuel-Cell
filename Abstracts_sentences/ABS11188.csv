1,11188,"We study the microstructure, strength, and micromechanisms of fracture of 50%(ZrO2-4 mole% Y2O3-2 mole% CeO2-2 wt.% Al2O3)-50% (NiO-5 wt.% CuO) ceramics in the as-sintered state after one-time reduction and after the proposed procedure of cyclic redox treatment at 600 degrees C in Ar-5 vol.% H-2 and N-2-10 vol.% H-2-5 vol.% CO2 gas mixtures.",Elevation of Strength of the Anode-Substrate Material of Hydrogen and Hydrocarbon Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11003-023-00669-3
2,11188,It is shown that the elevated strength of cermets of this system is caused both by lowering of the Y2O3 content from traditional 8 mole % to 4 mole % and by about a twofold decrease in the grain sizes of the original nickel phase after redox cycling.,Elevation of Strength of the Anode-Substrate Material of Hydrogen and Hydrocarbon Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11003-023-00669-3
3,11188,The efficiency of this kind of treatment in improving the properties of the anode-substrate in hydrogen and hydrocarbon solid-oxide fuel cells is confirmed.,Elevation of Strength of the Anode-Substrate Material of Hydrogen and Hydrocarbon Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1007/s11003-023-00669-3
