1,2564,"Two-cell solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) short stacks with anode-facing-cathode (A-C), anode-facing-anode (A-A), and cathode-facing-cathode (C-C) configurations were fabricated and operated in single chamber conditions.","Effect of stack configurations on single chamber solid oxide fuel cell, anode-cathode, anode-anode, and cathode-cathode configuration",10.1016/j.electacta.2013.04.092
2,2564,"Fuel cells consist of NiO/Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) anode support, YSZ electrolyte, and (La, Sr)MnO3 (LSM) cathode.","Effect of stack configurations on single chamber solid oxide fuel cell, anode-cathode, anode-anode, and cathode-cathode configuration",10.1016/j.electacta.2013.04.092
3,2564,"The A-C stack obtains the highest OCV, the A-A stack obtains the highest actual temperature of stack, and the C-C stack obtains the highest power output in the same condition.","Effect of stack configurations on single chamber solid oxide fuel cell, anode-cathode, anode-anode, and cathode-cathode configuration",10.1016/j.electacta.2013.04.092
4,2564,A high flow rate was necessary for the A-A stack to obtain a good performance of stack due to the non-selectivity anode.,"Effect of stack configurations on single chamber solid oxide fuel cell, anode-cathode, anode-anode, and cathode-cathode configuration",10.1016/j.electacta.2013.04.092
5,2564,A low N-2 flow rate was propitious to the C-C stack: the peak power output was about 740 mW at N-2 flow rate of 100 cm(3) min(-1).,"Effect of stack configurations on single chamber solid oxide fuel cell, anode-cathode, anode-anode, and cathode-cathode configuration",10.1016/j.electacta.2013.04.092
