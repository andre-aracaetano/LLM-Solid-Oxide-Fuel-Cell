1,14723,The provision of cooling in a high-capacity trigeneration system is challenging due to the huge difference in the energy performance between heat-driven and electricity-driven cooling equipment.,Performance investigation of a SOFC-primed micro-combined hybrid cooling and power system in hot and humid regions,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116298
2,14723,"A micro-scale application can be more attractive, particularly when the recovered waste heat is solely used to drive a desiccant dehumidification cycle in a hybrid cooling system which offers better energy performance for use in hot and humid regions.",Performance investigation of a SOFC-primed micro-combined hybrid cooling and power system in hot and humid regions,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116298
3,14723,"Thus, given the availability of small-capacity solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), a SOFC-primed micro-combined hybrid cooling and power (mCHyCP) system was developed, and its performance in a 24-h restaurant in Singapore and in Hong Kong was analyzed.",Performance investigation of a SOFC-primed micro-combined hybrid cooling and power system in hot and humid regions,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116298
4,14723,"It was found that by performing year-round dynamic simulations using TRNSYS, a 10% reduction in the total electricity demand could be achieved in the tropical Singaporean climate compared to a 5% reduction in demand in the sub-tropical Hong Kong climate.",Performance investigation of a SOFC-primed micro-combined hybrid cooling and power system in hot and humid regions,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116298
5,14723,This reflected the effect of different seasons on the performance of the mCHyCP system.,Performance investigation of a SOFC-primed micro-combined hybrid cooling and power system in hot and humid regions,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116298
6,14723,"In addition, at most 24% and 38% reductions in the primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for both regions could be achieved, which indicated the potential of such system as a sustainable distributed energy source.",Performance investigation of a SOFC-primed micro-combined hybrid cooling and power system in hot and humid regions,10.1016/j.energy.2019.116298
