1,2159,The Finnish solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) project (FINSOFC) was initiated in 2002 as a five-year project.,Solid oxide fuel cell system development in VTT,10.1115/1.2756571
2,2159,It forms the core of the publicly funded SOFC research in Finland.,Solid oxide fuel cell system development in VTT,10.1115/1.2756571
3,2159,The purpose of the project is to support the industry in its development of SOFC systems and components and other possible SOFC-based business to be created in the future.,Solid oxide fuel cell system development in VTT,10.1115/1.2756571
4,2159,The project is coordinated by the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland in cooperation with universities and industrial enterprises.,Solid oxide fuel cell system development in VTT,10.1115/1.2756571
5,2159,The project is executed in close cooperation with several European partners both bilaterally and within Real-SOFC.,Solid oxide fuel cell system development in VTT,10.1115/1.2756571
6,2159,The focus is to construct and run a natural gas-fueled 5 kW(e) SOFC power plant demonstration connected to heat and electricity grids.,Solid oxide fuel cell system development in VTT,10.1115/1.2756571
7,2159,The power plant demonstration contains a stack and all BOP components from fuel processing to power conditioning and grid connections.,Solid oxide fuel cell system development in VTT,10.1115/1.2756571
8,2159,The aim is also to thoroughly understand the behavior of the system.,Solid oxide fuel cell system development in VTT,10.1115/1.2756571
9,2159,"The subprojects needed to do this are (i) fuel processing, (ii) testing of fuel cells and stacks, (iii) construction of a 5 kW, power station demonstration, and (iv) system modeling.",Solid oxide fuel cell system development in VTT,10.1115/1.2756571
