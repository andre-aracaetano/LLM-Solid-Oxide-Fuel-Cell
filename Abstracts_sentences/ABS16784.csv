3,16784,Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3-delta shows a p-type conductivity of 135 S/cm at 700 degrees C and in a partial pressure range from p(O-2)=20 kPa (air) to P(O-2)=2.10(-3) kPa (argon) which slightly decreases to 105 S/cm at p(O-2)=10(-14) kPa.,"Non-stoichiometry, thermal expansion and electrical properties of Pr1-xSrxMn1-yInyO3-δ perovskites",10.1016/j.ssi.2008.08.007
4,16784,The coefficient of thermal expansion does not vary between air and argon and is close to values of state of the art electrolytes.,"Non-stoichiometry, thermal expansion and electrical properties of Pr1-xSrxMn1-yInyO3-δ perovskites",10.1016/j.ssi.2008.08.007
5,16784,Therefore Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3-delta is a promising candidate for the application as the cathode material in a solid oxide fuel cell.,"Non-stoichiometry, thermal expansion and electrical properties of Pr1-xSrxMn1-yInyO3-δ perovskites",10.1016/j.ssi.2008.08.007
6,16784,Partial substitution of praseodymium by strontium increases the amount of oxygen vacancies and therefore increases the ionic conductivity when no multivalent B-site cation is involved.,"Non-stoichiometry, thermal expansion and electrical properties of Pr1-xSrxMn1-yInyO3-δ perovskites",10.1016/j.ssi.2008.08.007
7,16784,A solubility limit of x=0.2...0.3 exists for Pr1-xSrxMn1-yInyO3-delta (y=0.5; 1) perovskites.,"Non-stoichiometry, thermal expansion and electrical properties of Pr1-xSrxMn1-yInyO3-δ perovskites",10.1016/j.ssi.2008.08.007
8,16784,Exceeding this limit leads to the formation of a secondary phase which is identified as SrIn2O4.,"Non-stoichiometry, thermal expansion and electrical properties of Pr1-xSrxMn1-yInyO3-δ perovskites",10.1016/j.ssi.2008.08.007
9,16784,The ionic conductivity of Pr0.5Sr0.5InO3-delta reaches 3.10(-3) S/cm from air to p (O-2)=4.10(-16) kPa at 700 degrees C. Due to the incorporation of the insulating secondary phase SrIn2O4 the real ionic conductivity of the phase pure perovskite is expected to be higher.,"Non-stoichiometry, thermal expansion and electrical properties of Pr1-xSrxMn1-yInyO3-δ perovskites",10.1016/j.ssi.2008.08.007
10,16784,Therefore this material is promising for the application in high temperature electrochemical devices when oxygen ionic conductivity is required.,"Non-stoichiometry, thermal expansion and electrical properties of Pr1-xSrxMn1-yInyO3-δ perovskites",10.1016/j.ssi.2008.08.007
