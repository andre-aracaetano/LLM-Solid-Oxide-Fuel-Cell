4,5563,"An optimized composition of 10 mol% nickel doped samarium oxide (10NSO) as an electrolyte in the fuel cell has a high open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.09 V and a notable power output of 1080 mW cm(-2) at 520 degrees C. Further investigation revealed that the 10NSO displays a superior ionic conduction up to 0.26 S cm(-1) at 520 degrees C. Moreover, the cell demonstrates high stability up to 80 h. The high electrochemical property and good stability recommend that the NSO is a favorable candidate for symmetrical SOFC electrolyte.",Electrical properties of Ni-doped Sm2O3 electrolyte,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.08.057
