1,17162,Gadolina doped ceria (GDC) is a promising electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC).,Eco-Friendly Screen-Printing Inks of Gadolinia Doped Ceria,10.1115/1.3120271
2,17162,Dense layers of this material can be economically deposited by screen printing.,Eco-Friendly Screen-Printing Inks of Gadolinia Doped Ceria,10.1115/1.3120271
3,17162,"However, the inks for this technique generally use organic compounds that can raise health and safety issues, as well as economical issues.",Eco-Friendly Screen-Printing Inks of Gadolinia Doped Ceria,10.1115/1.3120271
4,17162,"In order to obtain a low-cost alternative to the generally accepted organic-based ink, four different blends of binders were considered to prepare water-based GDC inks.",Eco-Friendly Screen-Printing Inks of Gadolinia Doped Ceria,10.1115/1.3120271
5,17162,"The systems were deposited onto green NiO/GDC anodes produced by tape casting and treated at 1673 K for 4 h. By choosing the right combination of solvents and binders, it was possible to obtain a dense crack-free film of GDC from a water-based system.",Eco-Friendly Screen-Printing Inks of Gadolinia Doped Ceria,10.1115/1.3120271
