1,16998,Bulk samples of SmBa1-xSrxCo2O5+ were synthesized using solid-state chemical reaction of the starting metal oxides in the appropriate weight ratios and heating in air at temperatures approaching 1223K. Their thermal expansion coefficients were determined using in situ x-ray diffraction studies between 298K and 1273K. No phase transition was observed during the heating or the cooling cycle.,Thermal Stability and Anisotropic Thermal Expansion of SmBa1-xSrxCo2O5+ (0.1x0.5),10.1007/s11664-019-07040-w
2,16998,"The volumetric thermal expansion coefficients for samples with orthorhombic Pmmm phase are 6x10(-5)K(-1)(x=0.0), 6.8x10(-5)K(-1) (x=0.3) and 6.4x10(-5)K(-1) (x=0.5), and for sample with an orthorhombic phase Pnma 7.1x10(-5)K(-1) (x=1).",Thermal Stability and Anisotropic Thermal Expansion of SmBa1-xSrxCo2O5+ (0.1x0.5),10.1007/s11664-019-07040-w
3,16998,The linear thermal expansion showed anisotropy of (a) or (c)>(b) for samples with Pmmm phase and no anisotropy for the x=1 sample.,Thermal Stability and Anisotropic Thermal Expansion of SmBa1-xSrxCo2O5+ (0.1x0.5),10.1007/s11664-019-07040-w
