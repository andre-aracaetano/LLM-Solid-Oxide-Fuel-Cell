1,11022,"In this study, a single-step cofiring through the extrusion molding and wet-ceramic coating technique was developed to fabricate a cathode-supported microtubular cell.",Development and characterization of cathode-supported SOFCs by single-step cofiring fabrication for intermediate temperature operation,10.1115/1.2930767
2,11022,The cell is consisting of a Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) electrolyte with a NiO-GDC anode on a porous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta/GDC tube (460 mu m wall thickness and 2.26 mm diameter).,Development and characterization of cathode-supported SOFCs by single-step cofiring fabrication for intermediate temperature operation,10.1115/1.2930767
3,11022,"Densification of the ceria membrane (thickness <20 mu m) was successful by cosintering the laminated thin electrolyte and the anode with the cathode at 1200 degrees C. Compared with that fabricated by the conventional two-step cofiring process, the cell showed an improved performance due to the increased anode sintering temperature, which leads to an improved anode/electrolyte interfacial property.",Development and characterization of cathode-supported SOFCs by single-step cofiring fabrication for intermediate temperature operation,10.1115/1.2930767
4,11022,"The cell having 2 cm tube length fed with humidified 30 vol % H-2-Ar (3% H2O) produced the maximum power densities of 0.09 W cm(-2), 0.08 W cm(-2), and 0.05 W cm(-2), at 600 degrees C, 550 degrees C, and 500 degrees C, respectively.",Development and characterization of cathode-supported SOFCs by single-step cofiring fabrication for intermediate temperature operation,10.1115/1.2930767
