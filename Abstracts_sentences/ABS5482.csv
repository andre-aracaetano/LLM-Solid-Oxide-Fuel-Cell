1,5482,"Ni0.9Fe0.1-supported solid oxide fuel cells are fabricated by tape casting-screen printing-sintering process; and the activity for CH4 reforming and electrochemical performance are examined with wet (3 vol.% H2O) CH4 as the fuel at 650 degrees C, in comparison with Ni-supported cells.",Methane on-cell reforming in nickel-iron alloy supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.062
2,5482,"At a flow rate of 100 ml min(-1), the wet CH4 is partially (35 vol.%) reformed to H-2, CO and CO2 in the Ni0.9Fe0.1 anode-support, demonstrating a higher reforming activity than that of the Ni anode-support.",Methane on-cell reforming in nickel-iron alloy supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.062
3,5482,The maximum power density is 1.01 Wcm(-2) at a high limiting current density of 2.6 A cm(-2); and cell voltage at 0.4 A cm(-2) is slightly decreased from 0.65 to 0.60 V within 50 h durability test.,Methane on-cell reforming in nickel-iron alloy supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.062
4,5482,This high performance is attributed to the Ni0.9Fe0.1 anode-support that is more active for CH4 reforming and resistant to carbon deposition than its Ni counterpart.,Methane on-cell reforming in nickel-iron alloy supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.062
