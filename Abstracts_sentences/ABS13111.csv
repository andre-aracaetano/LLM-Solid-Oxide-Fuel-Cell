2,13111,"The fibers were developed from two different perovskite materials; lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM) and lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF), which mixed with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).",Effect of sintering temperature on perovskite-based hollow fiber as a substrate for cathode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s41779-021-00620-2
3,13111,The effect of high sintering temperature (1250-1450 degrees C) on both hollow fibers was examined.,Effect of sintering temperature on perovskite-based hollow fiber as a substrate for cathode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s41779-021-00620-2
4,13111,Both LSM/YSZ and LSCF/YSZ composites were composed of asymmetric structure that consists of sponge-like and finger-like voids.,Effect of sintering temperature on perovskite-based hollow fiber as a substrate for cathode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s41779-021-00620-2
5,13111,"LSM/YSZ hollow fiber gave higher mechanical strength of 161 MPa with sufficient porosity of 22% compared to LSCF/YSZ which exhibited mechanical strength of 114 MPa at 1400 degrees C. Besides, the gas permeation for both composite cathode hollow fibers showed the same declining trends as the function of sintering temperature.",Effect of sintering temperature on perovskite-based hollow fiber as a substrate for cathode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s41779-021-00620-2
6,13111,"Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD) result showed a formation of a resistive phase when the sintering temperature reached 1300 degrees C for LSCF/YSZ and destruction of cobalt phase occurred at 1400 degrees C.",Effect of sintering temperature on perovskite-based hollow fiber as a substrate for cathode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s41779-021-00620-2
