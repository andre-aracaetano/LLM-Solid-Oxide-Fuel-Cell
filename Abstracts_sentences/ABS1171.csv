1,1171,A type of micro-solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was designed and fabricated that uses self-supporting thin (similar to 20 mu m thick) lanthanum-gallate-based electrolyte.,Thick-Film Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Based on Lanthanum-Gallate Electrolyte Without Using Buffer Layer,10.1149/1.3086261
2,1171,"With this configuration, the cofiring of electrolyte and anode was avoided, and high power density was obtained without using a buffer layer, which prevents the reaction between the electrolyte and Ni in the anode.",Thick-Film Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Based on Lanthanum-Gallate Electrolyte Without Using Buffer Layer,10.1149/1.3086261
3,1171,"The maximum power densities were 0.29, 0.56, and 0.93 W/cm(2) at 600, 650, and 700 degrees C, respectively, comparable to those of the anode-supported SOFCs that use lanthanum-gallate electrolyte and a buffer layer.",Thick-Film Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Based on Lanthanum-Gallate Electrolyte Without Using Buffer Layer,10.1149/1.3086261
4,1171,This structure has the advantages of both electrolyte and electrode-support types.,Thick-Film Electrolyte-Supported SOFC Based on Lanthanum-Gallate Electrolyte Without Using Buffer Layer,10.1149/1.3086261
