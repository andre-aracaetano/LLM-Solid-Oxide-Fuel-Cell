1,14812,Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems for aircraft applications require an order of magnitude increase in specific power density (1.0 kW kg(-1)) and long life.,"A symmetrical, planar SOFC design for NASN′s high specific power density requirements",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.110
2,14812,"While significant research is underway to develop anode supported cells which operate at temperatures in the range of 650-800 degrees C, concerns about Cr-contamination from the metal interconnect may drive the operating temperature down further, to 750 degrees C and lower.","A symmetrical, planar SOFC design for NASN′s high specific power density requirements",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.110
3,14812,"Higher temperatures, 850-1000 degrees C, are more favorable in order to achieve specific power densities of 1.0 kWkg(-1).","A symmetrical, planar SOFC design for NASN′s high specific power density requirements",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.110
4,14812,"Since metal interconnects are not practical at these high temperatures and can account for up to 75% of the weight of the stack, NASA is pursuing a design that uses a thin, LaCrO3-based ceramic interconnect that incorporates gas channels into the electrodes.","A symmetrical, planar SOFC design for NASN′s high specific power density requirements",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.110
5,14812,"The bi-electrode supported cell (BSC) uses porous YSZ scaffolds, on either side of a 10-20 mu m electrolyte.","A symmetrical, planar SOFC design for NASN′s high specific power density requirements",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.110
6,14812,The porous Support regions are fabricated with graded porosity using the freeze-tape casting process which can be tailored for fuel and air flow.,"A symmetrical, planar SOFC design for NASN′s high specific power density requirements",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.110
7,14812,"Removing gas channels from the interconnect simplifies the stack design and allows the ceramic interconnect to be kept thin, on the order of 50-100 mu m. The YSZ electrode scaffolds are infiltrated with active electrode materials following the high-temperature sintering step.","A symmetrical, planar SOFC design for NASN′s high specific power density requirements",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.110
8,14812,"The NASA-BSC is symmetrical and CTE matched, providing balanced stresses and favorable mechanical properties for vibration and thermal cycling.","A symmetrical, planar SOFC design for NASN′s high specific power density requirements",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.08.110
