1,4561,The evolutions of stress in the multilayer structure of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) working under high temperature are calculated by an analytical model.,Evolution of the residual stress in solid oxide fuel cell during creep,10.1007/s41779-018-0277-1
2,4561,A finite element model is established to validate the results of the present model.,Evolution of the residual stress in solid oxide fuel cell during creep,10.1007/s41779-018-0277-1
3,4561,"The results show that, the present model can be used to analyze the stress relaxation of the SOFC during creep, the stresses both in anode and electrolyte drop dramatically at the first time, but the stress in cathode is first increased and then decreased.",Evolution of the residual stress in solid oxide fuel cell during creep,10.1007/s41779-018-0277-1
4,4561,"The stress relaxation rates of the anode, electrolyte, and cathode of SOFC are 97.87%, 94.91%, and 57.36%, respectively.",Evolution of the residual stress in solid oxide fuel cell during creep,10.1007/s41779-018-0277-1
5,4561,"The creep behavior of electrolyte has little effect on the stress redistribution of the single cell, while anode as well as cathode plays an important role in the evolution of the residual stress and curvature.",Evolution of the residual stress in solid oxide fuel cell during creep,10.1007/s41779-018-0277-1
