1,17863,"Nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet with various vol.% of Ni has been prepared by the combustion of Ni(NO3)(2), Y(NO3)(3), ZrO(NO3)(2) and carbohydrazide followed by hydrogen reduction at 800 degrees C, 2 h. The as-formed cermet powders were fine with surface area in the range of 27-32 m(2)/g with an average agglomerated particle size in the range of 0.25-0.8 mu m.",Synthesis and properties of Ni-YSZ cermet: anode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(98)00187-8
