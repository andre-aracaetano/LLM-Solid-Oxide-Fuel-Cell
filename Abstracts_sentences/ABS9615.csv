1,9615,"In recent years, solid oxide fuel cells fueled with ammonia have been attracting intensive attention.",A Stability Study of Ni/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode for Direct Ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.5b11122
2,9615,"In this work, ammonia fuel was supplied to the Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cermet anode at 600 and 700 degrees C, and the change of electrochemical performance and microstructure under the open-circuit state was studied in detail.",A Stability Study of Ni/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode for Direct Ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.5b11122
3,9615,The influence of ammonia exposure on the microstructure of Ni was also investigated by using Ni/YSZ powder and Ni film deposited on a YSZ disk.,A Stability Study of Ni/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode for Direct Ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.5b11122
4,9615,"The obtained results demonstrated that Ni in the cermet anode was partially nitrided under an ammonia atmosphere, which considerably roughened the Ni surface.",A Stability Study of Ni/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode for Direct Ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.5b11122
5,9615,"Moreover, the destruction of the anode support layer was confirmed for the anode-supported cell upon the temperature cycling test between 600 and 700 degrees C because of the nitriding phenomenon of Ni, resulting in severe performance degradation.",A Stability Study of Ni/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anode for Direct Ammonia Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.5b11122
