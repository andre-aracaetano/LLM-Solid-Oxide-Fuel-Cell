1,2743,The visualization of three-dimensional (3D) microstructures of solid oxide fuel cells helps to understand the efficiency of the electrochemical conversion process study the device s reliability and improve manufacturing processes Here we used X-ray nanotomography to investigate a porous nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) composite anode These results were used to characterize and quantify the key structural parameters such as the volume ratio of the three phases (Ni YSZ and pore) connected porosity surface area of each phase interface of Ni/YSZ volume-specific three-phase boundary length (TPB where the Ni YSZ and fuel gas phases come together) and electrical conductivity of the anode (c) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved,Analysis of the three-dimensional microstructure of a solid-oxide fuel cell anode using nano X-ray tomography,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.059
