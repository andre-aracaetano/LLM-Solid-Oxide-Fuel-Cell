1,18679,"With only MoS2 as the anode catalyst, the performance of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) using H2S-containing H-2 as fuel increased with temperature.",CoS-promoted MoS2 catalysts for SOFC using H2S-containing hydrogen or syngas as fuel,10.1149/1.2718476
2,18679,"The highest current density was 360 mA/cm(2) and the highest power density was 58 mW/cm(2) at 900 degrees C. When using pure H-2, the performance was slightly lower.",CoS-promoted MoS2 catalysts for SOFC using H2S-containing hydrogen or syngas as fuel,10.1149/1.2718476
3,18679,Impedance measurements showed that both ohmic resistance and polar resistance increased in the absence of H2S. The performance of CoS-MoS2 as an anode catalyst was significantly better when compared with MoS2 alone.,CoS-promoted MoS2 catalysts for SOFC using H2S-containing hydrogen or syngas as fuel,10.1149/1.2718476
4,18679,"At 900 degrees C, the maximum current density when using CoS-MoS2 was 550 mA/cm(2) and the maximum power density was 100 mW/cm(2).",CoS-promoted MoS2 catalysts for SOFC using H2S-containing hydrogen or syngas as fuel,10.1149/1.2718476
5,18679,The performance of all the metal sulfide catalysts was decreased immediately on introduction of CO to the feed gas.,CoS-promoted MoS2 catalysts for SOFC using H2S-containing hydrogen or syngas as fuel,10.1149/1.2718476
6,18679,"The effect was reversible, and performance recovered after removal of CO from the feed stream.",CoS-promoted MoS2 catalysts for SOFC using H2S-containing hydrogen or syngas as fuel,10.1149/1.2718476
7,18679,"This showed that the effect was due to strong adsorption of CO on the catalytic sites, and that the effect could be reversed through continued operation of the SOFC.",CoS-promoted MoS2 catalysts for SOFC using H2S-containing hydrogen or syngas as fuel,10.1149/1.2718476
8,18679,"When the supply of CO was discontinued, oxygen ions transferred from the YSZ membrane reacted with adsorbed CO to regenerate the active sites.",CoS-promoted MoS2 catalysts for SOFC using H2S-containing hydrogen or syngas as fuel,10.1149/1.2718476
