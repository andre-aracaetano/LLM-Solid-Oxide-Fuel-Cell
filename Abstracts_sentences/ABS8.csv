1,8,"This work presents the performance of the direct flame fuel cell based on the anode-supported solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a propane flame, which serves not only as a fuel reformer but also as a heat source to sustain the fuel cell operation.",High performance direct flame fuel cell using a propane flame,10.1016/j.proci.2010.07.047
2,8,The anode-supported SOFC was successfully fabricated and showed an extraordinary fuel cell performance of 584 mW/cm(2) by using a propane flame; far higher than that of the electrolyte-supported SOFC.,High performance direct flame fuel cell using a propane flame,10.1016/j.proci.2010.07.047
3,8,The total flow rates of premixed propane-air greatly influenced the range of fuel cell operation and fuel cell performance.,High performance direct flame fuel cell using a propane flame,10.1016/j.proci.2010.07.047
4,8,"With the fixed flow rate of propane, the introduction of an air flow exhibited a complex effect on the peak power density and the maximum current density due to the variation of fuel cell temperature and fuel concentration.",High performance direct flame fuel cell using a propane flame,10.1016/j.proci.2010.07.047
