2,16464,Specimens tested for 500 h at 750 degrees C and 0.7 V indicated >30% power degradation.,Degradation mechanisms of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O3SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2266160
3,16464,"While scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis indicated no obvious microstructural or chemical phenomena that could explain the high degradation, X-ray photon spectroscopy revealed that enrichment of Sr at the cathode-electrolyte and cathode-current collector interfaces was at least partially responsible for the observed degradation.",Degradation mechanisms of La-Sr-Co-Fe-O3SOFC cathodes,10.1149/1.2266160
