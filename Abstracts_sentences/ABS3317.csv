1,3317,"A new cubic double perovskite oxide, LaSrMnCoO5+delta(LSMC), was investigated as a novel cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC).",LaSrMnCoO5+δ as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.001
2,3317,The electrical conductivity of an LSMC sample reaches 111-140 S cm(-1) in the temperature range 600-850 degrees C. XRD results show that an LSMC cathode is chemically compatible with IT electrolyte material Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC).,LaSrMnCoO5+δ as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2012.03.001
