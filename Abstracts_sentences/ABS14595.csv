3,14595,"The effects of different content of Ni2+ doping on the crystal structure, surface morphology, thermal matching with YSZ (Yttria-stabilized zirconia), conductivity, and electrochemical performance of pyrochlore oxides were examined using different characterization techniques.",Pyrochlore La2Zr2-xNixO7 anodes for direct ammonia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11708-024-0948-2
4,14595,The findings indicate that the LZN(x) oxide behaves as an n-type semiconductor and exhibits an excellent high-temperature chemical compatibility and thermal matching with the YSZ electrolyte.,Pyrochlore La2Zr2-xNixO7 anodes for direct ammonia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11708-024-0948-2
5,14595,"Furthermore, LZN(0.05) exhibits the smallest conductive band potential and bandgap, making it have a higher power density as anode material for NH3-SOFCs compared to other anodes.",Pyrochlore La2Zr2-xNixO7 anodes for direct ammonia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11708-024-0948-2
6,14595,"As a result, the maximum power density of the LZN(0.05)-40YSZ composite anode reaches 100.86 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C, which is 1.8 times greater than that of NiO-based NH3-SOFCs (56.75 mW/cm(2)) under identical flow rate and temperature conditions.",Pyrochlore La2Zr2-xNixO7 anodes for direct ammonia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11708-024-0948-2
7,14595,The extended durability indicates that the NH3-SOFCs utilizing the LZN(0.05)-40YSZ composite anode exhibits a negligible voltage degradation following uninterrupted operation at 800 degrees C for 100 h.,Pyrochlore La2Zr2-xNixO7 anodes for direct ammonia solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11708-024-0948-2
