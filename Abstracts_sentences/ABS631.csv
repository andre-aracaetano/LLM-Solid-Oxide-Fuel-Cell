1,631,In the present investigation ethanol-water mixtures were directly fed to a yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrochemical reactor operated in a fuel cell mode and the preliminary results are presented and discussed.,Investigation of the reaction of ethanol-steam mixtures in a YSZ electrochemical reactor operated in a fuel cell mode,10.1115/1.2349529
2,631,"Polycrystalline films of platinum (Pt) and silver (Ag) were, respectively, tested as anode catalysts in a wide range of experimental conditions while the cathode was exposed to the atmospheric air The single direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cell (DE-SOFC) tests were performed in order to investigate separately Pt and Ag's activities towards ethanol steam reaction and fuel cell performance (Pt-DESOFC and Ag-DESOFC).",Investigation of the reaction of ethanol-steam mixtures in a YSZ electrochemical reactor operated in a fuel cell mode,10.1115/1.2349529
3,631,"In both cases the products were on-line analyzed by a mass spectrograph, a gas chromatograph and a series of gas analysers under fuel cell mode of operation.",Investigation of the reaction of ethanol-steam mixtures in a YSZ electrochemical reactor operated in a fuel cell mode,10.1115/1.2349529
4,631,"The results showed that even at high temperature values (> 750 degrees C) the main products were CH3CHO, CH4, CO, H-2, and CO2.",Investigation of the reaction of ethanol-steam mixtures in a YSZ electrochemical reactor operated in a fuel cell mode,10.1115/1.2349529
5,631,"Furthermore, as expected the single DESOFC performance was improved as the temperature increased.",Investigation of the reaction of ethanol-steam mixtures in a YSZ electrochemical reactor operated in a fuel cell mode,10.1115/1.2349529
6,631,"However a relatively poor fuel cell performance has been obtained in both cases, which could be attributed to the following reasons: the relatively low (for YSZ electrolyte) operation temperature, the presence of homogeneous reactions, and the cell configuration.",Investigation of the reaction of ethanol-steam mixtures in a YSZ electrochemical reactor operated in a fuel cell mode,10.1115/1.2349529
