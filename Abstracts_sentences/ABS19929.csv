2,19929,Some of the materials studied are potential candidate electrolyte materials with applications in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs).,Thermal phase transformations in LaGaO3 and LaAlO3 perovskites: An experimental and computational solid-state NMR study,10.1016/j.ssnmr.2012.01.003
3,19929,"Small variations in the local distortions of the subject phases are experimentally observed by Ga-71 (and Ga-69) and Al-27 NMR in the LaGaO3 and LaAlO3 phases, respectively, with heating to 1400K. The orthorhombic-to-rhombohedral phase transformation occurring in LaGaO3 at approximately 416 K is clearly observed in the Ga-71/Ga-69 NMR spectra and is associated with a significant increase in the quadrupolar coupling constant (QCC).",Thermal phase transformations in LaGaO3 and LaAlO3 perovskites: An experimental and computational solid-state NMR study,10.1016/j.ssnmr.2012.01.003
4,19929,"Thereafter a gradual decrease in QCC is observed, consistent with increased motion of the GaO6 octahedral units and a reduction in the degree of octahedral tilting.",Thermal phase transformations in LaGaO3 and LaAlO3 perovskites: An experimental and computational solid-state NMR study,10.1016/j.ssnmr.2012.01.003
5,19929,"The experimental and theoretical Ga-71, Ga-69, Al-27 and O-17 NMR parameters (including isotropic and anisotropic chemical shift parameters, quadrupolar coupling constants, and associated asymmetries) of the low and high temperature polymorphs are compared.",Thermal phase transformations in LaGaO3 and LaAlO3 perovskites: An experimental and computational solid-state NMR study,10.1016/j.ssnmr.2012.01.003
