3,17602,During the power generation tests at 1273 K the Ru/YSZ cer-met anode showed high activity for hydrogen oxidation compared with conventional Ni/YSZ cermet anodes.,HIGH-POWER DENSITY SOLID OXIDE ELECTROLYTE FUEL-CELLS USING RU/Y2O3 STABILIZED ZIRCONIA CERMET ANODES,10.1016/0167-2738(93)90260-A
4,17602,Especially in the high current density of a maximum of 3200 mA/cm2 the ac polarization value was reduced to approximately 200 mV. Tubular type SOFCs were made by depositing 10 mum thick 10 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte films on porous La(Sr)MnO(x) cathode tubes using the EVD process and then making a Ru/YSZ cermet anode on YSZ.,HIGH-POWER DENSITY SOLID OXIDE ELECTROLYTE FUEL-CELLS USING RU/Y2O3 STABILIZED ZIRCONIA CERMET ANODES,10.1016/0167-2738(93)90260-A
