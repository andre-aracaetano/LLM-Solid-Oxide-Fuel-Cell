4,19826,Electric properties of the samples were studied in the temperature range of 623-1173 K and in the oxygen partial pressure range of 0.01-10(-22) MPa.,Solid electrolytes based on CeO2 for medium-temperature electrochemical devices,10.1134/S1023193511060127
5,19826,"The values of oxygen critical pressure (p(O2)*) are presented, at which the ionic and electron conductivity values are equal.",Solid electrolytes based on CeO2 for medium-temperature electrochemical devices,10.1134/S1023193511060127
6,19826,The values were calculated on the basis of experimental dependences at 1023 K at the assumption that the ionic conductivity value is determined only by the dopant concentration and its effective ionic radius and is independent of the oxygen partial pressure.,Solid electrolytes based on CeO2 for medium-temperature electrochemical devices,10.1134/S1023193511060127
