3,10073,"The microstructures of the porous LSCF-Ag cermet cathodes were observed using a scanning electron microscope, and the area specific resistance of the cathodes was measured by the two-probe ac impedance method.",LSCF-Ag Cermet Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3110882
4,10073,"The LSCF-Ag cermet cathodes with different Ag fractions annealed at 750 degrees C for 3 h had the optimum microstructure and the lowest Rp when the Ag fraction in the LSCF-Ag cermet cathodes was 40 or 50 wt %, and the LSCF-Ag cermet cathode including 50 wt % Ag had a sufficient porosity without the poly(methyl methacrylate).",LSCF-Ag Cermet Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3110882
