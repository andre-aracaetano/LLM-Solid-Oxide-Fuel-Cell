1,7880,"The feasibility of a Ni/YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) anode infiltrated with a perovskite-type proton conductor, SrZr0.95Y0.05O3-alpha (SZY), was investigated for use in solid oxide fuel cells.",Improvement in Durability and Performance of Nickel Cermet Anode with SrZr0.95Y0.05O3-α in Dry Methane Fuel,10.1149/1.3028636
2,7880,The electrochemical characteristics of the Ni/YSZ-SZY anode and the Ni/YSZ anode were examined for humidified hydrogen fuel and for dry methane fuel.,Improvement in Durability and Performance of Nickel Cermet Anode with SrZr0.95Y0.05O3-α in Dry Methane Fuel,10.1149/1.3028636
3,7880,The durability of these anodes against carbon deposition was also studied using accelerated degradation tests.,Improvement in Durability and Performance of Nickel Cermet Anode with SrZr0.95Y0.05O3-α in Dry Methane Fuel,10.1149/1.3028636
4,7880,"The significant result is that, although the SZY has a much lower oxide ion conductivity than YSZ at high temperature, the addition of SZY to the Ni/YSZ anode improved the operational stability of the Ni/YSZ anode in dry methane with reducing the overpotential of the anode.",Improvement in Durability and Performance of Nickel Cermet Anode with SrZr0.95Y0.05O3-α in Dry Methane Fuel,10.1149/1.3028636
