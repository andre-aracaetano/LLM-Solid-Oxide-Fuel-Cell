2,17865,Crucial to the development of these anion conductors is the knowledge of crystal structures and the ion-diffusion mechanism at an atomic scale.,Experimental Visualization of the Interstitialcy Diffusion of Anions in the LaOF-Based Oxyfluoride La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2,10.1021/acsaem.1c01097
3,17865,"Recently, mixed-anion compounds have attracted much attention, but experimental visualization of anion-diffusion pathways is very rare in mixed-anion compounds.",Experimental Visualization of the Interstitialcy Diffusion of Anions in the LaOF-Based Oxyfluoride La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2,10.1021/acsaem.1c01097
4,17865,"Lanthanum oxyfluoride LaOF-based materials are mixed-anion compounds and exhibit high anion (fluoride-ion and oxide-ion) conductivities; however, their high-temperature crystal structures and anion-diffusion mechanism are not known satisfactorily.",Experimental Visualization of the Interstitialcy Diffusion of Anions in the LaOF-Based Oxyfluoride La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2,10.1021/acsaem.1c01097
5,17865,"Herein, we report detailed information on the crystal structure and structural disorder of La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2 and LaOF from -243 degrees C (30 K) to 600 degrees C. Trigonal R3m beta-LaOF undergoes a first-order phase transition into a cubic a-phase with the Fm3m fluorite-type structure around 490 degrees C on heating, while La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2 is a cubic Fm3m a-phase between -243 and 600 degrees C.",Experimental Visualization of the Interstitialcy Diffusion of Anions in the LaOF-Based Oxyfluoride La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2,10.1021/acsaem.1c01097
6,17865,"Neither significant amounts of interstitial anions at the 32f site nor significant anion vacancies at the lattice 8c site are observed in cubic LaOF at 600 degrees C, while both interstitial anions at the 32f site and anion vacancies at the lattice 8c site exist in cubic La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2 from -243 to 600 degrees C. We have succeeded in experimental visualization of anion-diffusion pathways in La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2.",Experimental Visualization of the Interstitialcy Diffusion of Anions in the LaOF-Based Oxyfluoride La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2,10.1021/acsaem.1c01097
7,17865,"It was found that the anions migrate through both the interstitial 32f and lattice 8c sites (8c-32f-32f-8c anion-diffusion pathways), indicating an interstitialcy diffusion mechanism.",Experimental Visualization of the Interstitialcy Diffusion of Anions in the LaOF-Based Oxyfluoride La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2,10.1021/acsaem.1c01097
8,17865,The existence of interstitial anions and anion vacancies and the formation of the anion-diffusion pathways are the structural origins of the high anion conductivity of La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2.,Experimental Visualization of the Interstitialcy Diffusion of Anions in the LaOF-Based Oxyfluoride La0.9Sr0.1O0.45F2,10.1021/acsaem.1c01097
