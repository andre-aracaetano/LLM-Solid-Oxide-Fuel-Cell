1,4097,"The key-requirements for glass ceramic sealing materials to achieve high efficiencies in planar solid oxide fuel cells are leak tightness, high insulating resistance, and low reactivity in contact with the anode or cathode gases and the interconnect material.",Barium-Free Sealing Materials for High Chromium Containing Alloys,10.1002/fuce.201200171
2,4097,"Therefore SCHOTT has developed special glasses and glass-ceramics for chromium alloys, like Cr5FeY (CFY, Plansee SE).",Barium-Free Sealing Materials for High Chromium Containing Alloys,10.1002/fuce.201200171
3,4097,Especially the CFY material requires adapted sealing materials due to its lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) compared to ferritic stainless steels and the possibility for interface reactions originating from the high chromium content and the glass seal components.,Barium-Free Sealing Materials for High Chromium Containing Alloys,10.1002/fuce.201200171
4,4097,"In this study, new glass-ceramic sealing materials for chromium containing alloys are presented.",Barium-Free Sealing Materials for High Chromium Containing Alloys,10.1002/fuce.201200171
5,4097,Results show that barium-free glass-ceramics are advantageous when sealing high chromium alloys in terms of interface reactions.,Barium-Free Sealing Materials for High Chromium Containing Alloys,10.1002/fuce.201200171
6,4097,"Because of the absence of barium oxide, formation of detrimental chromate phases at the interface was avoided.",Barium-Free Sealing Materials for High Chromium Containing Alloys,10.1002/fuce.201200171
7,4097,"The new glasses show low porosity, high hermeticity, and strong bonding toward the CFY material, fulfilling the requirements of SOFC sealants.",Barium-Free Sealing Materials for High Chromium Containing Alloys,10.1002/fuce.201200171
