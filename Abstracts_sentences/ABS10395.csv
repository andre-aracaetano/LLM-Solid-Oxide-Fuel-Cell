1,10395,Proton-conducting perovskites have been widely studied because of their potential application as solid electrolytes in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Influence of Nonstoichiometry on Proton Conductivity in Thin-Film Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.1021/acsami.7b16900
2,10395,"Structural and chemical heterogeneities can develop during synthesis, device fabrication, or service, which can profoundly affect proton transport.",Influence of Nonstoichiometry on Proton Conductivity in Thin-Film Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.1021/acsami.7b16900
3,10395,"Here, we use time-resolved Kelvin probe force microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, atom probe tomography, and density functional theory calculations to intentionally introduce Ba-deficient planar and spherical defects and link the resultant atomic structure with proton transport behavior in both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric epitaxial, yttrium-doped barium zirconate thin films.",Influence of Nonstoichiometry on Proton Conductivity in Thin-Film Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.1021/acsami.7b16900
4,10395,"The defects were intentionally induced through high-temperature annealing treatment, while maintaining the epitaxial single crystalline structure of the films, with an overall relaxation in the atomic structure.",Influence of Nonstoichiometry on Proton Conductivity in Thin-Film Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.1021/acsami.7b16900
5,10395,"The annealed samples showed smaller magnitudes of local lattice distortions because of the formation of proton polarons, thereby leading to decreased proton-trapping effect.",Influence of Nonstoichiometry on Proton Conductivity in Thin-Film Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.1021/acsami.7b16900
6,10395,"This resulted in a decrease in the activation energy for proton transport, leading to faster proton transport.",Influence of Nonstoichiometry on Proton Conductivity in Thin-Film Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate,10.1021/acsami.7b16900
