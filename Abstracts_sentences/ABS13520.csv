1,13520,"As anode-support materials for solid oxide fuel cells, porous LaNbO4-NiO-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) composites (LNY), containing 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt% of LaNbO4 and designated as 0LNO, 5LNO, 10LNO, 15LNO, and 20LNO, respectively, are prepared by tape casting and sintering.",LaNbO4-NiO-Y2O3 Stabilized ZrO2 Anode-Support Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/jace.13824

3,13520,"The porosity of as-sintered LNY is around 30%, and that of reduced LNY cermets decreases from 47% for reduced 0LNO to 43% for reduced 20LNO.",LaNbO4-NiO-Y2O3 Stabilized ZrO2 Anode-Support Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/jace.13824
4,13520,"The fracture strength (sigma(f)) of LNY is higher than that of the reduced form; however, both of them are not rather sensitive to the amount of LaNbO4, depending on crack-originating flaws in the specimens.",LaNbO4-NiO-Y2O3 Stabilized ZrO2 Anode-Support Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/jace.13824
5,13520,"The fracture toughness (K-IC) of LNY increases with LaNbO4 content and is 1.87 MPa.m(1/2) for 20LNO, which is more than 20% increase from that of 0LNO; however the K-IC for reduced LNY is higher than that of LNY, and decreases with increasing LaNbO4 content due to the decreased amount of ductile metallic Ni phase.",LaNbO4-NiO-Y2O3 Stabilized ZrO2 Anode-Support Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/jace.13824
