1,4640,"In this work, the mixed oxide-ion/electron conductor (MIEC) double-perovskite compounds A(2)FeMoO(6) (AFMO, A = Ca, Sr, Ba) are investigated as anode materials for O2- -ion conducting solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","High conductive and long-term phase stable anode materials for SOFCs: A2FeMoO6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba)",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.05.079
2,4640,"Several advantages are outlined here; 1) under H-2 atmosphere, the conductivities of Ba2FeMoO6 (BFMO), Sr2FeMoO6 (SFMO) and Ca2FeMoO6 (CFMO) reach as high as 243, 302 and 561 S cm(-1), respectively, which can be comparable with the commercial NiO-electrolyte anode; 2) excellent structure and phase stability at high temperature and in H-2 atmosphere; 3) matched thermodynamic compatibility (such as TECs) with electrolyte materials; 4) fast oxidization for fuel with O2- ions accepted by oxygen vacancies from the electrolyte.","High conductive and long-term phase stable anode materials for SOFCs: A2FeMoO6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba)",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.05.079
3,4640,"Moreover, with H-2 as fuel gas, the cell power output, cell's long-term stabilities and the structural parameter are also been examined to evaluate the AFMO anode.","High conductive and long-term phase stable anode materials for SOFCs: A2FeMoO6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba)",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.05.079
