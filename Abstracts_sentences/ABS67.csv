1,67,This article summarizes the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Risk Management Research Laboratory's Fuel Cell Program (www.epa.gov/ORD/ NRMRL/std/fuelcell) and presents interim findings of an ongoing project aimed at quantifying how clean fuel cell technology is from cradle-to-grave compared to conventional power generation processes.,A summary of the EPA's Fuel Cell Program dealing with the environmental life cycle assessment,10.1080/009083190893442
2,67,"Data and data sources will be reviewed by fuel cell type ( polymer exchange membrane, phosphoric acid fuel cell, solid oxide fuel cell, molten carbonate fuel cell, etc.)",A summary of the EPA's Fuel Cell Program dealing with the environmental life cycle assessment,10.1080/009083190893442
