2,1500,"In this research, a cobalt-free layered GdBaFe2O5+delta (GBF) perovskite was developed as a cathode material for protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells (PCMFCs) based on proton conducting electrolyte of stable BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY7).",A novel cobalt-free layered GdBaFe2O5+δ cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.006
3,1500,"The button cells of Ni-BZCY7 vertical bar BZCY7 vertical bar GBF were fabricated and characterized using complex impedance technique from 600 to 700 degrees C. An open-circuit potential of 1.007 V. maximum power density of 417 mW cm(-2), and a low electrode polarization resistance of 0.18 Omega cm(2) were achieved at 700 degrees C.",A novel cobalt-free layered GdBaFe2O5+δ cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.006
