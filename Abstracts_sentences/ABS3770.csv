2,3770,"Here, we report for the first time the novel La0.9Ca0.1Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-delta (LCFNb) perovskite with good potentiality for the electrode material of the symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells (SSOFC).",Niobium doped lanthanum calcium ferrite perovskite as a novel electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.111
3,3770,"The Sc0.2Zr0.8O2-delta (SSZ) electrolyte supported symmetrical cells with impregnated LCFNb and LCFNb/SDC (Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta) electrodes achieve relatively high power outputs with maximum power densities (MPDs) reaching up to 392 and 528.6 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C in dry H-2, respectively, indicating the excellent electro-catalytic activity of LCFNb towards both hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction.",Niobium doped lanthanum calcium ferrite perovskite as a novel electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.111
4,3770,"Besides, the MPDs of the symmetrical cells with LCFNb/SDC composite electrodes in CO and syngas (CO: H-2 = 1:1) are almost identical to those in H-2, implying that LCFNb material has similar catalytic activities to carbon monoxide compared with hydrogen.",Niobium doped lanthanum calcium ferrite perovskite as a novel electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.111
5,3770,"High durability in both H-2, CO and syngas during the short term stability tests for 50 h are also obtained, showing desirable structure stability, and carbon deposition resistance of LCFNb based electrodes.",Niobium doped lanthanum calcium ferrite perovskite as a novel electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.111
6,3770,The present results indicate that the LCFNb perovskite with remarkable cell performance is a promising electrode material for symmetrical SOFCs.,Niobium doped lanthanum calcium ferrite perovskite as a novel electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.111
