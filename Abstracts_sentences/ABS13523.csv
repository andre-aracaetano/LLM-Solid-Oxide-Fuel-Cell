4,13523,"The conductivity of NSCu and LSCu reached 106 S cm(-1) and 125 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C. NSCu cathode exhibited much lower area specific resistances (ASR) than LSCu, e.g., the ASR values for NSCu cathode on Sm-doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte in air were 0.07 Omega cm(2), 0.09 Omega cm(2) and 0.24 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, 750 degrees C and 700 degrees C, while the corresponding values for LSCu were 0.11 Omega cm(2), 0.21 Omega cm(2) and 0.44 Omega cm(2), respectively.","Characterization and optimization of Ln1.7Sr0.3CuO4 (Ln = La, Nd)-based cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.04.199
