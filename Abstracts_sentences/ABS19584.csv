1,19584,The flexibility and feasibility of a 5 kW SOFC generator designed for natural gas (NG) and fuelled by a non-conventional liquid fuel such as ethanol is analysed.,"Residential Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Generator Fuelled by Ethanol: Cell, Stack and System Modelling with a Preliminary Experiment",10.1002/fuce.201000004
2,19584,A complete generator model is implemented to predict and determine the main criticalities when ethanol fuel is adoperated.,"Residential Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Generator Fuelled by Ethanol: Cell, Stack and System Modelling with a Preliminary Experiment",10.1002/fuce.201000004
3,19584,"The main balance-of-plant (BoP) units considered are the reformer, the recirculation system based on an ejector, the tubular cells bundles constituting the stack unit, the after-burner zone and the air blower.","Residential Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Generator Fuelled by Ethanol: Cell, Stack and System Modelling with a Preliminary Experiment",10.1002/fuce.201000004
4,19584,"The electrical and global efficiencies achieved at nominal operating conditions show how ethanol maintains generator performance good, while only slightly reducing the system AC efficiency from 48% (achieved by NG) to 45%.","Residential Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Generator Fuelled by Ethanol: Cell, Stack and System Modelling with a Preliminary Experiment",10.1002/fuce.201000004
5,19584,The effectiveness and flexibility of the recirculation system when changing the fuel is also verified since a safe steam-to-carbon ratio (STCR) is established after the fuel is switched from NG ethanol.,"Residential Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Generator Fuelled by Ethanol: Cell, Stack and System Modelling with a Preliminary Experiment",10.1002/fuce.201000004
6,19584,"The stack thermal management is analysed in detail and related to the system performances, showing how a high endothermic fuel reforming reaction is required to maintain the overall system efficiency.","Residential Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Generator Fuelled by Ethanol: Cell, Stack and System Modelling with a Preliminary Experiment",10.1002/fuce.201000004
7,19584,A preliminary experiment with ethanol feeding the Siemens generator is finally presented.,"Residential Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Generator Fuelled by Ethanol: Cell, Stack and System Modelling with a Preliminary Experiment",10.1002/fuce.201000004
8,19584,The system response to the new fuel is monitored by several measured parameters and the system regulation is explained.,"Residential Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Generator Fuelled by Ethanol: Cell, Stack and System Modelling with a Preliminary Experiment",10.1002/fuce.201000004
