6,12672,"S cm(-1) is achieved for Sc0.04Sm0.16Ce0.8O1.9 materials at 700 degrees C. Single cells with Sc0.04Sm0.16Ce0.8O1.9 as electrolytes demonstrate a maximum power density of 225 mW cm(-2), and an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.87 Vat 700 degrees C. Codoping Sc2O3 and Sm2O3 also suppresses the reduction of ceria thus inhibits the drop of OCV under working condition at 700 degrees C.
