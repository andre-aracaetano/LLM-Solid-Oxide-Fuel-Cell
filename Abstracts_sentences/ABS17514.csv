1,17514,"The La0.8Sr0.2Mn(1-y) FeyO((3+/-delta)) (LSMF with y = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1) compounds are prospective cathode materials for advanced solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) application operating at 700degreesC. Usual analysis methods like thermogravimetric analysis or redox titration enable to determine the average oxidation state of both manganese and iron cations.",Mossbauer study of lanthanum-strontium ferromanganite oxides,10.1023/B:HYPE.0000043244.19471.1a
2,17514,The comparative role of iron and manganese in B-site was evaluated by Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy.,Mossbauer study of lanthanum-strontium ferromanganite oxides,10.1023/B:HYPE.0000043244.19471.1a
3,17514,Spectra revealed that the complete substitution of iron for manganese induces the formation of Fe5+ for the compound with y = 1.,Mossbauer study of lanthanum-strontium ferromanganite oxides,10.1023/B:HYPE.0000043244.19471.1a
