1,15092,"A novel trigeneration system which integrates a SOFC system, an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), and an ammonia water absorption chiller with a CO2 capture system is proposed and investigated.","Thermodynamic analysis of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell, Organic Rankine Cycle and absorption chiller trigeneration system with CO2 capture",10.1016/j.enconman.2018.05.108
2,15092,"The exhaust gas from SOFC anode combusts with pure O-2 instead of air and thus the combustion products mainly consist of CO2 and H2O, which the CO2 can be captured easily by the condensation method; in SOFC cathode side, a series-connected ORC and ammonia water absorption chiller heat recovery system which can produce power, heat and cooling is employed to recover the waste heat of SOFC cathode exhaust gas.","Thermodynamic analysis of an integrated solid oxide fuel cell, Organic Rankine Cycle and absorption chiller trigeneration system with CO2 capture",10.1016/j.enconman.2018.05.108
