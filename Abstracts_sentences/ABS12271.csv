6,12271,"It is observed that the presence of carbon monoxide (CO) in fuel, as compared to pure hydrogen, influences the anodic charge transfer processes not only due to promotion of the water-gas-shift reaction at the anode two-phase (fuel | electrode) and three-phase (fuel | electrode | electrolyte) interfaces, but also because of its direct electrooxidation at the anode three-phase interfaces.",Physical-chemical processes at Mo-doped ceria-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anodes in solid oxide fuel cells using syngas derived by the distribution of relaxation times method,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.143083

9,12271,"Additionally, other oxidation processes of CO at the anode interfaces (such as, the Boudouard reaction) promote the formation of carbon deposits lacking ordered structure, which are more reactive than graphitic structures formed at Ni-YSZ anodes but still can negatively influence the electrochemical kinetics.",Physical-chemical processes at Mo-doped ceria-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anodes in solid oxide fuel cells using syngas derived by the distribution of relaxation times method,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.143083
