2,5261,"Here, we report stable non-cobalt and non strontium La1-xNi0.6Fe0.4O3 perovskite cathodes with improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.","Enhanced and stable strontium and cobalt free A-site deficient La1-xNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (x=0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.149
3,5261,"A-site deficient La1-xNi0.6Fe0.4O3 cathodes within 8 at.% all exhibit the invariable phase structure with LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (LNF), and the matched thermal expansion coefficient with that of the (Ce0.90Gd0.10)O-1.95 (GDC) electrolyte.","Enhanced and stable strontium and cobalt free A-site deficient La1-xNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (x=0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.149
4,5261,"The polarization resistance of the La0.94Ni0.6Fe0.4O3 (LNF94) cathode is 0.61 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C in air, which is 1/5 of the LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (2.78 Omega cm(2)).","Enhanced and stable strontium and cobalt free A-site deficient La1-xNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (x=0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.149
5,5261,"The peak power density of the corresponding single cell with LNF94 cathode is 0.37 Omega cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, which is 2.36 times higher than that of the single cell with LNF cathode (0.11 W cm(-2)).","Enhanced and stable strontium and cobalt free A-site deficient La1-xNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (x=0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.149
6,5261,"We further study the long-term stability of LNF and LNF94 cathodes, the polarization resistance of the LNF94 electrode slightly fluctuates around 0.18 Omega cm(2) during 50 h operation at 800 degrees C, while the polarization resistance of the LNF increases by about 15%.","Enhanced and stable strontium and cobalt free A-site deficient La1-xNi0.6Fe0.4O3 (x=0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.149
