2,4247,"The interaction between two different transition metals, Mn and Co, may affect the electronic conducting properties and electrochemical performance.","Effect of Mn on the electrochemical properties of a layered perovskite NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2-xMnxO5+δ (x=0, 0.25, and 0.5) for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2013.09.014
3,4247,The substitution of Mn for Co lowers the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of Co-based materials by suppression of the spin state transition of Co3+ which might consequently improve the mechanical compatibility with the electrolyte.,"Effect of Mn on the electrochemical properties of a layered perovskite NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2-xMnxO5+δ (x=0, 0.25, and 0.5) for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2013.09.014
4,4247,"The electrochemical performance, however, could be slightly degraded by trapping of the effective mobile charge with increasing Mn content.","Effect of Mn on the electrochemical properties of a layered perovskite NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2-xMnxO5+δ (x=0, 0.25, and 0.5) for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2013.09.014
5,4247,Such a substitution of Co by Mn would provide a tradeoff relationship between TEC and electrochemical performance in IT-SOFCs.,"Effect of Mn on the electrochemical properties of a layered perovskite NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2-xMnxO5+δ (x=0, 0.25, and 0.5) for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2013.09.014
