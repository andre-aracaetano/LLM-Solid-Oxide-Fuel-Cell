1,9981,The performances of Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (IT-SOFC) anode-supported planar cells with a 10 cm(2)active surface were studied versus the combination of cathode thickness and the presence of an Anode Functional Layer (AFL).,Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-xfor Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Influence of Cathode Thickness and Anode Functional Layer on Performance,10.3390/en13174400
2,9981,"The temperature range was 500 to 650 degrees C, and Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-x(GDC) was used as the electrolyte material, Ni-GDC as the anode material, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-d(LSCF48) as the cathode material.",Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-xfor Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Influence of Cathode Thickness and Anode Functional Layer on Performance,10.3390/en13174400
3,9981,"The power density, conductivity, and activation energy of different samples were determined in order to investigate the influence of the cathode thickness and AFL on the performance.",Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-xfor Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Influence of Cathode Thickness and Anode Functional Layer on Performance,10.3390/en13174400
4,9981,These results showed an improvement in the performances when the AFL was not present.,Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-xfor Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Influence of Cathode Thickness and Anode Functional Layer on Performance,10.3390/en13174400
5,9981,The maximum power density reached 370 mW center dot cm(-2)at 650 degrees C for a sample with a cathode thickness of 50 mu m and an electrolyte layer that was 20 mu m thick.,Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-xfor Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Influence of Cathode Thickness and Anode Functional Layer on Performance,10.3390/en13174400
6,9981,"Moreover, it was highlighted that a thinner cathode layer reduced the power density of the cell.",Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-xfor Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Influence of Cathode Thickness and Anode Functional Layer on Performance,10.3390/en13174400
