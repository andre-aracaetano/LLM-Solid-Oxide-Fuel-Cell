1,10745,The decomposition mechanism of manganese-containing 10 mol% Sc2O3 and 1 mol% CeO2 co-doped ZrO2 (10Sc1CeSZ) electrolyte during long-term operation of a cathode-supported tubular-type solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was investigated.,Stability of Sc2O3 and CeO2 co-doped ZrO2 electrolyte during the operation of solid oxide fuel cells: Part III. Detailed mechanism of the decomposition,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.06.025
2,10745,"With Fe2O3, TiO2, Na2CO3. and MgO applied respectively on an electrolyte surface, cell operation tests were conducted at 1000 C for 270 h. Additionally, an annealing test using manganese-containing 10SclCeSZ pellets was conducted under a fuel atmosphere to clarify the influence of P(O-2) distribution in the electrolyte.",Stability of Sc2O3 and CeO2 co-doped ZrO2 electrolyte during the operation of solid oxide fuel cells: Part III.
