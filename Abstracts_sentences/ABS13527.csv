1,13527,"We report an optimized Sr0.95Ti0.35Fe0.6Ni0.05O3-delta (STFN) anode in electrolyte supported single cell, which exhibits high stability and fine electrochemical catalytic activity in 3% H2O-97% H-2 at 750 degrees C, with exsolved Ni0.4Fe0.6 nano particles and stoichiometric-close composition of AB(0.924)O(3-delta) after exsolution.","Sr(Ti,Fe)O3-δ Based Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode with Self-precipitated (Ni,Fe) and Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ Nano Particles",10.1149/1945-7111/abcc2e
2,13527,"In order to bring perovskite anode into application, mixtures of STFN and Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC), prepared by physical and sol-gel method, are applied as anode functional layer in electrolyte supported single cells.","Sr(Ti,Fe)O3-δ Based Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode with Self-precipitated (Ni,Fe) and Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ Nano Particles",10.1149/1945-7111/abcc2e
3,13527,"Further studies reveal that the composite anode prepared by adding GDC to STFN can improve anode performance at intermediate and low temperatures by decreasing anode polarization resistance ((R-p,R-A) dependence in diluted fuels.","Sr(Ti,Fe)O3-δ Based Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode with Self-precipitated (Ni,Fe) and Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ Nano Particles",10.1149/1945-7111/abcc2e
4,13527,"The sol-gel method is shown to effectively fabricate uniformly dispersed multi-phase anode, compared with STFN anode, with decreased R-p,(A) of 0.089 Omega center dot cm(2) for STFN@GDC anode at 750 degrees C and pH2 0.97 atm.","Sr(Ti,Fe)O3-δ Based Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode with Self-precipitated (Ni,Fe) and Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ Nano Particles",10.1149/1945-7111/abcc2e
5,13527,"Moreover, the single cell also demonstrates good performance under both H-2 and H-2-CO.
