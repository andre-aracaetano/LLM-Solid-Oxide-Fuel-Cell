1,5782,Reactive Element (RE) and RE/cobalt-coated stainless steel AISI 441 was exposed at Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) cathode conditions (850 degrees C in air with 3% water content) for up to 500 h. The chromium evaporation was measured by applying the denuder technique.,Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Oxidation performance and chromium evaporation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.089
2,5782,Uncoated material exhibited severe spallation which could be successfully prevented by using cerium or lanthanum coatings.,Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Oxidation performance and chromium evaporation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.089
3,5782,By applying double layer coatings of cerium or lanthanum in combination with cobalt the oxidation rate was decreased and the chromium volatilisation was also about 90% lower than the uncoated material.,Coated stainless steel 441 as interconnect material for solid oxide fuel cells: Oxidation performance and chromium evaporation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.089
