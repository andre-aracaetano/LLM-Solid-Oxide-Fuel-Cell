2,8571,"Sr0.7K0.3SiO2.85, close to the solid-solution limit of Sr1-xKxSiO3-0.5x, was characterized by solid-state Si-29 NMR spectroscopy and neutron powder diffraction (NPD).",Solid-State 29Si NMR and Neutron-Diffraction Studies of Sr0.7K0.3SiO2.85 Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ic500891j
3,8571,"Differing with the average structure containing the vacancies stabilized within the isolated Si3O9 tetrahedral rings derived from the NPD study, the (29Si) NMR data provides new insight into the local defect structure in Sr0.7K0.3SiO2.85.",Solid-State 29Si NMR and Neutron-Diffraction Studies of Sr0.7K0.3SiO2.85 Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ic500891j

5,8571,"data suggests that the Si3O9 tetrahedral rings in the K-doped SrSiO3 materials were broken, forming Si3O8 chains.",Solid-State 29Si NMR and Neutron-Diffraction Studies of Sr0.7K0.3SiO2.85 Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ic500891j
6,8571,"The Si3O8 chains can be stabilized by either bonding with the oxygen atoms of the absorbed lattice water molecules, leading to the Q(1)-linked tetrahedral Si, or sharing oxygen atoms with neighboring Si3O9 units, which is consistent with the Q(3)-linked tetrahedral Si signal detected in the Si-29 NMR spectra.",Solid-State 29Si NMR and Neutron-Diffraction Studies of Sr0.7K0.3SiO2.85 Oxide Ion Conductors,10.1021/ic500891j
