4,12877,"Among all the compositions, 0.2Ca11SSZ demonstrates the highest conductivity of 0.075 S cm-1 at 800 degrees C, with excellent stability of 6.7%/100 h in a reducing (97 vol% H2/3 vol% H2O) atmosphere.",Role of Divalent Co-Dopant as Structure Stabilizer in Scandia-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1149/1945-7111/ad1550
5,12877,"However, the presence of 0.5 mol% calcium in 11SSZ results in more than threefold suppression of aging rate compared to undoped11SSZ i.e. 2.19%/200 h in air atmosphere at 800 degrees C. Additionally, the doping of divalent Ca2+ widens the electrolytic domain up to pO2 similar to 10-26 atm at 1000 degrees C compared to state-of-art 8YSZ (pO2 similar to 10-22 atm), with 0.024% linear expansion on phase transition and 172 MPa flexural strength.",Role of Divalent Co-Dopant as Structure Stabilizer in Scandia-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1149/1945-7111/ad1550
6,12877,"Convincingly, the excellent structure stability and ionic conductivity of calcium co-doped 11SSZ compared to state-of-the-art electrolytes make them potential candidates to be used as an electrolyte for SOFC application.",Role of Divalent Co-Dopant as Structure Stabilizer in Scandia-Stabilized Zirconia Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1149/1945-7111/ad1550
