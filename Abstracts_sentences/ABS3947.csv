1,3947,"Doped CeO2 is widely used in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (500-650 degrees C) due to its high ionic conductivity, low reactivity to other cell components and ability to facilitate charge transfer reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface.",Structural and microstructural stability of ceria - gadolinia electrolyte exposed to reducing environments of high temperature fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta11752a
2,3947,"However, on exposure to hydrogen above 650 degrees C doped cerates can be reduced leading to catastrophic microstructure failure and loss of mechanical integrity.",Structural and microstructural stability of ceria - gadolinia electrolyte exposed to reducing environments of high temperature fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta11752a
3,3947,The effect of other fuels such as C and CO on the stability of ceria based electrolytes remains largely unexplored despite the increased significance in developing fuel cells that operate on these fuels.,Structural and microstructural stability of ceria - gadolinia electrolyte exposed to reducing environments of high temperature fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta11752a
4,3947,"In this paper a systematic investigation has been carried out on the effect of carbon monoxide on the electrical conductivity, ionic transport, crystal structure and microstructure of Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-x, with particular emphasis on the mechanisms of reduction and the long term stability of the material for use in a direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) where this material will be exposed to a reducing environment containing little or no hydrogen.",Structural and microstructural stability of ceria - gadolinia electrolyte exposed to reducing environments of high temperature fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta11752a
5,3947,These investigations have been carried out at temperatures typically found during the operation of a DCFC (800 degrees C) and the results have been compared with similar investigation carried out in dry hydrogen atmosphere.,Structural and microstructural stability of ceria - gadolinia electrolyte exposed to reducing environments of high temperature fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta11752a
6,3947,"A wide range of techniques including synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, high resolution transmission and scanning electron microscopy, four-probe DC conductivity measurements and electrochemical impedance analysis have been used to investigate the structural, microstructural and electrical properties of Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-x exposed to the operating environments of a DCFC.",Structural and microstructural stability of ceria - gadolinia electrolyte exposed to reducing environments of high temperature fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta11752a
