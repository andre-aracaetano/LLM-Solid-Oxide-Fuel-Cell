2,15397,"In this work, a series of transition metal elements (Fe, Co, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt) doped at the Ni site of La2NiO4+delta compounds as cathode materials of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are explored based on first-principles calculations, through which the determinant factors for interstitial oxygen formations and migrations are discussed at an atomistic level.",Computational Screening of La2NiO4+δ Cathodes with Ni Site Doping for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01044
3,15397,"The interstitial oxygen formation and migration energies for doped La2NiO4 are largely reduced in contrast to the pristine La2NiO4+delta, which is explained by charge density distributions, charge density gradients, and Bader charge differences.",Computational Screening of La2NiO4+δ Cathodes with Ni Site Doping for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01044
