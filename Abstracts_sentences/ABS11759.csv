2,11759,"Herein, we have systematically studied the Pt-samaria-doped ceria (SDC) cermet alloy anodes with varying Pt: SDC ratios to achieve high methanol oxidation reaction activity (MOR) and resistance to CO poisoning.",Pt-SDC alloy anode for methanol fueled low temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166078
3,11759,"It is observed that the optimal composition of the Pt-SDC alloy anode is Pt0.83SDC0.17, which exhibited lower activation resistance by 63 %, better tolerance to CO poisoning by 44 %, and higher thermal stability than that of pure Pt upon direct methanol operation at 450 C. Such improvements were ascribed to high Pt-SDC interfacial density of reaction sites with less CO poisoning due to oxygen spill over from SDC, while thermally stable SDC also helped preserve the morphology of the Pt anode at elevated temperatures.",Pt-SDC alloy anode for methanol fueled low temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166078
