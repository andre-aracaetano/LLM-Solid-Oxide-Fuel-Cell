1,4480,In this paper two different types of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) geometries are studied via CFD numerical simulations: a) a mono-block-layer build type (MOLB-type) with a porous embedding pipe in the air side of the geometry and a simple planar geometry were modeled feeding biogas obtained from local sludge.,Solid oxide fuel cell numerical study: modified MOLB-type and simple planar geometries with internal reforming,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.113
2,4480,"The numerical simulations integrated the internal reforming of methane in the anode side and different several phenomena that occur inside of the SOFC such as: mass transfer, heat transfer, species transport, chemical and electrochemical reactions.",Solid oxide fuel cell numerical study: modified MOLB-type and simple planar geometries with internal reforming,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.113
3,4480,"A detailed comparison of the results such as: current density, species concentration and temperature distributions along the fuel cells is reported.",Solid oxide fuel cell numerical study: modified MOLB-type and simple planar geometries with internal reforming,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.113
4,4480,"The results showed that the CH4, H2O, CO, CO2 concentration and current density distributions had similar trends for both MOLB-type with embedding porous pipe geometry and simple planar geometry.",Solid oxide fuel cell numerical study: modified MOLB-type and simple planar geometries with internal reforming,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.113
5,4480,"However, higher H-2 concentration and lower average temperature value are obtained from the MOLB-type with embedding porous pipe geometry, which help to handle higher current densities and reduces thermal stress, increasing the performance of the fuel cell.",Solid oxide fuel cell numerical study: modified MOLB-type and simple planar geometries with internal reforming,10.1016/j.electacta.2015.01.113
