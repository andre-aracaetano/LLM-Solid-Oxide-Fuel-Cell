1,13771,Oxygen reduction at ISCF-SDC (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 - (delta)-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9) composite cathode might take place at the LSCF-gas two-phase interface (2 PB) and the LSCF-SDC-gas three-phase boundary (3 PB).,Oxygen incorporation at the three-phase boundary of LSCF-SDC composite,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.164
2,13771,A method is developed to determine the oxygen incorporation rate and the amount of incorporated oxygen at 3 PB using the electrical conductivity relaxation technique.,Oxygen incorporation at the three-phase boundary of LSCF-SDC composite,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.164
3,13771,The obtained results are powerful supports to the viewpoint that oxygen incorporation at 3 PB is much more facile than that at 2 PB.,Oxygen incorporation at the three-phase boundary of LSCF-SDC composite,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.164
4,13771,"The amount of oxygen incorporated absolutely at 3 PB plays a dominating role in the total process, which actually contributes an average of more than 70% when only 4.5 vol.",Oxygen incorporation at the three-phase boundary of LSCF-SDC composite,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.164
5,13771,% SDC is added to LSCF.,Oxygen incorporation at the three-phase boundary of LSCF-SDC composite,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.164
6,13771,The incorporation rate at 3 PB is found to be affected not only by the 3 PB length but also the diffusion of oxygen species on the LSCF surface.,Oxygen incorporation at the three-phase boundary of LSCF-SDC composite,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.164
7,13771,"An effective surface diffusion length of about 1.5 mu m is suggested by the relation between the rate, 3 PB length and LSCF surface area.",Oxygen incorporation at the three-phase boundary of LSCF-SDC composite,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.164
