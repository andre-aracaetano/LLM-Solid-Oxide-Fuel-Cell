3,17556,The phase purity and electrical properties of the microwave processed samples were determined and compared with a conventionally processed material.,Microwave assisted synthesis and sintering of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815,10.1016/S0167-577X(02)01070-4
4,17556,It was found that LSGM with a composition La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 always yielded a two-phase mixture though the presence of second phase did not affect the conductivity significantly at lower temperatures.,Microwave assisted synthesis and sintering of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815,10.1016/S0167-577X(02)01070-4
