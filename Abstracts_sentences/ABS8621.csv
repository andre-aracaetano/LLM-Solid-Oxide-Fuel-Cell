1,8621,"Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) possesses an adequate level of oxygen ion conductivity and exhibits desirable chemical stability in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, and is widely used as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells.",Study on zirconia solid electrolytes doped by complex additives,10.1016/j.msea.2006.12.072
2,8621,"We reported here the effects Of Sc2O3 or Dy2O3 addition on the electrical conductivity, sintering, bending strength and microstructure of Sc2O3 or Dy2O3 and Yb2O3 doped-YSZ electrolyte materials prepared by hi.-h-temperature solid-state method.",Study on zirconia solid electrolytes doped by complex additives,10.1016/j.msea.2006.12.072
3,8621,"The electrical conductivity of the electrolyte materials was significantly improved by taking advantage of a complex addition of Y2O3 Yb2O3 and Sc2O3 (or Dy2O3) and maximum values of 0.18 and 0.16 S/cm were obtained at 1000 degrees C for both Series I and II, respectively, when the total additive content was 8.3 mol%.",Study on zirconia solid electrolytes doped by complex additives,10.1016/j.msea.2006.12.072
4,8621,"In addition, the bulk densities (1600 degrees C, 4 h) of the sintered samples decreased from 5.82 to 5.24 g/cm(3) with the increase Of Sc2O3 content but increased from 5.63 to 5.86 g/cm(3) as Dy2O3 content increased following the same sintering conditions.",Study on zirconia solid electrolytes doped by complex additives,10.1016/j.msea.2006.12.072
5,8621,The findings of this research also suggest that the introduction of complex additives promotes grain growth to a certain extent.,Study on zirconia solid electrolytes doped by complex additives,10.1016/j.msea.2006.12.072
