5,8352,"Microstructural change associated with the formation of nickel nanoparticles on zirconia grains, probably via NiCl(2)(g) sublimation, was observed after 150 h poisoning tests, whereas a partial recovery of cell voltage by removing chlorine from the fuels indicates that the chlorine poisoning is partially reversible.",Chlorine Poisoning of SOFC Ni-Cermet Anodes,10.1149/1.2980521
6,8352,"Thermochemical calculations, microstructural analysis, and electrochemical characterizations have revealed that the poisoning phenomena for Ni-based cermet anodes caused by chlorine compounds can be explained by the mixed adsorption-type and sublimation-type poisoning mechanism.",Chlorine Poisoning of SOFC Ni-Cermet Anodes,10.1149/1.2980521
