1,15232,"Reduced Ce0.9Ni0.1O2-delta consists of Ni nanoparticles and Ni-doped CeO2 (CNO), named (Ni@CNO) with Ni nanoparticles uniformly distributed on CNO substrate with high oxygen vacancy concentration and good water absorption capability.",A direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell with a functionally engineered Ni-Fe metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231533
2,15232,Thus Ni@CNO demonstrates moderate catalytic activity and high carbon deposition resistance during CH4 steam-reforming.,A direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell with a functionally engineered Ni-Fe metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231533
3,15232,"When it is infiltrated into Ni0.9Fe0.1 (NF) metallic support for metalsupported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs), forming a continuous coating, Ni@CNO offers CH4 steamreforming activity additional to that of the NF support with increased H2/CH4 ratio (3.38 at 600 degrees C) in the reforming gas, enhanced carbon deposition resistance, and prolonged performance durability.",A direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell with a functionally engineered Ni-Fe metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231533
4,15232,"With the Ni@CNO-infiltrated NF support (NFNC), Ni/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (Ni-GDC) function anode, GDC electrolyte, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (LSCF-GDC) cathode, the MS-SOFC cell directly fueled by wet CH4 (3 vol % H2O) exhibits a peak power density of 0.343 W cm-2 and the cell voltage durably maintains above 0.6 V at 400 mA cm-2 during a test of 280 h at 600 degrees C without noticeable carbon deposition in the support and the functional anode.",A direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell with a functionally engineered Ni-Fe metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231533
5,15232,"Such performance is comparable to and higher than those reported, suggesting that NFNC is a promising option for direct-CH4 MS-SOFCs.",A direct-methane solid oxide fuel cell with a functionally engineered Ni-Fe metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231533
