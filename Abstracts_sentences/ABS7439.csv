2,7439,"At this pressure, the plasma jet interaction with the surrounding atmosphere is very weak.",Thin and Dense Ceramic Coatings by Plasma Spraying at Very Low Pressure,10.1007/s11666-009-9416-0
3,7439,"Thus, the plasma velocity is almost constant over a large distance from the nozzle exit.",Thin and Dense Ceramic Coatings by Plasma Spraying at Very Low Pressure,10.1007/s11666-009-9416-0
4,7439,"Furthermore, at these low pressures the collision frequency is distinctly reduced and the mean free path is strongly increased.",Thin and Dense Ceramic Coatings by Plasma Spraying at Very Low Pressure,10.1007/s11666-009-9416-0
5,7439,"As a consequence, at low pressure the specific enthalpy of the plasma is substantially higher, but at lower density.",Thin and Dense Ceramic Coatings by Plasma Spraying at Very Low Pressure,10.1007/s11666-009-9416-0
