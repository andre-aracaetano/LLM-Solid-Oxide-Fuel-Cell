1,18473,The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of microwave energy on the structural and electrical properties of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Structural and Electrical Analysis of Microwave Processed YSZ Electrolytes for SOFC Prepared by Co-precipitation Method,10.1007/s11837-016-2145-1
2,18473,"Five different compositions of Zr1-x Y (x) O2-x/2 (x = 0.06-0.14) were prepared by a co-precipitation method and were then sintered by microwave as well as conventional heating at 1400A degrees C for 20 min and 240 min, respectively.",Structural and Electrical Analysis of Microwave Processed YSZ Electrolytes for SOFC Prepared by Co-precipitation Method,10.1007/s11837-016-2145-1
3,18473,The structural and electrical properties of the samples sintered by both the methods were compared.,Structural and Electrical Analysis of Microwave Processed YSZ Electrolytes for SOFC Prepared by Co-precipitation Method,10.1007/s11837-016-2145-1
4,18473,The x-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed that YSZ samples sintered by both methods had either a tetragonal crystal structure or a cubic structure depending on its composition.,Structural and Electrical Analysis of Microwave Processed YSZ Electrolytes for SOFC Prepared by Co-precipitation Method,10.1007/s11837-016-2145-1
5,18473,"Almost the same degree of densification as well as conductivity of same order was found from impedance analysis for both microwave- and conventionally sintered YSZ products, which showed that microwave sintering is the better alternative for material processing in terms of saving energy and time without compromising the product quality.",Structural and Electrical Analysis of Microwave Processed YSZ Electrolytes for SOFC Prepared by Co-precipitation Method,10.1007/s11837-016-2145-1
