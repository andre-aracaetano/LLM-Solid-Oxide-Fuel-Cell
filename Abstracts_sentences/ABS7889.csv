1,7889,"Redox reactions were studied at a single yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/Pt electrode interface, in parallel with pure YSZ with no catalyst electrode, by in situ analytical electron microscopy at elevated temperatures and in an oxygen atmosphere.",In Situ Analytical Electron Microscopy Studies of Redox Reactions at a YSZ/Pt Interface,10.1017/S143192761200027X
2,7889,In situ electron holography showed that the oxide underwent reduction at elevated temperatures in a vacuum and was consequently reoxidized upon exposure to an oxygen flux at the same temperature.,In Situ Analytical Electron Microscopy Studies of Redox Reactions at a YSZ/Pt Interface,10.1017/S143192761200027X
3,7889,In situ energy loss spectroscopy measurements were in agreement with in situ electron holography observations and indicated that the oxidation state of the host cation zirconium was altered in the reduced state of the YSZ to the metastable state Zr3+.,In Situ Analytical Electron Microscopy Studies of Redox Reactions at a YSZ/Pt Interface,10.1017/S143192761200027X
