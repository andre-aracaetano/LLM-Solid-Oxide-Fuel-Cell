1,19376,Composites of 6 mol% scandia-stabilized zirconia materials (6ScSZ) and nanosize Al2O3 powder (0-30wt.%) were prepared and characterized for electrical conductivity by the ac impedance method at various temperatures ranging from 300 to 950 degrees C.,Electrical conductivity enhancement in heterogeneously doped scandia-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.028
2,19376,All the composites characterized showed improved conductivity at higher temperatures compared to the undoped ScSZ.,Electrical conductivity enhancement in heterogeneously doped scandia-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.028
3,19376,"An average conductivity of 0.12 S cm(-1) was measured at 850 degrees C for 6ScSZ+30 wt.% Al2O3 Composite samples, an increase in conductivity up to 20% compared to the undoped 6ScSZ specimen at this temperature.",Electrical conductivity enhancement in heterogeneously doped scandia-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.028
4,19376,Microstructural evaluation using scanning electron microscopy revealed that the ScSZ grain size was relatively unchanged up to 10 wt.% of Al2O3 additions.,Electrical conductivity enhancement in heterogeneously doped scandia-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.028
5,19376,"However, the grain size was reduced in samples with higher (20 and 30 wt.%) additions of Al2O3.",Electrical conductivity enhancement in heterogeneously doped scandia-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.028
6,19376,"Small grain size, reduced quantity of the 6ScSZ material (only 70%), and improved conductivity makes these ScSZ+30wt.% Al2O3 composites very attractive as electrolyte materials in view of their collective mechanical and electrical properties and cost requirements.",Electrical conductivity enhancement in heterogeneously doped scandia-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.028
7,19376,The observed increase in conductivity values with the additions of an insulating Al2O3 phase is explained in light of the space charge regions at the 6ScSZ-Al2O3 grain boundaries.,Electrical conductivity enhancement in heterogeneously doped scandia-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.01.028
