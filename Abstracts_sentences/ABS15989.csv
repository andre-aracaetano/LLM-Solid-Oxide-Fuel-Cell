1,15989,Carbon removal from the anode triple-phase boundary (TPB) of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by adsorbed water molecules has been studied by density functional theory (DFT).,Coke-Tolerant Ni/BaCe1-xYxO3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp312485q
2,15989,We evaluated the energy pathways of water adsorption with subsequent oxidation of interfacial carbon for the case of Ni/BaCe1-xYxO3-delta and conventional Ni/YSZ anodes.,Coke-Tolerant Ni/BaCe1-xYxO3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp312485q
3,15989,"It has been found that oxidation of interfacial carbon, which occurs via a reaction with hydroxyls, released by adsorbed water molecules, is significantly more favorable on Ni/BaCe1-xYxO3-delta anodes as compared to Ni/YSZ.",Coke-Tolerant Ni/BaCe1-xYxO3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp312485q
4,15989,We argue that favorable carbon oxidation is governed by the ability of the oxide to adsorb and partially split water molecules.,Coke-Tolerant Ni/BaCe1-xYxO3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp312485q
5,15989,We also analyzed the underlying reasons for favorable water adsorption on the oxide surface and found that more favorable water adsorption occurs on the surfaces of the oxides with the lower value for the electronic work function and higher Fermi basicity.,Coke-Tolerant Ni/BaCe1-xYxO3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp312485q
6,15989,"To generalize the latter principle, we studied water adsorption on CaO and SrO oxides, which have the same crystal structure as BaO, and found that the more favorable water adsorption takes place on a surface of BaO, which also has the lowest electronic work function.",Coke-Tolerant Ni/BaCe1-xYxO3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp312485q
7,15989,"In line with previously published works, our findings indicate that a Ni/oxide anode, where the oxide surface has BaO termination, has a high resistance toward blocking of the TPB with carbon atoms in a water-containing atmosphere",Coke-Tolerant Ni/BaCe1-xYxO3-δ Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: DFT plus U Study,10.1021/jp312485q
