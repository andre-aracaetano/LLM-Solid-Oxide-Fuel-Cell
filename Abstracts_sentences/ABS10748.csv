2,10748,"thin-film solid oxide fuel cells were evaluated between 650 and 800 degreesC. Peak power densities and power densities at cell voltages of 0.7 V were 320 and 190 mW/cm(2), respectively, at 650 degreesC, denoted as 320/190/650.",Thin film SOFCs with cobalt-infiltrated cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.017
3,10748,"Corresponding power densities at other temperature were 1400/1100/800, 990/640/750, and 600/360/700.",Thin film SOFCs with cobalt-infiltrated cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.017
4,10748,"At 750 degreesC and lower, the power densities and ASRs (area-specific resistances) were better than those reported for an 8YSZ cell with record performance [S. de Souza, S.J. Visco, L.C. De Jonghe, in Proceeding of the Second European Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Forum, edited by B. Thorstensen, vol. 2 (1996), 677.], while showing a smaller temperature dependence.",Thin film SOFCs with cobalt-infiltrated cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.017
5,10748,Further performance improvements of about a factor of 2 were obtained at 650 degreesC after infiltration of the LSM/YSZ cathodes with a cobalt solution.,Thin film SOFCs with cobalt-infiltrated cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.017
6,10748,"This improvement persisted up to about 750 degreesC, being more pronounced at the lower temperatures.",Thin film SOFCs with cobalt-infiltrated cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.017
7,10748,The results indicate the potential benefit of cobalt infiltration for reduced temperature SOFCs.,Thin film SOFCs with cobalt-infiltrated cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.017
8,10748,AC measurements revealed that the majority of effect resulted from a decrease in the non-ohmic resistance of the cathode.,Thin film SOFCs with cobalt-infiltrated cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.08.017
