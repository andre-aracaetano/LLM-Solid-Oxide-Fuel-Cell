1,15831,A nanostructured CeO2-Ni coating is prepared on a steel substrate via two-step electrodeposition.,Oxidation and electrical properties of nanostructured CeO2-Ni coating on solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1177/02670836231212624
2,15831,"An oxide scale with a multi-layer structure of Cr2O3-(Mn,Cr)(3)O-4-(Ni,Mn,Cr)(3)O-4-NiO has developed on the coated steel after 1680 h of oxidation in air at 800 degrees C. CeO2 is uniformly distributed in the spinel and NiO layers.",Oxidation and electrical properties of nanostructured CeO2-Ni coating on solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1177/02670836231212624
3,15831,"The synergistic effects originating from nanostructured CeO2 and NiO not only reduce the growth rate of Cr2O3 and suppress the outward diffusion of Cr, but also improve the electrical performance of the surface scale.",Oxidation and electrical properties of nanostructured CeO2-Ni coating on solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1177/02670836231212624
