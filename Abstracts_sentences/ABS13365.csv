2,13365,"In the present work, parametric and sensitivity analysis have been presented to understand the effects of different operational (operating temperature, air-fuel ratio) and geometrical parameters (porosity, flow configurations and electrolyte thickness) on cell performance and thermal impacts generation in porous electrodes and solid electrolyte.",Parametric sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of operating and design parameters on single direct methane steam reforming solid oxide fuel cell performance and thermal impacts generation,10.1016/j.ecmx.2023.100374
3,13365,Simulation results show that 25 % increase in operating temperature (800 degrees to 1000 degrees C) causes an increase of 85.85 % in current density (2146.37 A/m2 to 3989.06 A/m2) and 10.5 % larger thermal stress generation (1673.18 MPa to 1849.69 MPa).,Parametric sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of operating and design parameters on single direct methane steam reforming solid oxide fuel cell performance and thermal impacts generation,10.1016/j.ecmx.2023.100374
