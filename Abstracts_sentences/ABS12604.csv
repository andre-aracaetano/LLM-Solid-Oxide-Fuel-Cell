4,12604,"It is found that the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) is manageable when Co ion is incorporated, and the low TEC value ranges from 12.7 x 10(-6) to 15.4 x 10(-6) K-1 that are well compatible with prototypical electrolytes Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 (YSZ) and Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC).","Investigations on structures, thermal expansion and electrochemical properties of La0.75Sr0.25Cu0.5-xCoxMn0.5O3-δ (x=0, 0.25, and 0.5) as potential cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.166
5,12604,"The dc-conductivity is significantly enhanced from 36.5, 90.5 to 173.7 S cm(-1) at 850 degrees C with the increasing Co percent, and accordingly, polarization resistance (R-p) is determined as 0.1291, 0.0835 and 0.0486 V cm(2) at 800 degrees C.","Investigations on structures, thermal expansion and electrochemical properties of La0.75Sr0.25Cu0.5-xCoxMn0.5O3-δ (x=0, 0.25, and 0.5) as potential cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.166
6,12604,"The high electrical conductivities and low resistances can be attributed to the strong B-O bond hybridization and oxygen vacancy formation at elevated temperatures with the introduction of Co ion, which is consistent with the results of first-principles calculation and thermogravimetric analysis.","Investigations on structures, thermal expansion and electrochemical properties of La0.75Sr0.25Cu0.5-xCoxMn0.5O3-δ (x=0, 0.25, and 0.5) as potential cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.166
