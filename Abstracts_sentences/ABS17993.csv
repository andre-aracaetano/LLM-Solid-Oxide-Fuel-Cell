1,17993,Material formulated as Ce5.2Sm0.8-xPrxMo15-(delta) (x=0.08) was prepared by adding small amounts of Pr dopant in oxide Ce5.2SM0.8-xPrxMoO15-delta.,Effects of Pr dopant on grain boundary and electrical properties of Ce5.2Sm0.8MoO15-δ,
2,17993,"Structural and electrical properties were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and AC impedance spectroscopy.",Effects of Pr dopant on grain boundary and electrical properties of Ce5.2Sm0.8MoO15-δ,
3,17993,The effect of small amounts of Pr on microstructure and electrical conductivity was discussed.,Effects of Pr dopant on grain boundary and electrical properties of Ce5.2Sm0.8MoO15-δ,
4,17993,"It was showed that the material doped with Pr has a lot of dents and small openings, which provide channels for oxygen ions, resulting in lower grain boundary and total conductivity activation energy.",Effects of Pr dopant on grain boundary and electrical properties of Ce5.2Sm0.8MoO15-δ,
5,17993,Thus the corresponding grain boundary conductivity and total conductivity of the material were improved notably.,Effects of Pr dopant on grain boundary and electrical properties of Ce5.2Sm0.8MoO15-δ,
6,17993,"The grain boundary conductivity of the material doped with Pr is 6.79 X 10(-3) S center dot cm(-1) at 500 degrees C, which is twice as large as that without Pr (5.61 X 10(-5) S center dot cm(-1)).",Effects of Pr dopant on grain boundary and electrical properties of Ce5.2Sm0.8MoO15-δ,
