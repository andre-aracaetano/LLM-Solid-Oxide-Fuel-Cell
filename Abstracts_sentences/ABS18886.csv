1,18886,The effects of the addition of Er2O3 on the grain growth and sinterability of c-ZrO2 were investigated using 8 mol.% yttria-stabilized cubic zirconia (c-ZrO2) and various amounts of Er2O3.,Grain growth and sinterability in Er2O3-doped cubic zirconia (c-ZrO2),10.3139/146.110999
2,18886,"For these purposes, the content of 0-15 wt.% Er2O3 and c-ZrO2 powders were doped using a colloidal process.",Grain growth and sinterability in Er2O3-doped cubic zirconia (c-ZrO2),10.3139/146.110999
3,18886,Undoped and Er2O3-doped c-ZrO2 specimens were annealed for grain growth at different temperatures and holding times.,Grain growth and sinterability in Er2O3-doped cubic zirconia (c-ZrO2),10.3139/146.110999
4,18886,An increase in annealing temperature and holding time caused grain growth in all specimens.,Grain growth and sinterability in Er2O3-doped cubic zirconia (c-ZrO2),10.3139/146.110999
5,18886,"Activation energy of the undoped c-ZrO2 obtained was 358 kJ mol(-1) and the activation energies of 1, 5, 10 and 15 wt.% Er2O3-doped specimens obtained were 388, 403, 432 and 476 kJ mol(-1), respectively.",Grain growth and sinterability in Er2O3-doped cubic zirconia (c-ZrO2),10.3139/146.110999
6,18886,"While excessive grain coarsening in the undoped c-ZrO2 was observed, a lesser level of grain growth occurred in the Er2O3-doped specimens, due to the segregation of Er2O3 at the grain boundaries and the restriction in the grain boundaries mobility of c-ZrO2.",Grain growth and sinterability in Er2O3-doped cubic zirconia (c-ZrO2),10.3139/146.110999
