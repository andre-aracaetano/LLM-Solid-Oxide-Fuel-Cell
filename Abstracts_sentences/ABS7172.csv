1,7172,"The chromium evaporation and oxidation behaviors of alumina-forming austenitic stain-less steels are systematically investigated at 800 degrees C in air +10% H2O relative to 310S for 5000 h. Cr evaporation rates of 310S are about 35 times higher than AFA alloys after 5000 h. Relatively rapid oxidation is observed on 310S after only one 500 h cycle, followed by a modest degree of mass loss and spallation, while the AFA alloys show high oxidation resistance throughout the entire test.",Alumina-forming austenitic stainless steel for high durability and chromium-evaporation minimized balance of plant components in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.09.010
