1,8825,A novel strategy was proposed to enhance the sinterability and electrical properties of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta(BZCY) proton-conducting electrolyte by adding 10 wt.% La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta(LSGM) to form a 90 wt.% BZCY-10 wt.% LSGM (BL91) composite electrolyte.,Enhancing the sinterability and electrical properties of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δproton-conducting ceramic electrolyte,10.1111/jace.17467
2,8825,"XRD patterns showed that no reaction occurred between the BZCY and LSGM electrolytes after sintering at 1400 degrees C, 1450 degrees C, 1500 degrees C, and 1550 degrees C for 10 h. The BL91 composite electrolyte exhibited higher relative densities and Vickers hardness and excellent electrical properties compared with those of the BZCY electrolyte.",Enhancing the sinterability and electrical properties of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δproton-conducting ceramic electrolyte,10.1111/jace.17467
