2,20311,The models were based on a steady-state heterogeneous two-dimensional tubular-design SOFC.,Modeling of IT-SOFC with indirect internal reforming operation fueled by methane: Effect of oxygen adding as autothermal reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.045
3,20311,The benefit in adding oxygen to methane and steam as the feed for autothermal reforming reaction on the thermal behavior and SOFC performance was simulated.,Modeling of IT-SOFC with indirect internal reforming operation fueled by methane: Effect of oxygen adding as autothermal reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.045
4,20311,The results indicated that smoother temperature gradient with lower local cooling at the entrance of the reformer channel can be achieved by adding a small amount of oxygen.,Modeling of IT-SOFC with indirect internal reforming operation fueled by methane: Effect of oxygen adding as autothermal reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.045
5,20311,"However, the electrical efficiency noticeably decreased when too high oxygen content was added due to the loss of hydrogen generation from the oxidation reaction; hence, the inlet oxygen to carbon (O/C) molar ratio must be carefully controlled.",Modeling of IT-SOFC with indirect internal reforming operation fueled by methane: Effect of oxygen adding as autothermal reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.045
6,20311,"Another benefit of adding oxygen is the reduction of excess steam requirement, which could reduce the quantity of heat required to generate the steam and eventually increases the overall system performance.",Modeling of IT-SOFC with indirect internal reforming operation fueled by methane: Effect of oxygen adding as autothermal reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.045
7,20311,It was also found that the operating temperature strongly affects the electrical efficiency achievement and temperature distribution along the SOFC system.,Modeling of IT-SOFC with indirect internal reforming operation fueled by methane: Effect of oxygen adding as autothermal reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.045
8,20311,"By increasing the operating temperature, the system efficiency increases but a significant temperature gradient is also detected.",Modeling of IT-SOFC with indirect internal reforming operation fueled by methane: Effect of oxygen adding as autothermal reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.045
9,20311,The system with a counter-flow pattern was compared to that with a co-flow pattern.,Modeling of IT-SOFC with indirect internal reforming operation fueled by methane: Effect of oxygen adding as autothermal reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.045
10,20311,The co-flow pattern provided smoother temperature gradient along the system due to better matching between the heat supplied from the electrochemical reaction and the heat required for the steam reforming reaction.,Modeling of IT-SOFC with indirect internal reforming operation fueled by methane: Effect of oxygen adding as autothermal reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.045
11,20311,"However, the electrical efficiency of the co-flow pattern is lower due to the higher cell polarization at a lower system temperature.",Modeling of IT-SOFC with indirect internal reforming operation fueled by methane: Effect of oxygen adding as autothermal reforming,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.045
