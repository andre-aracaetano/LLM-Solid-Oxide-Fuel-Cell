1,14392,One of the main drawbacks of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell technology is the limited capability to withstand reduction and oxidation (RedOx) of the Ni phase.,Curvature and Strength of Ni-YSZ Solid Oxide Half-Cells After Redox Treatments,10.1115/1.4001019
2,14392,"This study compares the effect of RedOx cycles on curvature and strength of half-cells, composed of a nickel-yttria-stabilized-zirconia (Ni-YSZ) support, a Ni-YSZ anode, and an 8YSZ electrolyte.",Curvature and Strength of Ni-YSZ Solid Oxide Half-Cells After Redox Treatments,10.1115/1.4001019
3,14392,"Five different treatments are studied: (i) reduction at 600 degrees C, (ii) reduction at 1000 degrees C, (iii) 1RedOx cycle at 750 degrees C, (iv) 5RedOx cycles at 750 degrees C, and (v) 5RedOx cycles at 600 degrees C.",Curvature and Strength of Ni-YSZ Solid Oxide Half-Cells After Redox Treatments,10.1115/1.4001019
4,14392,"The strength is measured by the ball-on-ring method, where it is calculated analytically from the force.",Curvature and Strength of Ni-YSZ Solid Oxide Half-Cells After Redox Treatments,10.1115/1.4001019
