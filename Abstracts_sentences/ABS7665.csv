2,7665,The influence of structural and operating parameters on the performance of the cell was analyzed.,Multi-physics field modeling and electrochemical performance analysis of medium-temperature methanol-fueled proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1080/15567036.2024.2320751
3,7665,"Moreover, the cell performance was compared with that of a methanol-oxygen ion-conducting SOFC (CH3OH-SOFC-O) under the same operating conditions.",Multi-physics field modeling and electrochemical performance analysis of medium-temperature methanol-fueled proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1080/15567036.2024.2320751
4,7665,"It was found that the anode support enables CH3OH-SOFC-H to exhibit higher performance, with the highest power density being 1493.3 W.m(-2) at 973 K. As the anode flow rate rises, the current density rises and subsequently falls, with a peak of 7623.6 A.m(-2).",Multi-physics field modeling and electrochemical performance analysis of medium-temperature methanol-fueled proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell,10.1080/15567036.2024.2320751
