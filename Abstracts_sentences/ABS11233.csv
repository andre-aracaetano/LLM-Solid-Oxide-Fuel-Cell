1,11233,"For the first time, a Fe-Ti-O containing pellet, a viable chemical looping particle, was used as a solid fuel for direct contact with the Ni/YSZ anode surface of a solid oxide fuel cell.",Solid oxide fuel cells fueled with reduced Fe/Ti oxide,10.1039/c4ta04905e
2,11233,"A maximum power density of 97 mW cm(-2), corresponding to 84% of that in the H-2 fuel, was produced using Fe-Ti-O in an inert Ar gas environment at 750 degrees C.",Solid oxide fuel cells fueled with reduced Fe/Ti oxide,10.1039/c4ta04905e
3,11233,The Fe-Ti-O pellets were able to generate stable electricity under repeated electrochemical oxidation and hydrogen reduction cycles.,Solid oxide fuel cells fueled with reduced Fe/Ti oxide,10.1039/c4ta04905e
4,11233,Temperature-programmed oxidationreduction coupled with infrared spectroscopic studies revealed that the oxidation of the Fe-Ti-O pellet followed a shrinking core model; the reduction followed a progressive-conversion model.,Solid oxide fuel cells fueled with reduced Fe/Ti oxide,10.1039/c4ta04905e
5,11233,The ability of the Fe-Ti-O pellet to generate electricity on the Ni/YSZ surface can be attributed to its low resistivity (<17 Omega cm) which allows electrons to transport from the electrochemical oxidation sites to the anode surface.,Solid oxide fuel cells fueled with reduced Fe/Ti oxide,10.1039/c4ta04905e
6,11233,"This study demonstrates that coupling a SOFC with an external reducer using Fe-Ti-O, an oxygen carrier, is a good candidate for electricity generation.",Solid oxide fuel cells fueled with reduced Fe/Ti oxide,10.1039/c4ta04905e
