1,6981,"The ferritic stainless steel AISI 441 (EN 1.4509) is exposed for 1000 h to air - 3% H2O on one side and to Ar - 5% H-2 - 3% H2O on the other at temperatures 600, 700, and 800 degrees C. Conditions are chosen to mimic the environment of metallic interconnects in an operating solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).",Temperature dependence of corrosion of ferritic stainless steel in dual atmosphere at 600-800 °C,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.04.088
