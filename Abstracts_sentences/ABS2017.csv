2,2017,Tailoring the sintering shrinkage of green sheets to one another was found to be an important factor in fabricating a flat and fracture-free three-layer cell.,Performance of a solid oxide fuel cell fabricated by co-firing,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02758-4
3,2017,Controlling the binder content in the fuel-electrode green sheet and calcination of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) powder were effective for tailoring the sintering shrinkage of green sheets.,Performance of a solid oxide fuel cell fabricated by co-firing,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02758-4
4,2017,"The performance of the co-fired three-layer cell was greatly influenced by the porosity of the air-electrode, and the maximum power density was attained at 70% of relative density, which is determined by the gas permeability and conductivity of air-electrode.",Performance of a solid oxide fuel cell fabricated by co-firing,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02758-4
