3,3569,"Shrinkage behavior of the chemically prepared, the commercial, and the mixed GDC powders is examined by thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA), which suggests that the mixed powder has good sinterability and compatible shrinkage with electrodes.",Co-firing of LSM-GDC/GDC/NiO-GDC with addition of nano-GDC powder,10.2109/jcersj2.116.792
4,3569,A LSM-GDC/GDC/NiO-GDC cell prepared by lamination of electrode and electrolyte green sheets is co-fired at 1300 degrees C for 4 h. The prepared fuel cell gives an output power density of 0.35 W/cm(2) at 600 degrees C. (C) 2008,Co-firing of LSM-GDC/GDC/NiO-GDC with addition of nano-GDC powder,10.2109/jcersj2.116.792
