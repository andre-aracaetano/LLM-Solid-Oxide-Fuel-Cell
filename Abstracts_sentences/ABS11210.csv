1,11210,"A Ni/NiFe2 dual-layer coating is deposited on 50-h pre-oxidized SUS 430 steel by magnetron sputtering for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) interconnects application, followed by thermal exposure in air at 800 degrees C for 1680 h. The thermally grown oxide scales exhibit tri-layer structure with inner Cr2O3 layer, middle NiO layer and outer NiFe2O4 spinel layer.",NiO/NiFe2O4 dual-layer coating on pre-oxidized SUS 430 steel interconnect,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.273
2,11210,The oxide coating converted from Ni/NiFe2 coating not only inhibit the growth of Cr2O3 and the outward diffusion of Cr species but also improve the electrical performance of the surface scale.,NiO/NiFe2O4 dual-layer coating on pre-oxidized SUS 430 steel interconnect,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.04.273
