1,18707,L0.2Sr0.8Fe0.8Ta0.2O3-delta (LSFT) is a mixed ionic electronic conductor (MIEC) at elevated temperatures and as such a candidate material for applications both in syn-gas synthesis and as electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Oxygen permeation in symmetric and asymmetric La0.2Sr0.8Fe0.8Ta0.2O3-δ membranes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2016.01.004
2,18707,This study addresses the variation in oxygen permeation rates for LSFT symmetric- and asymmetric-membranes at temperatures between 800 and 1000 degrees C with and without surface modification.,Oxygen permeation in symmetric and asymmetric La0.2Sr0.8Fe0.8Ta0.2O3-δ membranes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2016.01.004
3,18707,"The surface was structured in two different scales, macro (porous LSFT-layer) and micro (acid etching).",Oxygen permeation in symmetric and asymmetric La0.2Sr0.8Fe0.8Ta0.2O3-δ membranes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2016.01.004
4,18707,"The asymmetric membranes showed a significant variation in permeation rate with surface treatment with increasing rate in the sequence from non-treated to macro-structured and finally micro structured, corresponding to oxygen permeation being controlled by surface exchange and gas diffusion.",Oxygen permeation in symmetric and asymmetric La0.2Sr0.8Fe0.8Ta0.2O3-δ membranes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2016.01.004
5,18707,"It was found that the permeation rate was sensitive to the gas sweep rate when H-2-mixtures was introduced on the permeate side, which was rationalized by the effect of H2O-diffusion across a gas film layer.",Oxygen permeation in symmetric and asymmetric La0.2Sr0.8Fe0.8Ta0.2O3-δ membranes,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2016.01.004
