1,899,Activation effect can be defined as the enhancement of the electrochemical performance or activity of the solid oxide fuel cell cathodes such as Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM) with the polarization/current passage treatment under fuel cell operation conditions.,"Activation, microstructure, and polarization of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1007/s10008-005-0076-9
2,899,"In this paper, the activation effect of the cathodic polarization/current passage on the O-2 reduction reaction of the LSM-based cathodes is reviewed.","Activation, microstructure, and polarization of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1007/s10008-005-0076-9
3,899,"In addition to the activation effect, cathodic polarization/current passage also has a significant effect on the microstructure of the LSM electrodes and the morphology between the LSM electrode and Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte interface.","Activation, microstructure, and polarization of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1007/s10008-005-0076-9
4,899,A mechanism involving the incorporation of SrO species into the LSM lattice and the formation of oxygen vacancies is proposed for the activation effect of the polarization.,"Activation, microstructure, and polarization of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes",10.1007/s10008-005-0076-9
