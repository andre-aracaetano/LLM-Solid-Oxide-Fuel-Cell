1,4083,Ni/8 Mol% Y2O3-stabilized zirconia cermets are used in thin-film electrolyte solid-oxide fuel cells as support substrates.,Oxidation and resulting mechanical properties of Ni/8Y2O3-stabilized zirconia anode substrate for solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/JMR.2002.0142
2,4083,Rapid oxidation of the metallic Ni can cause failure of the substrate and of the whole system.,Oxidation and resulting mechanical properties of Ni/8Y2O3-stabilized zirconia anode substrate for solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/JMR.2002.0142
3,4083,"The rate of Ni oxidation in air and in an inert atmosphere containing water vapor was determined as a function of temperature between 500 and 950 degreesC. A logarithmic rate law describes the oxidation kinetics in air, whereas a linear rate law fits the first branch of the curve of the experimental data in a humidified inert atmosphere.",Oxidation and resulting mechanical properties of Ni/8Y2O3-stabilized zirconia anode substrate for solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/JMR.2002.0142
4,4083,The substrate exhibits no significant mechanical degradation after uniform oxidation under moderate conditions.,Oxidation and resulting mechanical properties of Ni/8Y2O3-stabilized zirconia anode substrate for solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/JMR.2002.0142
5,4083,"However, the observed bending of the samples after oxidation in humidified argon, due to the nonuniform oxidation, can cause damage to fuel cell.",Oxidation and resulting mechanical properties of Ni/8Y2O3-stabilized zirconia anode substrate for solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/JMR.2002.0142
