1,4181,The physical properties and microstructures of supporting anodes are extremely important for the performances of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,"Investigation on the microstructures, mechanical and electrical properties of solid oxide fuel cells anodes fabricated by using chitosan and cold mounts powders as new pore formers",10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.04.223
2,4181,"In the present work, for the first time, two new pore formers, cold mount powder and chitosan as well as graphite, activated carbon and corn starch as three well-known pore formers were studied and used for fabrication of porous Ni-YSZ anodes of solid oxide fuel cells.","Investigation on the microstructures, mechanical and electrical properties of solid oxide fuel cells anodes fabricated by using chitosan and cold mounts powders as new pore formers",10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.04.223
3,4181,Morphological features and size of the pore former particles were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and particle size analyzer (PSA) technique and their thermal decomposition/oxidation properties were determined by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA).,"Investigation on the microstructures, mechanical and electrical properties of solid oxide fuel cells anodes fabricated by using chitosan and cold mounts powders as new pore formers",10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.04.223
