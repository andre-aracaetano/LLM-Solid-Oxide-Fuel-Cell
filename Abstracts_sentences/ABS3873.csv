2,3873,"However, these empirical observations have not yet explained the detailed reaction mechanism.",First-Principles Study of Enhanced Oxygen incorporation Near the Grain Boundary on Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia,10.1166/sam.2016.2628
3,3873,"Here, we performed first-principles calculations to quantitatively access the mechanism that may govern the fast oxygen incorporation at the GB.",First-Principles Study of Enhanced Oxygen incorporation Near the Grain Boundary on Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia,10.1166/sam.2016.2628
4,3873,"We investigated the key elementary steps of oxygen incorporation onto both Sigma 5 (310)/[001] GB and (001) surfaces of YSZ at the atomic scale; yttrium dopant segregation, vacancy formation, and oxygen adsorption.",First-Principles Study of Enhanced Oxygen incorporation Near the Grain Boundary on Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia,10.1166/sam.2016.2628
5,3873,"Our results showed that the doped yttrium preferentially segregates toward the GB, inducing the easier formation of oxygen vacancy between the yttrium pair at the GB.",First-Principles Study of Enhanced Oxygen incorporation Near the Grain Boundary on Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia,10.1166/sam.2016.2628
6,3873,"After these steps, oxygen is favorably adsorbed near the oxygen vacancy accumulated at the GB, eventually incorporating into the vacancy site.",First-Principles Study of Enhanced Oxygen incorporation Near the Grain Boundary on Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia,10.1166/sam.2016.2628
