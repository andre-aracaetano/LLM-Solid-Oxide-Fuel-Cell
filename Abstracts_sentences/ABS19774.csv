4,19774,"For system reforming simplicity, a base case parameter set was defined as the fuel inlet of 60% CH4:40% CO2 mixed with air in a 1:1 ratio, together with 800 degreesC operating temperature and 80% fuel conversion.",Energy balance model of a SOFC cogenerator operated with biogas,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00103-4
5,19774,"A model stack, consisting of 100 series elements of anode supported electrolyte cells of 100 cm(2) each, was calculated to deliver 3.1 kW(el) and 5.16 kW(th) from an input of 1.5 N m(3)/h of biogas (8.95 kW LHV), corresponding to 33.8 and 57.6% electrical and thermal efficiencies (Lower Heating Values (LHVs)), respectively.",Energy balance model of a SOFC cogenerator operated with biogas,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00103-4
6,19774,"The incidence on the efficiencies of the model system was examined by the variation of a number of parameters such as the CO2 content in the biogas, the amount of air addition to the biogas stream, the addition of steam to the fuel inlet, the air excess ratio lambda and the stack operating temperature, and the results discussed.",Energy balance model of a SOFC cogenerator operated with biogas,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00103-4
