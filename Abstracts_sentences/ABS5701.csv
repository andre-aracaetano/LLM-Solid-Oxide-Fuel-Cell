2,5701,Therefore the startup and shutdown behaviors are critical to a portable solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and SOFC system.,Startup Characteristics of Propane-Fueled and Thermally Self-Sustained Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Hot Zones,10.1149/2.063206jes
3,5701,Startup characteristics of four propane-fueled hot zones were investigated.,Startup Characteristics of Propane-Fueled and Thermally Self-Sustained Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Hot Zones,10.1149/2.063206jes
4,5701,"The hot zones were able to be started up at environmental temperatures of 50 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 0 degrees C, -10 degrees C, -20 degrees C and -30 degrees C, respectively, without the need of additional heat source.",Startup Characteristics of Propane-Fueled and Thermally Self-Sustained Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Hot Zones,10.1149/2.063206jes
5,5701,The effect of the environment temperatures on the startup times for the stacks to reach operating temperatures (700 degrees C for example) was negligible (within 3 minutes).,Startup Characteristics of Propane-Fueled and Thermally Self-Sustained Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Hot Zones,10.1149/2.063206jes
6,5701,"The hot zone temperatures, however, decreased when decreasing the environmental temperatures from 50 degrees C to -30 degrees C, and stabilized at 661-635 degrees C (CPOX), 763-745 degrees C (stack) and 785-733 degrees C (TG) after one hour from startup.",Startup Characteristics of Propane-Fueled and Thermally Self-Sustained Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Hot Zones,10.1149/2.063206jes
7,5701,The maximum power of the hot zones was 165 W at over 60% fuel utilization.,Startup Characteristics of Propane-Fueled and Thermally Self-Sustained Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Hot Zones,10.1149/2.063206jes
