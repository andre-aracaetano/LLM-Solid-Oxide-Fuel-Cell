1,11362,"In this communication, cobaltite-based perovskite (CBP) cathodes are directly applied on the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte via an in situ assembly process without the addition of a doped ceria interlayer and pre-sintering at high temperatures.",Direct application of cobaltite-based perovskite cathodes on the yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta07067a
2,11362,"The results demonstrate for the first time that a CBP electrode/YSZ electrolyte interface can be formed in situ under cathodic polarization at a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating temperature of 750 degrees C. Nevertheless, the performance of cells with Sr-containing CBP cathodes deteriorates due to the surface segregation of Sr species and formation of a Sr-rich reaction layer at the interface.",Direct application of cobaltite-based perovskite cathodes on the yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta07067a
3,11362,"However, the stability and power density of cells with in situ assembled CBP cathodes can be further enhanced by B-site doping or by using a Sr-free CBP.",Direct application of cobaltite-based perovskite cathodes on the yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta07067a
