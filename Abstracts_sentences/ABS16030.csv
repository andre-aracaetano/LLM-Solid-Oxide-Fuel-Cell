1,16030,"In response to the urgent demand for highly active anodes for lower-temperature proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs) and with the aim to explore the function of metal catalysts and porous skeletons, two series anode-supported BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY)-based single cells with varying Ni catalysts and pore formers were assembled and evaluated comparably.",Rationally structuring proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell anode with Ni metal catalyst and porous skeleton,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.181
2,16030,"In the exploration of Ni catalyst variable, the NBZCY65-35-20SS (65 wt% NiO in NiO-BZCY prepared with adding 20 wt% starch) anode possesses the highest performance, for the 1:1 vol ratio of Ni-BZCY could offer the maximum effective triple-phase boundary (TPB) area in the prerequisite of having abundant pores achieved with the 20 wt% pore former as a constant.",Rationally structuring proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell anode with Ni metal catalyst and porous skeleton,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.181
3,16030,"In addition, both the NBZCY65-3515SS and NBZCY65-35-25SS anode demonstrate inferior electrochemical properties separately due to the inadequate reducing gas transmission channels and reaction sites.",Rationally structuring proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell anode with Ni metal catalyst and porous skeleton,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.181
4,16030,"The BZCY cell assembled with NBZCY65-3520SS reveals an excellent performance, in which the peak power densities (PPDs) were 660, 539, 413, 272 mW cm(-2) and the polarization resistances (R-P) were 0.061, 0.126, 0.28, 0.652 Omega cm(2) at 700, 650, 600, 550 degrees C, respectively.",Rationally structuring proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell anode with Ni metal catalyst and porous skeleton,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.181
5,16030,"NBZCY65-35-20SS, which has both a superior TPB area and a fine porous anode skeleton, is a preferable option for anode-supported H-SOFCs.",Rationally structuring proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell anode with Ni metal catalyst and porous skeleton,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.181
6,16030,"On the whole, the scientific regulations governing metal catalysis and pore-forming could be beneficial to the architecture of fine H-SOFC anode structures.",Rationally structuring proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell anode with Ni metal catalyst and porous skeleton,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.181
