1,1308,Thermal and chemical properties of invert glasses and glass-ceramics developed for hermetic seals for solid oxide fuel cells are described.,Designing sealing glasses for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/105994906X117206
2,1308,The glasses crystallize to form thermally stable pyro- and orthosilicate phases with the requisite thermal expansion match to the Y-stabillized ZrO2 (YSZ) electrolyte.,Designing sealing glasses for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/105994906X117206
3,1308,"In addition, the glasses bond to Cr-steel substrates at 800-850 degrees C without forming extensive interfacial reaction products.",Designing sealing glasses for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/105994906X117206
4,1308,The thermal expansion characteristics of the glass-ceramics remain essentially unchanged after 28 days at 750 degrees C. Compositions with lower (<= 2 mol%) B2O3 contents exhibit the lowest volatilization rates when exposed to wet forming gas at 750 degrees C.,Designing sealing glasses for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1361/105994906X117206
