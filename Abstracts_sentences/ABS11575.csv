3,11575,"A parameter study is performed focusing on the inlet fuel composition, where humidified hydrogen and methane syngas (the steam-to-carbon ratio is 3) as well as the local distribution of temperature, velocity, gas concentrations, and thermal stress are predicted and presented.",Numerical Investigation of Heat/Flow Transfer and Thermal Stress in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC,10.3390/cryst12121697
4,11575,The simulated results show that the fuel inlet composition has a significant effect on the temperature and gas concentration distributions.,Numerical Investigation of Heat/Flow Transfer and Thermal Stress in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC,10.3390/cryst12121697
5,11575,"The high-temperature zone of the hydrogen-fueled SOFC is located at the central part of units 5, 6, and 7, and the maximum value is about 44 K higher than that of methane syngas-fueled SOFC.",Numerical Investigation of Heat/Flow Transfer and Thermal Stress in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC,10.3390/cryst12121697
6,11575,The methane-reforming and electrochemical reactions in the anode active layer result in a significant concentration gradient between the anode support layer and the active layer of the methane syngas-fueled SOFC.,Numerical Investigation of Heat/Flow Transfer and Thermal Stress in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC,10.3390/cryst12121697

8,11575,"The maximum stress variation gradient between electrode layers of hydrogen SOFC is larger (44.2 MPa) than that of methanol syngas SOFC (14.1 MPa), but the remaining components have a more uniform stress distribution.",Numerical Investigation of Heat/Flow Transfer and Thermal Stress in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC,10.3390/cryst12121697
9,11575,"In addition, the electrode layer of each fuel SOFC produces a significant stress gradient in the y-axis direction, and stress extremes appear in the corner regions where adjacent assembly components are in contact.",Numerical Investigation of Heat/Flow Transfer and Thermal Stress in an Anode-Supported Planar SOFC,10.3390/cryst12121697
