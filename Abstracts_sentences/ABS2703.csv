1,2703,We herein report a thin film deposition of perovskite BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-delta (BCFZY) by pulsed laser depositing (PLD) method for the use as a cathode in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Pulsed laser deposition of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.01.034
2,2703,The BCFZY powder was first synthesized via sol-gel method and pelletized to employ it as a target in PLD system.,Pulsed laser deposition of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.01.034
3,2703,"As a result, the PLD-deposited thin BCFZY film showed nano-porous morphology and preferred nano-architecture for cathode of SOFCs.",Pulsed laser deposition of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.01.034
4,2703,"The applicability of the thin film BCFZY to SOFC cathode was even confirmed by fabricating an SOFC with BCFZY cathode and operating it at 500 degrees C, where stable open-circuit voltage of 1.13 V was measured for an hour.",Pulsed laser deposition of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.01.034
