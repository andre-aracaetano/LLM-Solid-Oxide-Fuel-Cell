1,3478,One approach to lower the cost of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is to lower the operating temperatures below 1073 K to allow the use of robust and comparatively inexpensive stainless steels not only for interconnects but also for SOFC support structures.,CHARACTERIZATION OF POROUS STAINLESS STEEL 430 FOR LOW- AND INTERMEDIATE-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL (SOFC) SUBSTRATES,10.1080/15435070903372510
2,3478,The metal supports must be sufficiently porous to facilitate gas flow toward the reactive sites in the electrodes.,CHARACTERIZATION OF POROUS STAINLESS STEEL 430 FOR LOW- AND INTERMEDIATE-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL (SOFC) SUBSTRATES,10.1080/15435070903372510
3,3478,Gas flow and electrical conductivity must remain adequate during any oxidation that occurs during operation.,CHARACTERIZATION OF POROUS STAINLESS STEEL 430 FOR LOW- AND INTERMEDIATE-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL (SOFC) SUBSTRATES,10.1080/15435070903372510
4,3478,"In order to identify microstructures most suitable for use as SOFC supports, a series of gas permeation and surface profilometry experiments was conducted to determine the permeability and surface roughness of porous steels (AISI 430) having different pore structures.",CHARACTERIZATION OF POROUS STAINLESS STEEL 430 FOR LOW- AND INTERMEDIATE-TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL (SOFC) SUBSTRATES,10.1080/15435070903372510
