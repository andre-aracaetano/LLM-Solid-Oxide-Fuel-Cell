1,18884,Microstructural evolution of a Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cell (SOEC) Ni-YSZ cermet cathode is investigated using three dimensional electrode characterisations.,Degradation study by 3D reconstruction of a nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia cathode after high temperature steam electrolysis operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.066
2,18884,"3D reconstructions are obtained on a reference and two long-term tested cells, which were maintained at -0.5 and -0.8 A cm(-2) for 1000 h at 800 degrees C. During the long term tests, air was fed at the anode and a mixture of 10% H-2-90% H2O was fed at the cathode.",Degradation study by 3D reconstruction of a nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia cathode after high temperature steam electrolysis operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.066
