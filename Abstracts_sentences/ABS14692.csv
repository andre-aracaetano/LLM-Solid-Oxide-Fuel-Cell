6,14692,"While (001)-oriented LSC60-40(113) thin films were found to have similar surface oxygen exchange coefficients to LSC60-40(113) bulk, surface coverage of (001)-oriented (La0.5Sr0.5)(2)CoO4 +/-delta (LSC214) on the LSC60-40(113) thin films led to significant enhancement in the surface oxygen kinetics up to similar to 3 orders of magnitude.",Oxygen Electrocatalysis on Epitaxial La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Perovskite Thin Films for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.018207jes
