4,19802,"The EIS response of four extreme kinetic scenarios, characterised by the rate-determining step (electron-transfer or ion-transfer) and the high/low surface coverage of adsorbed oxygen, is mechanistically interpreted for both dense films and porous electrodes.",Identifiability of the mechanisms governing the reaction kinetics of MIEC electrodes in solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2023.143418
