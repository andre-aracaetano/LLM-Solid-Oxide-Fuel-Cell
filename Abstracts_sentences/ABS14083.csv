1,14083,This work investigates the catalytic properties of Ir/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2x (Ir/CGO) catalyst and CGO support in steam reforming of methane in the absence or presence of H2S (50?ppm) for further application in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) working under methane at intermediate temperatures and integrating a gradual internal reforming concept.,Catalytic Steam Methane Reforming Over Ir/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-x: Resistance to Coke Formation and Sulfur Poisoning,10.1002/fuce.201100079
2,14083,The catalytic activity was measured at 750 degrees C by using a 50?mol.% CH4/5?mol.% H2O/45?mol.% N2 mixture and a 10?mol.% CH4/90?mol.% N2 mixture.,Catalytic Steam Methane Reforming Over Ir/Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-x: Resistance to Coke Formation and Sulfur Poisoning,10.1002/fuce.201100079
