1,1224,A novel composite was synthesized by mixing La0.1Sr0.9MnO3-delta (LSM) with Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) for the functional layer of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC).,Semiconductor-Ionic Nanocomposite La0.1Sr0.9MnO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ Functional Layer for High Performance Low Temperature SOFC,10.3390/ma11091549
2,1224,"Though LSM, a highly electronic conducting semiconductor, was used in the functional layer, the fuel cell device could reach OCVs higher than 1.0 V without short-circuit problem.",Semiconductor-Ionic Nanocomposite La0.1Sr0.9MnO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ Functional Layer for High Performance Low Temperature SOFC,10.3390/ma11091549
3,1224,"A typical diode or rectification effect was observed when an external electric force was supplied on the device under fuel cell atmosphere, which indicated the existence of a junction that prevented the device from short-circuit problem.",Semiconductor-Ionic Nanocomposite La0.1Sr0.9MnO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ Functional Layer for High Performance Low Temperature SOFC,10.3390/ma11091549
4,1224,The optimum ratio of LSM:SDC = 1:2 was found for the LT-SOFC to reach the highest power density of 742 mW.cm(-2) under 550 degrees C,Semiconductor-Ionic Nanocomposite La0.1Sr0.9MnO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ Functional Layer for High Performance Low Temperature SOFC,10.3390/ma11091549
5,1224,"The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data highlighted that introducing LSM into SDC electrolyte layer not only decreased charge-transfer resistances from 0.66 Omega.cm(2) for SDC to 0.47-0.49 Omega.cm(2) for LSM-SDC composite, but also decreased the activation energy of ionic conduction from 0.55 to 0.20 eV.",Semiconductor-Ionic Nanocomposite La0.1Sr0.9MnO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ Functional Layer for High Performance Low Temperature SOFC,10.3390/ma11091549
