(KEPCO) and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (MMC) have been jointly developing disc-type intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) since 2001.",Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
2,11717,Operation temperatures between 600 and 800 degrees C have been set as the target.,Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
3,11717,These temperatures enable SOFCs to use inexpensive metallic separators for cell-stacking and are sufficiently high for steam reforming of the hydrocarbon fuel.,Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
4,11717,A I kW-class demonstration power generation system with a module that had a steam-reforming function was developed in 2003.,Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
5,11717,The third generation module and the fourth generation module were developed in 2004.,Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
6,11717,The third generation module was integrated into the system for various tests including long-term stability.,Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
7,11717,The fourth generation module was examined for performance evaluation.,Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
8,11717,"The system included an SOFC module, a dc-ac inverter, a desulfurizer, a heat-recovery unit, and an automatic control device.",Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
9,11717,The long-term stability test for over 1000 h gave no decrease in stack voltage.,Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
10,11717,"In parallel, the long-term stability test of a single cell stack unit was continued for over 10,000 It.",Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
11,11717,"In addition, hot water at 90 degrees C was obtained by the heat-recovery unit using high temperatures off-gas from the SOFC module.",Development of disc-type intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.003
12,11717,The newly developed fourth generation module gave an electrical efficiency of 60% (dc/lower heating value) using town gas as a fuel at an average stack temperatures of about 750 degrees C.
