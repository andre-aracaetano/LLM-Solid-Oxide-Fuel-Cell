1,7672,A La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM)/La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) core-shell structured composite cathode of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has been fabricated by wet infiltration followed by a rapid sintering (RS) process.,A La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ core-shell structured cathode by a rapid sintering process for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.036
2,7672,The RS is carried out by placing LSCF infiltrated LSM electrodes directly into a preheated furnace at 800 degrees C for 10 min and cooling down very quickly.,A La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ core-shell structured cathode by a rapid sintering process for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.036
