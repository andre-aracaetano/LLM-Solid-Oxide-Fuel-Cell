5,8075,The transition of oxygen through membranes based on materials studied is determined to the large extent by the kinetics of surface exchange which depends on the rate of delivery of oxygen vacancies to the surface.,"Stability, mixed conductivity, and thermomechanical properties of perovskite materials for fuel cell electrodes based on La0.5A0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-δ, La0.5Ba0.5Ti0.5Fe0.5O3-δ, and (La0.5D0.5)0.95Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-δ (A = Ca, Ba)",10.1134/S1023193516070089
6,8075,"Doping of ferrites with chromium or titanium decreases the electronic and ionic conductivity; however, the presence of substituents in D' sublattice makes it possible to stabilize the perovskite phase in a wide range of NEuro(D-2), decrease the thermal and chemical expansion, and prevent to the large extent the ordering of oxygen vacancies, which allows one to consider these materials as the candidates for electrodes in symmetrical solid-oxide fuel cells.","Stability, mixed conductivity, and thermomechanical properties of perovskite materials for fuel cell electrodes based on La0.5A0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-δ, La0.5Ba0.5Ti0.5Fe0.5O3-δ, and (La0.5D0.5)0.95Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-δ (A = Ca, Ba)",10.1134/S1023193516070089
