1,19887,The present work explores the possibility of incorporation of silicon into the crystal structure of Ruddlesden-Popper La2NiO4+delta mixed conducting ceramics with the aim to improve the chemical compatibility with lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes.,Impact of Silica Additions on the Phase Composition and Electrical Transport Properties of Ruddlesden-Popper La2NiO4+δ Mixed Conducting Ceramics,10.3390/pr10010082
2,19887,"Ceramics with the nominal composition La2Ni1-ySiyO4+delta (y = 0, 0.02 and 0.05) were prepared by the glycine nitrate combustion technique and sintered at 1450 degrees C. While minor changes in the lattice parameters of the tetragonal K2NiF4-type lattice may suggest incorporation of a small fraction of Si into the Ni sublattice, combined XRD and SEM/EDS studies indicate that this fraction is very limited (MUCH LESS-THAN2 at.%, if any).",Impact of Silica Additions on the Phase Composition and Electrical Transport Properties of Ruddlesden-Popper La2NiO4+δ Mixed Conducting Ceramics,10.3390/pr10010082

5,19887,The preferential reactivity of silica with lanthanum oxide opens a possibility to improve the compatibility between lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes and La2NiO4+delta-based electrodes by appropriate surface modifications.,Impact of Silica Additions on the Phase Composition and Electrical Transport Properties of Ruddlesden-Popper La2NiO4+δ Mixed Conducting Ceramics,10.3390/pr10010082
6,19887,The promising potential of this approach is supported by preliminary tests of electrodes infiltrated with lanthanum oxide.,Impact of Silica Additions on the Phase Composition and Electrical Transport Properties of Ruddlesden-Popper La2NiO4+δ Mixed Conducting Ceramics,10.3390/pr10010082
