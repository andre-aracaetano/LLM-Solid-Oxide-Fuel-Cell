1,9468,"In this study, thin molybdenum-containing, nickel-based metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs) were fabricated through atmospheric plasma spraying and then characterized.",Characterization of thin metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells fabricated through atmospheric Plasma spraying,10.1002/fuce.202200205
2,9468,"We investigated the change in cell performance associated with the reduction of the Ni-Mo support layer thickness from 200 to 80 & mu;m and reduction of the substrate sintering temperature from 1200 to 1000 & DEG;C. At a cell voltage of 0.6 V, the measured maximum power density values of a 50 x 50 mm(2) MS-SOFC were 313, 581, 890, and 1098 mW cm(-2) at 600, 650, 700, and 750 & DEG;C, respectively.",Characterization of thin metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells fabricated through atmospheric Plasma spraying,10.1002/fuce.202200205
3,9468,"A 100 x 100 mm(2) (commercial-size) MS-SOFC and an assembled single-cell MS-SOFC stack exhibited electric output power values of approximately 33 and 39 W at 700 and 750 & DEG;C, respectively, and an effective electrode area of 81 cm(2).",Characterization of thin metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells fabricated through atmospheric Plasma spraying,10.1002/fuce.202200205
4,9468,"In a long-term stability test, the commercial-size cell and single-cell stack exhibited a degradation rate of approximately 1% after 1000 h of operation at a current density of 250-300 mA cm(-2) and temperature of 700 & DEG;C. Moreover, a five-cell MS-SOFC stack demonstrated a stack power of 180.85 W at 3.792 V (446.5 mW cm(-2) at 0.758 V) and 750 & DEG;C.",Characterization of thin metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells fabricated through atmospheric Plasma spraying,10.1002/fuce.202200205
