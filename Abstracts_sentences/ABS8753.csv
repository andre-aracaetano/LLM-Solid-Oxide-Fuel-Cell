1,8753,"The electrochemical response of proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells (PC-SOFC) with Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) cermet anode by low-ppm(v) level hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was studied using both electrolyte-supported cells and anode symmetrical cells at 750-450 degrees C. Upon the introduction of H2S, both types of cells show small but observable increase in the electrode apparent interfacial resistance (R-ai) with no change in ohmic resistance.",H2S Poisoning of Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Comparison with Conventional Oxide-Ion Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/2.0841810jes
2,8753,"In addition, secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis on Ni-BZCYYb composite pellets after exposure to H2S showed a strong correlation between the distributions of barium and sulfur species, yet both were complementary to the distribution of nickel species.",H2S Poisoning of Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Comparison with Conventional Oxide-Ion Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/2.0841810jes
3,8753,The results indicate that PC-SOFC are still subjected to poisoning by low ppm(v)-level H2S at intermediate temperature.,H2S Poisoning of Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Comparison with Conventional Oxide-Ion Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/2.0841810jes
4,8753,"However, the H2S poisoning effect (in terms of relative increase in interfacial resistance) for PC-SOFC appears much smaller than for conventional oxide-ion conducting SOFC with Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet anode and YSZ electrolyte.",H2S Poisoning of Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Comparison with Conventional Oxide-Ion Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/2.0841810jes
5,8753,Such a difference in H2S poisoning behavior is hypothesized to be related to the different anode reaction process for PC-SOFC versus conventional oxide-ion conducting SOFC and the potential (electro-)catalytic role that proton conducting ceramic electrolyte might play in the anode reaction.,H2S Poisoning of Proton Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and Comparison with Conventional Oxide-Ion Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1149/2.0841810jes
