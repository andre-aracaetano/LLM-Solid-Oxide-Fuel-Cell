1,2132,"We demonstrate the use of a novel pulse (18)O-(16)O isotopic exchange technique for the rapid determination of the oxygen surface exchange rate of oxide ion conductors while simultaneously providing insight into the mechanism of the oxygen exchange reaction, which contributes to the efficient development of devices incorporating these solids, such as solid oxide fuel cells and oxygen transport membranes.",A novel pulse isotopic exchange technique for rapid determination of the oxygen surface exchange rate of oxide ion conductors,10.1039/b912712g
