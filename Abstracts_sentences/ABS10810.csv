1,10810,"In this study, the crystal structure, thermal, oxygen transport, electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties of the perovskite NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta (NBSC55) are investigated.","Oxygen transport, thermal and electrochemical properties of NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ cathode for SOFCs",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.01.022
2,10810,"In the temperature range of 250 degrees C-350 degrees C, the weight loss upon heating was due to a partial loss of lattice oxygen and along with a reduction of Co(4+ )to Co3+.","Oxygen transport, thermal and electrochemical properties of NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ cathode for SOFCs",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.01.022
3,10810,The tend of weight-loss slows down as temperature increased above 350 degrees C indicating a reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ during this stage.,"Oxygen transport, thermal and electrochemical properties of NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ cathode for SOFCs",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.01.022
4,10810,"The oxygen migration is dominated by surface exchange process at high temperature range (650-800 degrees C); however, the bulk diffusion process prevails at low temperature range (500-600 degrees C).","Oxygen transport, thermal and electrochemical properties of NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+δ cathode for SOFCs",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.01.022
