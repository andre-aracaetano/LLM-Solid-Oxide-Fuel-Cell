1,9051,"Although some perovskite oxides have been shown to be stable solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes, the actual crystal structure of these materials under operating conditions is largely unknown.",Structural and Chemical Evolution of the SOFC Anode La0.30Sr0.70Fe0.70Cr0.30O3-δ upon Reduction and Oxidation: An in Situ Neutron Diffraction Study,10.1021/cm100609e
2,9051,"In this paper, the structural evolution or the SOFC anode La0.30Sr0.70Fe0.70Cr0.30O3-delta was studied at 800 and 900 degrees C (similar to SOFC operating temperatures) in progressively reducimg and oxidizing environments.",Structural and Chemical Evolution of the SOFC Anode La0.30Sr0.70Fe0.70Cr0.30O3-δ upon Reduction and Oxidation: An in Situ Neutron Diffraction Study,10.1021/cm100609e
3,9051,"The perovskite was shown to be stable down to a pO(2) of 10(-20) atm at 800 degrees C and a pO(2) of 10(-18) atm at 900 degrees C, at which point a spinel phase formed.",Structural and Chemical Evolution of the SOFC Anode La0.30Sr0.70Fe0.70Cr0.30O3-δ upon Reduction and Oxidation: An in Situ Neutron Diffraction Study,10.1021/cm100609e
