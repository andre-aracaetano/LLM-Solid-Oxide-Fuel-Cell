1,1318,In this work a combined heat and power unit (CHP unit) based on the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology is analysed.,Feed-forward control of a solid oxide fuel cell system with anode offgas recycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.053
2,1318,This unit has a special feature: the anode offgas is partially recycled to the anode inlet.,Feed-forward control of a solid oxide fuel cell system with anode offgas recycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.053
3,1318,Thus it is possible to increase the electrical efficiency and the system can be operated without external water feeding.,Feed-forward control of a solid oxide fuel cell system with anode offgas recycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.053
4,1318,A feed-forward control concept which allows secure operating conditions of the CHP unit as well as a maximization of its electrical efficiency is introduced and validated experimentally.,Feed-forward control of a solid oxide fuel cell system with anode offgas recycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.053
5,1318,The control algorithm requires a limited number of measurement values and few deterministic relations for its description.,Feed-forward control of a solid oxide fuel cell system with anode offgas recycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.053
