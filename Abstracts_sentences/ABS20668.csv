4,20668,"The cell consisted of a 3YSZ electrolyte, CGO diffusion-barrier/adhesion layers, a lanthanum strontium cobaltite ferrite (LSCF) oxygen electrode, and a nickel/gadolinia-doped ceria (Ni/GDC) steam/hydrogen electrode.","80,000 current on/off cycles in a one year long steam electrolysis test with a solid oxide cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.05.124
5,20668,"The test included two operation blocks with each 40,000 cycles of 2 min duration and a current density of -0.7 Acm(-2) in the ON mode (-0.07 Acm-(2) in OFF mode), as well as steady-state ON periods with 5800 h duration.","80,000 current on/off cycles in a one year long steam electrolysis test with a solid oxide cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.05.124
