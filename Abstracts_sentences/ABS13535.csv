2,13535,"In this work, a novel dual-layer ceramic hollow fiber for a cathode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cell (MT-SOFC) has been successfully developed via a co-spinning-sintering technique.",Novel cathode-supported hollow fibers for light weight micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with an active cathode functional layer,10.1039/c4ta04635h
3,13535,"The green cathode hollow fibers, in dual layer configuration, consisting of a La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) main layer and a LSM-Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) functional layer with increased three phase boundary length, are first prepared by co-spinning, which are then sintered at around 1350 degrees C to allow the creation of sufficient mechanical strength.",Novel cathode-supported hollow fibers for light weight micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with an active cathode functional layer,10.1039/c4ta04635h
4,13535,Other cell components like the electrolyte (YSZ) and anode (NiO + YSZ) are then coated separately.,Novel cathode-supported hollow fibers for light weight micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with an active cathode functional layer,10.1039/c4ta04635h
5,13535,The coated electrolyte film with a thickness of around 27 mu m is obtained by co-sintering of YSZ/LSM-YSZ/LSM in a sandwich structure.,Novel cathode-supported hollow fibers for light weight micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells with an active cathode functional layer,10.1039/c4ta04635h
