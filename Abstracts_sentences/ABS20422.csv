9,20422,"These rare-earth-doped ceria powders with various sizes were formed by uniaxial pressing (49 MPa) followed by cold isostatic pressing (294 MPa), and sintered at 900-1600 degrees C in air for 4 h. The micrometer-sized-doped CeO2 powders were densified above 95% of the theoretical density at 1200 degrees C, The grain size of rare-earth-doped ceria after sintering at 1600 degrees C was larger in the samples with the larger rare-earth element.",Synthesis and sintering of rare-earth-doped ceria powder by the oxalate coprecipitation method,10.1557/JMR.1999.0127
