1,11469,The compatibility of bismuth compounds as a sintering aid for (ZrO2)(0.89)(ScO1.5)(0.1)(CeO2)(0.01) (ScSZ) electrolyte in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) has been discussed.,Effects of Bi Addition on Sintering and Electrical Properties of Scandia Stabilized Zirocnia as Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Electrolyte,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.184
2,11469,Addition of 3 mol% BiO1.5 considerably decreased the sintering temperature of ScSZ of approximately 200 C and achieved the densification with a relative density above 95% at 1200 degrees C.,Effects of Bi Addition on Sintering and Electrical Properties of Scandia Stabilized Zirocnia as Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Electrolyte,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.184
3,11469,The solid solubility limit of BiO1.5 in ScSZ was less than 2 mol%.,Effects of Bi Addition on Sintering and Electrical Properties of Scandia Stabilized Zirocnia as Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Electrolyte,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.184
4,11469,"Dispersion of Bi2O3 at the grain boundaries correspondingly accelerated the growth of ScSZ grains and increased the grain boundary resistance at temperatures below 450 degrees C. At elevated temperatures of 450-750 degrees C, the electrical conductivity of the ScSZ after doping remained almost unchangeable in air and under reducing atmospheres.",Effects of Bi Addition on Sintering and Electrical Properties of Scandia Stabilized Zirocnia as Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Electrolyte,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.184
5,11469,The results suggested that bismuth addition is promising to be applicable to a low-temperature co-firing fabrication of ScSZ based components for IT-SOFCs.,Effects of Bi Addition on Sintering and Electrical Properties of Scandia Stabilized Zirocnia as Intermediate-Temperature SOFC Electrolyte,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.184
