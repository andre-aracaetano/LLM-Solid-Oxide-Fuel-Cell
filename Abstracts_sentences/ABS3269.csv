5,3269,"The relationship between the microstructure, interfacial properties and the electrochemical behaviour of the cathode material is not a static one.","Issues on development of (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00814-0
6,3269,"Rather, it changes and evolves constantly under fuel-cell operation conditions.","Issues on development of (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00814-0
7,3269,"Such dynamic relationship between the properties and the electrochemical behaviour is important for the fundamental understanding of the mechanism and kinetics of the oxygen reduction at LSM cathodes, and for the development of high-performance cathodes for SOFCs that operate at intermediate temperatures (600-800 degreesC).","Issues on development of (La,Sr)MnO3 cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00814-0
