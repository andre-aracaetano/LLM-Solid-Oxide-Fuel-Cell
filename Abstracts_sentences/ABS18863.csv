6,18863,"In this paper, the difficulties associated with CVD growth of oxide films using solid phase precursors such as Ce(fod), which contain fluorinated ligands are discussed as well as the methods used to eliminate such problems, The variation of important CVD parameters such as moist oxygen flow rate are discussed in terms of their effect on the growth rate and the elemental composition of the deposited films.",The use of Ce(fod)(4) as a precursor for the growth of ceria films by metal-organic chemical vapour deposition,10.1016/0040-6090(95)08193-3
