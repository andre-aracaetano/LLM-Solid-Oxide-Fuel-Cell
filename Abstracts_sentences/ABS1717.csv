1,1717,In the current research the third generation of tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) which is believed to solve the redox cycling problem is introduced and the cell configuration is discussed.,Fabrication of thin porous electrolyte-supported tubular fuel cells using slip casting,
2,1717,This type of ceramic fuel cell consists of a slip cast porous support of approximately 500 mu m thickness coated with a thin dense electrolyte layer both made of calcined YSZ.,Fabrication of thin porous electrolyte-supported tubular fuel cells using slip casting,
3,1717,The porous support can have up to 50% porosity as a result of both the preliminary calcination of YSZ powder and the addition of a pore former.,Fabrication of thin porous electrolyte-supported tubular fuel cells using slip casting,
4,1717,Different parameters that affect the porosity content and thickness of the supports are also studied.,Fabrication of thin porous electrolyte-supported tubular fuel cells using slip casting,
5,1717,It is shown that the short casting time required for high porosity tubes can be controlled by modifying the solid loading of the slip and/or the porosity of the plaster mold.,Fabrication of thin porous electrolyte-supported tubular fuel cells using slip casting,
6,1717,"Finally, multiple casting is introduced as a coating method in which the electrolyte layer with the required thickness can be slip cast directly onto the porous support.",Fabrication of thin porous electrolyte-supported tubular fuel cells using slip casting,
