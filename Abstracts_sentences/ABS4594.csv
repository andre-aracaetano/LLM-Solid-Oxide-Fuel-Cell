1,4594,"A planar thin-film solid oxide fuel cell has been fabricated with an inexpensive, scalable, technique involving colloidal deposition of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) films on porous NiO-YSZ substrates, yielding solid oxide fuel cells capable of exceptional power density at operating temperatures of 700 to 800 degrees C.",Reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on YSZ thin-film electrolyte,10.1149/1.1837484
2,4594,"The thickness of the YSZ film deposited onto the porous substrate is approximately 10 mu m after sintering, and is well bonded to the NiO/YSZ substrate.",Reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on YSZ thin-film electrolyte,10.1149/1.1837484
3,4594,"Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSM cells built with this technique have exhibited theoretical open-circuit potentials (OCPs), high current densities, and exceptionally good power densities of over 1900 mW/cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Electrochemical characterization of the cells indicates negligible losses across the Ni-YSZ/YSZ interface and minor polarization of the fuel electrode.",Reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on YSZ thin-film electrolyte,10.1149/1.1837484
4,4594,Thin-film cells have been tested for long periods of time (over 700 h) and have been thermally cycled from 650 to 800 degrees C while demonstrating excellent stability over time.,Reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cell based on YSZ thin-film electrolyte,10.1149/1.1837484
