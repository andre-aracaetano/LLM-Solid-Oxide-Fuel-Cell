2,1913,"The major requirements of stack and module builders for these materials are the stability of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), the excellent bonding (sticking) behaviour and the absence of volatile ingredients, which can lead to changes of the material properties and the sealing ability.",Investigation properties of BaO/RO-Al2O3-R2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s41779-017-0036-8
3,1913,"In this study, the thermal stability of glasses in the BaO-Al2O3-La2O3-B2O3-SiO2 system was investigated, to develop a suitable sealing glass for planar solid oxide fuel cell operating at 800-850 degrees C.",Investigation properties of BaO/RO-Al2O3-R2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s41779-017-0036-8
