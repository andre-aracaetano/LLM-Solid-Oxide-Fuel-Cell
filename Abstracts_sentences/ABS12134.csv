1,12134,A ferrite-based perovskite oxide La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-delta (LSFMo) has been evaluated as the anode of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC).,High performance ferrite-based anode La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.157
2,12134,XRD result indicates that no metallic iron precipitates from the lattice when the LSFMo was reduced under reducing atmosphere.,High performance ferrite-based anode La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.157
3,12134,The LSFMo exhibits a n-type semiconducting behavior in dry H-2 and its conductivity values attain 2.5-6.8 S cm(-1) at 600-850 degrees C.,High performance ferrite-based anode La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.157
4,12134,"The polarization resistances (R-p) of LSFMo anode on La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte are 9.08 cm(2) at 700 degrees C and 3.04 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C in dry H-2 under open-circuit condition; however, with introducing a Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) interlayer between the anode and electrolyte, the R-p values are decreased to 1.54 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C and 0.50 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C.",High performance ferrite-based anode La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.157
5,12134,"The maximum power densities (P-max) of the LSGM supported single cell with configuration of LSFMo/SDC/LSGM/ Ba0.6Sr0.4Co0.9Nb0.1O3-delta achieve 722 mW cm(-2) in H-2 and 513 mW cm(-2) in CH4 at 800 degrees C. Moreover, good power cycle stability of the cell in CH4 means excellent carbon resistance of the LSFMo anode.",High performance ferrite-based anode La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.157
