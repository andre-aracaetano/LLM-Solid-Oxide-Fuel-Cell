3,1578,"An excellent fuel cell performance, e.g. a maximum power density of 1107 W cm(-2), has been shown for a symmetrical fuel cell that contained ZnO/NiO nanocomposite electrodes at 500 degrees C. To our knowledge, to date this is by far the highest power density achieved at this temperature.",ZnO/NiO nanocomposite electrodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2011.05.032
