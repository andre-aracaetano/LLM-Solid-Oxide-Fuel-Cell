1,11478,"In this study, the main sections required to produce electricity in an SOFC short stack starting from biogas were studied and tested at a lab-scale level.",Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell short-stack with biogas feeding,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.040
2,11478,"A test-rig including a cleaning unit, a reformer and an SOFC stack was built and used to run a test of 500 h. In the plant, an in-house planar SOFC short stack (composed of three nickel based anode-supported cells) was fed by a simulated biogas mixture (60 vol.% CH4, 40 vol.% CO2) contaminated by 30 ppmv of H2S (the main contaminant found in biogas, and deleterious for both the reformer and fuel cells).",Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell short-stack with biogas feeding,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.040
3,11478,"In the plant, H2S is first removed from the gas stream by adsorption in a fixed bed reactor packed with Na-X zeolites.",Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell short-stack with biogas feeding,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.040
4,11478,The mixture was also passed on a ZnO guard bed (heated at 300 degrees C) before feeding the reformer unit in order to guarantee a durable and stable operation of the same.,Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell short-stack with biogas feeding,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.040
5,11478,"The reformer uses a Ni-based catalyst, and was operated at similar to 700 degrees C in a mixed steam-/dry-reforming condition to produce a gas mixture suitable for the Ni-based SOFC with CH4 converted almost entirely to H-2 and CO.",Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell short-stack with biogas feeding,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.040
6,11478,"The 3-cells short stack was operated at 800 degrees C and 0.1 A cm(-2) for more than 500 h. The gas analysis was performed, via a mass spectrometer, in several points of the plant.",Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell short-stack with biogas feeding,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.040
7,11478,"These measurements indicated that no sulfur breakthrough takes place from the zeolites bed, and furthermore that the catalyst has a quite stable behavior.",Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell short-stack with biogas feeding,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.040
8,11478,Results clearly show how a SOFC stack can be successfully operated with a contaminated biogenous gas mixture as fuel.,Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell short-stack with biogas feeding,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.040
9,11478,"As a matter of fact the cell stack exhibited a regular behavior, with no signs of degradation in the complete test.",Performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell short-stack with biogas feeding,10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.040
