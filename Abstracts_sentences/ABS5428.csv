2,5428,"Three cells with the configuration of Ni-YSZ/YSZ/Nd2NiO4+delta-YSZ were fabricated with different pore-formers, such as graphite, PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) or an equal mixture of both, which were added to the Ni-YSZ support during the fabrication process.",The effect of pore-former morphology on the electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells under combined fuel cell and electrolysis modes,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.02.055
3,5428,The results show that the Ni-YSZ support containing graphite leads to a more porous support and formation of coarser pores in the vicinity of the electrolyte.,The effect of pore-former morphology on the electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells under combined fuel cell and electrolysis modes,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.02.055
4,5428,"This leads to a reduction in the triple phase boundary (TPB) length with a corresponding increase of activation polarization and, as a consequence, the overall cell performance decreases in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes.",The effect of pore-former morphology on the electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells under combined fuel cell and electrolysis modes,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.02.055
5,5428,"The cell having PMMA delivered the highest performance under both operation modes (818 and -713 mAcm(-2) were obtained in SOFC and SOEC modes at 800 degrees C), due to finer pores next to the electrolyte.",The effect of pore-former morphology on the electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells under combined fuel cell and electrolysis modes,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.02.055
6,5428,The cell having the mixture of both pore-formers delivered intermediate results.,The effect of pore-former morphology on the electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells under combined fuel cell and electrolysis modes,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.02.055
7,5428,All the cells show similar concentration polarization values meaning that even the least porous cell (PMMA) provided sufficient porosity for gas flow.,The effect of pore-former morphology on the electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells under combined fuel cell and electrolysis modes,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.02.055
