1,20152,"State-of-the-art air electrodes such as (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSM) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3+delta (LSCF) for solid oxide cells (SOCs), suffer from sluggish oxygen exchange kinetics and high activation energy at reduced temperatures, thus dramatically decreasing their performance.",Boosting the performance of conventional air electrodes for solid oxide cells by in-situ loading of nano praseodymium oxide,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114873
2,20152,"Herein, we demonstrate a simple strategy to boost the activities of these conventional air electrodes.",Boosting the performance of conventional air electrodes for solid oxide cells by in-situ loading of nano praseodymium oxide,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114873
3,20152,"Praseodymium oxide nano-catalysts were in-situ homogeneously incorporated into LSM, LSCF, and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSC) air electrodes during the SOC startup via a facile one-step urea-based infiltration method.",Boosting the performance of conventional air electrodes for solid oxide cells by in-situ loading of nano praseodymium oxide,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114873
4,20152,"The polarization resistance of LSM can be reduced to<1/10 of its original value, while LSCF and LSC can be reduced to about 1/2 - 1/4 of their original resistances at 600-800 C. This approach dramatically enhances the cell performances, typically increases the SOFC power outputs and electrolysis current densities (at 600 degrees C) by>5 times for LSM, more than two times for LSCF, and approximately two times for LSC.",Boosting the performance of conventional air electrodes for solid oxide cells by in-situ loading of nano praseodymium oxide,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114873
5,20152,"Furthermore, the infiltrated LSC electrode show good durability of 132 h at 700 degrees C under electrolysis mode.",Boosting the performance of conventional air electrodes for solid oxide cells by in-situ loading of nano praseodymium oxide,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114873
6,20152,This work demonstrates a facile and cost-effective way to boost the performance of conventional air electrodes for SOC and is also applicable to the studies involving similar oxygen exchange reactions for various energy conversion and storage systems.,Boosting the performance of conventional air electrodes for solid oxide cells by in-situ loading of nano praseodymium oxide,10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114873
