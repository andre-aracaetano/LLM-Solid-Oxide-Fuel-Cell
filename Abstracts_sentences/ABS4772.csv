1,4772,We prepared button-sized and 5 x 5 cm(2) electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells.,Performance and stability of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells: from button-sized to 5 x 5 cm2,10.1007/s43207-023-00359-5
2,4772,"The button-sized cell with a 150-micron-thin electrolyte shows a peak power density of 0.58 Wcm(- 2), whereas that with a 280-micron-thick electrolyte shows a peak power density of 0.42 Wcm(- 2), at 800 degrees C, indicating that the performance of electrolyte-supported cells (ESCs) is dominated by electrolyte thickness.",Performance and stability of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells: from button-sized to 5 x 5 cm2,10.1007/s43207-023-00359-5
3,4772,"The 5 x 5 cm(2) cell was tested, and its peak power density was found to be comparable to that of a button-sized cell with the same electrolyte thickness.",Performance and stability of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells: from button-sized to 5 x 5 cm2,10.1007/s43207-023-00359-5
4,4772,An electrode-segmented 5 x 5 cm(2) ESC was prepared to investigate the in-plane performance variation of the ESCs.,Performance and stability of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells: from button-sized to 5 x 5 cm2,10.1007/s43207-023-00359-5
5,4772,"The electrochemical performances of the inlet and outlet regions were almost identical, in contrast to those of anode-supported cells.",Performance and stability of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells: from button-sized to 5 x 5 cm2,10.1007/s43207-023-00359-5
6,4772,"The uniformity of in-plane performance distribution, i.e., in-plane anode gas concentration distribution, improved considerably in ESCs when utilizing a thinner anode (similar to 20 micron).",Performance and stability of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells: from button-sized to 5 x 5 cm2,10.1007/s43207-023-00359-5
7,4772,"A nonuniform gas concentration distribution can lead to anode degradation associated with Ni re-oxidation, and therefore, the electrolyte-support type is preferred for mitigating anode performance degradation.",Performance and stability of electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells: from button-sized to 5 x 5 cm2,10.1007/s43207-023-00359-5
