5,8015,"The results show that when the alcohol was used as solvent, at a spray distance of 60 mm, the as-sprayed LSM deposits presented porous agglomerates with a size range from 10 to 60 mu m which were mainly composed of small particles ranging from 0.2 to 2 mu m. The LSM cathode showed a finely porous microstructure with grain sizes from micrometers to submicrometers, Annealing at 1050 degrees C for 2 h in air resulted in coherent porous films of the perovskite phase with a fine microstructure.",Microstructure and polarization of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode deposited by alcohol solution precursor plasma spraying,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.05.081
