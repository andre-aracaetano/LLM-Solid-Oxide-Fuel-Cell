2,20759,"Results of the steady-state polarization measurements, which are formulated into the Butler-Volmer formalism to extract transfer coefficient values, lead us to conclude that the two-electron charge transfer step to atomically adsorbed oxygen is rate-limiting.",Active reaction sites and oxygen reduction kinetics on La1-xSrxMnO3+δ (x = 0.1-0.4) YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
3,20759,"The same conclusion is drawn from the P-O2-dependent ac impedance measurements, where the exponent m in the relationship of I-0 (exchange current density) proportional to P-O2(m) is analyzed.",Active reaction sites and oxygen reduction kinetics on La1-xSrxMnO3+δ (x = 0.1-0.4) YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
4,20759,Chemical analysis is performed on the quenched Mn perovskites to estimate their oxygen stoichiometry factors (delta) at the operating temperature (700-900 degrees C).,Active reaction sites and oxygen reduction kinetics on La1-xSrxMnO3+δ (x = 0.1-0.4) YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
5,20759,"Here, the observed delta turns out to become smaller as both the Sr-doping contents (x) and the measured temperature increase.",Active reaction sites and oxygen reduction kinetics on La1-xSrxMnO3+δ (x = 0.1-0.4) YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
6,20759,"A comparison between the delta values and cathodic activity of Mn perovskites reveals that the cathodic transfer coefficients (alpha(c)) for oxygen reduction reaction are inversely proportional to delta whereas the anodic ones (alpha(a)) show the opposite trend, reflecting that the surface oxygen vacancies on Mn perovskites actively participate in the O-2 reduction reaction.",Active reaction sites and oxygen reduction kinetics on La1-xSrxMnO3+δ (x = 0.1-0.4) YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
7,20759,"Among the samples of x=0.1-0.4, the manganite with x=0.4 exhibits the smallest delta value (even negative), and consistently this electrode shows the highest alpha(c) and the best cathodic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction.",Active reaction sites and oxygen reduction kinetics on La1-xSrxMnO3+δ (x = 0.1-0.4) YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells,
