1,18289,The authors newly propose and investigate two types of carbon dioxide recovering SOFC/GT combined power generation systems in which a gas turbine with carbon dioxide recycle or water vapor injection is adopted as the bottoming cycle.,High performance SOFC/GT combined power generation system with CO2 recovery by oxygen combustion method,10.1016/j.enconman.2004.08.011
2,18289,"In these systems, fuel gas is first introduced to a SOFC, and its exhaust fuel gas is afterburned by pure oxygen.",High performance SOFC/GT combined power generation system with CO2 recovery by oxygen combustion method,10.1016/j.enconman.2004.08.011
3,18289,Carbon dioxide or water vapor is also injected into the combustor to reduce the combustion gas temperature.,High performance SOFC/GT combined power generation system with CO2 recovery by oxygen combustion method,10.1016/j.enconman.2004.08.011

5,18289,"The exhaust gas of the gas turbine preheats the injection gas, and then, carbon dioxide is separated by only cooling and water condensation.",High performance SOFC/GT combined power generation system with CO2 recovery by oxygen combustion method,10.1016/j.enconman.2004.08.011
6,18289,"It is made clear that the overall efficiency of the system with carbon dioxide recycle reaches 63.87% (HHV) or 70.88% (LHV), and that of the system with water vapor injection reaches 65.00% (HHV) or 72.13% (LHV).",High performance SOFC/GT combined power generation system with CO2 recovery by oxygen combustion method,10.1016/j.enconman.2004.08.011
7,18289,"These values are sufficiently high, indicating that the proposed systems are worth further research and development.",High performance SOFC/GT combined power generation system with CO2 recovery by oxygen combustion method,10.1016/j.enconman.2004.08.011
