1,17220,The dielectric relaxation behavior of the fluorite structured nanocrystalline Ce0.8Gd0.1Pr0.1O2-delta compound was studied in the temperature range of 200-550 degrees C. Two different types of relaxation processes were observed corresponding to (1) defect pairs such as (Pr-Ce(')-V-O)(center dot) and (Gd-Ce(')-V-O)(center dot) and (2) the trimers such as (Pr-Ce(')-V-O(center dot center dot)-Gd-Ce(')).,Dielectric relaxation properties of nanostructured Ce0.8Gd0.1Pr0.1O2-δ material at intermediate temperatures,10.1063/1.3083556
