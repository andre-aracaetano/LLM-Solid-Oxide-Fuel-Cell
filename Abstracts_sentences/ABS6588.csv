1,6588,Porosity graded anode substrates for solid oxide fuel cells are considered to optimise the gas transport through the substrate by maintaining a high electrochemical activity for fuel oxidation at the anode/solid electrolyte interface.,Preparation of porosity-graded SOFC anode substrates,10.1002/fuce.200500116
2,6588,"In this work, the fabrication of porosity graded anode substrates, made from nickel oxide and yttria-modified zirconia and produced by dry uni-axial pressing, are described.",Preparation of porosity-graded SOFC anode substrates,10.1002/fuce.200500116
3,6588,"Using carbon as pore formers and adjusting the particle size distribution in the ceramic NiO-YSZ masses, samples with gradually changing porosity are built up.",Preparation of porosity-graded SOFC anode substrates,10.1002/fuce.200500116
4,6588,The sintering behaviour of the individual layers is analysed and partly adjusted so the multi-layer support can be co-fired together with the YSZ electrolyte layer.,Preparation of porosity-graded SOFC anode substrates,10.1002/fuce.200500116
