2,19598,"In this study, tri-layer samples of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/(La0.8Sr0.2)(x)MnO3 (LSM)/AISI 441 stainless steel are made and thermally treated in dry air atmosphere at 800 C for 500 h. The air electrode composition is varied by changing the x value in (La0.8Sr0.2)(x)MnO3 from 0.95 to 1.05 (L5M95, LSM100, and LSM105).",Surface and interface behaviors of (La0.8Sr0.2)xMnO3 air electrode for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.052
