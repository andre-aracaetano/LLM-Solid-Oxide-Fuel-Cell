2,20891,The Nb1-xTixO2 rutile system offers particularly high electronic conductivity and has good chemical compatibility with SOFC components and seems an interesting candidate.,Niobia Based Rutile Materials as SOFC Anodes,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<249::AID-FUCE249>3.0.CO;2-A
3,20891,"Of the three stable phases in the Nb2O5-TiO2 system, Nb2TiO7 was chosen as starting composition as it has the highest Ti content and so exhibits the highest conductivity when reduced to rutile.",Niobia Based Rutile Materials as SOFC Anodes,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<249::AID-FUCE249>3.0.CO;2-A
4,20891,Nb2TiO7 was prepared by standard solid state reaction at 1250 degrees C for 48 hours in air.,Niobia Based Rutile Materials as SOFC Anodes,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<249::AID-FUCE249>3.0.CO;2-A

6,20891,The conductivity increases by about 4 orders of magnitude to about 300 Scm(-1) between air and fuel atmospheres and the p(O-2)(-1/6) dependence close to fuel conditions indicates n-type conductivity.,Niobia Based Rutile Materials as SOFC Anodes,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<249::AID-FUCE249>3.0.CO;2-A
7,20891,Impedance spectra of samples in both oxidising and reducing atmospheres were consistent with electronic domination; any ionic contribution seemed insignificant.,Niobia Based Rutile Materials as SOFC Anodes,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<249::AID-FUCE249>3.0.CO;2-A
8,20891,Symmetrical cell measurements of Nb2TiO7-x screen-printed electrodes on yttria stabilised zirconia in air were dominated by the series resistance of the electrodes.,Niobia Based Rutile Materials as SOFC Anodes,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<249::AID-FUCE249>3.0.CO;2-A
9,20891,"Under reducing conditions the series resistance was very low; however, there were significant polarisation impedances and also a large diffusion limitation.",Niobia Based Rutile Materials as SOFC Anodes,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<249::AID-FUCE249>3.0.CO;2-A
10,20891,The poor electrochemical performance is thought to be related to very slow ionic diffusion in the niobate.,Niobia Based Rutile Materials as SOFC Anodes,10.1002/1615-6854(200112)1:3/4<249::AID-FUCE249>3.0.CO;2-A
