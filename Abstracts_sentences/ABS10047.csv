2,10047,"In this work, Ba- and Sr-containing composites (Ni Ba1-xSrXCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-delta) were for the first time proposed and evaluated as anodes for Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC)-based SOFCs.",Barium- and Strontium-Containing Anode Materials toward Ceria-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with High Open Circuit Voltages,10.1021/acsaem.8b00825
3,10047,"Both Ba and Sr diffusion occurs at elevated temperatures during fabricating anode-supported half-cells; correspondingly, a thin electron-blocking interlayer is formed in situ at the anode/electrolyte interface.",Barium- and Strontium-Containing Anode Materials toward Ceria-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with High Open Circuit Voltages,10.1021/acsaem.8b00825
4,10047,"The presence of Ba ensures the formation of a BaCeO3-based electron-blocking layer, which has a very high ion transport number and completely eliminates the internal short circuit current across the SDC electrolyte.",Barium- and Strontium-Containing Anode Materials toward Ceria-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with High Open Circuit Voltages,10.1021/acsaem.8b00825
5,10047,"Sr incorporation can substantially promote the sintering activity of the anode and electrolyte and, hence, reduces the sintering temperature of the half-cells to 1150 degrees C.",Barium- and Strontium-Containing Anode Materials toward Ceria-Based Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with High Open Circuit Voltages,10.1021/acsaem.8b00825
