1,10164,"The performance of supported platinum as an anode catalyst in a hydrogen sulfide solid oxide fuel cell with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte has been examined in the temperature range of 700-900degreesC. The highest current density achieved at 800degreesC was 100 mA/cm(2) and the highest power density was 15.4 mW/cm(2), when operated with 5% H2S feed.",Stabilization of platinum anode catalyst in a H2S-O2 solid oxide fuel cell with an intermediate TiO2 layer,10.1149/1.1479156
2,10164,"Increasing the concentration of H2S in the anode feed did not improve the performance of the cell, due to corruption of the platinum anode; the reversible formation and decomposition of PtS on the platinum-YSZ interface led to instability of the electrochemical interface of the Pt catalyst with the YSZ electrolyte.",Stabilization of platinum anode catalyst in a H2S-O2 solid oxide fuel cell with an intermediate TiO2 layer,10.1149/1.1479156
3,10164,The membrane structure and performance were both stabilized by interposing a thin layer of TiO2 between the Pt anode and YSZ electrolyte.,Stabilization of platinum anode catalyst in a H2S-O2 solid oxide fuel cell with an intermediate TiO2 layer,10.1149/1.1479156
4,10164,The stabilized open-circuit voltage value depended on flow rates of the anode and cathode feeding gases.,Stabilization of platinum anode catalyst in a H2S-O2 solid oxide fuel cell with an intermediate TiO2 layer,10.1149/1.1479156
5,10164,"This behavior is attributed to the crossover of reactants, which change the partial pressures of product SO2 and H2O. (C) 2002 The Electrochemical Society.",Stabilization of platinum anode catalyst in a H2S-O2 solid oxide fuel cell with an intermediate TiO2 layer,10.1149/1.1479156
