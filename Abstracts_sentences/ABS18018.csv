3,18018,"C. CeO2 co-doped with rare earth oxides (REOs) La and Gd (LGDC), Y and Gd (YGDC), and also Nd and Gd (NGDC) were evaluated in this study.","Comparative effect of REO co-dopant (La, Y, Nd) on ionic conductivity of Gd-doped CeO2 solid electrolyte for IT-SOFC",10.1007/s41779-019-00332-8
4,18018,"Samples were sintered at 1200 degrees C, 1300 degrees C, and 1400 degrees C for 3, 4, and 5 h. The results show that the increased sintering temperature, sintering time, and value of mole % dopant can increase the value of the ionic conductivity.","Comparative effect of REO co-dopant (La, Y, Nd) on ionic conductivity of Gd-doped CeO2 solid electrolyte for IT-SOFC",10.1007/s41779-019-00332-8
