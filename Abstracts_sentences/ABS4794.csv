3,4794,The modified anode exhibited much higher peak power density in H-2 compared with the original anode at the same condition.,MnO-Co composite modified Ni-SDC anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.08.024
4,4794,"For example, the peak power density by the modified anode was 1756 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, compared with 1322 mW cm(-2) by the original anode at the same temperature.",MnO-Co composite modified Ni-SDC anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.08.024
5,4794,The higher peak power density of modified anode was attributed to its much lower polarization resistance and relatively higher porosity.,MnO-Co composite modified Ni-SDC anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.08.024
6,4794,"However, it showed a worse stability than the unmodified anode in dry methane at 650 degrees C due to severer carbon deposition.",MnO-Co composite modified Ni-SDC anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.08.024
