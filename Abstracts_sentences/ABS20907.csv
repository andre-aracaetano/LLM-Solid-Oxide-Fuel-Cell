1,20907,"Here, we report the preparation, characterization, and performance of reforming propane and n-butane into a syngas of composite structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = 0.46 wt.% Pt, 0.24 wt.% Rh, and 0.24 wt.% Ru) catalysts.","Composite Structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = Pt, Rh, and Ru) Catalysts for Propane and n-Butane Reforming to Syngas",10.3390/ma15207336
2,20907,"The catalysts are composed of a high-heat-conducting FeCrAl block with preset geometry, with a surface nearly totally covered by theta-Al2O3.","Composite Structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = Pt, Rh, and Ru) Catalysts for Propane and n-Butane Reforming to Syngas",10.3390/ma15207336
3,20907,"Afterwards, a layer of ceria-zirconia mixed oxide was deposited.","Composite Structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = Pt, Rh, and Ru) Catalysts for Propane and n-Butane Reforming to Syngas",10.3390/ma15207336
4,20907,"The formed oxide coating was used as a support for 2-3 nm sized Pt, Rh, or Ru nanoparticles.","Composite Structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = Pt, Rh, and Ru) Catalysts for Propane and n-Butane Reforming to Syngas",10.3390/ma15207336
5,20907,The performance of the catalysts in propane steam reforming decreased in the order of Rh approximate to Ru >,"Composite Structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = Pt, Rh, and Ru) Catalysts for Propane and n-Butane Reforming to Syngas",10.3390/ma15207336

7,20907,"The reformates obtained in the propane steam reforming over Rh- and Ru/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl at 600 degrees C and GHSV = 8300 h(-1) contained 65.2 and 62.4 vol.% of H-2, respectively, and can be used as a fuel for solid oxide fuel cells.","Composite Structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = Pt, Rh, and Ru) Catalysts for Propane and n-Butane Reforming to Syngas",10.3390/ma15207336
8,20907,"In the oxidative steam reforming of propane at 700 degrees C and GHSV= 17,000 h(-1), the activities of the Rh- and Pt-based catalysts were similar and the compositions of the outlet gas mixtures were quite close to equilibrium in both cases.","Composite Structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = Pt, Rh, and Ru) Catalysts for Propane and n-Butane Reforming to Syngas",10.3390/ma15207336
9,20907,"Increasing the reagent flow rate to 25,600 h(-1) showed stability of the Rh/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl performance, whereas the Pt/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl activity decreased.","Composite Structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = Pt, Rh, and Ru) Catalysts for Propane and n-Butane Reforming to Syngas",10.3390/ma15207336
10,20907,"A mathematical model considering the velocity field, mass balance, pressure, and temperature distribution, as well as the reaction kinetics, was suggested for the propane steam and oxidative steam reforming over the Pt- and Rh/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl catalysts.","Composite Structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = Pt, Rh, and Ru) Catalysts for Propane and n-Butane Reforming to Syngas",10.3390/ma15207336
11,20907,The model well described the experimental results.,"Composite Structured M/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2/Al2O3/FeCrAl (M = Pt, Rh, and Ru) Catalysts for Propane and n-Butane Reforming to Syngas",10.3390/ma15207336
