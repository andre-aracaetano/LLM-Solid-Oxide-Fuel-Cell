4,9988,"The electrochemical performance of the thin film cathodes is measured by impedance spectroscopy on symmetrical cells in the temperature range of 450 -650 degrees C. LSC cathode thin films (250 nm thick) with 30 wt% GDC content exhibit the lowest area specific resistance (ASR) values of 0.32, 0.78 and 2.04 Omega cm(2) in ambient air at 650, 600 and 550 degrees C, respectively.",Synthesis and characterization of nanoparticulate La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ cathodes for thin-film solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.149
