1,5690,"An alkali-free, alkaline earth borosilicate glass (designated G102) has been developed as a viscous sealant for use with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",An alkali-free barium borosilicate viscous sealing glass for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.088
2,5690,"The glass possesses the requisite viscosity, electrical resistivity, and thermal and chemical stability under SOFC operating conditions to act as a reliable sealant.",An alkali-free barium borosilicate viscous sealing glass for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.088
3,5690,Sandwich seals between aluminized stainless steel and a YSZ/NiO-YSZ bilayer survived 148 thermal cycles (800 degrees C to room temperature) in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres at a differential pressure of similar to 3.4 kPa (0.5 psi) without failure.,An alkali-free barium borosilicate viscous sealing glass for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.088
4,5690,"For sandwich seals that were held at 800 degrees C for up to 2280 h in air, G102 resisted crystallization, there were limited interactions at the G102/YSZ interface, but BaAl2Si2O8 crystals formed at the glass/metal interface because of the reaction between the glass and the aluminized steel.",An alkali-free barium borosilicate viscous sealing glass for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.088
5,5690,Sandwich seals that were intentionally cracked by thermal shock resealed to became hermetic upon reheating to temperatures as low as 744 degrees C. (C) 2014,An alkali-free barium borosilicate viscous sealing glass for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.088
