1,13207,"Compared with conventional oxygen-ion-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (O-SOFCs), proton ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) are more attractive for low-temperature operation due to their smaller activation energy and higher ionic conductivity at reduced temperatures.",The BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-δ nanocomposite: a new high-performance cobalt-free triple-conducting cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells operating at reduced temperatures,10.1039/d1ta10652j
2,13207,"However, most of the PCFCs still exhibit lower power outputs than O-SOFCs until now due to the lack of suitable and high-performance cathode materials.",The BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-δ nanocomposite: a new high-performance cobalt-free triple-conducting cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells operating at reduced temperatures,10.1039/d1ta10652j
3,13207,"Cobalt (Co)-based perovskite oxides have been widely employed as cathodes for PCFCs, and suffer from poor thermo-mechanical compatibility with the electrolyte and inferior structural stability.",The BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-δ nanocomposite: a new high-performance cobalt-free triple-conducting cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells operating at reduced temperatures,10.1039/d1ta10652j
4,13207,"Herein, Co-free triple-conducting perovskite-based nanocomposites are reported as highly active and stable cathodes for PCFCs.",The BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-δ nanocomposite: a new high-performance cobalt-free triple-conducting cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells operating at reduced temperatures,10.1039/d1ta10652j
5,13207,"By tailoring the Ce/Y co-doping amounts in BaFeO3-delta, Ba(Ce0.8Y0.2)(x)Fe1-xO3-delta (x = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3) perovskites experience a phase transformation from a single-phase (x = 0.1, O2-/e(-) conducting) into a composite (x = 0.2 and 0.3, O2-/e(-) and H+/e(-) conducting) to achieve triple-conducting capability.",The BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-δ nanocomposite: a new high-performance cobalt-free triple-conducting cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells operating at reduced temperatures,10.1039/d1ta10652j
6,13207,"The optimized BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-delta nanocomposite cathode displays superior activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with low area-specific resistances of 0.27 and 1.49 omega cm(2) at 600 and 500 degrees C, respectively, surpassing most of the reported Co-free PCFC cathodes.",The BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-δ nanocomposite: a new high-performance cobalt-free triple-conducting cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells operating at reduced temperatures,10.1039/d1ta10652j
7,13207,The BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-delta cathode also exhibits superior thermo-mechanical compatibility with BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta electrolyte and improved CO2 tolerance due to the strong interaction between O2-/e(-) and H+/e(-) conducting phases and the optimized dual-phase composition.,The BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-δ nanocomposite: a new high-performance cobalt-free triple-conducting cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells operating at reduced temperatures,10.1039/d1ta10652j
8,13207,"Consequently, an anode-supported single cell with the BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-delta cathode delivers a high peak power density of 829 mW cm(-2) at 650 degrees C and a durable operation for similar to 450 h at 550 degrees C.",The BaCe0.16Y0.04Fe0.8O3-δ nanocomposite: a new high-performance cobalt-free triple-conducting cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells operating at reduced temperatures,10.1039/d1ta10652j
