1,5288,The composite cathodes of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and Mn1.3Co1.5O4 (MCO) are prepared by infiltration of the MCO oxides into porous YSZ backbones using aqueous solutions of the corresponding nitrate salts.,Mn1.5Co1.5O4-δ infiltrated yttria stabilized zirconia composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.106
2,5288,Calcinations at 850 degrees C promote the formation of the MCO spinel oxide and yield nano-scale catalyst coatings on the YSZ pore walls.,Mn1.5Co1.5O4-δ infiltrated yttria stabilized zirconia composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.106
3,5288,Impedance measurements on the symmetric MCO YSZ cathode fuel cells show that the lowest polarization resistance in air at 800 degrees C is 0.43 Omega cm(2) for the MCO impregnated YSZ composite at the MCO volume loading of 13.5%.,Mn1.5Co1.5O4-δ infiltrated yttria stabilized zirconia composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.106
4,5288,Analysis of the impedance spectra suggest that the oxygen reduction kinetics is probably limited by double ionization of the adsorbed oxygen atoms or charge transfer at the triple-phase boundaries.,Mn1.5Co1.5O4-δ infiltrated yttria stabilized zirconia composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.106
5,5288,"Furthermore, introducing the oxide ion conductor of samarium-doped ceria as a second component in the coated catalysts yields much lower polarization resistances, e.g., 0.15 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C.
