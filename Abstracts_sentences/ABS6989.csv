1,6989,Ni modified Ce0.6Mn0.3Fe0.1O2 (Ni-CMF) material is evaluated as an anode material for hybrid direct carbon fuel cell (HDCFC).,"Ni modified Ce(Mn, Fe)O2 cermet anode for high-performance direct carbon fuel cell",10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.135
2,6989,The Temperature Programmed Reaction (TPR) and GC test results show that the Ni additive significantly promotes the oxidation of carbon and consequently accelerates the formation rate of CO.,"Ni modified Ce(Mn, Fe)O2 cermet anode for high-performance direct carbon fuel cell",10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.135
3,6989,"Moreover, the Ni-CMF material is found to show a high electrical conductivity compared to pure CMF in HDCFC operating conditions.","Ni modified Ce(Mn, Fe)O2 cermet anode for high-performance direct carbon fuel cell",10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.135
4,6989,"Taking advantage of the excellent catalytic activity and high conductivity, the electrolyte-supported HDCFC with Ni-CMF anode shows a high maximum power density of 580.7 mW cm (2) at 800 degrees C, when activated carbon is used as the fuel.","Ni modified Ce(Mn, Fe)O2 cermet anode for high-performance direct carbon fuel cell",10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.135
5,6989,"Furthermore, the cell displays good stability under galvanostatic operation at current density of 50 mA cm (2) at 750 degrees C. These results indicate that the designed Ni-CMF composite material has the potential to be developed as an alternative anode for HDCFCs.","Ni modified Ce(Mn, Fe)O2 cermet anode for high-performance direct carbon fuel cell",10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.135
