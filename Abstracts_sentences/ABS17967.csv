2,17967,Powder X-ray diffraction showed the formation of a single-phase orthorhombic phase in the Pnma space group.,Perovskite-type Nd0.75Ba0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-023-04901-7
3,17967,It showed minor reactivity with Sr and Mg-co-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM) when sintered with 30 wt.% LSGM at 1050 degrees C. 4-probe DC chronopotentiometry measurements were performed on the sintered sample pellets and showed a maximum conductivity of 674 S/cm at 700 degrees C. 2-probe AC electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed on LSGM pellets from 650 to 800 degrees C to investigate the oxygen reduction property of NBCF25 using a composite slurry (70 wt.% NBCF and 30 wt.% LSGM).,Perovskite-type Nd0.75Ba0.25Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s11581-023-04901-7
