6,19913,"The IL-gating-converted PV phase of a SrFeO3-delta (SFO3-delta) layer shows a ferromagnetic-like behavior but applies a huge pinning effect on LSMO magnetic moments, which consequently leads to a prominent exchange bias phenomenon, suggesting an uncompensated helical magnetic structure of SFO3-delta.",Electric Field Control of Phase Transition and Tunable Resistive Switching in SrFeO2.5,10.1021/acsami.8b18251
