1,8426,A planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was designed to be operated in gradual internal reforming conditions under pure dry methane.,A solid oxide fuel cell operating in gradual internal reforming conditions under pure dry methane,10.1149/1.2936228
2,8426,Stable operation was achieved for about 30 h. This result was obtained by deposition onto a Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia cermet of a highly active and carbon-deposition-resistant catalyst layer consisting of Ir/CeO(2).,A solid oxide fuel cell operating in gradual internal reforming conditions under pure dry methane,10.1149/1.2936228
3,8426,"The performances of this layer were first evaluated in situ at open-circuit voltage, and then the principle of gradual internal reforming associated with electrocatalytic dissociation was demonstrated.",A solid oxide fuel cell operating in gradual internal reforming conditions under pure dry methane,10.1149/1.2936228
4,8426,The best cell performances with CH(4)/H(2)O=1/4 were 0.1 A cm(-2) at 0.55 V (about 55 mW cm(-2)) at 1173 K.,A solid oxide fuel cell operating in gradual internal reforming conditions under pure dry methane,10.1149/1.2936228
