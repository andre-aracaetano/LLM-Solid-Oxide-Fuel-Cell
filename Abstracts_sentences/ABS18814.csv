2,18814,"(La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3-delta-Zr0.84Y0.16O2-gamma (LSM-YSZ) symmetric cells were tested at 800 degrees C in air with current densities of 0.5 and 1.5 A cm(-2), with current cycle periods of 1 and 12 h. A continuous increase in both ohmic and polarization resistance was observed, via Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), for cells tested with a reversing current of 1.5 A cm(-2), whereas cells tested at 0.5 A cm(-2) showed no measurable resistance increase.",Life testing of LSM-YSZ composite electrodes under reversing-current operation,10.1039/c3cp52973h
3,18814,"The resistance degradation was explained by delamination in the electrode, observed by post-test Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), near the interface with the electrolyte for the 1.5 A cm(-2) cells, but not for those tested at 0.5 A cm(-2).",Life testing of LSM-YSZ composite electrodes under reversing-current operation,10.1039/c3cp52973h
4,18814,Current cycle period also impacted the degradation observed at 1.5 A cm(-2): both the rate of resistance increase and the extent of post-test delamination decreased on going from constant current mode to a 12 h period to a 1 h period.,Life testing of LSM-YSZ composite electrodes under reversing-current operation,10.1039/c3cp52973h
5,18814,The results indicate that lower current densities and reversing-current operation are desirable to maximize the lifetime of solid oxide cells.,Life testing of LSM-YSZ composite electrodes under reversing-current operation,10.1039/c3cp52973h
