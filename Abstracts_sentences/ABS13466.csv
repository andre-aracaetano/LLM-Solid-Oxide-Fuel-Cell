1,13466,Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) are efficient energy-conversion devices that provide great potential to realize a clean and sustainable energy future.,Highly Efficient and Robust Composite Cathode with an In Situ Formed Proton Conductor for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c02151
2,13466,"However, the low catalytic activity and stability of the cathode at intermediate temperatures present significant obstacles to their commercial application.",Highly Efficient and Robust Composite Cathode with an In Situ Formed Proton Conductor for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c02151
3,13466,"To overcome these challenges, we developed a strategy to modify a Ba(Co0.7Fe0.2Zr0.1)(0.95)O3-delta (BCFZ95) cathode surface by Pr6O11 (PO) nanoparticles (NPs) and in situ formed BaPrO3 proton conductor.",Highly Efficient and Robust Composite Cathode with an In Situ Formed Proton Conductor for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c02151
4,13466,"Oxygen molecules adsorb and dissociate rapidly on the NPs, leading to a significant enhancement of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity for the B(CFZ)95 cathode.",Highly Efficient and Robust Composite Cathode with an In Situ Formed Proton Conductor for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c02151
5,13466,"The polarization resistance (R-p) of the B(CFZ)95-15 wt % PO composite cathode was 0.064 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, exhibiting a substantial reduction of 50% compared with B(CFZ)95.",Highly Efficient and Robust Composite Cathode with an In Situ Formed Proton Conductor for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c02151
6,13466,"Through the rational adjustment of the calcination temperature, proton-conductor BaPrO3 was in situ generated at the Pr6O11/B(CFZ)95 interface, which promoted the hydration process and facilitated the proton transmission of the composite cathode.",Highly Efficient and Robust Composite Cathode with an In Situ Formed Proton Conductor for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c02151
7,13466,"Moreover, the stability of the composite cathode against CO2 was synchronically promoted by the Pr6O11 conformal coating due to a more stable Pr6O11 and a higher acidity of Pr3+/Pr4+ than that of Ba2+, as confirmed by carbonate decomposition chemical potential computations.",Highly Efficient and Robust Composite Cathode with an In Situ Formed Proton Conductor for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c02151
8,13466,"The composite cathode also has good recovery performance; after the treatment with a high concentration of CO2, the R-p of the composite cathode can be restored to the initial level.",Highly Efficient and Robust Composite Cathode with an In Situ Formed Proton Conductor for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c02151
9,13466,"The infiltration of Pr6O11 and in situ formed proton conductor comprehensively improved the ORR activity, hydration activity, and stability of the B(CFZ)95 cathode, and the modification method provides an inspiring technical solution for not only PCFCs but also other types of energy-conversion and -storage systems, including solid oxide electrolysis cells and metal-air batteries.",Highly Efficient and Robust Composite Cathode with an In Situ Formed Proton Conductor for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsaem.3c02151
