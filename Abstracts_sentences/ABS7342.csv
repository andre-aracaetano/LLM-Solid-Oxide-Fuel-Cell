2,7342,"The Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) is amongst the most efficient fuel cell types, however, due to the high cell operating temperature cation diffusion occurs between the different components of the cell, resulting in rapid degradation of the power output.",In-situ neutron diffraction study of cathode/electrolyte interactions under electrical load and elevated temperature,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2016.02.012
3,7342,In this paper we investigate cation migration between the promising intermediate temperature-SOFC cathode La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-delta (LSCF) and a fluorite type electrolyte Ce1-xPrxO2-delta (CPO).,In-situ neutron diffraction study of cathode/electrolyte interactions under electrical load and elevated temperature,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2016.02.012

5,7342,The lattice parameter and cation occupancy evolution were analysed by Rietveld refinement as a function of time and applied potential.,In-situ neutron diffraction study of cathode/electrolyte interactions under electrical load and elevated temperature,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2016.02.012
6,7342,"The materials were found to be stable, as no impurity formation, lattice parameter or site occupancy evolution was observed during the experiment.",In-situ neutron diffraction study of cathode/electrolyte interactions under electrical load and elevated temperature,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2016.02.012
7,7342,However La migration prior to the experiment from LSCF to CPO was observed as well as B-site vacancies in LSCF.,In-situ neutron diffraction study of cathode/electrolyte interactions under electrical load and elevated temperature,10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2016.02.012
