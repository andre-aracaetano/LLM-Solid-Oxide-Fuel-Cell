2,18561,Here we report the effect of this alternating current operation on Ni-YSZ fuel electrodes in 1000 h life tests at different current densities.,Effect of Reversing-Current Operation on the Structure and Electrochemical Performance Evolution of Ni-YSZ Fuel Electrodes,10.1149/2.1231810jes
3,18561,Ni-YSZ/YSZ/Ni-YSZ symmetric cells were used because they allow relatively straightforward interpretation of electrochemical results.,Effect of Reversing-Current Operation on the Structure and Electrochemical Performance Evolution of Ni-YSZ Fuel Electrodes,10.1149/2.1231810jes
4,18561,"At constant cell current density values <= 0.4 A/cm(2), the cell voltage and total resistance values were reasonably stable, with a slight reduction in R-P. At current densities >= 0.6 A/cm(2), voltage and total cell resistances were still approximately constant, but there was a steady increase in the R-Omega that was almost offset by a decrease in R-P. The higher current densities resulted in damage to the electrode/electrolyte interface structure including delamination, explaining the R-Omega increase.",Effect of Reversing-Current Operation on the Structure and Electrochemical Performance Evolution of Ni-YSZ Fuel Electrodes,10.1149/2.1231810jes
5,18561,"Increasing the current density also produced more Ni and YSZ nanoparticles in the electrode, yielding the decrease of R-P. (C) 2018",Effect of Reversing-Current Operation on the Structure and Electrochemical Performance Evolution of Ni-YSZ Fuel Electrodes,10.1149/2.1231810jes
