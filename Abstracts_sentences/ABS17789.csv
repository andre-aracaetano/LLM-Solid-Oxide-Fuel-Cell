2,17789,"The phase identification, microstructures, thermal expansion and ionic conductivities of samples were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dilatometry and AC impedance spectroscopy (IS).",The effect of Sr on the properties of Y-doped ceria electrolyte for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.07.011
3,17789,"The results showed that the samples of co-doping with Y and Sr can result in higher ionic conductivity and lower activation energy than those of Y singly doped ceria in the temperature range of 450-750 degrees C. As the substitution amount of Sr for Y increased up to 25 mol% (Ce0.8Y0.15Sr0.05O2-delta), the sample attained the optimum ionic conductivity.",The effect of Sr on the properties of Y-doped ceria electrolyte for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.07.011
