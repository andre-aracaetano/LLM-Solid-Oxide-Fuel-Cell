1,1039,"In this paper, a new heat recovery for a microcogeneration system based on solid oxide fuel cell and air source heat pump (HP) is presented with the main goal of improving efficiency on energy conversion for a residential building.",Studying a Hybrid System Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Combined With an Air Source Heat Pump and With a Novel Heat Recovery,10.1115/1.4041864
2,1039,The novelty of the research work is that exhaust gases after the fuel cell are first used to heat water for heating/domestic water and then mixed with the external air to feed the evaporator of the HP with the aim of increasing energy efficiency of the latter.,Studying a Hybrid System Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Combined With an Air Source Heat Pump and With a Novel Heat Recovery,10.1115/1.4041864
3,1039,"This system configuration decreases the possibility of freezing of the evaporator as well, which is one of the drawbacks for air source HP in Nordic climates.",Studying a Hybrid System Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Combined With an Air Source Heat Pump and With a Novel Heat Recovery,10.1115/1.4041864
4,1039,"A parametric analysis of the system is developed by performing simulations varying the external air temperature, air humidity, and fuel cell nominal power.",Studying a Hybrid System Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Combined With an Air Source Heat Pump and With a Novel Heat Recovery,10.1115/1.4041864
5,1039,"Coefficient of performance (COP) can increase more than 100% when fuel cell electric power is close to its nominal (50 kW), and/or inlet air has a high relative humidity (RH) (close to 100%).",Studying a Hybrid System Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Combined With an Air Source Heat Pump and With a Novel Heat Recovery,10.1115/1.4041864
6,1039,"Instead, the effect of mixing the exhausted gases with air may be negative (up to -25%) when fuel cell electric power is 20 kW and inlet air has 25% RH.",Studying a Hybrid System Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Combined With an Air Source Heat Pump and With a Novel Heat Recovery,10.1115/1.4041864
7,1039,"Thermodynamic analysis is carried out to prove energy advantage of such a solution with respect to a traditional one, resulting to be between 39% and 44% in terms of primary energy.",Studying a Hybrid System Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Combined With an Air Source Heat Pump and With a Novel Heat Recovery,10.1115/1.4041864
8,1039,The results show that the performance of the air source HP increases considerably during cold season for climates with high RH and for users with high electric power demand.,Studying a Hybrid System Based on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Combined With an Air Source Heat Pump and With a Novel Heat Recovery,10.1115/1.4041864
