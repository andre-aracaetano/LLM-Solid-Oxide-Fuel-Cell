3,10260,"Here, we present results pertaining to the sulfur-tolerance of Ce0.80Gd0.20O1.90(CGO), Pt/ CGO and Rh/CGO co-impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 anode 'backbone' microstructures and their ability to recover performance after being exposed to H2S. The Ni/CGO co-impregnated system exhibited severe poisoning by H2S, however, the Rh/CGO system displayed good stability in Area Specific Resistance (ASR) upon introduction of 1-2 ppm of H2S and the Pt/CGO system showed minimal increases in ASR with the addition of 1-8 ppm H2S. Recovery measurements performed in non-humidified H-2 at 300 mA cm(-2) , after exposure to 8 ppm H2S, indicated that the Pt/CGO and Rh/CGO systems could recover within 10 min, whilst 60 min were required to achieve almost a full recovery of performance for the Ni/CGO system.",Evaluating sulfur-tolerance of metal/Ce0.80Gd0.20O1.90 co-impregnated La0.20Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3 anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2020.115254
