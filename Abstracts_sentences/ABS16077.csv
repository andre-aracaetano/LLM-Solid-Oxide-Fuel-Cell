1,16077,This study investigates the effect of water vapor and hydrogen on the conductivity of perovksite-like cuprates Y(Pr)Ba2Cu3Oy and Sr2CuO3 at t = 20-150 degrees C.,Study of the Conductivity of Perovskite-Like Cuprates Y(Pr)Ba2Cu3Oy and Sr2CuO3,10.1134/S0031918X18120049
2,16077,It is demonstrated that the interaction of cuprates with a hydrogen-containing atmosphere results in intercalation of hydrogen or water into the structure of compounds and produces ionic current carriers.,Study of the Conductivity of Perovskite-Like Cuprates Y(Pr)Ba2Cu3Oy and Sr2CuO3,10.1134/S0031918X18120049
3,16077,"Measurements of the emf of cuprate-based electrochemical cells reveal that such cells, where cuprates act as proton-conductive membranes, have the capacity to generate emf.",Study of the Conductivity of Perovskite-Like Cuprates Y(Pr)Ba2Cu3Oy and Sr2CuO3,10.1134/S0031918X18120049
