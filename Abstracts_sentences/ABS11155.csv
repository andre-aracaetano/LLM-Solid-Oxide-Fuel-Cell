2,11155,The Cr deposition reaction between the Fe-Cr alloy metallic interconnect and oxides varies significantly with the nature of the oxides.,"Interaction between metallic interconnect and constituent oxides of (La, Sr)MnO3 coating of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2005.10.002
3,11155,"The interaction between the Fe-Cr alloy and La2O3 and Mn2O3 oxide coatings primarily results in the formation of LaCrO3 and (Cr,Mn)(3)O-4 while in the case of SrO oxide coating, Cr2O3 is the main product.","Interaction between metallic interconnect and constituent oxides of (La, Sr)MnO3 coating of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2005.10.002
4,11155,"In the case of LSM coating, the formation of (Cr, Mn)304 and Cr2O3 is identified.","Interaction between metallic interconnect and constituent oxides of (La, Sr)MnO3 coating of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2005.10.002
5,11155,"The results indicate that the chemical interaction between the Fe-Cr alloy interconnect and LSM coating is most likely related to the surface oxide species such as SrO and MnO, initially enriched or segregated on the surface of LSM particularly in the early stages of the reaction.","Interaction between metallic interconnect and constituent oxides of (La, Sr)MnO3 coating of solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2005.10.002
