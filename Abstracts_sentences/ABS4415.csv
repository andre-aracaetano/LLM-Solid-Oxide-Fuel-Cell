1,4415,A fast parallel model of coupled heat and current transport in a planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack is developed.,Anomalous Transport of Thermal Disturbance in a Planar SOFC Stack,10.1149/1.3305792
2,4415,The model is used to simulate the thermal effect of a resistive spot in a 15-cell stack.,Anomalous Transport of Thermal Disturbance in a Planar SOFC Stack,10.1149/1.3305792
3,4415,The small circular spot cools off the cell by 1 K in the region of nearly the same radius (cold spot).,Anomalous Transport of Thermal Disturbance in a Planar SOFC Stack,10.1149/1.3305792
4,4415,"Unexpectedly, this cold spot propagates along the stack axis with only a minor loss in the spot amplitude.",Anomalous Transport of Thermal Disturbance in a Planar SOFC Stack,10.1149/1.3305792
5,4415,"The perturbation analysis of the governing equations shows that in typical conditions, the amplitude of the cold spot decays exponentially with the distance along the stack axis.",Anomalous Transport of Thermal Disturbance in a Planar SOFC Stack,10.1149/1.3305792
6,4415,"However, the characteristic scale of the exponent appears to be large.",Anomalous Transport of Thermal Disturbance in a Planar SOFC Stack,10.1149/1.3305792
7,4415,The theoretical value of this scale (14 cells) agrees well with the value obtained from the numerical calculations (12.5 cells).,Anomalous Transport of Thermal Disturbance in a Planar SOFC Stack,10.1149/1.3305792
8,4415,"The analysis also reveals that at large current densities or in stacks of the large transversal size, the temperature disturbance oscillates along the stack axis.",Anomalous Transport of Thermal Disturbance in a Planar SOFC Stack,10.1149/1.3305792
9,4415,The physics of these effects are discussed.,Anomalous Transport of Thermal Disturbance in a Planar SOFC Stack,10.1149/1.3305792
