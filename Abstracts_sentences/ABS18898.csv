3,18898,"[SrF2] O-2, SrF2, Y2O3, SrY2O4, Pt, was studied over the temperature range from 935 to 1080 K which yielded the least squares expression E+/-0.76 (mV) 236.46 - 0.16198T (K).",High temperature stability of SrY2O4 by SrF2-based emf method,
4,18898,"From this, the standard Gibbs energy of formation DeltaG(f.ox)(o) of SrY2O4 from its constituent binary oxides Y2O3 and SrO was derived to be DeltaG(f,ox)(o) +/-0.15(kJmol(-1))= -45.63+0.03126T (K).",High temperature stability of SrY2O4 by SrF2-based emf method,
5,18898,"A value of 0.58 could be derived for the activity of SrO, a(SrO), in the SrY2O4/Y2O3 mixture at an extrapolated temperature of 1273 K, which could be used for assessing the compatibility of 15 mol% YO1.5 stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte with SrO-bearing components of solid oxide fuel cells.",High temperature stability of SrY2O4 by SrF2-based emf method,
