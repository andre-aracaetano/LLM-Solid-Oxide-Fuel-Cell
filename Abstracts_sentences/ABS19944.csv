1,19944,Ceramics can play a remarkable role in the engineering of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) capable of meeting the ambitious targets of reduced cost and improved lifetime.,Influence of electrospraying parameters on the microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2F0.8O3-δ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jssc.2009.04.018
2,19944,"While mixed ionic-electronic conductors such as LaxSr1-xCoyFe1-yO3-delta are being used as volumic cathodes to increase the catalytic performance of these components, adequate microstructures are also an important requirement for optimal performance, particularly at lower operating temperatures.",Influence of electrospraying parameters on the microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2F0.8O3-δ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jssc.2009.04.018
3,19944,This work is devoted to the fabrication of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta films on Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta substrates by electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) and to the characterization of the microstructural dependence on the deposition conditions.,Influence of electrospraying parameters on the microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2F0.8O3-δ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jssc.2009.04.018
4,19944,"A wide variety of microstructures ranging from dense to porous, with particular features such as reticulation and micro-porosity, were obtained by varying the ESD deposition parameters: nozzle-to-substrate distance (15, 30, 43, 45, and 58 mm), solution flow rate (0.34 and 1.5 mL/h), and substrate temperature (300, 350, 400 and 450 degrees C).",Influence of electrospraying parameters on the microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2F0.8O3-δ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jssc.2009.04.018
5,19944,The correlation between deposition parameters and resulting microstructures was systematically studied and put into evidence.,Influence of electrospraying parameters on the microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2F0.8O3-δ films for SOFCs,10.1016/j.jssc.2009.04.018
