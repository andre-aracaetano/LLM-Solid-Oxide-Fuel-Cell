1,15668,A solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a sustainable energy resource that has been efficiently used for large-scale applications such as gas-turbines.,"NiO-GDC nanowire anodes for SOFCs: novel growth, characterization and cell performance",10.1039/d2ma00317a
2,15668,"However, its miniaturization for small-scale applications requires novel electrode materials especially anodes (other than Ni-YSZ) in different configurations and designs such as in the nanostructure form.","NiO-GDC nanowire anodes for SOFCs: novel growth, characterization and cell performance",10.1039/d2ma00317a
3,15668,"Herein, we are proposing the growth of a novel nickel oxide-gadolinium doped ceria (NiO-GDC) nanowire-based anode using a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism.","NiO-GDC nanowire anodes for SOFCs: novel growth, characterization and cell performance",10.1039/d2ma00317a
4,15668,"To the best of our knowledge, NiO-GDC has never been grown before in the form of nanowires using the VLS mechanism.","NiO-GDC nanowire anodes for SOFCs: novel growth, characterization and cell performance",10.1039/d2ma00317a
5,15668,The nanowires are prepared at different evaporation temperatures and exhibit dense morphology.,"NiO-GDC nanowire anodes for SOFCs: novel growth, characterization and cell performance",10.1039/d2ma00317a
6,15668,"Detailed Raman spectroscopy reveals that during the growth, reorganization of NiO-GDC particles results in the formation of a more complex structure that diverges from pristine NiO-GDC powder.","NiO-GDC nanowire anodes for SOFCs: novel growth, characterization and cell performance",10.1039/d2ma00317a
7,15668,"Furthermore, the temperature-dependence of the electrical conductivity reveals that the nanowires prepared at 1400 degrees C (evaporation temperature) possess high conductivity due to better charge-carrier transport, confirmed by their low activation energies.","NiO-GDC nanowire anodes for SOFCs: novel growth, characterization and cell performance",10.1039/d2ma00317a
8,15668,"The electrolyte-supported button cell synthesized using a NiO-GDC nanowire anode exhibits a maximum power density of similar to 178 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and concentration polarization is found to be the major loss, as revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data.","NiO-GDC nanowire anodes for SOFCs: novel growth, characterization and cell performance",10.1039/d2ma00317a
9,15668,"Based on our preliminary investigations, these nanowires have great potential to be used as an anode for SOFCs.","NiO-GDC nanowire anodes for SOFCs: novel growth, characterization and cell performance",10.1039/d2ma00317a
