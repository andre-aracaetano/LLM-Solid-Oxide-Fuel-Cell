4,9102,"In addition, the degradation occurring between three alloys with different compositions, Crofer 22 APU, SS430 and Conicro 4023 W 188, as metallic interconnects and La0.6Sr0.4FeO3 (LSF40) ceramic material as a cathode was studied.",Compatibility between strontium-doped ferrite cathode and metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.094
5,9102,"The results show significant chromium deposition and the formation of SrCrO4, LaCrO3 and La2O3 that block the active LSF40 electrode surface and degrade the stack (YSZ/SDC/LSF40/Interconnect) performance.",Compatibility between strontium-doped ferrite cathode and metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.094

7,9102,The deposition of the Cr species and the reaction with the LSF40 cathode is related to the composition of the oxide scales formed at each metallic interconnect and at the same time is related to the composition of the alloys.,Compatibility between strontium-doped ferrite cathode and metallic interconnects in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.094
8,9102,The best results obtained were for the half-cell (YSZ/SDC/LSF40) in contact with Conicro 4023 W 188 and Crofer 22 APU after heat treatment in air at 800 degrees C for 100 h.
