8,16328,Further Raman experiments revealed that more graphite-like carbon residuals and less defects or amorphous carbons (I-G/I-D=2.0) were found in the case of Cu/Ni-SSZ catalysts (300 degrees C for 2h).,Hydrogen production of nickel-scandia-stabilized zirconia and copper/nickel-scandia-stabilized zirconia catalysts through steam methane reforming for solid oxide fuel cell operation,10.1007/s10098-018-1591-6
9,16328,"Among the catalysts in this study, the Cu/Ni-SSZ catalyst (300 degrees C for 2h) is considered as a promising catalyst for SMR reaction, since it has a fair methane conversion, and characterized higher CO2 selectivity and lower CO selectivity without compromising the hydrogen purity.",Hydrogen production of nickel-scandia-stabilized zirconia and copper/nickel-scandia-stabilized zirconia catalysts through steam methane reforming for solid oxide fuel cell operation,10.1007/s10098-018-1591-6
