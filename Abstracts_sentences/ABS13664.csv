3,13664,"First, cells with different SSC contents in the oxygen electrode and different sintering temperatures were prepared and tested in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode.",Optimization of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated YSZ electrodes for solid oxide fuel cell/electrolysis cell,10.1039/c6ra21200j
4,13664,An optimal cell with an SSC content of 45 wt% and sintering temperature of 850 degrees C shows favorable microstructure and relatively lower polarization resistance.,Optimization of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated YSZ electrodes for solid oxide fuel cell/electrolysis cell,10.1039/c6ra21200j
5,13664,"The peak power densities of 0.96 W cm(-2) and polarization resistances as low as 0.39 Omega cm(-2) were obtained at 750 degrees C. Then, in solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) mode, the effects of CO2/H2O ratio were investigated.",Optimization of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated YSZ electrodes for solid oxide fuel cell/electrolysis cell,10.1039/c6ra21200j
6,13664,Results indicated that the CO2/H2O ratio has little influence on the electrolysis performance in the range of 1 : 2-2 : 1.,Optimization of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated YSZ electrodes for solid oxide fuel cell/electrolysis cell,10.1039/c6ra21200j
7,13664,"Finally, the electrochemical stability of the cell in both modes was tested at 750 degrees C for about 100 h. After a slight degradation in the initial 25 h, the cell showed good stability in SOFC mode, and no visible degradation was detected in SOEC mode in 100 h operation.",Optimization of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated YSZ electrodes for solid oxide fuel cell/electrolysis cell,10.1039/c6ra21200j
