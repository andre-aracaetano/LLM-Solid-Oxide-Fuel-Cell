1,13226,The lattice Boltzmann method is an appropriate mesoscopic-scale tool for investigating the diffusion processes.,An approach combining the lattice Boltzmann method and Maxwell-Stefan equation for modeling multi-component diffusion,10.1063/5.0059073
2,13226,"However, since the state-of-the-art multi-component diffusion lattice Boltzmann (LB) models are based on the kinetic theory and start from the lattice Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model, some defects cannot be avoided: they are only suitable for steady flow and there are limitations for setting the velocity and viscosity in lattice units.",An approach combining the lattice Boltzmann method and Maxwell-Stefan equation for modeling multi-component diffusion,10.1063/5.0059073
3,13226,"We devise a new incompressible LB model for ideal gases in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which is based on the advection-diffusion equation and coupled with the Maxwell-Stefan (M-S) equation by relaxation time.",An approach combining the lattice Boltzmann method and Maxwell-Stefan equation for modeling multi-component diffusion,10.1063/5.0059073
4,13226,"The coupled M-S equation is used for correction, considering the driving force in a multi-component diffusion system.",An approach combining the lattice Boltzmann method and Maxwell-Stefan equation for modeling multi-component diffusion,10.1063/5.0059073
5,13226,Our LB model is implemented to predict the concentration overpotentials of a porous anode in a SOFC.,An approach combining the lattice Boltzmann method and Maxwell-Stefan equation for modeling multi-component diffusion,10.1063/5.0059073
6,13226,"The overpotentials are calculated from an H-2-H2O-Ar ternary mass transport simulation and compared to the corresponding experimental results and several published continuum-scale and LB computations, demonstrating that our model offers a better consistency with the experimental measurement.",An approach combining the lattice Boltzmann method and Maxwell-Stefan equation for modeling multi-component diffusion,10.1063/5.0059073
7,13226,"Moreover, a Stefan tube is simulated for benchmarking against the local parameters; this is compared with the related experimental data and demonstrates the accuracy of our LB model.",An approach combining the lattice Boltzmann method and Maxwell-Stefan equation for modeling multi-component diffusion,10.1063/5.0059073
