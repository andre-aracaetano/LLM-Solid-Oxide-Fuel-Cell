2,5092,"In traditional electrode-supported cells, the mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion between materials in each layer may give rise to thermal stresses during operation, resulting in micro-cracks of ultra-thin electrolytes, which may ultimately lead to operational damages and performance degradation.",Anode-Supported Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Double-sided Cathodes,10.1002/ente.201800743
3,5092,"This work proposes a new symmetric, planar SOFC design based on double-sided cathodes to offset asymmetry of thermal stresses within the structure.",Anode-Supported Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Double-sided Cathodes,10.1002/ente.201800743
4,5092,This new design has been applied to prepare an anode-supported SOFC that maintains integrity after two complete redox cycles.,Anode-Supported Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Double-sided Cathodes,10.1002/ente.201800743
5,5092,"Its anti-fracture load is 20 times stronger than that of traditional ultra-thin cells, and its electrochemical performance is close to that of traditional large-scale, ultra-thin cells.",Anode-Supported Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Double-sided Cathodes,10.1002/ente.201800743
6,5092,These properties are promising for application under harsh operational environments.,Anode-Supported Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Double-sided Cathodes,10.1002/ente.201800743
