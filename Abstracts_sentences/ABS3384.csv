1,3384,Nanothin and pinhole-free electrolyte-embedded solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) on nanothin bottom electrode catalyst-coated anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) substrates with 20 nm and 80 nm-sized nanopores are morphologically and electrochemically characterized to identify the substrate-dependent nanostructuring effects.,Substrate-Dependent Growth of Nanothin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells toward Cost-Effective Nanostructuring,10.1007/s40684-016-0005-7
2,3384,"Reliable electrolytes were fabricated through the application of a protective layer deposited by atomic layer deposition, whose microstructural distortion reduced as the electrolyte became thinner At 450 degrees C, the SOFC on the AAO substrate with 80 nm nanopores generated a higher peak power density by approximately 22% than the SOFC on the AAO substrate with 20 nm nanopores when the electrolyte and the bottom electrode catalyst are as thin as 300 nm and 50 nm, respectively",Substrate-Dependent Growth of Nanothin Film Solid Oxide Fuel Cells toward Cost-Effective Nanostructuring,10.1007/s40684-016-0005-7
