2,9907,"Up to now, the authors have already developed the simulation codes for the one channel region and the single cell plate in its cell stack.",Three dimensional analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cell stack considering radiation,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.019
3,9907,"To calculate accurately the effect of radiation heat transfer from the cell stack surfaces, however, a code that can treat the whole cell stack is necessary.",Three dimensional analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cell stack considering radiation,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.019
4,9907,"In the present study, therefore, the authors newly develop a three dimensional simulator.",Three dimensional analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cell stack considering radiation,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.019
5,9907,"code of the planar SOFC stack, and the detailed effect of the radiation heat transfer is investigated.",Three dimensional analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cell stack considering radiation,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.019
6,9907,"It is made clear that the conventional codes are sufficiently accurate, and the newly developed whole cell stack code is not inevitable to predict the maximum cell temperature.",Three dimensional analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cell stack considering radiation,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.019
7,9907,"This is because the thermal conductivity of the cell materials made of ceramics is very small, and the central part of the cell stack is almost free from the influence of radiation heat transfer.",Three dimensional analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cell stack considering radiation,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.019
8,9907,"On the other hand, the stack simulation is needed to calculate accurately the cell voltage because the radiation heat transfer reduces it when the ambient temperature is low.",Three dimensional analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cell stack considering radiation,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.019
9,9907,"The bad influence of low ambient temperature on the voltage is, however, small and relatively high voltage is obtained even when the ambient temperature is very low.",Three dimensional analysis of planar solid oxide fuel cell stack considering radiation,10.1016/j.enconman.2006.11.019
