1,13130,"In this study, the effects of calcination and milling of 8YSZ (8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia) used in the nickel-YSZ anode on the performance of anode supported tubular fuel cells were investigated.",Tailoring the Microstructure of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Support by Calcination and Milling of YSZ,10.1038/srep27359
2,13130,"For this purpose, two different types of cells were prepared based on a Ni-YSZ/YSZ/Nd2NiO4+delta-YSZ configuration.",Tailoring the Microstructure of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Support by Calcination and Milling of YSZ,10.1038/srep27359
3,13130,"For the anode preparation, a suspension was prepared by mixing NiO and YSZ in a ratio of 65:35 wt% (Ni:YSZ 50:50 vol.%) with 30 vol.% graphite as the pore former.",Tailoring the Microstructure of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Support by Calcination and Milling of YSZ,10.1038/srep27359
4,13130,As received Tosoh YSZ or its calcined form (heated at 1500 degrees C for 3 hours) was used in the anode support as the YSZ source.,Tailoring the Microstructure of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Support by Calcination and Milling of YSZ,10.1038/srep27359
5,13130,"Electrochemical results showed that optimization of the fuel electrode microstructure is essential for the optimal distribution of gas within the support of the cell, especially under electrolysis operation where the performance for an optimized cell (calcined YSZ) was enhanced by a factor of two.",Tailoring the Microstructure of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Support by Calcination and Milling of YSZ,10.1038/srep27359
6,13130,"In comparison with a standard cell (containing as received YSZ), at 1.5 V and 800 degrees C the measured current density was -1380 mA cm(-2) and -690 mA cm(-2) for the cells containing calcined and as received YSZ, respectively.",Tailoring the Microstructure of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Support by Calcination and Milling of YSZ,10.1038/srep27359
7,13130,The present study suggests that the anode porosity for improved cell performance under SOEC is more critical than SOFC mode due to more complex gas diffusion under electrolysis mode where large amount of steam needs to be transfered into the cell.,Tailoring the Microstructure of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anode Support by Calcination and Milling of YSZ,10.1038/srep27359
