2,4179,"Herein, Ce4+ doping in SrFe0.95Ni0.05O3 imparts FeNi3 exsolution and CeO2 precipitation in a reducing condition, contributing to the fuel reforming, C-C bond cleavage and coke consumption in the anode chamber.",High-performance and durable alcohol-fueled symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell based on ferrite perovskite electrode,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118117
3,4179,"The ferrite perovskites are stable in ethanol/steam at 800 degrees C, whereas they are unstable in ethanol vapor with the high C fugacity inducing the formation of Fe0 and carbides.",High-performance and durable alcohol-fueled symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell based on ferrite perovskite electrode,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118117
4,4179,"However, the Ce0.2Sr0.8Fe0.95Ni0.05O3 anode maintains mostly the perovskite and is free from coke after the 300 h' operation under C2H5OH fuel at 0.5 V or 0.7 V because of the dynamic balance between the carbon deposition and consumption since an operation for 10 h shows a clear carbon deposition.",High-performance and durable alcohol-fueled symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell based on ferrite perovskite electrode,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118117
5,4179,A maximum power density of 0.58 W cm-2 and a polarization resistance of 0.21 omega cm2 at 800 degrees C can be obtained for the symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell with identical Ce0.2Sr0.8Fe0.95Ni0.05O3 cathode and anode under an ethanol fuel.,High-performance and durable alcohol-fueled symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell based on ferrite perovskite electrode,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118117
