7,20550,"The main advantage of the MA was the simplicity to obtain the apparent porosity, although this method did not provide the pore size distribution.",Comparative analysis between different porosimetric tests on macroporous alumina,10.1590/S1517-707620170005.0265
8,20550,The pore size distribution obtained by H-1-RMN - CPMG was similar to those obtained by PIM.,Comparative analysis between different porosimetric tests on macroporous alumina,10.1590/S1517-707620170005.0265
9,20550,The similarity of these results was evidenced by the high value of Pearson correlation (r > 0.962) between these methods.,Comparative analysis between different porosimetric tests on macroporous alumina,10.1590/S1517-707620170005.0265
