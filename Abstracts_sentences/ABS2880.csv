3,2880,"A fuel cell with a structure of Ni/NCAL-Sr0.7Co0.3FeO3-delta-NCAL/Ni reached a promising performance of 771 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C. Moreover, appropriate doping of cobalt at the A-site resulted in enhanced charge carrier transportation yielding an ionic conductivity of >0.1 S cm(-1) at 550 degrees C.
