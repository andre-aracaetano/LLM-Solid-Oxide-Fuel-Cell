1,9469,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) needs to be heated to a high temperature to be able to start generating electricity.,"Optimal Heat-Up Planning of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with and without Hot Air Recycling by Considering Energy, Time, and Temperature Gradient",10.1002/ente.202201401
2,9469,"This study aims to manage the heat-up process of a SOFC by considering the three objectives of time duration, energy consumption, and temperature gradient, simultaneously.","Optimal Heat-Up Planning of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with and without Hot Air Recycling by Considering Energy, Time, and Temperature Gradient",10.1002/ente.202201401
3,9469,"Mass flow rate (MFR) and rate of temperature rise (RTR) of the hot air, passing through the cathode channel of the SOFC, are considered as decision variables.","Optimal Heat-Up Planning of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with and without Hot Air Recycling by Considering Energy, Time, and Temperature Gradient",10.1002/ente.202201401
4,9469,The transient heat-up process is numerically simulated for six different MFR values (5-50 mg s(-1)) and six different RTR values (0.1-5 K s(-1)).,"Optimal Heat-Up Planning of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with and without Hot Air Recycling by Considering Energy, Time, and Temperature Gradient",10.1002/ente.202201401
5,9469,"The results indicate that higher RTR leads to lower heat-up duration, lower energy consumption, but higher temperature gradient.","Optimal Heat-Up Planning of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with and without Hot Air Recycling by Considering Energy, Time, and Temperature Gradient",10.1002/ente.202201401
6,9469,"Also, higher MFR results in lower heat-up duration, lower temperature gradient, but higher energy consumption.","Optimal Heat-Up Planning of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with and without Hot Air Recycling by Considering Energy, Time, and Temperature Gradient",10.1002/ente.202201401
7,9469,The results also reveal that hot air recycling increases thermal efficiency from below 40% to nearly 100%.,"Optimal Heat-Up Planning of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with and without Hot Air Recycling by Considering Energy, Time, and Temperature Gradient",10.1002/ente.202201401
8,9469,"Finally, when hot air recycling is employed and all the objectives are considered simultaneously, the heat-up plan with a RTR of 0.5 K s(-1) and a MFR of 50 mg s(-1) is selected as the best choice by using linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference.","Optimal Heat-Up Planning of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with and without Hot Air Recycling by Considering Energy, Time, and Temperature Gradient",10.1002/ente.202201401
