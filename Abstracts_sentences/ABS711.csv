1,711,The successful market introduction of the solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cell technology for power-to-gas applications requires the reduction of the degradation rates and the better understanding of the degradation mechanisms of the stacks.,Long-Term Behavior of a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOEC) Stack,10.1002/fuce.201900245
2,711,"Therefore, the paper reports and compares the long-term behavior of a solid oxide cell stack in electrolysis and reversible fuel cell/electrolysis operation.",Long-Term Behavior of a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOEC) Stack,10.1002/fuce.201900245
3,711,The 30-cell stack with electrolyte supported cells was supplied by Sunfire GmbH (Dresden/Germany) in the German funded RSOC Project.,Long-Term Behavior of a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOEC) Stack,10.1002/fuce.201900245
4,711,"The stack was operated for 3,370 h in electrolysis and afterwards for 2,500 h in reversible fuel cell/electrolysis mode, each at 70% gas conversion.",Long-Term Behavior of a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOEC) Stack,10.1002/fuce.201900245
5,711,"In the beginning of the test, the stack showed high gas tightness, good performances and high efficiencies in both SOEC and SOFC operations.",Long-Term Behavior of a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOEC) Stack,10.1002/fuce.201900245
6,711,"During 3,370 h of SOEC operation a low degradation of +0.5%/1,000 h was measured.",Long-Term Behavior of a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOEC) Stack,10.1002/fuce.201900245
7,711,"During 2,500 h of reversible fuel cell/electrolysis cycling, the gas tightness of the stack slightly decreased, which led to a temperature increase, and higher degradation rates were observed.",Long-Term Behavior of a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOEC) Stack,10.1002/fuce.201900245
8,711,The increase of the ohmic resistance contributed mostly to the degradation.,Long-Term Behavior of a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOEC) Stack,10.1002/fuce.201900245
9,711,Optimized operating conditions for reversible cycling and increasing the purity of the supplied water are foreseen in order to minimize stack degradation in reversible operation.,Long-Term Behavior of a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOEC) Stack,10.1002/fuce.201900245
