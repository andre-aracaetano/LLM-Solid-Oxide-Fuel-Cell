1,18567,"Heterostructured interfaces of oxides which can exhibit transport and reactivity characteristics remarkably different from those of bulk oxides, are interesting systems to explore in search of highly active cathodes for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).",Oxygen Reduction Kinetics Enhancement on a Heterostructured Oxide Surface for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jz101217d
2,18567,Here we show that the ORR of similar to 85 nm thick La0.8Sr0.2-CoO3-delta (LSC113) films prepared by pulsed laser deposition on (001)-oriented yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates is dramatically enhanced (similar to 3-4 orders of magnitude above bulk LSC113) by surface decorations of (La0.5Sr0.5)(2)CoO4 +/-delta (LSC214) with coverage in the range from similar to 0.1 to similar to 15 nm.,Oxygen Reduction Kinetics Enhancement on a Heterostructured Oxide Surface for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jz101217d
3,18567,Their surface and atomic structures were characterized by atomic force scanning electron and scanning transmission electron microscopy and the ORR kinetics were determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.,Oxygen Reduction Kinetics Enhancement on a Heterostructured Oxide Surface for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jz101217d
4,18567,"Although the mechanism for ORR enhancement is not yet fully understood our results to date show that the observed ORR enhancement can be attributed to highly active interfacial LSC113/LSC214 regions, which were shown to be atomically sharp.",Oxygen Reduction Kinetics Enhancement on a Heterostructured Oxide Surface for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/jz101217d
