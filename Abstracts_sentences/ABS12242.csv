1,12242,"Several spinet samples, i.e., MnxCr3-xO4 (0.5 <= x <= 2.5), NiCr2O4 and CoCr2O4, were synthesized and studied in terms of phase analysis, density, electrical resistivity and thermal expansion behaviour.",Electrical and microstructural characterization of spinel phases as potential coatings for SOFC metallic interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.03.137
2,12242,"The spinel samples were generally single phase; exceptions included MnCr2O4 and Mno(0.5)Cr(2.5)O(4) with significant amounts of Cr2O3 and NiCr2O4 With trace amounts of NiO. Porosity, in general, decreased with increasing sintering temperature, except for Mn0.5Cr2.5O4, which showed increasing porosity with increasing sintering temperature.",Electrical and microstructural characterization of spinel phases as potential coatings for SOFC metallic interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.03.137
