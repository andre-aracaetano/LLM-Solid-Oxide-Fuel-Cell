1,10049,Experiments described in this work examine degradation mechanisms of nickel-based anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating with a biogas surrogate and exposed to 110 ppm Cl (delivered either as CH3Cl or HCl).,Chlorine-induced degradation in SOFCs operating with biogas,10.1039/c7se00156h
2,10049,Chlorine present in green and synthetic fuels such as biogas and syngas can accelerate degradation of high temperature nickel anodes.,Chlorine-induced degradation in SOFCs operating with biogas,10.1039/c7se00156h
3,10049,"Chlorine contamination has been studied in SOFCs where H-2 was the primary fuel but little attention has focused on deleterious, cooperative effects that result from Clcontamination in predominantly carbon containing fuels.",Chlorine-induced degradation in SOFCs operating with biogas,10.1039/c7se00156h
4,10049,"Operando Raman spectroscopy is used to directly observe the anode's catalytic activity as evidenced by observable carbon accumulation, and electrochemical impedance and voltammetry measurements report on overall cell performance.",Chlorine-induced degradation in SOFCs operating with biogas,10.1039/c7se00156h
5,10049,Studies performed at 650 degrees C and 700 degrees C show that Cl immediately suppresses carbon accumulation and causes slow but steady cell degradation.,Chlorine-induced degradation in SOFCs operating with biogas,10.1039/c7se00156h
6,10049,Prolonged exposure to Cl results in abrupt and irreversible device failure.,Chlorine-induced degradation in SOFCs operating with biogas,10.1039/c7se00156h
7,10049,These results differ markedly from recent reports of Cl contamination in SOFCs operating independently with H-2 and CH4.,Chlorine-induced degradation in SOFCs operating with biogas,10.1039/c7se00156h
