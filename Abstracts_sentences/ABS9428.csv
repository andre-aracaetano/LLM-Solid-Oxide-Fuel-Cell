5,9428,"On the basis of thermodynamic and kinetic analysis, we propose that under anodic SOFC conditions, there is not a single stable Ov on pure, Pr-, Nd-, and Sm-doped surfaces because the first nearest-neighbor Ov is filled immediately upon formation, followed by the next catalytic cycle, while one Ov exists stably on Gd-doped surface, and subsequent catalytic cycle proceeds on the second nearest-neighbor vacancy site.",Understanding the oxygen-vacancy-related catalytic cycle for H2 oxidation on ceria-based SOFC anode and the promotion effect of lanthanide doping from theoretical perspectives,10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151803
