1,20970,"In order to simulate solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-related coking mechanisms of Ni, methane-induced surface carbide and carbon growth was studied under close-to-real conditions by synchrotron-based near-ambient-pressure (NAP) Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in the temperature region between 250 and 600 degrees C. Two complementary polycrystalline Ni samples were used, namely, Ni foam-serving as a model structure for bulk Ni in cermet materials such as Ni/YSZ- and Ni foil.",Near-Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Study of Methane-Induced Carbon Deposition on Clean and Copper-Modified Polycrystalline Nickel Materials,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b07317
2,20970,The growth mechanism of graphene/graphite species was found to be closely related to that previously described for ethylene-induced graphene growth on Ni(111).,Near-Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Study of Methane-Induced Carbon Deposition on Clean and Copper-Modified Polycrystalline Nickel Materials,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b07317
3,20970,"After a sufficiently long incubation period of the Ni foam in methane at 0.2 mbar and temperatures around 400 degrees C, cooling down to similar to 250 degrees C, and keeping the sample at this temperature for 50-60 min, initial formation of a near-surface carbide phase was observed, which exhibited the same spectroscopic fingerprint as the C2H4 induced Ni2C phase on Ni(111).",Near-Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Study of Methane-Induced Carbon Deposition on Clean and Copper-Modified Polycrystalline Nickel Materials,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b07317
4,20970,"Only in the presence of this carbidic species, subsequent graphene/graphite nucleation and growth was observed.",Near-Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Study of Methane-Induced Carbon Deposition on Clean and Copper-Modified Polycrystalline Nickel Materials,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b07317
5,20970,"Vice versa, the absence of this species excluded further graphene/graphite formation.",Near-Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Study of Methane-Induced Carbon Deposition on Clean and Copper-Modified Polycrystalline Nickel Materials,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b07317
6,20970,"At temperatures above 400 degrees C, decomposition/bulk dissolution of the graphene/graphite phase was observed on the rather open surface of the Ni foam.",Near-Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Study of Methane-Induced Carbon Deposition on Clean and Copper-Modified Polycrystalline Nickel Materials,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b07317
7,20970,"In contrast, Ni foil showed-under otherwise identical conditions predominant formation of unreactive amorphous carbon, which can only be removed at >= 500 degrees C by oxidative clean-off.",Near-Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Study of Methane-Induced Carbon Deposition on Clean and Copper-Modified Polycrystalline Nickel Materials,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b07317
8,20970,"Moreover, the complete suppression of carbide and subsequent graphene/graphite formation by Cu-alloying of the Ni foam and by addition of water to the methane atmosphere was verified.",Near-Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Study of Methane-Induced Carbon Deposition on Clean and Copper-Modified Polycrystalline Nickel Materials,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b07317
