4,19047,The novelty of our first-principles study lies in the incorporation of lattice thermal excitations on the formation energy and diffusion properties of V-O over wide epitaxial strain conditions (-4 <= eta <= +4%).,Ab initio description of oxygen vacancies in epitaxially strained SrTiO3 at finite temperatures,10.1038/s41598-021-91018-4
5,19047,"We found that thermal lattice excitations are necessary to obtain a satisfactory agreement between first-principles calculations and the available experimental data for the formation energy of V-O. Furthermore, it is shown that thermal lattice excitations noticeably affect the energy barriers for oxygen ion diffusion, which strongly depend on eta and are significantly reduced (increased) under tensile (compressive) strain.",Ab initio description of oxygen vacancies in epitaxially strained SrTiO3 at finite temperatures,10.1038/s41598-021-91018-4
6,19047,"The present work demonstrates that for a realistic theoretical description of oxygen vacancies in STO thin films is necessary to consider lattice thermal excitations, thus going beyond standard zero-temperature ab initio approaches.",Ab initio description of oxygen vacancies in epitaxially strained SrTiO3 at finite temperatures,10.1038/s41598-021-91018-4
