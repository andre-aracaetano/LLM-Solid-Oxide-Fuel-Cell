1,12287,"Ni pattern anodes with triple phase boundary (tpb) lengths varying between 0.04 and 4 m/cm(2) were prepared by photolithography, The lines are continuous on the whole surface area of the anode and are stable during thermal treatment up to 973 K.",Reaction mechanism of Ni pattern anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00462-8
2,12287,"The patterns also withstand electrochemical measurements up to moderate overpotentials of at least 200 mV. The impedance spectra consist of three semicircles and are fitted to an equivalent circuit consisting of an electrolyte resistance R-e, a charge transfer resistance R-t, a double layer capacitance C-d1, as well as three R-CPE ((C) under bar nstant (P) under bar hase (E) under bar lement) units.",Reaction mechanism of Ni pattern anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00462-8
3,12287,"It is found that two electrode processes are significantly influenced by the variation of the tpb length, whereas one process stays almost constant.",Reaction mechanism of Ni pattern anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00462-8
