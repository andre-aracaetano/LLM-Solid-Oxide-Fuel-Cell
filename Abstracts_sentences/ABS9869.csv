1,9869,"With the aim of reducing the temperature of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), a new high-performance perovskite cathode has been developed.",High-performance Fe-Co-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10008-010-1052-6
2,9869,An area-specific resistance (ASR) as low as 0.12 Omega cm(2) at 600 A degrees C was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on symmetrical cells.,High-performance Fe-Co-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10008-010-1052-6
3,9869,The cathode is a composite between (Gd(0.6)Sr(0.4))(0.99)Fe(0.8)Co(0.2)O(3-delta) (GSFC) and Ce(0.9)Gd(0.1)O(1.95) (CGO10).,High-performance Fe-Co-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10008-010-1052-6
4,9869,Examination of the microstructure of the cathodes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a possibility of further optimisation of the microstructure in order to increase the performance of the cathodes.,High-performance Fe-Co-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10008-010-1052-6
5,9869,It also seems that an adjustment of the sintering temperature will make a lowering of the ASR value possible.,High-performance Fe-Co-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10008-010-1052-6
6,9869,The cathodes were compatible with ceria-based electrolytes but reacted to some extent with zirconia-based electrolytes depending on the sintering temperature.,High-performance Fe-Co-based SOFC cathodes,10.1007/s10008-010-1052-6
