2,5770,The effect of ammonium poly-(methacrylate) (PMAA) dispersant and pH on the zeta potential of YSZ and NiO particles and the viscosity of the NiO/YSZ slurries is studied in detail.,"NiO/YSZ, anode-supported, thin-electrolyte, solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by gel casting",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.080
3,5770,The results show that the absolute zeta potential of YSZ and NiO particles reaches a maximum value at pH value similar to 10 and the viscosity of the NiO/YSZ slurry is lowest when the PMAA dispersant content is 1.5 wt.%.,"NiO/YSZ, anode-supported, thin-electrolyte, solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by gel casting",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.080
