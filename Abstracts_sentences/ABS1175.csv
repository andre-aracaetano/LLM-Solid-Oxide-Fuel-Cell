4,1175,The primary problem in the operation of SOFCs using biogas is H2S. The goal of this work is to investigate the possible effects of ammonia on different sorbents that have already successfully been used for the desulfurization of biogas.,Investigation of NH3 Influence on Adsorptive H2S Removal from Biogas for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Application,10.1002/cite.201700167
5,1175,The H2S adsorption capacity of four commercially available sorbents in the presence of NH3 was investigated as well as the influence of an upstream NH3 removal.,Investigation of NH3 Influence on Adsorptive H2S Removal from Biogas for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Application,10.1002/cite.201700167
6,1175,The CuO-MnO-based sorbent showed the best performance related to sulfur uptake.,Investigation of NH3 Influence on Adsorptive H2S Removal from Biogas for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Application,10.1002/cite.201700167
