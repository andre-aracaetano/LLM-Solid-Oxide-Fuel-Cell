1,8017,"The cobalt-based perovskites are the most common solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode materials, which generally have the issues of thermal compatibility and performance at the reducing temperature.","The investigation of co-assembled high-performance (Ba, Sm/Sr)(Co, Zr) O3-δ composite perovskite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.matlet.2023.135513
2,8017,"In this study, two Ba0.5(Sm/Sr)0.5Co0.8Zr0.2O3-delta (BSmCZ/BSrCZ) perovskite composites were synthesized using a smart co -assembled method, which were primarily composed of cubic doped-BaZrO3 and hexagonal doped-BaCoO3 pe-rovskites.","The investigation of co-assembled high-performance (Ba, Sm/Sr)(Co, Zr) O3-δ composite perovskite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.matlet.2023.135513
3,8017,"Both BSmCZ and BSrCZ composites exhibited more suited thermal expansion coefficient (12.8 x 10-6 and 13.9 x 10-6 K-1) to the electrolyte, nanostructure with extensive heterointerfaces and excellent cathode| electrolyte interfaces.","The investigation of co-assembled high-performance (Ba, Sm/Sr)(Co, Zr) O3-δ composite perovskite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.matlet.2023.135513
4,8017,"Compared to BSrCZ composite, the BSmCZ composite possessed a relatively higher content (65 %) of activated oxygen species and higher electrical conductivity (70.7 S cm -1).","The investigation of co-assembled high-performance (Ba, Sm/Sr)(Co, Zr) O3-δ composite perovskite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.matlet.2023.135513
