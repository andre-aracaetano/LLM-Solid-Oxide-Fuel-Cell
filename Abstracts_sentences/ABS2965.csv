1,2965,Layered perovskites have attracted abundant interest as advanced cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) due to their high electrical conductivity and excellent catalytic properties for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).,Growth of Thin-Film Layered Perovskite Cathodes by Pulsed Laser Deposition and their Electrochemical Studies in IT-SOFCs,10.1149/2.020406jes
2,2965,"However, cobalt related layer perovskite oxides generally suffer from larger thermal expansion co-efficiency (TEC) than that of electrolyte materials.",Growth of Thin-Film Layered Perovskite Cathodes by Pulsed Laser Deposition and their Electrochemical Studies in IT-SOFCs,10.1149/2.020406jes
3,2965,"In this study, we have prepared a thin interlayer, SmBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta (SBSCO) layered perovskite, via pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on a Sr- and Mg- doped LaGaO3 (LSGM) thin film electrolyte to prevent the formation of a micro-gap arising from the thermal mismatch between the SBSCO cathode and LSGM electrolyte.",Growth of Thin-Film Layered Perovskite Cathodes by Pulsed Laser Deposition and their Electrochemical Studies in IT-SOFCs,10.1149/2.020406jes
4,2965,A Samaria-doped ceria (SDC) buffer layer was prepared between the cathodic interlayer and LSGM electrolyte in order to prevent interdiffusion of cations.,Growth of Thin-Film Layered Perovskite Cathodes by Pulsed Laser Deposition and their Electrochemical Studies in IT-SOFCs,10.1149/2.020406jes
5,2965,"The cathodic interlayer of SBSCO is helpful for overcoming the thermal mismatch between the SBSCO powder cathode and the LSGM electrolyte, and also shows high power generating properties and small area specific resistance under typical fuel cell operating conditions.",Growth of Thin-Film Layered Perovskite Cathodes by Pulsed Laser Deposition and their Electrochemical Studies in IT-SOFCs,10.1149/2.020406jes
