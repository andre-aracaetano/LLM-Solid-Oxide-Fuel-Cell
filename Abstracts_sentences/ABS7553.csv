6,7553,"Applying hydrogen as the fuel, compressed air as the oxidant, the fuel cells were tested in the temperature region between 300 and 700 degreesC. The SDC-BCY20 electrolyte ITSOFCs reached a performance of 0.25 W/cm(2) at 550 degreesC. Under a constant discharge water was observed both, on the anode and the cathode side, indicative of hybrid conduction based on proton and oxygen ion transport.",Novel hybrid conductors based on doped ceria and BCY20 for ITSOFC applications,10.1016/j.elecom.2004.01.015
