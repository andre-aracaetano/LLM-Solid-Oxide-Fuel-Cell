1,14425,"Nanoporous 1-mu m thin La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSC) layers are deposited by spray pyrolysis and subsequently sintered at 600 degrees C, 800 degrees C, and 1000 degrees C. A strontium- and oxygen-rich phase can be found within the pore network, which appears at low sintering temperatures.",Influence of strontium-rich pore-filling phase on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.060
2,14425,This so-called secondary phase occupies up to 20.7 vol.% of the LSC films for the 600 degrees C annealing process.,Influence of strontium-rich pore-filling phase on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.060
3,14425,It does not hinder the electrochemical activity towards oxygen reduction of such layers that exhibit an area-specific resistance (ASR) as low as 0.13 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C in air.,Influence of strontium-rich pore-filling phase on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.060
4,14425,This result makes the spray pyrolysed LSC thin films promising candidates as intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes.,Influence of strontium-rich pore-filling phase on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.060
5,14425,For higher sintering temperatures the secondary phase progressively disappears.,Influence of strontium-rich pore-filling phase on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.060
6,14425,A correlation between the inverse of the ASR and the whole LSC surface area (regardless of the presence of the secondary phase or not) is also evidenced.,Influence of strontium-rich pore-filling phase on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.060
7,14425,The increase of ASR with increasing sintering temperature is found to be primarily related to the exchange neutral flux density of the Sr-deficient LSC.,Influence of strontium-rich pore-filling phase on the performance of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ thin-film cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.060
