1,3363,Doped cerium oxide (CeO2) based electrolytes are attractive alternative materials to replace the existing yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) used as electrolyte for SOFC (solid oxide fuel cells).,Inductively coupled plasma synthesis of CeO2-based powders from liquid solutions for SOFC electrolytes,10.1007/s11090-004-8836-3
2,3363,"Cerium oxide electrolytes offer a similar performance to YSZ electrolytes at a lower cell operating temperature (similar to600-800 degreesC), therefore reducing thermal stresses and solid state reactions among the cell components.",Inductively coupled plasma synthesis of CeO2-based powders from liquid solutions for SOFC electrolytes,10.1007/s11090-004-8836-3
3,3363,"Doped Ce1- xMexO2-x/2 (Me = Gd, Sm or Y) fine powders were synthesized from nitrate salts dissolved in water using a radio frequency inductively coupled plasma reactor.",Inductively coupled plasma synthesis of CeO2-based powders from liquid solutions for SOFC electrolytes,10.1007/s11090-004-8836-3
4,3363,It was demonstrated that the relative concentrations of Ce and dopants fed in the solutions were retained in the synthesized powders.,Inductively coupled plasma synthesis of CeO2-based powders from liquid solutions for SOFC electrolytes,10.1007/s11090-004-8836-3
5,3363,The products were all nano-crystalline with the basic crystal structure of CeO2 and the crystal size of the products was essentially independent of the dopant used.,Inductively coupled plasma synthesis of CeO2-based powders from liquid solutions for SOFC electrolytes,10.1007/s11090-004-8836-3
6,3363,The particle size distributions obtained were multimodal and in most cases trimodal.,Inductively coupled plasma synthesis of CeO2-based powders from liquid solutions for SOFC electrolytes,10.1007/s11090-004-8836-3
7,3363,The results obtained differ from a previously reported mechanism of particle synthesis from liquid precursors.,Inductively coupled plasma synthesis of CeO2-based powders from liquid solutions for SOFC electrolytes,10.1007/s11090-004-8836-3
