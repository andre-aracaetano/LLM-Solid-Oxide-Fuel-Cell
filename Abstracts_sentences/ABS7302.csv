1,7302,A 500 nm thick thin film YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrolyte was successfully fabricated on a conventionally processed anode substrate by spin coating of chemical solution containing slow-sintering YSZ nanoparticles with the particle size of 20 nm and subsequent sintering at 1100 degrees C. Incorporation of YSZ nanoparticles was effective for suppressing the differential densification of ultrafine precursor powder by mitigating the prevailing bi-axial constraining stress of the rigid substrate with numerous local multi-axial stress fields around them.,Thin film yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) by chemical solution deposition,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.01.021

3,7302,The thin film YSZ electrolyte placed on a rigid anode substrate with the GDC (gadolinia-doped ceria) and LSC (La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta) layers deposited by PLD (pulsed laser deposition) processes revealed that it had fairly good gas tightness relevant to a SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) electrolyte and maintained its structural integrity during fabrication and operation processes.,Thin film yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) by chemical solution deposition,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.01.021
4,7302,"In fact, the open circuit voltage was 1.07 V and maximum power density was 425 mW/cm(2) at 600 degrees C, which demonstrates that the chemical solution route can be a viable means for reducing electrolyte thickness for low- to intermediate-temperature SOFCs.",Thin film yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) by chemical solution deposition,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.01.021
