1,19482,"This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of a 48-h independent power outage system, evaluate the indoor thermal environment under power outage conditions, and improve residential awareness of disasters through a power outage experience.",Resiliency evaluation of a collective residence with an independent power outage system,10.1002/2475-8876.12316
2,19482,A power outage experiment was conducted in a collective residence with a 48-h independent power system.,Resiliency evaluation of a collective residence with an independent power outage system,10.1002/2475-8876.12316
3,19482,"The available power for each dwelling unit was limited based on the type of heat source, at 700 and 1200 W for cogeneration (CG) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) heating, respectively.",Resiliency evaluation of a collective residence with an independent power outage system,10.1002/2475-8876.12316
4,19482,The power supply was halted when the available power limit was exceeded.,Resiliency evaluation of a collective residence with an independent power outage system,10.1002/2475-8876.12316
5,19482,"During the experiment, the thermal environment, temperature, humidity, amount of power generated by the CG and SOFC, and load power of the dwelling units were analyzed.",Resiliency evaluation of a collective residence with an independent power outage system,10.1002/2475-8876.12316
6,19482,We also conducted a questionnaire survey to evaluate the indoor environment and infrastructure.,Resiliency evaluation of a collective residence with an independent power outage system,10.1002/2475-8876.12316
7,19482,"The results showed that home appliances could be used because all dwelling units were supplied with sufficient power, at 700 and 1200 W. The most important appliances were electric fans, refrigerators, lighting, mobile phones, and computer chargers.",Resiliency evaluation of a collective residence with an independent power outage system,10.1002/2475-8876.12316
8,19482,"Therefore, the experiment demonstrated that a comfortable evacuation living condition can be realized by using CG and SOFC during a power outage in the summer.",Resiliency evaluation of a collective residence with an independent power outage system,10.1002/2475-8876.12316
