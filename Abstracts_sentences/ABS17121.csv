2,17121,"While a Ni/GDC anode failed to operate after 12 h at a current density of 0.2 A cm(-2) and 650 degrees C with dry methane flow, the cell performance of a Ni0 9Fe0.1/GDC anode showed no degradation over 50 h. The outlet gas of SOFC was analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the results revealed that methane was oxidized more completely on a Ni-Fe/GDC anode compared to a Ni/GDC anode.",Enhanced stability of Ni-Fe/GDC solid oxide fuel cell anodes for dry methane fuel,10.1016/j.catcom.2010.07.014
