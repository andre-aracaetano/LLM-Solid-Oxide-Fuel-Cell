4,3151,"The results show that by selection of the optimal values of the fuel cell's temperature and pressure, air-to-fuel molar ratio, compressor and gas turbine pressure ratio, and the cycle pinch point as 809.8 K, 360 kPa, 2, 2.05, 11.6, and 34.9, the exergy efficiency is increased by 8%, and the produced electricity cost is reduced by 9.7%.","Optimization of a triple cycle based on a solid oxide fuel cell and gas and steam cycles with a multiobjective genetic algorithm and energy, exergy and economic analyses",10.1016/j.enconman.2018.11.023
5,3151,The sensitivity analysis shows that an increase in compressor pressure ratio leads to a decrease in the energy and exergy efficiencies and entropy production rates.,"Optimization of a triple cycle based on a solid oxide fuel cell and gas and steam cycles with a multiobjective genetic algorithm and energy, exergy and economic analyses",10.1016/j.enconman.2018.11.023
6,3151,A change in air-to-fuel molar ratio from 2 to 3 causes the triple cycle electricity cost first to increase and then to decrease.,"Optimization of a triple cycle based on a solid oxide fuel cell and gas and steam cycles with a multiobjective genetic algorithm and energy, exergy and economic analyses",10.1016/j.enconman.2018.11.023
