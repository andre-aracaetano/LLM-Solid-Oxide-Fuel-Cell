1,3077,This study presents the electrochemical performance of (Ba0.5Sr0.5)(0.9)Sm0.1CO0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSSCF) as a cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC).,Electrochemical performance of (Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.9Sm0.1Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ as an intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.022
2,3077,AC-impedance analyses were carried on an electrolyte supported BSSCF/Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC)/Ag half-cell and a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF)/SDC/Ag half-cell.,Electrochemical performance of (Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.9Sm0.1Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ as an intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.022
3,3077,"In contrast to the BSCF cathode half-cell, the total resistance of the BSSCF cathode half-cell was lower, e.g., at 550 degrees C; the values for the BSSCF and BSCF were 1.54 and 2.33 ohm cm(2), respectively.",Electrochemical performance of (Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.9Sm0.1Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ as an intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.11.022
