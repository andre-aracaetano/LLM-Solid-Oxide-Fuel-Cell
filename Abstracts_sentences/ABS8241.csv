1,8241,A key hindrance of operating solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) at low temperature is the relatively high cell resistance resulting in low power output density.,High performance solid-oxide fuel cell: Opening windows to low temperature application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.02.033
2,8241,"In this work, we report an SOFC design based on an anode-supported cell (ASC) with thin film Yttria stabilized zirconia electrolyte (YSZ), capable of high power output densities of 1050 mW cm(-2) using H-2 as fuel, at an operating temperature of 873 K. Such high cell performances have been realized by applying three optimization steps: (1) using La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta-perovskite (LSC) as high performing cathode material at low temperature; (2) integration of an optimized Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (CGO) inter-diffusion barrier layer and (3) optimization of the microstructure of the anode substrate by means of increasing the substrate porosity.",High performance solid-oxide fuel cell: Opening windows to low temperature application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.02.033
