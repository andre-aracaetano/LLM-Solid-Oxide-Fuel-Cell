3,7654,"mu SOFCs (diameter < 5 mm) have two main potential advantages, a substantial increase in the electrolyte surface area per unit volume of a stack and also rapid start-up.",Anode-supported tubular micro-solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02129.x
4,7654,"As fuel cell power is directly proportional to the active electrolyte surface area, a mu SOFC stack can substantially increase the VPD of an SOFC device.",Anode-supported tubular micro-solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02129.x
5,7654,A decrease in tube diameter allows for a reduction in wall thickness without any degradation of a cell's mechanical properties.,Anode-supported tubular micro-solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02129.x
6,7654,"Owing to its thin wall, a mu SOFC has an extremely high thermal shock resistance and low thermal mass.",Anode-supported tubular micro-solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2007.02129.x
