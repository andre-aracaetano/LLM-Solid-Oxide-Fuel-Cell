1,18721,"The area specific resistivity (ASR) of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x cathodes on Gd-doped ceria electrolytes has been measured over the temperature range 325-725 degrees C, The ASR values for single layer porous cathodes could be satisfactorily interpreted in terms of available data for oxygen surface exchange coefficients.",Properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x (LSCF) double layer cathodes on gadolinium-doped cerium oxide (CGO) electrolytes -: II.: Role of oxygen exchange and diffusion,10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00430-X
2,18721,By introducing a thin (similar to 1 mu m) dense layer of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x (LSCF) adjacent to the gadolinium-doped cerium oxide (CGO) electrolyte the resistivity values were decreased by a factor of 2-3 times; which could be explained by increasing the effective interfacial contact area between the LSCF and GGO.,Properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x (LSCF) double layer cathodes on gadolinium-doped cerium oxide (CGO) electrolytes -: II.: Role of oxygen exchange and diffusion,10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00430-X
3,18721,However calculations using data for oxygen self diffusion coefficients indicated much higher ASR values than determined experimentally for these duplex layer cathode structures.,Properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x (LSCF) double layer cathodes on gadolinium-doped cerium oxide (CGO) electrolytes -: II.: Role of oxygen exchange and diffusion,10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00430-X
4,18721,"It is necessary, therefore, to invoke enhanced oxygen ion transport through the dense layer which could arise either due to the development of A-site deficient LSCF material, or too rapid diffusion via grain boundaries.",Properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x (LSCF) double layer cathodes on gadolinium-doped cerium oxide (CGO) electrolytes -: II.: Role of oxygen exchange and diffusion,10.1016/S0167-2738(97)00430-X
