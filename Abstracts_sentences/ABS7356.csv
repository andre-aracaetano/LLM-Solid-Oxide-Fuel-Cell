1,7356,Samaria-doped ceria Ce0.9SM0.1O1.95 (SDC) and samaria and praseodymium co-doped ceria Ce0.9Sm0.08Pr0.02O1.95 (SPDC) powders were synthesized by glycine nitrate process.,The effect of Pr co-dopant on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.08.018
2,7356,SDC and SPDC electrolytes were made using the corresponding powders to press pellets and sinter them in air at 1400degreesC. SEM and open porosity measurement showed the electrolytes were not dense and SPDC was more porous than SDC.,The effect of Pr co-dopant on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.08.018
3,7356,Raman spectra indicated the oxygen vacancy concentration of SPDC was higher than SDC.,The effect of Pr co-dopant on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.08.018
4,7356,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with SPDC and SDC electrolytes were made and tested.,The effect of Pr co-dopant on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.08.018
5,7356,The SOFC.,The effect of Pr co-dopant on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.08.018
6,7356,with SPDC electrolyte had higher power density but lower open circuit voltage.,The effect of Pr co-dopant on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.08.018
7,7356,Impedance measurement was undertaken for the SOFCs at open circuit and the results showed that both the Ohmic and polarization resistances for SPDC electrolyte are smaller than for SDC.,The effect of Pr co-dopant on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.08.018
8,7356,It is explained that co-doping Pr in Sm-doped ceria may increase the oxygen ionic conductivity by changing the grain boundary conditions so that more oxygen vacancies may exist and move faster.,The effect of Pr co-dopant on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.08.018
9,7356,The electrochemical catalytic activity of Pr may play an important role in decreasing the polarization of electrolyte-electrode interface of the SOFCs.,The effect of Pr co-dopant on the performance of solid oxide fuel cells with Sm-doped ceria electrolyte,10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.08.018
