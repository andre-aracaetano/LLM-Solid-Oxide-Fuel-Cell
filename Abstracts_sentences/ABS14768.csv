1,14768,Co-rich and crack-free Mn-Co oxide coatings were deposited on AN 430 substrates by anodic electrodeposition from aqueous Solutions.,Oxidation resistance and electrical properties of anodically electrodeposited Mn-Co oxide coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.114
2,14768,"The as-deposited Mn-Co oxide coatings, with nano-scale fibrous morphology and a metastable rock salt-type structure, evolved into a (Cr,Mn,CO)(3)O-4 spinel layer due to the outward diffusion of Cr from the AISI 430 substrates when pretreated in air.",Oxidation resistance and electrical properties of anodically electrodeposited Mn-Co oxide coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.114
3,14768,The Mn-Co oxide coatings were reduced into metallic Co and Mn3O4 Phases when annealed in a reducing atmosphere of 5% H-2-95% N-2.,Oxidation resistance and electrical properties of anodically electrodeposited Mn-Co oxide coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.114
4,14768,"In contrast to the degraded oxidation resistance and electrical properties observed for the air-pretreated Mn-Co oxide coated samples, the H-2-pretreated Mn-Co oxide coatings not only acted as a protective barrier to reduce the Cr outward diffusion, but also improved the electrical performance of the steel interconnects.",Oxidation resistance and electrical properties of anodically electrodeposited Mn-Co oxide coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.114
5,14768,"The improvement in electronic conductivity can be ascribed to the higher electronic conductivity of the Co-rich spinel layer and better adhesion of the scale to the steel substrate, thereby eliminating scale spallation.",Oxidation resistance and electrical properties of anodically electrodeposited Mn-Co oxide coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.114
