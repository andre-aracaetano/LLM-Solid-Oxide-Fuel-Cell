1,4920,"Under realistic operation conditions of solid oxide fuel cells, CO2 and/or H2O in air can react with the cathode, and deteriorate its activity and stability.",Effects of CO2 and H2O on Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ cathode and modification by a Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ coating,10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.09.002
2,4920,"In this study, effects of CO2 and H2O on Ba0.3Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta (BCFN) cathode have been studied by the analyses of X-ray diffraction patterns, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical impedance spectra.",Effects of CO2 and H2O on Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ cathode and modification by a Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ coating,10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.09.002
3,4920,"In simulated air with the co-existence of CO2 and H2O, BaCO3 is formed on the cathode surface at 600 degrees C, where BCFN is stable with either CO2 or H2O individually.",Effects of CO2 and H2O on Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ cathode and modification by a Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ coating,10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.09.002
4,4920,"In addition, BCFN performs lower electrical conductivity and higher polarization resistance (R-p) in air with CO2 and H2O. However, degradation of BCFN electrode is reversible:; of BCFN recovers when atmosphere is switched back to fresh air.",Effects of CO2 and H2O on Ba0.9Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ cathode and modification by a Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ coating,10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.09.002
