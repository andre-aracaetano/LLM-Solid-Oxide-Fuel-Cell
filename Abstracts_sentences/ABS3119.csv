1,3119,"In this study, a gas turbine (GT) system for auxiliary power units (APUs) is proposed based on a fuel cell combustor, which separates combustion into three processes: fuel-rich combustion, electrochemical reaction through solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), and fuel-lean combustion.",Analysis of a gas turbine auxiliary power unit system based on a fuel cell combustor,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.006
2,3119,"Compared with the traditional GT system, the efficiency of the pro-posed system is much higher due to the high efficiency of the electrochemical conversion process in SOFCs.",Analysis of a gas turbine auxiliary power unit system based on a fuel cell combustor,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.006
3,3119,"Meanwhile, the advantage of the GT's high power density is conserved to improve the system power density by increasing the GT power proportion, which makes it possible to be used as an APU for aircraft.",Analysis of a gas turbine auxiliary power unit system based on a fuel cell combustor,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.006
4,3119,"First, the system was simulated and evaluated at the base case with electrical efficiency reaching 45.62% and power density reaching 0.43 kW/kg.",Analysis of a gas turbine auxiliary power unit system based on a fuel cell combustor,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.006
5,3119,"Then, extra fuel was added into the fuel-lean combustion chamber to increase the GT power proportion, which led to an increase in power density and a decrease in efficiency.",Analysis of a gas turbine auxiliary power unit system based on a fuel cell combustor,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.006
6,3119,"Finally, the concept of a superhigh-temperature SOFC was proposed to further increase the system power density.",Analysis of a gas turbine auxiliary power unit system based on a fuel cell combustor,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.006
7,3119,"When the SOFCs operate at a superhigh temperature of 1473 K, the power density of the system reaches 2.67 kW/kg, which is much higher than that of conventional SOFC-GT hybrid systems.(c) 2022",Analysis of a gas turbine auxiliary power unit system based on a fuel cell combustor,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.10.006
