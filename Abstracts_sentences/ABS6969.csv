1,6969,"Nano-sized Ce0.79Gd0.2Cu0.01O2-delta electrolyte powder was synthesized by the polyvinyl alcohol assisted combustion method, and then characterized by crystalline structure, powder morphology, sintering micro-structure and electrical properties.",High sintering activity Cu-Gd co-doped CeO2 electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.053
2,6969,"The results demonstrate that the as-synthesized Ce0.79Gd0.2Cu0.01O2-delta was well crystalline with cubic fluorite structure, and exhibited a porous foamy morphology composed of gas cavities and fine crystals ranging from 30 to 50 nm.",High sintering activity Cu-Gd co-doped CeO2 electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.053
3,6969,"After sintering at 1100 degrees C, the as-prepared pellets exhibited a dense and moderate-grained micro-structure with 95.54% relative density, suggesting that the synthesized Ce0.79Gd0.2Cu0.01O2-delta powder had high sintering activity.",High sintering activity Cu-Gd co-doped CeO2 electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.053
4,6969,"The powders made by this method are expected to offer potential application in intermediate-to-low temperature solid-oxide fuel cells, due to its very low densification sintering temperature (1100 degrees C), as well as high conductivity of 0.026 S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C and good mechanical performance with three-point flexural strength value of 148.15 +/- 2.42 MPa.",High sintering activity Cu-Gd co-doped CeO2 electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.03.053
