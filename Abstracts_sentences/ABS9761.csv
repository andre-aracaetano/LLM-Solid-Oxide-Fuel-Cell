1,9761,"In exploring new cobalt-free perovskite oxide cathodes for intermediate temperature SOFCs (solid oxide fuel cells), Sc and Nb co-doped SrFeO3-based perovskite, SSNF (SrSc0.175Nb0.025Fe0.8O3-delta) was synthesized.",A new scandium and niobium co-doped cobalt-free perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.061
2,9761,"Powder X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and SAED (selected area electron diffraction) showed that SSNF crystallized in the tetragonal space group P4/mmm (#123) with lattice parameters of a = 3.912 angstrom and c = 7.794 angstrom.",A new scandium and niobium co-doped cobalt-free perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.061
3,9761,"Upon heating from 400 degrees C to 1000 degrees C, the oxygen non-stoichiometry (delta) of SSNF increased from 0.19 to 0.47, concurrent with a decrease in the average valence state of iron from 3.73 to 3.03.",A new scandium and niobium co-doped cobalt-free perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.061
4,9761,"The electrical conductivity of SSNF followed semi-conducting thermal dependence behavior, with values of 3.7-9.4 S cm(-1) at 350-750 degrees C. O-2-TPD (oxygen temperature programmed desorption) indicated the onset of Fe4+ reduction at 500 degrees C. SSNF exhibited a low thermal expansion coefficient value of 16.2 x 10(-6) K-1 (70-900 degrees C), as anticipated by excluding cobalt from the perovskite lattice.",A new scandium and niobium co-doped cobalt-free perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.061
5,9761,"SSNF was relatively inert to the SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9) electrolyte up to 1000 degrees C. These features, and its low ASR (area specific resistance) of 0.236 n cm(2) at 600 degrees C, denote the potential of SSNF and the opportunity to create new structures with improved performance through a co-doping strategy.",A new scandium and niobium co-doped cobalt-free perovskite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.061
