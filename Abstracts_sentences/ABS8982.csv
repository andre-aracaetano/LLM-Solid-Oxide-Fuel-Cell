1,8982,A cermet of sliver and gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) is investigated as the anode material of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Direct operation of Ag-based anode solid oxide fuel cells on propane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.111
2,8982,The SOFCs are operated with hydrogen and dry propane as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant.,Direct operation of Ag-based anode solid oxide fuel cells on propane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.111
3,8982,Their electrochemical and durability performances are tested and compared to those of SOFCs with conventional Ni-GDC anode.,Direct operation of Ag-based anode solid oxide fuel cells on propane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.111
4,8982,"Experimental results show that performances of the SOFCs, respectively with Ag-GDC and Ni-GDC anode, are similar when operated on hydrogen, while quite different on propane.",Direct operation of Ag-based anode solid oxide fuel cells on propane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.111
5,8982,The open circuit voltage (OCV) of a SOFC with Ag-GDC anode is stable at similar to 1 V while that with Ni-GDC anode continuously drops from the initial 1.2 V-0.85 V in 140 min.,Direct operation of Ag-based anode solid oxide fuel cells on propane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.111
6,8982,"A SOFC with AgGDC anode has been stably operated on propane at a constant current density of 103 mA cm(-2) for more than 160 h while that with Ni-GDC anode for only 50 h. SEM examination shows Ni-GDC anode is destroyed by carbon deposition during operation on propane, while Ag-GDC anode is well conserved and has a carbon layer, with some breakages, built on its surface.",Direct operation of Ag-based anode solid oxide fuel cells on propane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.111
7,8982,Mechanisms of the stable operation of SOFCs with Ag-GDC anode on dry propane is investigated and analyzed.,Direct operation of Ag-based anode solid oxide fuel cells on propane,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.111
