4,15363,The crystallite size was in the similar to 3 nm to similar to 80 nm range.,Nanostructured Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by a Solution Spray-Coating Process,10.1149/2.0541613jes
5,15363,"Polarization resistance was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) from 400 degrees C to 700 degrees C. Nano-cathodes of similar to 70 nm thickness fired at 700 degrees C exhibited polarization resistance of similar to 0.23 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. By contrast, LSM + YSZ cathodes made by a conventional process exhibited polarization resistance of similar to 2 Omega cm(2).",Nanostructured Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by a Solution Spray-Coating Process,10.1149/2.0541613jes
