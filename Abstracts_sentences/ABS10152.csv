1,10152,Generalized predictive control (GPC) is applied to control the maximum temperature in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack and the temperature difference over the stack.,Model predictive control of the solid oxide fuel cell stack temperature with models based on experimental data,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.126
2,10152,"GPC is a model predictive control method and the models utilized in this work are ARX-type (autoregressive with extra input), multiple input-multiple output, polynomial models that were identified from experimental data obtained from experiments with a complete SOFC system.",Model predictive control of the solid oxide fuel cell stack temperature with models based on experimental data,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.126
3,10152,"The proposed control is evaluated by simulation with various input-output combinations, with and without constraints.",Model predictive control of the solid oxide fuel cell stack temperature with models based on experimental data,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.126
4,10152,A comparison with conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control is also made.,Model predictive control of the solid oxide fuel cell stack temperature with models based on experimental data,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.126
5,10152,"It is shown that if only the stack maximum temperature is controlled, a standard PID controller can be used to obtain output performance comparable to that obtained with the significantly more complex model predictive controller.",Model predictive control of the solid oxide fuel cell stack temperature with models based on experimental data,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.126
6,10152,"However, in order to control the temperature difference over the stack, both the stack minimum and the maximum temperature need to be controlled and this cannot be done with a single PID controller.",Model predictive control of the solid oxide fuel cell stack temperature with models based on experimental data,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.126
7,10152,In such a case the model predictive controller provides a feasible and effective solution.,Model predictive control of the solid oxide fuel cell stack temperature with models based on experimental data,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.126
