1,9227,"Iron-cobalt-based perovskite oxides with general formula Ln(0.7)Sr(0.3)Fe(0.8)Co(0.2)O(3-delta) (where Ln = La, Pr and Gd) have been investigated for their application as intermediate-temperature cathodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","Development of electrolyte-supported intermediate-temperature single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells using Ln0.7Sr0.3Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, La, Gd) cathodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.069
2,9227,Powdered samples of these materials were synthesized by a novel gel combustion process and then characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XPD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).,"Development of electrolyte-supported intermediate-temperature single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells using Ln0.7Sr0.3Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, La, Gd) cathodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.069
3,9227,"XPD patterns were satisfactorily indexed with an orthorhombic GdFeO3-type structure and, for all samples, a mean particle size of less than 1 mu m was estimated from the SEM data.","Development of electrolyte-supported intermediate-temperature single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells using Ln0.7Sr0.3Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, La, Gd) cathodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.069
4,9227,"Experimental single-chamber SOFCs using with these materials as cathodes and NiO-SDC (samaria-doped ceria) and SDC as anode and electrolyte, respectively, were evaluated at 600 degrees C in a methane/oxygen mixtures.","Development of electrolyte-supported intermediate-temperature single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells using Ln0.7Sr0.3Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ (Ln = Pr, La, Gd) cathodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.069
