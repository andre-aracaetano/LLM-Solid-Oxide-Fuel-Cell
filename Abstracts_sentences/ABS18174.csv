1,18174,"The structure and performance of Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4M0.6O3(M=Co, Mn, Fe; denoted SSCC, SSCM and SSCF, respectively) as intermediate temperature-solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) cathodes were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry (TG), thermal expansion, electrical conductivity and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).","Structure and Properties of Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4M0.6O3(M=CO, Mn, Fe) as IT-SOFCs Cathodes",10.3866/PKU.WHXB20090609
2,18174,The Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4M0.6O3 system has an orthorhombic structure.,"Structure and Properties of Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4M0.6O3(M=CO, Mn, Fe) as IT-SOFCs Cathodes",10.3866/PKU.WHXB20090609
3,18174,"The crystal parameter increases in the following order: Co, Mn, Fe, while the oxygen content, thermal expansion and electrical conductivity decrease in the same order.","Structure and Properties of Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4M0.6O3(M=CO, Mn, Fe) as IT-SOFCs Cathodes",10.3866/PKU.WHXB20090609
4,18174,"The electrocatalytic activity of SSCM cathodes is limited by the oxide ion diffusion process because of low oxide ion vacancy, while the electrocatalytic activity of SSCC or SSCF is controlled by an oxygen exchange process on the cathode surface and an oxide ion diffusion process in the cathode because of the high oxide ion vacancy.","Structure and Properties of Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4M0.6O3(M=CO, Mn, Fe) as IT-SOFCs Cathodes",10.3866/PKU.WHXB20090609
5,18174,"The area specific resistance (ASR) of SSCF is lower than that of the SSCC above 700 degrees C because of the high oxide diffusion coefficient of SSCF, so the total electrocatalytic activity of SSCF is higher than that of SSCC.","Structure and Properties of Sm0.5Sr0.5Co0.4M0.6O3(M=CO, Mn, Fe) as IT-SOFCs Cathodes",10.3866/PKU.WHXB20090609
