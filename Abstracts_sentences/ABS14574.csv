1,14574,In this paper we present results for a high power density IT-SOFC and a method for dispersing nanosized Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) particles at the GDC electrolyte and Ni-GDC anode interface.,Performance of IT-SOFC with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Functional Layer at the Interface of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Electrolyte and Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Anode,10.1002/fuce.200900005
2,14574,Dispersed nanosized particles were deposited to form an anode functional layer (AFL),Performance of IT-SOFC with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Functional Layer at the Interface of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Electrolyte and Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Anode,10.1002/fuce.200900005
3,14574,"Anode supports were prepared by tape casting of large micron-sized NiO powder and sub micron-sized GDC powder without pore former For the cathode a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-GDC composite was used Without an AFL the open circuit potential (OCP) and the maximum power density were 0.677 V and 407 mW cm(-2), respectively, at 650 degrees C using 30 sccm of hydrogen and air flow-rate.",Performance of IT-SOFC with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Functional Layer at the Interface of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Electrolyte and Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Anode,10.1002/fuce.200900005
4,14574,"With an AFL the OCP and the maximum power density increased to 0.796 V and 994 mW cm(-2), respectively, at the same temperature.",Performance of IT-SOFC with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Functional Layer at the Interface of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Electrolyte and Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Anode,10.1002/fuce.200900005
5,14574,"Two point probe impedance measurements revealed that the AFL fabricated by the proposed method not only increased the OCP but also reduced the electrode polarisation by 68% The effect of gas flow-rate is also present in this paper When hydrogen and air flow-rate is increased at 90 sccm, the sample with AFL obtained 1.57 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C",Performance of IT-SOFC with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Functional Layer at the Interface of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Electrolyte and Ni-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 Anode,10.1002/fuce.200900005
