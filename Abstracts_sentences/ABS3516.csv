1,3516,"In this study, we evaluate lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) surface-coated with lanthanum nickelate (LNO) fabricated by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) for application in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ, cathode surface-treated with La2NiO4+δ by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition for high performance solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.162
2,3516,The AACVD method successfully produces LNO in the desired composition and crystal structure.,"La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ, cathode surface-treated with La2NiO4+δ by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition for high performance solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.162
3,3516,The deposited LNO is confirmed to form a dense and uniform layer along the nano-porous LSCF support.,"La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ, cathode surface-treated with La2NiO4+δ by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition for high performance solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.162
4,3516,"The LSCF with an optimal amount of LNO surface clearly enhances the SOFC performance, showing a power increase of approximately 60% at 600 degrees C in our experiment.","La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ, cathode surface-treated with La2NiO4+δ by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition for high performance solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.162
5,3516,"This enhancement results from the reduction of both ohmic and polarization resistance, presumably due to improved cathodic surface kinetics and current collection.","La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ, cathode surface-treated with La2NiO4+δ by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition for high performance solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.162
6,3516,"This AACVD LNO-treatment is also confirmed to be effective in improving long-term stability, significantly suppressing the power decrease observed in an untreated sample.","La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ, cathode surface-treated with La2NiO4+δ by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition for high performance solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.162
