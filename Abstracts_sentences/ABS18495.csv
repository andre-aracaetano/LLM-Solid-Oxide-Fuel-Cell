1,18495,Ni/CG40-cermet anodes with two different ratios of nickel and ceria-gadolinia-oxide were exposed to seven different reduction temperatures between 555 degrees C and 1140 degrees C. For each reduction temperature one sample was analysed by scanning electron microscopy.,Nickel agglomeration in solid oxide fuel cells: The influence of temperature,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.015
2,18495,The continuous particle size distributions were determined from the images.,Nickel agglomeration in solid oxide fuel cells: The influence of temperature,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.015
3,18495,Significant nickel particle growth occurred above a reduction temperature of 850 degrees C for both anodes.,Nickel agglomeration in solid oxide fuel cells: The influence of temperature,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.015
4,18495,The T-dependent nickel particle growth in the range of several initial particle radii could be fitted well with an Arrhenius type equation.,Nickel agglomeration in solid oxide fuel cells: The influence of temperature,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.015
5,18495,"However, no clear trend was obtained for the activation energy of the nickel agglomeration as a function of the initial particle sizes and the Ni/CG40 ratio.",Nickel agglomeration in solid oxide fuel cells: The influence of temperature,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.015
6,18495,This lack of systematic trend may indicate competing material transport mechanisms such as diffusion and/or evaporation/condensation.,Nickel agglomeration in solid oxide fuel cells: The influence of temperature,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.015
7,18495,"For Ni/CG40 anodes with higher metallic content, nickel agglomeration was more pronounced for reduction temperatures above 950 C. Besides the nickel, the ceria-gadolinia-oxide showed an increase in particle size at reduction temperatures above 950 degrees C as well.",Nickel agglomeration in solid oxide fuel cells: The influence of temperature,10.1016/j.ssi.2012.01.015
