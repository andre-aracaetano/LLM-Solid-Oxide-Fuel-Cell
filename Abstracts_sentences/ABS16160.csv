1,16160,"A series of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with anodes containing mixtures of either Cu and Ni or Cu and Co, prepared by impregnation of the metal salts into porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), were examined for operation with both H-2 and n-butane fuels at 973 and 1073 K.",A study of SOFC anodes based on Cu-Ni and Cu-Co bimetallics in CeO2-YSZ,10.1149/1.1774184
2,16160,"The Cu-Ni mixtures formed single-phase alloys; however, anodes prepared with Cu0.8Ni0.2 were found to be unstable in n-butane at 973 K if the alloy was reduced at 973 K, but stable if reduced at 1073 K, indicating a probable change in surface composition with reduction temperature.",A study of SOFC anodes based on Cu-Ni and Cu-Co bimetallics in CeO2-YSZ,10.1149/1.1774184
3,16160,"The addition of Ni to Cu significantly increased the performance of the cells for operation in H-2, but caused no change in performance for n-butane.",A study of SOFC anodes based on Cu-Ni and Cu-Co bimetallics in CeO2-YSZ,10.1149/1.1774184
4,16160,"Unlike the Cu-Ni system, Cu-Co bimetallics formed two phases.",A study of SOFC anodes based on Cu-Ni and Cu-Co bimetallics in CeO2-YSZ,10.1149/1.1774184
5,16160,"It appears that Cu covers the surface of most of the Co, based on reduced CO adsorption and the fact that Cu0.5Co0.5 mixtures were stable for at least 3 h in n-butane at 973 K. Again, at 973 K, the addition of Co to Cu significantly increased the performance of the cells for operation in H-2, but caused no change in performance for n-butane.",A study of SOFC anodes based on Cu-Ni and Cu-Co bimetallics in CeO2-YSZ,10.1149/1.1774184
6,16160,"At 1073 K, improved performance was observed for both H-2 and n-butane with anodes based on Cu and Co.",A study of SOFC anodes based on Cu-Ni and Cu-Co bimetallics in CeO2-YSZ,10.1149/1.1774184
7,16160,The results suggest that bimetallics are worth considering for fuel cells that operate on hydrocarbons.,A study of SOFC anodes based on Cu-Ni and Cu-Co bimetallics in CeO2-YSZ,10.1149/1.1774184
