6,11506,"High-temperature byproduct heat from the SOFC drives the calcination reaction, which restores CaO. Unfortunately, the possible realization of the process may encounter various technical difficulties mainly connected with requirements for the SOFC (very high operating temperature, high sulfur tolerance, integrated heat exchanger) and CaO/CaCO3 process (the decrease of the performance with increasing number of cycles and problematic heat transport into calcination vessel).",Some technical issues of zero-emission coal technology,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.08.012
