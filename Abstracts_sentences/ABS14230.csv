2,14230,"Materials with about 3 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 composition are good electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cell, ceramic membrane oxygen separation and a number of related devices because of their superior mechanical properties and ease of fabrication into thin self-supporting structures in comparison with a material in the 8-10 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 composition range.",Analysis of the conductivity of commercial easy sintering grade 3 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.06.012
3,14230,"In this study, sintering behaviour, impedance studies, four-probe DC conductivity measurements and microstructure analysis has been performed on various easy sintering grade materials from two commercial powder suppliers.",Analysis of the conductivity of commercial easy sintering grade 3 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.06.012
4,14230,"These materials achieve near theoretical density at sintering temperatures as low as 1350-1400 degreesC. For direct comparison of the conductivity and impedance behaviour in easy sintering grade materials, several other 3 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 powders were also investigated.",Analysis of the conductivity of commercial easy sintering grade 3 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 materials,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.06.012
