2,3251,These seals must function at high temperatures between 600 and 900 degrees C and in the oxidizing and reducing environments of fuels and air.,High-temperature seals for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC),10.1361/105994906X117224
3,3251,"Among the different types of seals, the metal-metal seals can be readily fabricated using metal joining, soldering, and brazing techniques.",High-temperature seals for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC),10.1361/105994906X117224
4,3251,"However, metal-ceramic and ceramic-ceramic seals require significant research and development because the brittle nature of ceramics/glasses can lead to fracture and loss of seal integrity and functionality.",High-temperature seals for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC),10.1361/105994906X117224
5,3251,"Consequently, any seals involving ceramics/glasses also require significant attention and technology development for reliable SOFC operation.",High-temperature seals for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC),10.1361/105994906X117224
6,3251,This paper is prepared to primarily address the needs and possible approacbes for high-temperature seals for SOFC and seals fabricated using some of these approaches.,High-temperature seals for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC),10.1361/105994906X117224
7,3251,A new concept of self-healing glass seals is proposed for making seals among material combinations with a significant expansion mismatches.,High-temperature seals for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC),10.1361/105994906X117224
