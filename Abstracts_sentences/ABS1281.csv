4,1281,"Pt cathode shows lower activation resistance by 50% after a 10 h operation and higher thermal stability by a factor of 2 compared with the cell with a Pt-only cathode, which is known to be the best single catalyst at 450 degrees C. Eventually, a thin-film SOFC with a highly active and stable CeO2-overcoated cathode based on an anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) substrate demonstrates a high peak power density of 800 mW cm(-2) at 500 degrees C, which is the highest performance ever reported for an AAO-based SOFC at this temperature.",Ultrathin Atomic Layer-Deposited CeO2 Overlayer for High-Performance Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1021/acsami.9b10572
