3,8906,Reversible solid oxide fuel cell (RSOFC) as the energy storage device can effectively store the renewable energy and build a bidirectional connection with natural gas (NG).,Reversible solid oxide fuel cell for natural gas/renewable hybrid power generation systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.057
4,8906,"In this paper, the energy storage strategy was designed to improve the RE penetration and dynamic operation stability in a distributed system coupling wind generators, internal combustion engine, RSOFC and lithium-ion batteries.",Reversible solid oxide fuel cell for natural gas/renewable hybrid power generation systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.057
5,8906,"By compromising the relative deviation of power supply and demand, RE penetration, system efficiency and capacity requirement, the strategy that no more than 36% of the maximum wind power output is directly supplied to users and the other is stored by the combination of battery and reversible solid oxide fuel cell is optimal for the distributed system.",Reversible solid oxide fuel cell for natural gas/renewable hybrid power generation systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.057
6,8906,"In the case, the RE penetration reached 56.9% and the system efficiency reached 55.2%.",Reversible solid oxide fuel cell for natural gas/renewable hybrid power generation systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.057
7,8906,"The maximum relative deviation of power supply and demand is also lower than 4%, which is significantly superior to that in the wind curtailment case.",Reversible solid oxide fuel cell for natural gas/renewable hybrid power generation systems,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.057
