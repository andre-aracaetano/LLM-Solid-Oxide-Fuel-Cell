1,11699,"A new composite solid oxide fuel cell anode material, SrTi1-xFexO3-delta mixed with Gd-doped ceria, was tested in La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta electrolyte-supported cells with La0.4Ce0.6O2 barrier layers and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 cathodes.",Fe-substituted SrTiO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ee23791e
2,11699,"The x = 0.7 composition had an anode polarization resistance of 0.17 Omega cm(2), at 800 degrees C in humidified H-2, much lower than the value 0.39 Omega cm(2) measured for x = 0.4 and 3.14 Omega cm(2) for x = 0.",Fe-substituted SrTiO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ee23791e
3,11699,"The reduced polarization resistance correlated with increased oxygen non-stoichiometry delta, which suggests that it may be related to increased ionic conductivity.",Fe-substituted SrTiO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ee23791e
4,11699,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements at 800 degrees C on the x = 0.7 anode cell showed a main response centered at similar to 1 Hz that increased with decreasing hydrogen partial pressure.,Fe-substituted SrTiO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ee23791e
5,11699,The maximum power density observed was for the x = 0.7 cell - 337 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C in air and humidified hydrogen - and was limited mainly by the thick electrolyte.,Fe-substituted SrTiO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 composite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ee23791e
