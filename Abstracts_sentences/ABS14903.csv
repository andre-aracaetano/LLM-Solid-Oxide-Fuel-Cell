1,14903,"We investigated an appropriate preparation condition for anode-supported SOFCs: (La,Sr)MnO3/cathode functional layer/YSZ/Ni-YSZ were fabricated with and without a Ni-YSZ anode functional layer (AFL) via the tape-casting method, where the AFL thicknesses were controlled from approximately 20 to 80 mm.",Fabrication and Power Densities of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Different Ni-YSZ Anode Functional Layer Thicknesses,10.1002/fuce.201400138
2,14903,"The warpage depended on the co-sintering temperature of the electrolyte/AFL/anode-support half-cells, indicating that similar shrinkage of the electrolyte/AFL/anode support is significant for lower warpages.",Fabrication and Power Densities of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Different Ni-YSZ Anode Functional Layer Thicknesses,10.1002/fuce.201400138
3,14903,The electrical properties of SOFCs with AFLs were compared to those of SOFCs without AFLs.,Fabrication and Power Densities of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Different Ni-YSZ Anode Functional Layer Thicknesses,10.1002/fuce.201400138
4,14903,"In this regard, the use of an AFL decreased the ohmic and activation polarization resistances due to both the decrease in contact resistance between the electrolyte and the AFL and the increase in three-phase boundaries.",Fabrication and Power Densities of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Different Ni-YSZ Anode Functional Layer Thicknesses,10.1002/fuce.201400138
5,14903,"However, the polarization diffusion increased when an AFL was employed, because AFL layers are denser than the anode support.",Fabrication and Power Densities of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Different Ni-YSZ Anode Functional Layer Thicknesses,10.1002/fuce.201400138
6,14903,"The maximum power densities of samples with AFL were higher than those of SOFCs without AFLs, indicating that the decrease in both ohmic and activation-polarization resistances is more significant for improving the power densities, as compared to the concentration polarization resistance.",Fabrication and Power Densities of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Different Ni-YSZ Anode Functional Layer Thicknesses,10.1002/fuce.201400138
