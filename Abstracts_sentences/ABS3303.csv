1,3303,A microtubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) consisting of Gd-doped CeO(2) (GDC) interlayer-Sc stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) electrolyte has been prepared on an anode supported tube using one step sintering process at 1350 degrees C.,One-step sintering process of gadolinia-doped ceria interlayer-scandia-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for anode supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.046
2,3303,"The cell performance under high fuel utilization condition, with H(2) flow rate as low as 4.3 mL min(-1) per 1 cm(2) electrode area is evaluated.",One-step sintering process of gadolinia-doped ceria interlayer-scandia-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for anode supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.046
3,3303,The one-step sintering process results in an improvement of open circuit voltage but an increase of ohmic resistance due to possible high resistive layer and voids observed between GDC and ScSZ layers.,One-step sintering process of gadolinia-doped ceria interlayer-scandia-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for anode supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.046
4,3303,"The performance of the cell shows power densities of 0.35-0.57 W cm(-2) with corresponding energy efficiencies of 45-20% (LHV), respectively, at 700 degrees C. Impedance analyses at different voltages have shown that the overpotential due to gas transport is dominant in the low current density region.",One-step sintering process of gadolinia-doped ceria interlayer-scandia-stabilized zirconia electrolyte for anode supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.046
