1,17943,"The outstanding oxygen permeability of the perovskite Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) and its applicability as a cathode in solid oxide fuel cells are remarkable, yet have been hindered by the formation of secondary phases at T < 840 degrees C and the subsequent degradation.",Improved Phase Stability and CO2 Poisoning Robustness of Y-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ SOFC Cathodes at Intermediate Temperatures,10.1021/acsaem.8b00028
2,17943,The other main drawback to BSCF is related to the formation of carbonates in the presence of CO2.,Improved Phase Stability and CO2 Poisoning Robustness of Y-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ SOFC Cathodes at Intermediate Temperatures,10.1021/acsaem.8b00028

4,17943,"In this work, 10% Y-doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF10Y) is electrochemically, microstructurally, and chemically characterized in O-2- and CO2-containing atmospheres as porous cathodes in symmetrical cells with Gd-doped ceria as electrolyte.",Improved Phase Stability and CO2 Poisoning Robustness of Y-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ SOFC Cathodes at Intermediate Temperatures,10.1021/acsaem.8b00028
5,17943,"Experiments in oxygen/nitrogen gas mixtures (pO(2) = 0.02-0.40 atm) at T = 600-900 degrees C showed high performance with a cathode specific resistance of 49.9 m Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C in air (pO(2) = 0.21 atm), which is very comparable to 47.8 m Omega cm(2) for undoped BSCF, but which deteriorates constantly under the same conditions.",Improved Phase Stability and CO2 Poisoning Robustness of Y-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ SOFC Cathodes at Intermediate Temperatures,10.1021/acsaem.8b00028
6,17943,"Moreover, adding significant amounts of CO2 (from 1% to 3% vol) to air at 700 degrees C shows that BSCF10Y has a remarkably enhanced tolerance toward the adsorption of CO2 molecules (compared to the undoped BSCF cathodes).",Improved Phase Stability and CO2 Poisoning Robustness of Y-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ SOFC Cathodes at Intermediate Temperatures,10.1021/acsaem.8b00028
7,17943,The electrode microstructure was analyzed by focused ion beam (FIB) combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).,Improved Phase Stability and CO2 Poisoning Robustness of Y-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ SOFC Cathodes at Intermediate Temperatures,10.1021/acsaem.8b00028
8,17943,The chemical composition was analyzed by scanning transmission electron spectroscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS).,Improved Phase Stability and CO2 Poisoning Robustness of Y-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ SOFC Cathodes at Intermediate Temperatures,10.1021/acsaem.8b00028
9,17943,"The presence of secondary phases in the BSCF10Y cathodes was strongly reduced or even suppressed compared to undoped BSCF, which explains the superior oxygen reduction reaction kinetics over time.",Improved Phase Stability and CO2 Poisoning Robustness of Y-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ SOFC Cathodes at Intermediate Temperatures,10.1021/acsaem.8b00028

11,17943,"The improved stability of the cubic phase in BSCF10Y compared to BSCF is linked to the monovalent agent and higher radius of the Y-dopant, while the improved stability in CO2-containing atmospheres is attributed to the higher acidity of Y3+ compared to the A-site cations and the high concentration of the Y-dopant, which is located on both the A-and B-sites of the perovskite.",Improved Phase Stability and CO2 Poisoning Robustness of Y-Doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ SOFC Cathodes at Intermediate Temperatures,10.1021/acsaem.8b00028
