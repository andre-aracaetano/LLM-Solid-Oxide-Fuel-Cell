1,13137,The performance characteristics of high-performance Ni-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are examined under typical fuel cell operating conditions over a period of similar to 3000 h when hydrogen contaminated with different concentrations of H(2)S was used as the fuel.,New insights into sulfur poisoning behavior of Ni-YSZ anode from long-term operation of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1039/c0ee00386g
2,13137,Analyses reveal some new insights into the sulfur poisoning behavior of a Ni-YSZ anode.,New insights into sulfur poisoning behavior of Ni-YSZ anode from long-term operation of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1039/c0ee00386g
3,13137,"First, an initial drop in power output upon exposure to H(2)S-contaminated fuels is more dramatic in an anode-supported cell (with small cell resistance) than in electrolyte-supported cell (with large cell resistance), creating an illusion that a high-performance cell appears to be less sulfur tolerant than a low-performance cell.",New insights into sulfur poisoning behavior of Ni-YSZ anode from long-term operation of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1039/c0ee00386g
4,13137,"Second, the transition time for this rapid performance drop to cease is much longer for an anode-supported cell (with a thicker anode) than an electrolyte-supported cell (with a thinner anode).",New insights into sulfur poisoning behavior of Ni-YSZ anode from long-term operation of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1039/c0ee00386g
5,13137,"Third, the degree of sulfur poisoning (or the cell resistance increase due to sulfur poisoning) diminishes with operating cell current density, suggesting that the water produced at the active sites on anode surface from electro-oxidation of hydrogen (or oxygen ions) may promote the oxidation and removal of adsorbed sulfur.",New insights into sulfur poisoning behavior of Ni-YSZ anode from long-term operation of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1039/c0ee00386g
6,13137,"This effect becomes less pronounced at higher concentration of H2S, but still significant at similar to 1 ppm of H(2)S. Fourth, the subsequent slow degradation in performance after the rapid performance drop upon initial exposure to H(2)S can be avoided, indicating that the previously reported slow degradation is unlikely the inherent behavior of a Ni-YSZ anode, but associated with other complications.",New insights into sulfur poisoning behavior of Ni-YSZ anode from long-term operation of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1039/c0ee00386g
7,13137,This further implies that sulfur poisoning may be reversible and the performance drop could be fully recovered when the fuel is switched back to clean hydrogen.,New insights into sulfur poisoning behavior of Ni-YSZ anode from long-term operation of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1039/c0ee00386g
