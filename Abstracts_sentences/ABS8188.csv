1,8188,"For predicting the voltage and temperature dynamics synchronously and designing a controller, a control-oriented dynamic modeling study of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) derived from physical conservation laws is reported, which considers both the electrochemical and thermal aspects of the SOFC.",Control-oriented dynamic identification modeling of a planar SOFC stack based on genetic algorithm-least squares support vector regression,10.1631/jzus.A1400011
2,8188,"Here, the least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) is employed to model the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the SOFC.",Control-oriented dynamic identification modeling of a planar SOFC stack based on genetic algorithm-least squares support vector regression,10.1631/jzus.A1400011
3,8188,"In addition, a genetic algorithm (GA), through comparing a simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) with a 5-fold cross-validation (5FCV) method, is preferably chosen to optimize the LSSVR's parameters.",Control-oriented dynamic identification modeling of a planar SOFC stack based on genetic algorithm-least squares support vector regression,10.1631/jzus.A1400011
4,8188,The validity of the proposed LSSVR with GA (GA-LSSVR) model is verified by comparing the results with those obtained from the physical model.,Control-oriented dynamic identification modeling of a planar SOFC stack based on genetic algorithm-least squares support vector regression,10.1631/jzus.A1400011
5,8188,Simulation studies further indicate that the GA-LSSVR model has a higher modeling accuracy than the LSSVR with SAA (SAA-LSSVR) and the LSSVR with 5FCV (5FCV-LSSVR) models in predicting the voltage and temperature transient behaviors of the SOFC.,Control-oriented dynamic identification modeling of a planar SOFC stack based on genetic algorithm-least squares support vector regression,10.1631/jzus.A1400011
6,8188,"Furthermore, the convergence speed of the GA-LSSVR model is relatively fast.",Control-oriented dynamic identification modeling of a planar SOFC stack based on genetic algorithm-least squares support vector regression,10.1631/jzus.A1400011
7,8188,The availability of this GA-LSSVR identification model can aid in evaluating the dynamic performance of the SOFC under different conditions and can be used for designing valid multivariable control schemes.,Control-oriented dynamic identification modeling of a planar SOFC stack based on genetic algorithm-least squares support vector regression,10.1631/jzus.A1400011
