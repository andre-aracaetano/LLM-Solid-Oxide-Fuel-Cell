3,19434,The results show that SCT can be reasonably modelled as a large-polaron itinerant hole-conductor with a constant mobility at high oxygen stoichiometry (2.5 + delta).,Defect chemistry and transport properties of SrCo1-xTaxO2.5+δ as a promising oxygen electrocatalyst for reversible solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.07.001
4,19434,"At low oxygen stoichiometry, electronic carriers tend to be localized small-polarons with a trapping center at Ta-Co. With the established defect model, a complete picture of electron hole concentration p = p(T, Po-2), excess electron concentration n = n(T, Po-2) and oxygen nonstoichiometry delta = delta(T, Po-2) is mapped out, from which p = p(T) under a constant delta is derived.",Defect chemistry and transport properties of SrCo1-xTaxO2.5+δ as a promising oxygen electrocatalyst for reversible solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.07.001
5,19434,The latter further reveals the true activation energy for hole-conduction under a constant delta and yields thermodynamic data for the oxygen incorporation reaction creating oxygen interstitials.,Defect chemistry and transport properties of SrCo1-xTaxO2.5+δ as a promising oxygen electrocatalyst for reversible solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.07.001
6,19434,"These fundamental data are also compared with SrCo1 (-) xNbxO2.5 + delta (SCN), suggesting that SCT is a better hole-conductor with higher hole concentration for oxygen electrocatalysis.",Defect chemistry and transport properties of SrCo1-xTaxO2.5+δ as a promising oxygen electrocatalyst for reversible solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2017.07.001
