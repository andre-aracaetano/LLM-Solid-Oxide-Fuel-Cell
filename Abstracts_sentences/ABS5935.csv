1,5935,An La0.6Sr0.4CO0.2Fe0.8O3-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSCF-LSM) multi-layer composite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was prepared on an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte by the screen-printing technique.,Electrochemical characteristics of an La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 multi-layer composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.049
2,5935,Its cathodic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectra were measured and the results were compared with those for a conventional LSM/LSM-YSZ cathode.,Electrochemical characteristics of an La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 multi-layer composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.049
3,5935,"While the LSCF-LSM multilayer composite cathode exhibited a cathodic overpotential lower than 0.13 V at 750 degrees C at a Current density of 0.4 A cm(-2), the overpotential for the conventional LSM-YSZ cathode was about 0.2V.",Electrochemical characteristics of an La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 multi-layer composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.049
4,5935,"The electrochemical impedance spectra revealed a better electrochemical performance of the LSCF-LSM multi-layer composite cathode than that of the conventional LSM/LSM-YSZ cathode; e.g.. the polarization resistance value of the multi-layer composite cathode was 0.25 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, nearly 40% lower than that of LSM/LSM-YSZ at the same temperature.",Electrochemical characteristics of an La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 multi-layer composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.049
