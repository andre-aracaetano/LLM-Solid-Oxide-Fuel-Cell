1,2749,Strontium-substituted lanthanum manganite/yttria-stabilized zirconia (LSM/YSZ) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) composite electrodes were fabricated with slurry spraying on both sides on either pure YSZ electrolyte foils or YSZ electrolyte foils with a cerium-gadolinium oxide (CGO) barrier layer made by spin coating.,The Effect of a CGO Barrier Layer on the Performance of LSM/YSZ SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3273194
2,2749,Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to evaluate the performance of the LSM/YSZ composite electrodes.,The Effect of a CGO Barrier Layer on the Performance of LSM/YSZ SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3273194
3,2749,It was shown that the CGO barrier layer affects both the performance of the LSM/YSZ composite electrodes and the series resistance of the cells.,The Effect of a CGO Barrier Layer on the Performance of LSM/YSZ SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3273194
4,2749,This indicates that the cathode-electrolyte interface and the barrier layer-electrolyte interface have a large influence on the performance of LSM/YSZ composite electrodes.,The Effect of a CGO Barrier Layer on the Performance of LSM/YSZ SOFC Cathodes,10.1149/1.3273194
