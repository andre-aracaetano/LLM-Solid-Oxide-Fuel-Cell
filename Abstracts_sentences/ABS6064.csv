1,6064,Improvement of long-term stability of 40vol.% NiO-60vol.% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode material in reducing atmosphere and under exposure to thermal shock through the modification of vacancy concentration and pore shape has been investigated for a solid oxide fuel cell.,Improvement of the stability of NiO-YSZ anode material for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s10008-007-0290-8
2,6064,"We varied the amount of Y2O3 additives from 8 to 10 mol% in YSZ and the type of carbon pore former, from plated activated carbon to spherical carbon black, to improve the strength and the stability of porous NiO-YSZ anode materials.",Improvement of the stability of NiO-YSZ anode material for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s10008-007-0290-8
3,6064,"Modifications by varying the amount of Y2O3 additives and carbon pore former result in a highly stable anode, even upon exposure to a reducing atmosphere for 1,200 h. In particular, the strengths of the new anode materials are markedly improved at the same porosity level.",Improvement of the stability of NiO-YSZ anode material for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s10008-007-0290-8
4,6064,Higher strengths do not degrade during a longtime durability test in a reducing atmosphere or upon thermal shock testing.,Improvement of the stability of NiO-YSZ anode material for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s10008-007-0290-8
5,6064,The relatively smaller degradation of electrical conductivity of the new anode material is discussed in terms of the possibility of suppression of the disconnectivity of Ni phases during operation of a solid oxide fuel cell.,Improvement of the stability of NiO-YSZ anode material for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s10008-007-0290-8
