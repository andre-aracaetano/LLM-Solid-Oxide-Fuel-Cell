1,482,A new medium entropy material LiCo0.25Fe0.25Mn0.25Ni0.25O2 (LCFMN) is proposed as a cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs).,Entropy engineering design of high-performing lithiated oxide cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.26599/JAC.2023.9220804
2,482,"Unlike traditional LiXO2 (X = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni) lithiated oxides, which have issues like phase impurity, poor chemical compatibility, or poor fuel cell performance, the new LCFMN material mitigates these problems, allowing for the successful preparation of pure phase LCFMN with good chemical and thermal compatibility to the electrolyte.",Entropy engineering design of high-performing lithiated oxide cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.26599/JAC.2023.9220804
3,482,"Furthermore, the entropy engineering strategy is found to weaken the covalence bond between the metal and oxygen in the LCFMN lattice, favoring the creation of oxygen vacancies and increasing cathode activity.",Entropy engineering design of high-performing lithiated oxide cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.26599/JAC.2023.9220804
4,482,"As a result, the H-SOFC with the LCFMN cathode achieves an unprecedented fuel cell output of 1803 mW.cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, the highest ever reported for H-SOFCs with lithiated oxide cathodes.",Entropy engineering design of high-performing lithiated oxide cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.26599/JAC.2023.9220804
5,482,"In addition to high fuel cell performance, the LCFMN cathode permits stable fuel cell operation for more than 450 h without visible degradation, demonstrating that LCFMN is a suitable cathode choice for H-SOFCs that combining high performance and good stability.",Entropy engineering design of high-performing lithiated oxide cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.26599/JAC.2023.9220804
