1,18888,"We present combined Synchrotron X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) study of La0.4Sr0.6Ti1-yCoyO3 +/-delta (0 <= y <= 0.5), which are promising electrode materials for symmetric solid oxide fuel cells.",Electronic and structural properties of La0.4Sr0.6Ti1-yCoyO3±δ electrode materials for symmetric SOFC studied by hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.005
2,18888,The measurements were performed at room temperature at the Ti and the Co K-edges in order to determine the local structural and electronic changes around the two transition metals.,Electronic and structural properties of La0.4Sr0.6Ti1-yCoyO3±δ electrode materials for symmetric SOFC studied by hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.005
3,18888,We find that Ti remains in a higher formal valence (around 4+) independent of the Co concentration.,Electronic and structural properties of La0.4Sr0.6Ti1-yCoyO3±δ electrode materials for symmetric SOFC studied by hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.005
4,18888,"In contrast to this, dramatic and systematic changes are observed for the Co as a function of y.",Electronic and structural properties of La0.4Sr0.6Ti1-yCoyO3±δ electrode materials for symmetric SOFC studied by hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.005
5,18888,"We conclude that the stability of the Ti4+ triggers the A-site deficiency in our samples and predicts that oxygen vacancies are much more easily formed at large Co content, which in turn will greatly enhance the performance as electrode material.",Electronic and structural properties of La0.4Sr0.6Ti1-yCoyO3±δ electrode materials for symmetric SOFC studied by hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.005
