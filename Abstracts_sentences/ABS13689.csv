1,13689,Perovskite-type Bi0.3Sr0.7Co0.3Fe0.7O3-delta (BiSCF3737) oxide with perfectly cubic structure based on the Pm-3m space group has been developed and investigated as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Performance assessment of Bi0.3Sr0.7Co0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-LSCF composite as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.075
2,13689,BiSCF3737 is incorporated into (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.9)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) to form a composite cathode called LSCF-BiSCF.,Performance assessment of Bi0.3Sr0.7Co0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-LSCF composite as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.075
3,13689,X-ray diffraction (XRD) results demonstrate that BiSCF3737 has an extremely desirable chemical compatibility with LSCF as well as with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte.,Performance assessment of Bi0.3Sr0.7Co0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-LSCF composite as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.075
4,13689,The cells with LSGM electrolyte (0.5 mm thickness) and symmetrical electrodes are fabricated for electrocatalaytic activity test.,Performance assessment of Bi0.3Sr0.7Co0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-LSCF composite as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.075
5,13689,"Compared with the pure constituent (LSCF or BiSCF3737), the composite with optimum composition, i.e., LSCF50-BiSCF50, exhibits better electrochemical activity for oxygen reduction.",Performance assessment of Bi0.3Sr0.7Co0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-LSCF composite as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.075
6,13689,"The LSGM electrolyte-supported (similar to 300 mu M thickness) cell with LSCF50-BiSCF50 composite cathode exhibits higher power densities of 0.617 and 0.802 W cm(-2) at 650 and 700 degrees C, respectively, with humidified H-2 (similar to 3% H2O) as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant.",Performance assessment of Bi0.3Sr0.7Co0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-LSCF composite as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.075
7,13689,"Over 78 h stability test at 600 degrees C indicates that a little performance decrease occurs but no interfacial damage happens, suggesting that LSCF50-BiSCF50 is a potential material for IT-SOFCs.",Performance assessment of Bi0.3Sr0.7Co0.3Fe0.7O3-δ-LSCF composite as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.075
