3,7465,"This paper reports an experimental study on the mitigation of carbon formation arising from the exposure of the commonly used Ni/YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) and Ni/CGO (gadolinium-doped ceria) SOFC anodes to biomass gasification tars Carbon formation and cell degradation was reduced through means of steam reforming of the tar over the nickel anode, and partial oxidation of benzene model tar via the transport of oxygen tons to the anode while operating the fuel cell under load Thermodynamic calculations suggest that a threshold current density of 365 mA cm(-2) was required to suppress carbon formation in dry conditions, which was consistent with the results of experiments conducted in this study.","The impact of steam and current density on carbon formation from biomass gasification tar on Ni/YSZ, and Ni/CGO solid oxide fuel cell anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.046
