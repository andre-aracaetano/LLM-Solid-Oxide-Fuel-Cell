2,12664,"In this method, an initial feedrod was prepared by assembling YSZ and NiO-YSZ thermoplastic compounds to produce a monolithic body with a cross-section of 24 rum x 24 mm and then coextruded through various orifices having dimensions of 24 x 2, 1 and 0.6 mm at 120 degrees C.",Fabrication and characterization of YSZ/Ni-YSZ bi-layered composites using thermoplastic coextrusion,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.03.016
3,12664,"This simple process produced thin plates with a remarkable reduction in thickness, while preserving the YSZ:NiO-YSZ thickness ratio of 1:39.",Fabrication and characterization of YSZ/Ni-YSZ bi-layered composites using thermoplastic coextrusion,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.03.016
4,12664,"After binder removal, the samples were co-fired at 1350 degrees C for 3 h in air, followed by reduction at temperatures ranging from 700 to 900 degrees C for 5 h in an Ar-5% H, atmosphere.",Fabrication and characterization of YSZ/Ni-YSZ bi-layered composites using thermoplastic coextrusion,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.03.016
5,12664,"Using this method, it was possible to fabricate a YSZ/Ni-YSZ bi-layered composite without any noticeable defects, in which a 11-[mu m thick dense YSZ layer was coated onto a 400-mu m thick Ni-YSZ cermet.",Fabrication and characterization of YSZ/Ni-YSZ bi-layered composites using thermoplastic coextrusion,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.03.016
6,12664,"Furthermore, the fabricated samples showed reasonable electrical conductivities, thus rendering them suitable for use as the basic components of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Fabrication and characterization of YSZ/Ni-YSZ bi-layered composites using thermoplastic coextrusion,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2007.03.016
