1,19269,"Sr and Mg doped lanthanum gallate perovskites (La1-xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-delta, shortened as LSGM-XY where X and Y are the doping levels in mole percentage (mol%) at the La- or A-site and the Ga- or B-site, respectively) are promising electrolyte materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Phase constitution in Sr and Mg doped LaGaO3 system,10.1016/S0025-5408(03)00140-5
2,19269,"In this study, we have investigated the primary perovskites as well as the secondary phases formed in terms of doping content changes and A/B ratio variations in these materials.",Phase constitution in Sr and Mg doped LaGaO3 system,10.1016/S0025-5408(03)00140-5
3,19269,"Fifteen powder compositions (three doping levels, X = Y = 0, 0.1, and 0.2 mol; and five A/B ratios 0.95, 0.98, 1.00, 1.02, and 1.05) were synthesized by the glycine-nitrate combustion process (GNP).",Phase constitution in Sr and Mg doped LaGaO3 system,10.1016/S0025-5408(03)00140-5
4,19269,These powders were equilibrated by calcining at 1500 degreesC for 9 h prior to crystalline phase characterization by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).,Phase constitution in Sr and Mg doped LaGaO3 system,10.1016/S0025-5408(03)00140-5
5,19269,"From the results of this study and the available phase diagrams in the literature on constituent binary oxide systems, we propose a crystalline phase diagram of the La2O3-SrO-Ga2O3-MgO quaternary system at elevated temperature (1500 degreesC).",Phase constitution in Sr and Mg doped LaGaO3 system,10.1016/S0025-5408(03)00140-5
