1,9013,The micro Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Combined Heat and Power (SOFC-CHP) System is one of the most promising technologies of distributed generation and has been commercialized in Japan and Europe.,Operating limitation and degradation modeling of micro solid oxide fuel cell-combined heat and power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113444
2,9013,"However, the performance degradation of an SOFC stack still exists, causing the ratio of power and heat to change and the Joule heat to increase in the stack.",Operating limitation and degradation modeling of micro solid oxide fuel cell-combined heat and power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113444
3,9013,This phenomenon should not have been neglected.,Operating limitation and degradation modeling of micro solid oxide fuel cell-combined heat and power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113444
4,9013,"A zero-dimension SOFC model including basic Nernst, ohmic, activation and concentration voltage loss was used to simulate the micro SOFC-CHP system, and a degradation model was also applied to modeling the power change with respect to operating time in different situations.",Operating limitation and degradation modeling of micro solid oxide fuel cell-combined heat and power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113444
5,9013,Both of the models were verified by real stacks experiment data and the effectiveness was proved in system-level modeling.,Operating limitation and degradation modeling of micro solid oxide fuel cell-combined heat and power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113444
6,9013,"Three key operating parameters of the system were promoted: stack current I, excess air factor alpha and fuel utilization U-f. Given the safe temperature ranges of an SOFC stack, combustor and reformer, the most appropriate parameter range was illustrated to be limited in a shape of a small triangle.",Operating limitation and degradation modeling of micro solid oxide fuel cell-combined heat and power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113444
7,9013,"Within the safe parameter range, while the excess air factor alpha was fixed at 2.64, the electrical efficiency reached a maximum 44.9% (HHV) at 120 A, while the electric power output of SOFC and hot water were both 5.58 kW. As for the dynamic modeling, by comparing constant current, constant voltage and constant power three operating patterns, results showed that the constant current pattern had the longest lifetime and the constant power pattern followed.",Operating limitation and degradation modeling of micro solid oxide fuel cell-combined heat and power system,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113444
