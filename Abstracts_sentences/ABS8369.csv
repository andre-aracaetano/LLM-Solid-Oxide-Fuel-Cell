3,8369,Comparison of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSCo) and La0.9Sr0.1MnO3 (LSM) as cathodes showed LSCo gave an exchange current density two orders of magnitude higher than that of LSM.,Electrode performance test on single ceramic fuel cells using as electrolyte Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3,10.1149/1.1838058
4,8369,"Comparison of CeO2/Ni and LSGM/Ni as anodes showed a degradation of the latter with time, and studies of the anode-electrolyte interface and the reactivity of NiO and LSGM suggest better anode performances can be obtained with a buffer layer that prevents formation of LaNiO3.",Electrode performance test on single ceramic fuel cells using as electrolyte Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3,10.1149/1.1838058
5,8369,"The cell performance showed that, with a proper choice of electrode materials and LSGM as the electrolyte, a SOFC operating at temperatures 600 degrees C < T-op < 800 degrees C is a realistic goal.",Electrode performance test on single ceramic fuel cells using as electrolyte Sr- and Mg-doped LaGaO3,10.1149/1.1838058
