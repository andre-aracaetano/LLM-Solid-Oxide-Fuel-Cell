4,3607,In this paper electron beam physical vapour deposition is discussed as a deposition technology for thin electrolyte layers.,Application of electrolyte layers for solid oxide fuel cells by electron beam evaporation,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.026
5,3607,An electrolyte composite layer was developed with a lower specific resistance in comparison to an electrolyte layer made by vacuum slip-casting.,Application of electrolyte layers for solid oxide fuel cells by electron beam evaporation,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.026
6,3607,The purpose of the composite electrolyte was to fulfil both gas tightness and electronic insulation.,Application of electrolyte layers for solid oxide fuel cells by electron beam evaporation,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.026
7,3607,The performance of fully-assembled anode-supported fuel cells with an electrolyte composite manufactured by electron beam evaporation was 0.93 A/cm(2) at 650 degrees C and 0.7 V. whereas the performance of cells with an electrolyte manufactured by vacuum slip-casting with a sintering step was 0.63 A/cm(2) at 650 degrees C and 0.7 V. The performance improvement was interpreted in terms of a significantly different bulk ionic resistance of the electrolyte layers.,Application of electrolyte layers for solid oxide fuel cells by electron beam evaporation,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.026
