1,10162,The time-dependent degradation of anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) with La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathodes has been studied.,Time-dependent performance of mixed-conducting SOFC cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.06.021
2,10162,Eight SOFCs have been tested over a period of 1000 It under different operation conditions to investigate the influence of different operation parameters on the degradation of the electrochemical performance.,Time-dependent performance of mixed-conducting SOFC cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.06.021
3,10162,"The cells were tested at 700 or 800 degrees C, at 0.3 or 0.6 A/cm(2) and with 21% or 5% O-2 at the cathode side and showed performance losses of 2-4% per 1000 h. While an elevated temperature and an elevated oxygen partial pressure had a negative influence on long-term performance, the current density did not have a clear effect.",Time-dependent performance of mixed-conducting SOFC cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.06.021
4,10162,Material analysis of the cells showed a formation of SrZrO3 at the interface of the Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta interlayer and the yttria stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) electrolyte during sintering of the cathode.,Time-dependent performance of mixed-conducting SOFC cathodes,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.06.021
5,10162,There are indications of a further formation of this phase during the electrochemical characterization obtained from X-ray diffraction analysis on LSCF-YSZ powder mixtures that were exposed to 800 degrees C for 200 h.
