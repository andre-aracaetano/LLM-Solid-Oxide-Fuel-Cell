1,20500,Chromia forming alloys are one of the best candidates for the interconnecting materials in solid oxide fuels cells (SOFC).,Metallic interconnects for SOFC: Characterization of their corrosion resistance in hydrogen/water atmosphere and at the operating temperatures of differently coated metallic alloys,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2006.08.069
2,20500,"Recent research has enabled to decrease the operating temperature of the SOFC from 1000 degrees C to 800 degrees C. However, low electronic conductivity and high volatility of the chromia scale need to be solved to improve performance of interconnects.",Metallic interconnects for SOFC: Characterization of their corrosion resistance in hydrogen/water atmosphere and at the operating temperatures of differently coated metallic alloys,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2006.08.069
