1,14207,The oxygen vacancy levels as a factor on different gadolinia-doped ceria interlayer (GDCi) films deposited on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte substrates by an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) via precursor solution of nitrate salts are investigated.,Oxygen vacancy levels on gadolinia-doped ceria interlayer deposited by atmospheric pressure plasma jet for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.169
2,14207,"Focusing on the effect of carrier gases, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are implemented for the materials characterization of the as-deposited GDCi films and sintered-GDCi films at various temperatures.",Oxygen vacancy levels on gadolinia-doped ceria interlayer deposited by atmospheric pressure plasma jet for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.169
3,14207,"The higher level of oxygen vacancies in GDCi films adhered on 8YSZ electrolyte are evidently analyzed using Ar as the carrier gas during the deposition, of which the interdiffusion resulted in the formation of (GDC + YSZ) solid solution for sintering over 1300 degrees C degraded the total conductivity.",Oxygen vacancy levels on gadolinia-doped ceria interlayer deposited by atmospheric pressure plasma jet for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.169
4,14207,The deposition of GDCi films on 8YSZ by APPJ method using O-2 carrier gas significantly improved the total conductivities of the whole electrolyte layers.,Oxygen vacancy levels on gadolinia-doped ceria interlayer deposited by atmospheric pressure plasma jet for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.169
5,14207,"Moreover, this study provides the useful insight into the oxygen vacancy levels on GDC films as interlayer (GDCi) to improve the values of open circuit voltage in LSM/GDCi/YSZ/Pt full-cell, as well as offering the efficiency of APPJ as one step deposition process.",Oxygen vacancy levels on gadolinia-doped ceria interlayer deposited by atmospheric pressure plasma jet for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.05.169
