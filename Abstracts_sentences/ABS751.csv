1,751,"Sr2Fe15Mo0.5O6 (SFMO) shows good chemical compatibility with NiO under 1000 degrees C. By dispersing a small amount of Ni (similar to 2 wt%) into the SFMO anode, the performance of the fuel cells with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3 (LSGM) electrolyte and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) cathode is dramatically improved.",Ni modified ceramic anodes for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2010.11.012
2,751,"With ambient air as the oxidant, the cell peak power density reaches 1.134 W cm(-2) in wet H-2 (3 vol% H2O) and 0.663 W cm(-2) in wet CH4 (3 vol% H2O) at 800 degrees C. Stable cell performance is achieved when operating the cell with CH4 as fuel at 0.7 V. indicating no significant carbon formation on the Ni-modified SFMO anode.",Ni modified ceramic anodes for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2010.11.012
3,751,"Considering the simple anode fabrication procedure and the relatively low cost of the anode materials, Ni modified SFMO ceramic anode shows great promise for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells.",Ni modified ceramic anodes for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.elecom.2010.11.012
