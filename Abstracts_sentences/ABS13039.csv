1,13039,A process for obtaining planar anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells was developed.,"Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using PSZ, Processed by Sequential Aqueous Tape Casting and Constrained Sintering",10.1111/jace.12559
2,13039,"Aqueous-based slurries were prepared and sequentially deposited via tape casting to form half cell tapes consisting of the electrolyte, functional, and structural anode.","Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using PSZ, Processed by Sequential Aqueous Tape Casting and Constrained Sintering",10.1111/jace.12559
3,13039,"Sintering of the three-layered tapes was done in two stages: presintering circular samples of 25mm diameter in free conditions first, and then sintering them using zirconium disks as light loads (90Pa), to obtain half cells having 20mm and 3.8m(-1) in diameter and curvature, respectively.","Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using PSZ, Processed by Sequential Aqueous Tape Casting and Constrained Sintering",10.1111/jace.12559
4,13039,"Active materials for the electrolyte, anode, and cathode were partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ), Ni and LSM, respectively.","Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using PSZ, Processed by Sequential Aqueous Tape Casting and Constrained Sintering",10.1111/jace.12559
5,13039,"Finally, thicknesses of complete cells were 400, 30, 30, and 80m for the structural anode, functional anode, electrolyte, and cathode, respectively.","Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using PSZ, Processed by Sequential Aqueous Tape Casting and Constrained Sintering",10.1111/jace.12559
6,13039,The cells were tested in a no-chamber (direct-flame) setup evaluating electrochemical performance and shock thermal resistance.,"Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using PSZ, Processed by Sequential Aqueous Tape Casting and Constrained Sintering",10.1111/jace.12559
7,13039,Open circuit voltage was 830mV at 560 degrees C using methanol as fuel in a burner with porous media to modify the shape of the flame.,"Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using PSZ, Processed by Sequential Aqueous Tape Casting and Constrained Sintering",10.1111/jace.12559
8,13039,Cells were also strong enough to resist the rapid temperature changes during several no-chamber tests.,"Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Using PSZ, Processed by Sequential Aqueous Tape Casting and Constrained Sintering",10.1111/jace.12559
