2,5873,The model does not neglect any of the possible molecular mass-transfer mechanisms present in a SOFC.,Multimodal mass transfer in solid-oxide fuel-cells,10.1016/j.ces.2009.11.006
3,5873,"It takes into account convection and molecular-diffusion phenomena in the channels, and convection, molecular diffusion and Knudsen diffusion in the porous electrodes.",Multimodal mass transfer in solid-oxide fuel-cells,10.1016/j.ces.2009.11.006
4,5873,The model does not require any of the constraining hypotheses present in previously published ones.,Multimodal mass transfer in solid-oxide fuel-cells,10.1016/j.ces.2009.11.006
5,5873,"Its noteworthy features are: (i) pressure is not considered as constant (in any direction) in the channel or in the electrode; (ii) global mass transfer through the porous media is modeled by means of the Dusty Gas Model, without any limiting assumption on the number of species in the multicomponent gas mixture; (iii) the physical phenomena in channel and porous medium are coupled through boundary conditions and solved simultaneously; (iv) the model can be used for both the anode and the cathode.",Multimodal mass transfer in solid-oxide fuel-cells,10.1016/j.ces.2009.11.006
6,5873,The algorithm is designed to simulate multidimensional domains and is applicable to both planar and tubular cells.,Multimodal mass transfer in solid-oxide fuel-cells,10.1016/j.ces.2009.11.006
