1,14164,"In this study, ammonia is presented as a feasible fuel for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Experimental Analysis of SOFC Fuelled by Ammonia,10.1002/fuce.201300276
2,14164,"Ammonia has several interesting features as fuel due to low-production cost, high-energy density and, focusing on fuel cells and hydrogen application, ammonia is an excellent H-2 carrier thanks to high value of volumetric and gravimetric densities.",Experimental Analysis of SOFC Fuelled by Ammonia,10.1002/fuce.201300276
3,14164,The paper reports experimental test performed to evaluate the feasibility of NH3 directly fed to a 50cm(2) single cell SOFC.,Experimental Analysis of SOFC Fuelled by Ammonia,10.1002/fuce.201300276
4,14164,"A test plan was developed to compare pure ammonia with an equivalent mix of ammonia, nitrogen, and hydrogen and the study of temperature and voltage values strongly indicates that a two stage oxidation of ammonia can be predicted and a previous cracking reaction occurs in the cell due to the nickel catalytic contribution.",Experimental Analysis of SOFC Fuelled by Ammonia,10.1002/fuce.201300276
5,14164,The study of temperatures and of heat flows show how the cell is cooled down to lower temperature because of heat adsorbed by the reaction and by flow mix entering the anode.,Experimental Analysis of SOFC Fuelled by Ammonia,10.1002/fuce.201300276
6,14164,The study shows also how for operative temperatures below 800 degrees C the cracking reaction takes place in the cell active area.,Experimental Analysis of SOFC Fuelled by Ammonia,10.1002/fuce.201300276
7,14164,Efficiency test demonstrates that the cell can operate at 300mWcm(-2) and 30% efficiency based on ammonia LHV.,Experimental Analysis of SOFC Fuelled by Ammonia,10.1002/fuce.201300276
