1,18397,A layered Mo doped Pr0.3Ba0.5MnO3-delta (Mo-PBMO) double perovskite oxide was prepared by a modified sol-gel method and the properties of the fabricated material are characterized by various technologies.,Molybdenum doped Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-δ (Mo-PBMO) double perovskite as a potential solid oxide fuel cell anode material,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.127
2,18397,"The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD), H-2-temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrate that the treatment in reducing atmosphere at high temperature lead to a significant phase transformation of the material to a single cubic phase as well as with the Mo in multiple oxidized states.",Molybdenum doped Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-δ (Mo-PBMO) double perovskite as a potential solid oxide fuel cell anode material,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.127
