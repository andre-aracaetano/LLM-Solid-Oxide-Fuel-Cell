1,4760,In this paper we try to tailor the chemical stability of cobalt-rich perovsldte Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) by B-site doping Sb.,Tailoring the chemical stability of cobalt-rich perovskite mixed conductor,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.018
2,4760,"The chemical stability of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.1Sb0.1O3-delta (BSCFS) was investigated by studying the oxygen nonstoichiometry, crystal structure and oxidation state by means of coulometric titration, high temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) and soft-X-ray absorption spectroscopy (s-XAS) in Various oxygen pressure (p(O-2)) and temperatures.",Tailoring the chemical stability of cobalt-rich perovskite mixed conductor,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.018
3,4760,The results prove that chemical stability of BSCFS is successfully improved in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell working condition owing to Co valence change which is controlled by high valence cation doping.,Tailoring the chemical stability of cobalt-rich perovskite mixed conductor,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.018
