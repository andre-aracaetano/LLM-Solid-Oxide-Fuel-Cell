1,5987,"Perovskite-related intergrowth oxides Sr(2.7)Ln(0.3)Fe(1.4)Co(0.6)O(7-delta) (Ln=La, Nd, Sm, and Gd) have been investigated as cathode materials for solid, oxide fuel cells (SOFC).","Characterization of Sr2.7Ln0.3Fe1.4Co0.6O7 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) intergrowth oxides as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.09.007
2,5987,"With decreasing size of the Ln(3+) ions, the unit cell volume, oxygen content, thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), and total electrical conductivity decrease from Ln = La to Gd.","Characterization of Sr2.7Ln0.3Fe1.4Co0.6O7 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) intergrowth oxides as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.09.007
3,5987,The decreasing unit cell volume and oxygen content is attributed to the decreasing size of Ln(3+) ions from Ln=La to Gd and a consequent preference for lower coordination numbers.,"Characterization of Sr2.7Ln0.3Fe1.4Co0.6O7 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) intergrowth oxides as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.09.007
4,5987,"While the decrease in the ionicity of the Ln-O bonds from Ln = La to Gd causes a decrease in the TEC, the increasing amount of oxygen vacancies leads to a decrease in electrical conductivity arising from a thermally activated semiconducting behavior.","Characterization of Sr2.7Ln0.3Fe1.4Co0.6O7 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) intergrowth oxides as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.09.007
5,5987,The cathode polarization conductance (R-p(-1)) measured using the ac-impedance spectroscopy and the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction in SOFC decrease from Ln = La to Gd partly due to the decrease in electrical conductivity.,"Characterization of Sr2.7Ln0.3Fe1.4Co0.6O7 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) intergrowth oxides as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2009.09.007
