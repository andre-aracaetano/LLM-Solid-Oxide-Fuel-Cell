4,15780,The problems in developing SOFCs are now so many and so different that a very flexible code is necessary.,A global thermo-electrochemical model for SOFC systems design and engineering,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00067-3
5,15780,"Thus, the code was not only designed in order to simulate each of the operating conditions, but also to test different stack configurations, materials, etc.",A global thermo-electrochemical model for SOFC systems design and engineering,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00067-3

7,15780,"The heat-up and start-up simulations allow: (1) to evaluate the time the cell stack needs to reach operating temperature from an initial temperature distribution, (2) to check the steepest temperature gradients occurring in the ceramic layers (which result in material stresses) and (3) to obtain important information about the pre-operating strategy.",A global thermo-electrochemical model for SOFC systems design and engineering,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00067-3
