1,20764,"Here, effects of B-site transition metals (TMs) in the (La0.6Sr0.4)XO3-delta (X = Mn, Fe, Co) perovskite structure on the activity and stability of the oxygen electrodes during high temperature electrolysis are discussed to provide a deep understanding of the phenomena observed for different oxygen electrodes under anodic polarizations.","An insight into the effects of B-site transition metals on the activity, activation effect and stability of perovskite oxygen electrodes for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.07.118
2,20764,"Performance and stability of the electrodes vary significantly at 800 degrees C as the TMs changed from Mn to Fe and Co, which is attributed to the different ionic conductivities and surface chemistry of the materials that have a strong dependence on the valence state and electronic structure of TMs.","An insight into the effects of B-site transition metals on the activity, activation effect and stability of perovskite oxygen electrodes for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.07.118
3,20764,"Under an anodic current passage of 200 mA cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, electrode polarization resistance (R-E) and overpotential (eta) of the (La0.6Sr0.4)MnO3-delta (LSM) electrode decrease significantly by 1.75 Omega cm(2) and 101 mV during the 1200 min test, compared with the constant values of R-E and eta for the (La0.6Sr0.4)FeO3-delta (LSF) and (La0.6Sr0.4)CoO3-delta (LSC) and electrodes, an indication of the influence of B-site TMs on the electrode performance and stability.","An insight into the effects of B-site transition metals on the activity, activation effect and stability of perovskite oxygen electrodes for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.07.118
4,20764,Most serious degradation is observed at the (La0.6Sr0.4)MnO3-delta electrode due to the electrode detachment arising from the accelerated SrO surface segregation and related disintegration of LSM particles near the electrode electrolyte interface.,"An insight into the effects of B-site transition metals on the activity, activation effect and stability of perovskite oxygen electrodes for solid oxide electrolysis cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.07.118
