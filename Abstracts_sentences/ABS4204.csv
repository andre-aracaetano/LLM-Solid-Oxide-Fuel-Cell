2,4204,The electrochemical process within the SOFC with hydrogen as the fuel is theoretically analyzed.,Characteristic analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell with proton conducting ceramic electrolyte,
3,4204,"With the present model, the effects of some parameters, such as the thickness of electrolyte, operating temperature and gas composition, on the ionic transport (or gas permeation) through the electrolyte and the electrical performance, i.e., the electromotive force (EMF) and internal resistance of the cell, are investigated in detail.",Characteristic analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell with proton conducting ceramic electrolyte,
4,4204,"The theoretical results are tested partly by comparing with the experimental data obtained from SrCe0.95M0.05O3-alpha (M=Yb, Y) cells.",Characteristic analysis of the solid oxide fuel cell with proton conducting ceramic electrolyte,
