1,16152,"With ionic conductivities superior to conventional doped zirconia and ceria at intermediate temperatures (IT, 700-800 degrees C), bismuth oxide (BiO1.5) materials based on the defect fluorite structure are promising electrolyte candidates for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at reduced temperatures.",Energetics of Dysprosia-Stabilized Bismuth Oxide Electrolytes,10.1021/cm302446e
2,16152,"In order to investigate the energetics of stabilized BiO1.5 in the fluorite structure, DyO1.5-stabilized BiO1.5 (DSB) over a range of compositions was synthesized by solid state reaction and quenched:Using high temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry in molten 3Na(2)O center dot 4MoO(3) at 702 degrees C, enthalpies of formation at 25 degrees C were determined.",Energetics of Dysprosia-Stabilized Bismuth Oxide Electrolytes,10.1021/cm302446e
3,16152,"Relative to the phases of the oxide end-members stable at room temperature (monoclinic BiO1.5 and C-type DyO1.5), the formation of Bi1-xDyxO1.5 is endothermic at x < 0.30 and becomes slightly exothermic toward the upper phase boundary (x = 0.50).",Energetics of Dysprosia-Stabilized Bismuth Oxide Electrolytes,10.1021/cm302446e
4,16152,"These data suggest that this system is slightly stabilized, and there is only a moderate (1-2 orders of magnitude) decrease in the volatility and susceptibility to reduction of bismuth oxide at high temperatures.",Energetics of Dysprosia-Stabilized Bismuth Oxide Electrolytes,10.1021/cm302446e
5,16152,"However, high conductivity still makes the system potentially useful at 700 degrees C and below.",Energetics of Dysprosia-Stabilized Bismuth Oxide Electrolytes,10.1021/cm302446e
6,16152,"Similar to findings for rare earth-doped zirconia, hafnia, and ceria, a negative interaction parameter for mixing in the solid solution suggests a tendency for short-range ordering, and the increasingly exothermic Delta H-mix with increasing x parallels the conductivity decrease with increasing dopant content.",Energetics of Dysprosia-Stabilized Bismuth Oxide Electrolytes,10.1021/cm302446e
