1,14317,Conventional Ni-based cermet anodes such as Ni-gadolinia doped ceria (Ni-GDC) suffer from Low carbon deposition resistance in direct methane solid oxide fueL cells (SOFCs).,Carbon-tolerant Ni-based cermet anodes modified by proton conducting yttrium- and ytterbium-doped barium cerates for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta06488k
2,14317,"Here we show that impregnating proton conducting perovskites Like BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-delta(BCY)and BaCe0.9Yb0.103O3-delta (BCYb) in Ni-GDC not 9 Y-0.1 only improves the initial polarization performance but aka, most importanty, significanty enhances the stability in wet methane fueL (3% H2O in CH4) by inhibiting carbon deposition and formation.",Carbon-tolerant Ni-based cermet anodes modified by proton conducting yttrium- and ytterbium-doped barium cerates for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta06488k
3,14317,"In wet methane, the voltage of the cell with the conventional Ni-GDC anode decreases rapidly from 0.58 to 0.15 V within 6 h at 200 mA cm(-2) and 750 degrees C.",Carbon-tolerant Ni-based cermet anodes modified by proton conducting yttrium- and ytterbium-doped barium cerates for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta06488k
4,14317,"In contrast, in the case of the cells with BCY + Ni-GDC and BCYb + Ni-GDC anodes, the ceLL voltage is essentiay constant at 0.62-0.65 V over a period of 48 h tested under identical conditions.",Carbon-tolerant Ni-based cermet anodes modified by proton conducting yttrium- and ytterbium-doped barium cerates for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta06488k
5,14317,"The microstructure and Raman spectroscopy analysis reveal that the impregnated fine BCY and BCYb particles are preferentiay distributed on the surface of the Ni grains in the Ni-GDC anode, decreasing the exposed surface of Ni grains and inhibiting carbon deposition.",Carbon-tolerant Ni-based cermet anodes modified by proton conducting yttrium- and ytterbium-doped barium cerates for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta06488k
6,14317,"Aka, the proton conducting and fine BCY and BCYb particles can adsorb and decompose water, which in turn reacts with deposited carbon to form CO and H-2, alleviating the carbon deposition problem in the anode and thus significanty improving the ceLL stability of direct methane SOFCs.",Carbon-tolerant Ni-based cermet anodes modified by proton conducting yttrium- and ytterbium-doped barium cerates for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c5ta06488k
