1,1377,"A strategy of tailoring Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-delta (BCN) is proposed, aiming to improve the sinterability and conductivity of BCN material for fuel cell applications.",Tailoring Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-δ with NiO as electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.091
2,1377,"The new Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.77Ni0.05O9.delta (BCNNi) material shows a significant improvement in sinterability compared with BCN, leading to a high densification for BCNNi after sintering at as low as 1400 degrees C.",Tailoring Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-δ with NiO as electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.091
3,1377,"In addition, the BCNNi exhibits a conductivity of 4.59 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C that is not only higher than that for BCN which only reaches 3.45 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at the same temperature but also shows a significant improvement compared with that for BCN-based materials in literature reports.",Tailoring Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-δ with NiO as electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.091
4,1377,"As a result, the cell with the BCNNi electrolyte shows a peak power density of 84 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C which is also one of the largest ever reported for this type of cells.",Tailoring Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-δ with NiO as electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.091
5,1377,Further electrochemical studies indicate that the high conductivity of BCNNi electrolyte membrane benefits the fuel cell performance.,Tailoring Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-δ with NiO as electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.091
