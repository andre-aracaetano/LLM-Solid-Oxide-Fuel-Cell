1,2942,"A novel concept of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), the symmetrical SOFC, that uses simultaneously the same material as both anode and cathode has been investigated.",An all-in-one flourite-based symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.094
2,2942,Common materials typically used as anode components such as a combination of YSZ and CeO2 plus a noble metal may be considered good candidates for such a configuration at relatively high temperatures (i.e. above 900 degrees C).,An all-in-one flourite-based symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.094
3,2942,"These symmetrical electrodes exhibit enhanced electrochemical properties under both reducing and oxidising conditions, in part due to the catalytic properties of the noble metal used.",An all-in-one flourite-based symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.094
4,2942,"In air the polarisation values are improved by a factor of four compared to electrodes without CeO2, whereas under reducing conditions an improvement of two-three orders of magnitude has been observed.",An all-in-one flourite-based symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.094
