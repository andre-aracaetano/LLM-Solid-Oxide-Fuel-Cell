1,14974,Bi-layer electrolyte films of Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 (YSZ)- 0.79Bi(2)O(3)-0.21Nb(2)O(5) (BNO) were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering on NiO-SDC anode substrates.,Solid oxide fuel cells with YSZ-BNO Bi-layer electrolyte film deposited by magnetron sputtering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.02.022
2,14974,"The stoichiometry of the BNO electrolyte film was found strongly dependent on the ratio of Ar and O-2 during sputtering, and the BNO film deposited at a mixture of 31 sccm Ar and 7 sccm O-2 appeared to be the closest to the target composition.",Solid oxide fuel cells with YSZ-BNO Bi-layer electrolyte film deposited by magnetron sputtering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.02.022
3,14974,"When deposited at 300 degrees C and subsequently annealed at 700 degrees C, the BNO electrolyte emerged to be crack free and dense with some scattering closed pores.",Solid oxide fuel cells with YSZ-BNO Bi-layer electrolyte film deposited by magnetron sputtering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.02.022
4,14974,The XRD patterns of the film are indexed to the cubic Fm (3) over bar m structure of Bi3NbO7.,Solid oxide fuel cells with YSZ-BNO Bi-layer electrolyte film deposited by magnetron sputtering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.02.022
5,14974,The as-deposited film was well-crystalline and consisted of fine grains and random orientation microstructures.,Solid oxide fuel cells with YSZ-BNO Bi-layer electrolyte film deposited by magnetron sputtering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.02.022
6,14974,"For electrolyte thicknesses of approximately 4.0 mu m YSZ and 1.5 mu m BNO layers, the open circuit voltage (OCV) and the maximum power density of the single cell with Ag cathode read respectively 0.94 V and 10 mW/cm(2) at 600 degrees C.",Solid oxide fuel cells with YSZ-BNO Bi-layer electrolyte film deposited by magnetron sputtering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.02.022
7,14974,These OCV values are lower than the expected theoretical value due to the high partial electronic conductivity.,Solid oxide fuel cells with YSZ-BNO Bi-layer electrolyte film deposited by magnetron sputtering,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.02.022
