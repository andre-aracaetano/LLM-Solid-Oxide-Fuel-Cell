1,14783,Various oxides were investigated as a ceramic anode of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using LaGaO3-based oxide electrolyte.,Oxide anode derived from Sr-doped LaMnO3 perovskite oxide for SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1149/1.2344830
2,14783,It was found that the cell using Sr-doped LaMnO3 for anode exhibits a fairly large power density among the examined oxides for anode.,Oxide anode derived from Sr-doped LaMnO3 perovskite oxide for SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1149/1.2344830
3,14783,"Because the anodic overpotential as well as the electrical resistance decreased, the power density of the cell increased with increasing the amount of Sr doped for La site in LaMnO3, and the highest power density of the cell was obtained by using La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 for anode.",Oxide anode derived from Sr-doped LaMnO3 perovskite oxide for SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1149/1.2344830
4,14783,"On this cell, the maximum power density was achieved to a value of 0.64 and 0.25 W/cm(2) at 1273 and 1073 K, respectively.",Oxide anode derived from Sr-doped LaMnO3 perovskite oxide for SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1149/1.2344830
5,14783,"After exposure of the cell to air at 1273 K for 24 h, almost the same power density was recovered by changing air to H-2.",Oxide anode derived from Sr-doped LaMnO3 perovskite oxide for SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1149/1.2344830
6,14783,"X-ray diffraction measurement suggests that the perovskite phase of La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 anode partially decomposed into La2MnO4, MnO2, and SrMnO3 after the power generation measurement; however, small power density can only be achieved on the cell using MnO2, SrMnO3, La2MnO4, and LaSrMnO4 for anode.",Oxide anode derived from Sr-doped LaMnO3 perovskite oxide for SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1149/1.2344830
7,14783,"Therefore, LaMnO3 perovskite phase doped with Sr is active as the anode of SOFCs, which is highly tolerant against oxidation.",Oxide anode derived from Sr-doped LaMnO3 perovskite oxide for SOFCs using LaGaO3 electrolyte,10.1149/1.2344830
