1,8197,"Perovskite materials of Pr0.4Sr0.6(Co0.3Fe0.6)(1-x)NbxO3-delta (PSCFNx, x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) were firstly synthesized as the cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by doping niobium(Nb) at the B site of Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.3Fe0.6O3-delta using a solid state reaction method.","Characterization of B-Site Niobium-Doped Pr0.4Sr0.6 (Co0.3Fe0.6)1-xNbxO3-δ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) Perovskites as Cathode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/slct.201702180
2,8197,"The effect of Nb doping amount on the lattice structure, oxygen desorption and electrochemical properties of PSCFNx at different calcination temperatures were investigated.","Characterization of B-Site Niobium-Doped Pr0.4Sr0.6 (Co0.3Fe0.6)1-xNbxO3-δ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) Perovskites as Cathode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/slct.201702180
3,8197,It is found that this material family had perfectly cubic structure based on the Pm-3 m space group whose lattice size increased with x. These materials were thermally stable after calcination and showed desirable chemical compatibility with electrolyte in the condition of calcination at 1250 degrees C for 8h under an air atmosphere.,"Characterization of B-Site Niobium-Doped Pr0.4Sr0.6 (Co0.3Fe0.6)1-xNbxO3-δ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) Perovskites as Cathode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/slct.201702180
4,8197,"The optimum x value of 0.1 was found for the PSCFNx cathode materials, which had the minimum polarization resistance value of 0.018 cm(2) at 900 degrees C. As a result, the single cell with the PSCFN0.1 cathode delivered a power density of 0.731 Wcm(-2) at 900 degrees C with humidified H-2 (similar to 3% H2O) as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant.","Characterization of B-Site Niobium-Doped Pr0.4Sr0.6 (Co0.3Fe0.6)1-xNbxO3-δ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) Perovskites as Cathode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/slct.201702180
5,8197,It indicates that PSCFN0.1 should be a promising cathode material for the SOFCs.,"Characterization of B-Site Niobium-Doped Pr0.4Sr0.6 (Co0.3Fe0.6)1-xNbxO3-δ (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) Perovskites as Cathode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/slct.201702180
