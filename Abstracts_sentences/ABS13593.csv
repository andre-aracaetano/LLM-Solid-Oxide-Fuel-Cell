1,13593,An efficient cathode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is mainly determined by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of mixed materials.,Corn-cob like nanofibres as cathode catalysts for an effective microstructure design in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta08692f
2,13593,We demonstrate a new microstructure design through a nanofibrous electrode based on a unique corn-cob structure.,Corn-cob like nanofibres as cathode catalysts for an effective microstructure design in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta08692f
3,13593,A one-step process to produce corn-cob ceramic nanofibers of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) is introduced using an electrospinning system equipped with a coaxial nozzle.,Corn-cob like nanofibres as cathode catalysts for an effective microstructure design in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta08692f
4,13593,"From the microscope analysis, perfect corn-cob nanofibers are finely produced with a diameter of 350 nm for the core and nanoparticles (30-40 nm) stacked on the surface similar to a core-shell structure.",Corn-cob like nanofibres as cathode catalysts for an effective microstructure design in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta08692f
5,13593,"The cathode fabricated using nanofibers with LSM outside and YSZ inside (YSZ@LSM) shows the best maximum power density of 1.15 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C with low polarization resistance, which is higher than that of the reverse core and shell positions (LSM@YSZ) and even the commercial LSM-YSZ.",Corn-cob like nanofibres as cathode catalysts for an effective microstructure design in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta08692f
6,13593,This better outcome is more prominent at elevated temperatures due to its accelerated catalytic activity.,Corn-cob like nanofibres as cathode catalysts for an effective microstructure design in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta08692f
7,13593,"Therefore, insight into the key factors that enhance ORR activity and single cell performance is obtained in terms of not only the nanofibrous core@shell structure but also more reaction active sites from the optimum catalyst position at the designed corn-cob nanofiber based cathodes.",Corn-cob like nanofibres as cathode catalysts for an effective microstructure design in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ta08692f
