1,11348,Development of low-cost and cobalt-free efficient cathode materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains one of the paramount motivations for material researchers at a low temperature (<650 degrees C).,Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity and CO2 Tolerance of Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by in Situ Formation of Carbonates,10.1021/acsami.9b07668
2,11348,"In particular, iron-based perovskite oxides show promise as electrocatalysts for ORR because Fe metal is cheaper and naturally abundant, exhibit matched thermal expansion with contacting components such as electrolytes, and show high tolerance in a CO2-containing atmosphere.",Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity and CO2 Tolerance of Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by in Situ Formation of Carbonates,10.1021/acsami.9b07668
3,11348,"Herein, we demonstrated a new mechanism, the in situ formation of alkali metal carbonates at the cathode surface.",Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity and CO2 Tolerance of Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by in Situ Formation of Carbonates,10.1021/acsami.9b07668
4,11348,"This new mechanism leads to an efficient and robust cobalt-free electrocatalyst (Sr(0.95)A(0.05)Fe(0.8)Nb(0.1)Ta(0.1)O(3-delta), SAFNTS, A = Li, Na, and K) for the application of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs).",Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity and CO2 Tolerance of Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by in Situ Formation of Carbonates,10.1021/acsami.9b07668
5,11348,"Our results revealed that the formation of Li\K carbonates boosts the ORR activity with an area-specific resistance as low as 0.12 and 0.18 (Omega) cm(2) at 600 degrees C, which show the highest performance of the cobalt-free single-phase cathode that has been ever reported so far.",Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity and CO2 Tolerance of Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by in Situ Formation of Carbonates,10.1021/acsami.9b07668
6,11348,"We also find that the chemical stability and tolerance of tested cathodes toward CO2 poisoning significantly improved with alkali carbonates, as compared to the pristine SrFe(0.8N)b(0.1)ATa(0.1)O(3-)delta (SFNT) at 600 degrees C.",Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity and CO2 Tolerance of Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by in Situ Formation of Carbonates,10.1021/acsami.9b07668
7,11348,This work demonstrates the conclusive role of alkali carbonates in developing highly efficient and stable cobalt-free cathodes for LT-SOFCs and CO2 neutralization.,Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity and CO2 Tolerance of Cathode for Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by in Situ Formation of Carbonates,10.1021/acsami.9b07668
