2,16958,We have so far fabricated a honeycomb cell with a cathode layer made of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSM) and an electrolyte layer of 8YSZ on a porous anode support in the honeycomb form of Ni/8YSZ.,Three-dimensional flow channel arrangements in an anode-supported honeycomb solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s00231-017-2154-9
3,16958,"In the present study, current-voltage and volumetric power density characteristics of the cells having different anode/cathode flow channel arrangements are measured under different flow rates of fed hydrogen to show the effect of three-dimensional fuel transport and distribution in the porous anode support on the cell performance.",Three-dimensional flow channel arrangements in an anode-supported honeycomb solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s00231-017-2154-9
4,16958,Ohmic resistances of the cells varying with current is also evaluated to clarify the nickel re-oxidation of the anode support by fuel depletion depending on the anode flow channel arrangements.,Three-dimensional flow channel arrangements in an anode-supported honeycomb solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s00231-017-2154-9
5,16958,We thereby discuss the difference of the advantage between the flow channel arrangements depending on the flow rate of the fed fuel to choose more suitable operation mode.,Three-dimensional flow channel arrangements in an anode-supported honeycomb solid oxide fuel cell,10.1007/s00231-017-2154-9
