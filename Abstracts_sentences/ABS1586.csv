1,1586,La2-xSrxCo0.5Ni0.5O4 +/-delta (LSCN) is presented as a novel electrode for both solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs).,Performance of La2-xSrxCo0.5Ni0.5O4±δ as an Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Reversible Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000067
2,1586,"LSCN/10Sc1CeSZ (scandia and ceria stabilised zirconia)/LSCN symmetrical cells were fabricated and characterised by AC impedance spectroscopy under different oxygen partial pressures at temperatures of up to 900 C. At 850 degrees C polarisation resistances of 5.15 and 5.74 Omega cm(2) were found applying air and oxygen, respectively.",Performance of La2-xSrxCo0.5Ni0.5O4±δ as an Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Reversible Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000067

4,1586,Electrochemical results showed that the cell performs equally in both SOFC and SOEC modes.,Performance of La2-xSrxCo0.5Ni0.5O4±δ as an Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Reversible Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000067
5,1586,Detailed results in terms of performance are presented and discussed.,Performance of La2-xSrxCo0.5Ni0.5O4±δ as an Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Reversible Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000067
6,1586,LSCN is presented as a good candidate for both SOFC and SOEC.,Performance of La2-xSrxCo0.5Ni0.5O4±δ as an Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Reversible Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000067
7,1586,The similar performance obtained for j-V (current density-voltage) curves in electrolysis and fuel cell operation mode is thought to be related to the flexible oxygen non-stoichiometry of the LSCN (K2NiF4-type structure).,Performance of La2-xSrxCo0.5Ni0.5O4±δ as an Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Reversible Cells,10.1002/fuce.201000067
