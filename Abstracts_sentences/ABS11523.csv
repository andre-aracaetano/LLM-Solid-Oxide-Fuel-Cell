4,11523,"First, the sintering temperature of the composite cathode was reduced by introducing a sintering function layer, which caused a 22% reduction in the initial polarization resistance (R), but the cathode polarization resistance decreased at a rate of 2.15 x 10-4 Omega cm(2) h(-1) at 700 degrees C during a period of 100 h. Second, nano-sized Gd-doped ceria powder (CGO) was added to the composite cathode system.",Improvement of (La0.74Bi0.10Sr0.16)MnO3-Bi1.4Er0.6O3 composite cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.09.012
5,11523,"Stability improvement was achieved at 10 vol% CGO, and the degradation rate at 700 degrees C was 4.01 x 10(-5) Omega cm(2) h(-1) during a period of 100 h.
