1,16037,Sr(Ti1-xFex)O3_ delta (STF) perovskite has been developed as one of the alternatives to Nickel-base fuel electrodes for solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) that can provide good tolerance to redox cycling and fuel impurities.,Comparative study on the electrochemical performance of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7)O3-? fuel electrode in different fuel gases for solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.214
2,16037,"Recent results on STF fuel electrodes present excellent electrochemical performance and outstand stability both under H2 fuel cell mode and H2O electrolysis mode, however, the electrochemical characteristics in other fuel gases, such as CO, CO-H2 mixture, CH4, and CO-CO2 mixture have not been investigated.",Comparative study on the electrochemical performance of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7)O3-? fuel electrode in different fuel gases for solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.214

4,16037,"At 800 degrees C, the peak power density slightly decreased from 0.9 W/cm2 in wet H2 to 0.68 W/cm2 in wet CO under fuel cell mode.",Comparative study on the electrochemical performance of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7)O3-? fuel electrode in different fuel gases for solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.214
5,16037,"However, the cell only showed a peak power density of 0.27 W/cm2 at 800 degrees C in wet CH4, reaching 0.75 W/cm2 at 850 degrees C, when the open-circuit voltage increased from 0.9 V to 1.02 V. STF fuel electrode exhibited much worse CO2 electrolysis performance than steam electrolysis, especially in high CO2 concentration due to the increased ohmic resistance and electrode polarization resistance.",Comparative study on the electrochemical performance of Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7)O3-? fuel electrode in different fuel gases for solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.214
