1,14264,"Two commercial ferritic stainless steels (FSSs), referred to as Steel A and Steel B, designed for specific high-temperature applications, were tested in static air for 2000 h at 750 degrees C to evaluate their potential as base materials for interconnects (ICs) in Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stacks (IT-SOFCs).",On the High-Temperature Oxidation and Area Specific Resistance of New Commercial Ferritic Stainless Steels,10.3390/met11030405
2,14264,Their oxidation behavior was studied through weight gain and Area Specific Resistance (ASR) measurements.,On the High-Temperature Oxidation and Area Specific Resistance of New Commercial Ferritic Stainless Steels,10.3390/met11030405
3,14264,"Additionally, the oxide scales developed on their surfaces were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (mu-RS), Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).",On the High-Temperature Oxidation and Area Specific Resistance of New Commercial Ferritic Stainless Steels,10.3390/met11030405
4,14264,"The evolution of oxide composition, structure, and electrical conductivity in response to aging was determined.",On the High-Temperature Oxidation and Area Specific Resistance of New Commercial Ferritic Stainless Steels,10.3390/met11030405
5,14264,"Comparing the results with those on AISI 441 FSS, steels A and B showed a comparable weight gain but higher ASR values that are required by the application.",On the High-Temperature Oxidation and Area Specific Resistance of New Commercial Ferritic Stainless Steels,10.3390/met11030405
6,14264,"According to the authors, Steel A and B compositions need an adjustment (i.e., a plain substitution of the elements which form insulant oxides or a marginal modification in their content) to form a thermally grown oxide (TGO) with the acceptable ASR level.",On the High-Temperature Oxidation and Area Specific Resistance of New Commercial Ferritic Stainless Steels,10.3390/met11030405
