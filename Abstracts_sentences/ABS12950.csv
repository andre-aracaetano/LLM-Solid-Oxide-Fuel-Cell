1,12950,One of the main challenges for advanced metallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported functional perovskite catalysts is the simultaneous achievement of a high population of NPs with uniform distribution as well as long-lasting high performance.,New Opportunity for in Situ Exsolution of Metallic Nanoparticles on Perovskite Parent,10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02757
2,12950,These are also the essential requirements for optimal electrode catalysts used in solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysis cells (SOFCs and SOECs).,New Opportunity for in Situ Exsolution of Metallic Nanoparticles on Perovskite Parent,10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02757
3,12950,"Herein, we report a facile operando manufacture way that the crystal reconstruction of double perovskite under reducing atmosphere can spontaneously lead to the formation of ordered layered oxygen deficiency and yield segregation of massively and finely dispersed NPs.",New Opportunity for in Situ Exsolution of Metallic Nanoparticles on Perovskite Parent,10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02757
4,12950,The real-time observation of this emergent process was performed via an environmental transmission electron microscope.,New Opportunity for in Situ Exsolution of Metallic Nanoparticles on Perovskite Parent,10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02757
5,12950,"Density functional theory calculations prove that the crystal reconstruction induces the loss of coordinated oxygen surrounding B-site cations, serving as the driving force for steering fast NP growth.",New Opportunity for in Situ Exsolution of Metallic Nanoparticles on Perovskite Parent,10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02757
6,12950,The prepared material shows promising capability as an active and stable electrode for SOFCs in various fuels and SOECs for CO2 reduction.,New Opportunity for in Situ Exsolution of Metallic Nanoparticles on Perovskite Parent,10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02757
7,12950,The conception exemplified here could conceivably be extended to fabricate a series of supported NPs perovskite catalysts with diverse functionalities.,New Opportunity for in Situ Exsolution of Metallic Nanoparticles on Perovskite Parent,10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02757
