1,6705,"Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) are considered more capable of operating at low temperature than solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) e.g., at 300-600 degrees C because of low activation energy associated with proton transport if suitable cathodes can be developed.",A cobalt free triple charge conducting Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ-Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Sb0.2O3-δ heterostructure composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.263
2,6705,"Herein, we have developed a cobalt-free triple charge conducting (oxygen ion, proton and electron-hole) Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta-Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Sb0.2O3-delta (SDC-BSFSb) heterostructure composite for PCFC cathode.",A cobalt free triple charge conducting Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ-Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Sb0.2O3-δ heterostructure composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.263
3,6705,The SDC-BSFSb exhibit very low-area-specific resistance with large oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity over barium-ceria-based proton conducting perovskite-oxide electrolytes.,A cobalt free triple charge conducting Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ-Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Sb0.2O3-δ heterostructure composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.263
4,6705,"We have demonstrated high-power densities of 705 mW-cm(2) for a button-sized PCFC at 550 degrees C using H-2/air fuels, and even with possible operation at 400 degrees C. Various spectroscopic measurements such as X-ray photoelectron, U-visible, Raman, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were employed to understand the improved ORR electrocatalyst function of SDC-BSFSb heterostructure composite for PCFCs cathode.",A cobalt free triple charge conducting Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ-Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Sb0.2O3-δ heterostructure composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.263
5,6705,It is found that SDC-BSFSb effectively showed enhanced ionic and electronic properties to exhibit high ORR at the interface of SDC and BSFSb particles.,A cobalt free triple charge conducting Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ-Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Sb0.2O3-δ heterostructure composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.263
6,6705,The results can further help to develop functional cobalt-free electro-catalysts for LT-PCFCs/LT-SOFCs and other related applications.,A cobalt free triple charge conducting Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ-Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Sb0.2O3-δ heterostructure composite cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.09.263
