2,18417,"Cr was studied as a function of temperature ( 1023 - 1173 K) for up to 480 h in flowing air, which corresponds to SOFC cathode environment operating conditions.",Oxidation kinetics study of the iron-based steel for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1023/B:JTAN.0000033205.69427.8e
3,18417,"The oxidation process was found to be a parabolic, suggesting that the diffusion of ionic defects in the scale is the slowest, rate determining step and it occurs predominantly by short-circuit diffusion paths.",Oxidation kinetics study of the iron-based steel for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1023/B:JTAN.0000033205.69427.8e
4,18417,"Comparison of the determined activation energy of oxidation of the studied steel with literature data indicates that at 1098 - 1173 K the chromia scale grows by the outward solid-state diffusion of chromium interstitials, whereas at 1023 - 1098 K - through a significant contribution of counter-current oxygen/chromium diffusion along Cr2O3 grain boundaries.",Oxidation kinetics study of the iron-based steel for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1023/B:JTAN.0000033205.69427.8e
5,18417,The oxide scales were composed mainly of Cr2O3 with a continuous thin Mn1.5Cr1.5O4 spinel layer on top of the chromia scale.,Oxidation kinetics study of the iron-based steel for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1023/B:JTAN.0000033205.69427.8e
6,18417,The oxidation test results on Fe-25Cr steel demonstrate the applicability of the commercial type DIN 50049 stainless steel as interconnect for SOFC.,Oxidation kinetics study of the iron-based steel for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1023/B:JTAN.0000033205.69427.8e
