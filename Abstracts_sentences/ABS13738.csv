1,13738,"Previous experimental studies have shown that addition of small amounts of oxygen to a hydrocarbon fuel stream can control coking in the anode, while relatively large amounts of oxygen are present in the fuel stream in single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Numerical study of heterogeneous reactions in an SOFC anode with oxygen addition,10.1149/1.2907763
2,13738,"In order to rationally design an anode for such use, it is important to understand the coupled catalytic oxidation/ reforming chemistry and diffusion within the anode under SOFC operating conditions.",Numerical study of heterogeneous reactions in an SOFC anode with oxygen addition,10.1149/1.2907763
3,13738,"In this study, the heterogeneous catalytic reactions in the anode of an anode-supported SOFC running on methane fuel with added oxygen are numerically investigated using a model that accounts for catalytic chemistry, porous media transport, and electrochemistry at the anode/electrolyte interface.",Numerical study of heterogeneous reactions in an SOFC anode with oxygen addition,10.1149/1.2907763
4,13738,"Using an experimentally validated heterogeneous reaction mechanism for methane partial oxidation and reforming on nickel, we identify three distinct reaction zones at different depths within the anode: a thin outer layer in which oxygen is nearly fully consumed in oxidizing methane and hydrogen, followed by a reforming region, and then a water-gas shift region deep within the anode.",Numerical study of heterogeneous reactions in an SOFC anode with oxygen addition,10.1149/1.2907763
