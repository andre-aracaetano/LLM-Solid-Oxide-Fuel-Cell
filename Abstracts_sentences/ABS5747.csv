2,5747,"Most IGFC system analysis efforts performed to-date have employed non-dimensional SOFC models, which predict SOFC performance based upon global mass and energy balances that do not resolve important intrinsic constraints of SOFC operation, such as the limits of internal temperatures and species concentrations.",Application of a detailed dimensional solid oxide fuel cell model in integrated gasification fuel cell system design and analysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.080
3,5747,"In this work, a detailed dimensional planar SOFC model is applied in IGFC system analysis to investigate these constraints and their implications and effects on the system performance.",Application of a detailed dimensional solid oxide fuel cell model in integrated gasification fuel cell system design and analysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.080
4,5747,The analysis results further confirm the need for employing a dimensional SOFC model in IGFC system design.,Application of a detailed dimensional solid oxide fuel cell model in integrated gasification fuel cell system design and analysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.080
5,5747,"To maintain the SOFC internal temperature within a safe operating range, the required cooling air flow rate is much larger than that predicted by the non-dimensional SOFC model, which results in a larger air compressor design and operating power that significantly reduces the system efficiency.",Application of a detailed dimensional solid oxide fuel cell model in integrated gasification fuel cell system design and analysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.080
6,5747,Options to mitigate the challenges introduced by considering the intrinsic constraints of SOFC operation in the analyses and improve IGFC design and operation have also been investigated.,Application of a detailed dimensional solid oxide fuel cell model in integrated gasification fuel cell system design and analysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.080
7,5747,"Novel design concepts that include staged SOFC stacks and cascading air flow can achieve a system efficiency that is close to that of the baseline analyses, which did not consider the intrinsic SOFC limitations.",Application of a detailed dimensional solid oxide fuel cell model in integrated gasification fuel cell system design and analysis,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.080
