1,10590,"Integrated Planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (IP-SOFC), which utilise a Ni/YSZ based anode, have been operated under direct hydrogen-methane mixture fuel injection at 900 degrees C.",Analysing Carbon Deposition on Ni/YSZ Anode Tested in an Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.14447/jnmes.v20i3.315
2,10590,"This process has shown some disadvantages in fuelling to the IP-SOFC; producing carbon deposition from the methane in the fuel mixture, causing direct structural damage to the IP-SOFC surface and blocking the area of activation for reaction processes and reducing the performances.",Analysing Carbon Deposition on Ni/YSZ Anode Tested in an Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.14447/jnmes.v20i3.315
3,10590,These factors were shown to adversely affect the performance of the IP-SOFC over time.,Analysing Carbon Deposition on Ni/YSZ Anode Tested in an Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.14447/jnmes.v20i3.315
4,10590,The aim of this paper is to calculate the amount of carbon deposited through the use of temperature programmed oxidation (TPO).,Analysing Carbon Deposition on Ni/YSZ Anode Tested in an Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.14447/jnmes.v20i3.315
5,10590,"In addition, the distribution of carbon is studied and analysed on all parts of the IP-SOFC cells.",Analysing Carbon Deposition on Ni/YSZ Anode Tested in an Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.14447/jnmes.v20i3.315
6,10590,The results show that both amorphous and graphitic carbon were formed causing microstructural damage thereby reducing the cell performance.,Analysing Carbon Deposition on Ni/YSZ Anode Tested in an Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC),10.14447/jnmes.v20i3.315
