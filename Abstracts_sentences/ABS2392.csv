1,2392,The microstructure and local chemistry of the interface between the screen-printed La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF) thin film cathode and Gd-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte substrate have been investigated.,Mutual Diffusion Occurring at the Interface between La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Cathode and Gd-doped Ceria Electrolyte during IT-SOFC Cell Preparation,10.1021/am2005543
2,2392,"Elemental distribution analyses, by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy operated in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode, illustrate that all constituent elements in GDC and LSCF mutually diffuse across the LSCF/GDC interface, with equal diffusion length.",Mutual Diffusion Occurring at the Interface between La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Cathode and Gd-doped Ceria Electrolyte during IT-SOFC Cell Preparation,10.1021/am2005543
3,2392,"This leads to the formation of mutual diffusion zones at the LSCF/GDC interfaces, with the resultant mixture of diffusing ions being associated with specific valence state changes, as verified by STEM electron energy loss spectroscopy analyses.",Mutual Diffusion Occurring at the Interface between La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Cathode and Gd-doped Ceria Electrolyte during IT-SOFC Cell Preparation,10.1021/am2005543
4,2392,"Moreover, this mutual diffusion can result in microstructural changes, where superstructure formation is accompanied by enhancement of oxygen vacancy ordering at this region.",Mutual Diffusion Occurring at the Interface between La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Cathode and Gd-doped Ceria Electrolyte during IT-SOFC Cell Preparation,10.1021/am2005543
5,2392,Such mutual diffusion and associated microstructure evolution is considered to be detrimental to fuel cell efficiency and should be suppressed by lowering cell fabrication temperatures.,Mutual Diffusion Occurring at the Interface between La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 Cathode and Gd-doped Ceria Electrolyte during IT-SOFC Cell Preparation,10.1021/am2005543
