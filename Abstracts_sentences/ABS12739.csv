1,12739,MnCo2O4(MCO)-YSZ composite electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells were prepared by alternating electrodeposition cycles of Mn and Co into a composite scaffold of YSZ and by infiltration of Mn and Co salts.,Fabrication of MnCo2O4-YSZ Composite Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Electrodeposition,10.1149/2.0791608jes
2,12739,"Measurements with 10-wt%, 25-wt%, and 40-wt% MCO-YSZ composites showed that good conductivities, greater than 1 S cm(-1), could be achieved for 25-wt% and 40-wt% loadings.",Fabrication of MnCo2O4-YSZ Composite Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Electrodeposition,10.1149/2.0791608jes
3,12739,"Also, the ohmic resistances of symmetric cells with 25-wt% and 40-wt% MCO, produced by either electrodeposition or infiltration, were equal to the value calculated for the YSZ electrolyte.",Fabrication of MnCo2O4-YSZ Composite Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Electrodeposition,10.1149/2.0791608jes
4,12739,"However, the non-ohmic losses in MCO-YSZ cells produced by electrodeposition were significantly lower than those produced by infiltration, probably due to the presence of catalytic amounts of Co3O4 in the electrodeposited composites, observed as an impurity phase in XRD.",Fabrication of MnCo2O4-YSZ Composite Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Electrodeposition,10.1149/2.0791608jes
5,12739,The addition of 5-wt% La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta (LSF) to a 40-wt% MCO-YSZ composite further increased electrode performance.,Fabrication of MnCo2O4-YSZ Composite Cathodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells by Electrodeposition,10.1149/2.0791608jes
