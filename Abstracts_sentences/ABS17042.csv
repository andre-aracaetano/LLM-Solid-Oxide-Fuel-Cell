1,17042,"Ethanol steam reforming with/without co-fed oxygen and hydrogen over Ni on high surface area (HSA) CeO2 support, synthesized via a surfactant-assisted method, (Ni/CeO2 (HSA)) was studied under solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating conditions for later application as an instack reforming catalyst.",Steam reforming of ethanol with co-fed oxygen and hydrogen over Ni on high surface area ceria support,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.001
2,17042,The catalyst provides considerably higher reforming reactivity and excellent resistance towards carbon deposition in comparison with Ni/Al2O3 and Ni on conventional ceria (Ni/CeO2 (low surface area; LSA)).,Steam reforming of ethanol with co-fed oxygen and hydrogen over Ni on high surface area ceria support,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.001
3,17042,"At the temperature above 800 degrees C, the main products from the reforming processes over Ni/CeO2 (HSA) were H-2, CO, and CO2 with some amount of CH4 depending on the inlet steam/ethanol and cofed reactant (i.e. O-2 and H-2)/ethanol ratios, whereas high hydrocarbon compound i.e. C2H4 was also observed from the reforming of ethanol over Ni/CeO2 (LSA) and Ni/Al2O3.",Steam reforming of ethanol with co-fed oxygen and hydrogen over Ni on high surface area ceria support,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.001
4,17042,An addition Of O-2 (as oxidative steam reforming) and H-2 significantly reduced the degree of carbon deposition.,Steam reforming of ethanol with co-fed oxygen and hydrogen over Ni on high surface area ceria support,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.001
5,17042,The presence of both reactants also promoted the conversions of hydrocarbon presented in the system (i.e. CH4 and C2H4) to CO and H-2.,Steam reforming of ethanol with co-fed oxygen and hydrogen over Ni on high surface area ceria support,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.001
6,17042,The major consideration of these additions is the suitable co-fed reactant/C2H5OH ratio.,Steam reforming of ethanol with co-fed oxygen and hydrogen over Ni on high surface area ceria support,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.001
7,17042,"The presence of too high oxygen concentration could oxidize Ni particles to NiO, which resulted in a lower reforming reactivity, and also combusts H-2 to H2O.",Steam reforming of ethanol with co-fed oxygen and hydrogen over Ni on high surface area ceria support,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.001

9,17042,"C2H5OH molar ratio for the oxidative steam reforming of Ni/CeO2 was 0.4, which is less than that of Ni/Al2O3.",Steam reforming of ethanol with co-fed oxygen and hydrogen over Ni on high surface area ceria support,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.001
10,17042,"An addition of too high hydrogen content slightly decreased the catalyst activity, which could be due to the active site competition of nickel particle and the inhibition of gas-solid redox reactions between the gaseous hydrocarbon components with the lattice oxygen (O-O(x)) on the surface Of CeO2 support in the case of Ni/CeO2.",Steam reforming of ethanol with co-fed oxygen and hydrogen over Ni on high surface area ceria support,10.1016/j.apcata.2007.05.001
