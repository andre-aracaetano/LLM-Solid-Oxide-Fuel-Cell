1,20340,"The technology of reforming liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to produce a mixture of methane, hydrogen and carbon oxides for application to internal reforming SOFC stacks was developed from experimental studies in a microreactor and then scaled-up and demonstrated through a planned 500-h test in a prototype LPG reformer.",Demonstration of LPG-fueled solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00377-6
2,20340,A number of pre-reforming and steam reforming catalysts were tested in the microreactor under isothermal conditions.,Demonstration of LPG-fueled solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00377-6
3,20340,The aim was to evaluate their activity for LPG reforming under thermodynamically favourable conditions.,Demonstration of LPG-fueled solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00377-6
4,20340,Compositions of the exit-gas from the reformer were measured for a range of steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratios and operating temperatures.,Demonstration of LPG-fueled solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00377-6
5,20340,Promising catalysts from these tests were then tested in a 1-kW size prototype reformer under adiabatic conditions with the temperature in the catalyst bed ranging from 350 to 373 degreesC at selected steam-to-carbon ratios.,Demonstration of LPG-fueled solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00377-6
6,20340,"With a steam/carbon ratio of 1.5 under these conditions, the composition of the reformed gas on a dry-basis is 55% methane, 25% hydrogen and 20%.",Demonstration of LPG-fueled solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00377-6

8,20340,The technical viability of operating SOFC stacks on pre-reformed LPG was firstly demonstrated by operation of a single cell on simulated pre-reforined LPG.,Demonstration of LPG-fueled solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00377-6
9,20340,"Finally, operation of an internal reforming SOFC system fueled by commercial LPG was demonstrated by running a 1-kW, 2 x 2 array stack in a 5-kW size SOFC system.",Demonstration of LPG-fueled solid oxide fuel cell systems,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00377-6
