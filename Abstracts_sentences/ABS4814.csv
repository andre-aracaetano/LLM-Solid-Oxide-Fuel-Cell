6,4814,"As predicted by theory, conditions that resulted in higher cell temperatures or in lower air and fuel concentrations resulted in lower thermodynamically reversible voltages.",Optimization of a Single-Cell Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Using Computational Fluid Dynamics,10.1115/1.4002616
7,4814,"However, the higher temperatures also reduced Ohmic losses and, when operating with low to moderate current densities, activation losses, which often caused the voltages actually being produced by the cell to increase.",Optimization of a Single-Cell Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Using Computational Fluid Dynamics,10.1115/1.4002616

9,4814,"Although the increased pressure resulted in higher cell voltages, this benefit was significantly reduced or eliminated when air-and fuel-compressor electrical loads were included.",Optimization of a Single-Cell Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Using Computational Fluid Dynamics,10.1115/1.4002616
10,4814,"CFD simulations were also performed with counterflow, crossflow, and parallel-flow fuel-channel to air-channel configurations and with various flow-channel dimensions.",Optimization of a Single-Cell Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Using Computational Fluid Dynamics,10.1115/1.4002616
11,4814,"The counterflow arrangement produced cell voltages that were equal to or slightly higher than the other configurations, and it resulted in a differential temperature across the electrolyte that was significantly less than that of the parallel-flow cell and was close to the maximum value in the crossflow cell, which limits stress caused by uneven thermal expansion.",Optimization of a Single-Cell Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Using Computational Fluid Dynamics,10.1115/1.4002616
12,4814,The use of wider ribs separating adjacent flow channels reduced the resistance to the electrical current conducted through the ribs.,Optimization of a Single-Cell Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Using Computational Fluid Dynamics,10.1115/1.4002616
13,4814,"However, it also reduced the area over which incoming fuel and oxygen were in contact with the electrode surfaces and, consequently, impeded diffusion through the electrodes.",Optimization of a Single-Cell Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Using Computational Fluid Dynamics,10.1115/1.4002616
14,4814,Reducing flow-channel height reduced electrical resistance but increased the pressure drop within the channels.,Optimization of a Single-Cell Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell Using Computational Fluid Dynamics,10.1115/1.4002616
