1,855,Carbonate-superstructured solid fuel cells (CSSFCs) are an emerging type of fuel cells with high flexibility of fuels.,Gradient Functional Layer Anode for Carbonate- Superstructured Solid Fuel Cells with Ethane Fuel,10.1002/smll.202311684
2,855,"However, using ethane fuel for solid fuel cells is a great challenge due to serious degradation of their anodes.",Gradient Functional Layer Anode for Carbonate- Superstructured Solid Fuel Cells with Ethane Fuel,10.1002/smll.202311684
3,855,"Herein, this critical issue is solved by creating a novel gradient functional layer anode for CSSFCs.",Gradient Functional Layer Anode for Carbonate- Superstructured Solid Fuel Cells with Ethane Fuel,10.1002/smll.202311684
4,855,"First, a finer-scale anode with a larger surface area is demonstrated to provide more active sites for the internal reforming reaction of ethane, achieving a 60% higher ethane conversion rate and 40% lower polarization resistance than conventional anodes.",Gradient Functional Layer Anode for Carbonate- Superstructured Solid Fuel Cells with Ethane Fuel,10.1002/smll.202311684
5,855,"Second, incorporating a gradient functional layer into the anode results in an additional 50% enhancement in the peak power density of CSSFCs to a record high value (up to 241 mW cm(-2)) with dry ethane fuel at a low temperature of 550 degrees C, which is even comparable to the power density of conventional solid oxide fuel cells above 700 degrees",Gradient Functional Layer Anode for Carbonate- Superstructured Solid Fuel Cells with Ethane Fuel,10.1002/smll.202311684
6,855,"C. Furthermore, the CSSFC with the gradient anode exhibits excellent durability for over 200 h. This finding provides a new strategy to develop efficient anodes for hydrocarbon fuels.",Gradient Functional Layer Anode for Carbonate- Superstructured Solid Fuel Cells with Ethane Fuel,10.1002/smll.202311684
