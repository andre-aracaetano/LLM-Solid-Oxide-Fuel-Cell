2,17262,Different modes of variation are obtained depending on the relative composition and porosity and the conditions of sintering.,Degradation of solid oxide fuel cell anodes due to sintering of metal particles - Correlated percolation model,10.1149/1.1837952
3,17262,They range from a moderate degradation (when the three-phase boundary still penetrates through the whole volume of the anode) to a catastrophic degradation (when the three-phase boundary is localized within a thin layer near the current collector).,Degradation of solid oxide fuel cell anodes due to sintering of metal particles - Correlated percolation model,10.1149/1.1837952
4,17262,"More specific situations, including nonmonotonic variation, are also revealed, as well as a rare case where the three-phase boundary increases when the sintering leads to the opening of new pores.",Degradation of solid oxide fuel cell anodes due to sintering of metal particles - Correlated percolation model,10.1149/1.1837952
