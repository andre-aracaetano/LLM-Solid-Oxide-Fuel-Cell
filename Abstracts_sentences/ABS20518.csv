1,20518,Here Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95-x (GDC) pre-infiltration was performed on 12 vol.% La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x (LSCF) or Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-x (SSC) infiltrated GDC Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathodes.,"Evidence that Surface-Segregated Sr Phases Can Be Removed in LSCF via Ceria Pre-Infiltration, Are Less Apt to Form in SSC",10.1149/1945-7111/abe34e
2,20518,"The addition of 7.5 vol.% of similar to 40 nm diameter GDC nanoparticles into a similar to 30 mu m thick porous scaffold of partially-sintered, sub-micron GDC particles before LSCF infiltration 1) lowered the temperature needed to produce a LSCF-GDC polarization resistance (R-P) of 0.1 Ohm*cm(2) by similar to 50 degrees C, and 2) reduced the amount of 500 h, 650 degrees C open-circuit LSCF-GDC R-P degradation from similar to 37% to similar to 6%.","Evidence that Surface-Segregated Sr Phases Can Be Removed in LSCF via Ceria Pre-Infiltration, Are Less Apt to Form in SSC",10.1149/1945-7111/abe34e
3,20518,"In contrast, GDC pre-infiltration had no effect on the initial SSC-GDC R-P or the 19% in R-P degradation observed during 500 h of 650 degrees C open-circuit aging.","Evidence that Surface-Segregated Sr Phases Can Be Removed in LSCF via Ceria Pre-Infiltration, Are Less Apt to Form in SSC",10.1149/1945-7111/abe34e
4,20518,"X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy showed that GDC pre-infiltration lowered the concentration of strontium species on the surface of the initial and 650 degrees C-aged LSCF-GDC, but had no effect on the initial or aged SSC-GDC Sr concentrations.","Evidence that Surface-Segregated Sr Phases Can Be Removed in LSCF via Ceria Pre-Infiltration, Are Less Apt to Form in SSC",10.1149/1945-7111/abe34e
5,20518,"Similarly, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy showed that for both the initial and aged LSCF-GDC, GDC pre-infiltration improved oxygen exchange at the infiltrate-backbone and infiltrate-gas interfaces, but had no effect on the SSC-GDC.","Evidence that Surface-Segregated Sr Phases Can Be Removed in LSCF via Ceria Pre-Infiltration, Are Less Apt to Form in SSC",10.1149/1945-7111/abe34e
6,20518,"Hence, GDC pre-infiltration was concluded to improve LSCF-GDC performance and durability by scavenging exsolved Sr-rich secondary phases that form on the interfaces of LSCF, but not SSC.","Evidence that Surface-Segregated Sr Phases Can Be Removed in LSCF via Ceria Pre-Infiltration, Are Less Apt to Form in SSC",10.1149/1945-7111/abe34e
