4,18834,"It was observed that at low current densities the current-voltage (i-V) curves showed good continuity across the open circuit voltage (OCV) but minor fluctuations in the SOC performance were observed at the higher current densities, which could be due to the gas-diffusion limitation of the reactants inside the electrodes or the microstructural changes occurring due to the electrode degradation.",Steam/CO2 Co-Electrolysis Performance of Reversible Solid Oxide Cell with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-δ Oxygen Electrode,10.1149/2.0481501jes
