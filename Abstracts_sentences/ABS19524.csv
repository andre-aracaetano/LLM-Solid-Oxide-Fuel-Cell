3,19524,Simple ceria/carbonate two-phase nanocomposites were synthesized by the carbonate precipitation method followed by a thermal treatment.,Electrical properties of ceria/carbonate nanocomposites,10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.03.098
4,19524,"The decomposition course of the precursor, the thermal stability, morphology and the composite formation mechanism were studied by thermogravimetric-differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA), IR, UV, SEM and XRD analyses.",Electrical properties of ceria/carbonate nanocomposites,10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.03.098
5,19524,"The conductivity temperature dependence in the 300-800 degrees C temperature range, performed on composite pellets, exhibits conductivity values one-two higher magnitude order and a lower activation energy of 0.809 +/- 0.001 eV, with respect to 1.693 +/- 0.005 eV for pure ceria obtained under the same conditions.",Electrical properties of ceria/carbonate nanocomposites,10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.03.098
6,19524,"This enhancement of the composite conductivity, corroborated with the blue shift of the gap energy, as deduced from the UV spectra, was attributed to the oxygen ion transport through an interface mechanism between the two phases of the ceria/carbonate composite.",Electrical properties of ceria/carbonate nanocomposites,10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.03.098
