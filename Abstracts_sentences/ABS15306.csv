3,15306,"The variation of oxygen content (10+delta) as a function of temperature under different atmospheres show that Pr4Ni3O10+delta is always oxygen over-stoichiometric, which further suggests its MIEC properties.",Pr4Ni3O10+δ: A new promising oxygen electrode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.012
4,15306,The polarization resistance (R-p) of Pr4Ni3O10+delta electrode is measured for GDC/co-sintered and two-step sintered half cells.,Pr4Ni3O10+δ: A new promising oxygen electrode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.012
5,15306,"The R-p for co-sintered sample is found to be 0.16 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C under air, which is as low as the one of highest performing Pr2NiO4+delta nickelate (R-p = 0.15 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C).",Pr4Ni3O10+δ: A new promising oxygen electrode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.012
6,15306,"Moreover, an anode supported (Ni-YSZ//YSZ) single cell including GDC//Pr4Ni3O10+delta co-sintered electrode shows a maximum power density of 1.60 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and 0.68 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C. Here, the work is emphasized on the very close electrochemical performance of Pr4Ni3O10+delta compared to the one of Pr2NiO4+delta with higher chemical stability, which gives great interests to consider this material as a very interesting oxygen-electrode for SOFCs.",Pr4Ni3O10+δ: A new promising oxygen electrode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.03.012
