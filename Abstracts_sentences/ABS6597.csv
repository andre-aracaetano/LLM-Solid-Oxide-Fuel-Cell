5,6597,"It is shown that while at 700 degrees C and 800 degrees C, the anode specimens exhibited purely elastic deformation and brittle fracture, a brittle-to-ductile transition occurred for heating above 800 degrees C and the anode deformed plastically at 900 degrees C. Fractography of the anode specimens were performed to identify the fracture modes of anodes tested at different temperatures.",Microstructure and mechanical properties of Ni/10 mol% Sc2O3-1 mol% CeO2-ZrO2 cermet anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.10.003
