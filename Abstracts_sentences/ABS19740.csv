1,19740,"Surface exchange coefficient (k) and bulk diffusion coefficient (D) are important properties to evaluate the performance of mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) ceramic oxides for use in energy conversion devices, such as solid oxide fuel cells.",Distribution of Characteristic Times: A High-Resolution Spectrum Approach for Visualizing Chemical Relaxation and Resolving Kinetic Parameters of Ionic-Electronic Conducting Ceramic Oxides,10.3390/coatings10121240
2,19740,The values of k and D are usually estimated by a non-linear curve fitting procedure based on electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) measurement.,Distribution of Characteristic Times: A High-Resolution Spectrum Approach for Visualizing Chemical Relaxation and Resolving Kinetic Parameters of Ionic-Electronic Conducting Ceramic Oxides,10.3390/coatings10121240
3,19740,"However, the rate-limiting mechanism (or the availability of k and D) and the experimental imperfections (such as flush delay for gaseous composition change, tau(f)) are not reflected explicitly in the time-domain ECR data, and the accuracy of k and D demands a careful sensitivity analysis of the fitting error.",Distribution of Characteristic Times: A High-Resolution Spectrum Approach for Visualizing Chemical Relaxation and Resolving Kinetic Parameters of Ionic-Electronic Conducting Ceramic Oxides,10.3390/coatings10121240
4,19740,"Here, the distribution of characteristic times (DCT) converted from time-domain ECR data is proposed to overcome the above challenges.",Distribution of Characteristic Times: A High-Resolution Spectrum Approach for Visualizing Chemical Relaxation and Resolving Kinetic Parameters of Ionic-Electronic Conducting Ceramic Oxides,10.3390/coatings10121240
5,19740,"It is demonstrated that, from the DCT spectrum, the rate-limiting mechanism and the effect of tau(f) are easily recognized, and the values of k, D and tau(f) can be determined conjunctly.",Distribution of Characteristic Times: A High-Resolution Spectrum Approach for Visualizing Chemical Relaxation and Resolving Kinetic Parameters of Ionic-Electronic Conducting Ceramic Oxides,10.3390/coatings10121240
6,19740,A strong robustness of determination of k and D is verified using noise-containing ECR data.,Distribution of Characteristic Times: A High-Resolution Spectrum Approach for Visualizing Chemical Relaxation and Resolving Kinetic Parameters of Ionic-Electronic Conducting Ceramic Oxides,10.3390/coatings10121240
7,19740,The DCT spectrum opens up a way towards visible and credible determination of kinetic parameters of MIEC ceramic oxides.,Distribution of Characteristic Times: A High-Resolution Spectrum Approach for Visualizing Chemical Relaxation and Resolving Kinetic Parameters of Ionic-Electronic Conducting Ceramic Oxides,10.3390/coatings10121240
