1,18416,The electrical conductivity change with annealing at 1000degreesC in the Y2O3-ZrO2 (YSZ) system was examined.,Effect of aging on conductivity of yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.08.018
2,18416,"Among the sintered samples doped with 8.0 mol% Y2O3 (8.0YSZ), 8.5 mol% Y2O3 (8.5YSZ), 9.0 mol% Y2O3 (9.0YSZ), 9.5 mol% Y2O3 (9.5YSZ) and 10.0 mol% Y2O3 (10.0YSZ), 9.5- and 10.0YSZ showed no conductivity decrease even for the annealing period of 1000 h, while 8.0- and 8.5YSZ showed significant decrease with time although the initial conductivities were higher than those of 9.5- and 10.0YSZ.",Effect of aging on conductivity of yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.08.018
