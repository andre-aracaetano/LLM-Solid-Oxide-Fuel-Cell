1,3206,"The purpose is to develop alternative alkaline-earth-free quasi-ternary LaCoO3-LaNiO3-LaFeO3 cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which demonstrate high electrical conductivity, good electrochemical performance and excellent chemical stability against CrO2(OH)(2) released from the metallic interconnects at operation temperatures.","Alkaline-earth-free quasi-ternary La(Co, Ni, Fe)O3-δ perovskite as potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1088/2053-1591/ab2ee8
2,3206,"Three different perovskites of lanthanum in combination with iron, cobalt and nickel oxides, i.e. LaFe0.8Co0.1Ni0.1O3-delta (LFCN), LaNi0.8Co0.1Fe0.1O3-delta (LNCF) and LaCo0.8Fe0.1Ni0.1O3-delta (LCFN), were synthesized by the modified Pechini method, and then systematically investigated in the phase structure, thermal expansion, electrical conductivity and catalytic activity.","Alkaline-earth-free quasi-ternary La(Co, Ni, Fe)O3-δ perovskite as potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1088/2053-1591/ab2ee8
3,3206,LFCN have the best combination to the requirements of high-performance cathodes for SOFCs.,"Alkaline-earth-free quasi-ternary La(Co, Ni, Fe)O3-δ perovskite as potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1088/2053-1591/ab2ee8
4,3206,Button cells with LFCN cathode were prepared on anodesupported YSZ electrolyte with gadolinium-doped cerium (GDC) buffer layer by screen printing.,"Alkaline-earth-free quasi-ternary La(Co, Ni, Fe)O3-δ perovskite as potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1088/2053-1591/ab2ee8
5,3206,Excellent electrochemical performance with high maximum power density of 643 mW.cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and corresponding low polarization resistance of 0.62 Omega cm(2) further demonstrate that LFCN is a very competitive candidate as SOFC cathode.,"Alkaline-earth-free quasi-ternary La(Co, Ni, Fe)O3-δ perovskite as potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1088/2053-1591/ab2ee8
