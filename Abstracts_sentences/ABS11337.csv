1,11337,"Glass and glass-ceramics (GCs) of the CaO-SrO-B2O3-TiO2-SiO2 system are promising candidates as sealants for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), mainly because of the possibility of the formation of Sr2SiO4 and Sr(TiO3) as crystalline phases, which minimizes the interfacial reaction between the interconnection elements and the sealant.",Sintering and crystallization of SrO-CaO-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramics with different TiO2 contents,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2017.07.021
