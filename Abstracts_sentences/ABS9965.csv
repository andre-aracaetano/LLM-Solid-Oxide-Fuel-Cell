6,9965,"It was observed that anodic gas velocity has an impact on soot formation and deposition, thus it was also studied in depth.",Analysis of Soot Deposition Mechanisms on Nickel-Based Anodes of SOFCs in Single-Cell and Stack Environment,10.3390/pr8111370
7,9965,Single-anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells were fueled with gases delivered in such a way that the initial velocities in the anodic compartment ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 m/s. Both cell operation and post-mortem observations proved that the carbon deposition process accelerates at higher anodic gas velocity.,Analysis of Soot Deposition Mechanisms on Nickel-Based Anodes of SOFCs in Single-Cell and Stack Environment,10.3390/pr8111370
