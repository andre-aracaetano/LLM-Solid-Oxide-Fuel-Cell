2,18758,In this study we explore a novel approach to electrode preparation employing amorphous cathode materials.,Amorphous-cathode-route towards low temperature SOFC,10.1039/c7se00606c
3,18758,La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta dense films have been deposited at different temperatures using pulsed laser deposition on silicon substrates.,Amorphous-cathode-route towards low temperature SOFC,10.1039/c7se00606c
4,18758,"Depending on the deposition temperature, textured polycrystalline or amorphous films have been obtained.",Amorphous-cathode-route towards low temperature SOFC,10.1039/c7se00606c
5,18758,Isotope exchange depth profiling experiments reveal that the oxygen diffusion coefficient of the amorphous film increased more than four times with respect to the crystalline materials and was accompanied by an increase of the surface exchange coefficient.,Amorphous-cathode-route towards low temperature SOFC,10.1039/c7se00606c
6,18758,No differences in the surface chemical composition between amorphous and crystalline samples were observed.,Amorphous-cathode-route towards low temperature SOFC,10.1039/c7se00606c
7,18758,"Remarkably, even if the electronic conductivities measured by the Van Der Pauw method indicate that the conductivity of the amorphous material was reduced, the overall catalytic properties of the cathode itself were not affected.",Amorphous-cathode-route towards low temperature SOFC,10.1039/c7se00606c
8,18758,This finding suggests that the rate limiting step is the oxygen mobility and that the local electronic conductivity in the amorphous cathode surface is enough to preserve its catalytic properties.,Amorphous-cathode-route towards low temperature SOFC,10.1039/c7se00606c
9,18758,Different cathode materials have also been tested to prove the more general applicability of the amorphous-cathode route.,Amorphous-cathode-route towards low temperature SOFC,10.1039/c7se00606c
