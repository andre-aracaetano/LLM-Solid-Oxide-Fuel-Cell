1,597,"In this paper we theoretically analyze the concept of a reversible-and-regenerative solid oxide device comprising a multilayer architecture that will employ an oxygen-ion-conducting solid oxide, e.g. yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte.","Regenerative, coal-based solid oxide fuel cell-electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.07.001
2,597,"The two electrodes to be used in the device are reversible, i.e. capable of reversibly operating as the cathode and as the anode.","Regenerative, coal-based solid oxide fuel cell-electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.07.001
3,597,One of the electrodes to be used is a liquid metal Ag and the other electrode will be chosen from several options including a nickel (Ni)-YSZ porous cermet.,"Regenerative, coal-based solid oxide fuel cell-electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.07.001
4,597,"The advantage of such a device is the ability to use coal (carbon), an abundantly available fuel in a solid oxide fuel cell.","Regenerative, coal-based solid oxide fuel cell-electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.07.001
5,597,The device can be operated in an electrolysis mode to generate hydrogen from coal and steam and in a power generation mode as a solid oxide fuel cell to generate electricity from the hydrogen generated during the electrolysis cycles.,"Regenerative, coal-based solid oxide fuel cell-electrolyzers",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.07.001
