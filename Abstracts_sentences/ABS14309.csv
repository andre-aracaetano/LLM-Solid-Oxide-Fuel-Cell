7,14309,"Finer resultant powder, compared to earlier reports, and SPS sintered BSCF with nanosized grains exhibited a significantly higher electrical conductivity up to 900 degrees C. Specific conductivity values have been measured in air and N-2 and the maximum of 63 5 cm(-1) at 430 degrees C in air and 25 S cm(-1) at 375 degrees C in N-2 correspondingly show twice as much as conventional BSCF implying a high pledge for nano-BSCF as cathode material in intermediate-temperature SOFC.",Synthesis of nanostructured BSCF by oxalate co-precipitation - As potential cathode material for solid oxide fuels cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.03.121
