1,10662,"La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) and La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta (LSCM) powders were synthesized by glycine-nitrate process, and LSGM electrolyte thin film was successfully fabricated on porous anode substrate of LSCM by slurry spin coating technology.",Fabrication of LSGM thin films on porous anode supports by slurry spin coating for IT-SOFC,10.1007/s12598-014-0346-8
2,10662,"Some technical parameters for the preparation of LSGM thin films were systematically investigated, including ink composition, sintering temperature, and spin coating times.",Fabrication of LSGM thin films on porous anode supports by slurry spin coating for IT-SOFC,10.1007/s12598-014-0346-8
3,10662,"The electrolyte films with the best compactness and somewhat rough are obtained when the operating parameters are fixed as follows: the content of ethyl cellulose as binder is 5 wt%, the content of terpineol as modifier is 5 wt%, the optimum coating cycle number is 9 times, and the best post-deposition sintering temperature is 1,400 degrees C for 4 h.",Fabrication of LSGM thin films on porous anode supports by slurry spin coating for IT-SOFC,10.1007/s12598-014-0346-8
