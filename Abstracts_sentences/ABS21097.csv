8,21097,"A thermal energy storage (TES) system of latent heat type based on a suitable phase change material (PCM) was also included to recover and store heat released by the SOFC, to be recycled later in order to satisfy the thermal energy requirements of both SOEC (steam production) and MSS (distillation column reboiler).",Renewable methanol production and use through reversible solid oxide cells and recycled CO2 hydrogenation,10.1016/j.fuel.2019.02.108
