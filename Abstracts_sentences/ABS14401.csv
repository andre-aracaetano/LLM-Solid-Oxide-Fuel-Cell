1,14401,"An intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (ITSOFC) based on 8YSZ electrolyte, La(0.6)Sr(0.4)CoO3-delta (LSCo) cathode, and Ni - 8YSZ anode coatings were consecutively deposited onto a porous Ni-plate substrate by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS).",A study of Ni+8YSZ/8YSZ/La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ ITSOFC fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.06.015
2,14401,"The spray parameters including current, argon and hydrogen flow rate, and powder feed rate were investigated by an orthogonal experiment to fabricate a thin gas-tight 8YSZ electrolyte coating (80 mum).",A study of Ni+8YSZ/8YSZ/La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ ITSOFC fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.06.015
3,14401,"By proper selection of the spray parameters to decrease the particles velocity and temperature, the sprayed NiO + 8YSZ coating after reducing with hydrogen shows a good electrocatalytic activity for H oxidation.",A study of Ni+8YSZ/8YSZ/La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ ITSOFC fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.06.015
4,14401,"With the same treatment, 100-170 mum dimensions LSCo particle could keep phase structure after spraying.",A study of Ni+8YSZ/8YSZ/La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ ITSOFC fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.06.015
5,14401,And the deposited LSCo cathode shows a good cathode performance and chemical compatibility with SYSZ electrolyte after operating at 800degreesC for 50h.,A study of Ni+8YSZ/8YSZ/La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ ITSOFC fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.06.015
6,14401,"Outputpower density of the sprayed cell achieved 410 mWcm(-2) at 850degreesC and 260mWcm-2 at 800 degreesC. Electrochemical characterization indicated that IR drop of 8YSZ electrolyte, cathodic polarization, and the contact resistance at LSCo/SYSZ interface were the main factors restricting the cell performance.",A study of Ni+8YSZ/8YSZ/La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ ITSOFC fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.06.015
7,14401,The results suggested that the use of APS cell allowed the reduction of the operating temperature of the SOFC to below 850degreesC with lower production costs.,A study of Ni+8YSZ/8YSZ/La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ ITSOFC fabricated by atmospheric plasma spraying,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.06.015
