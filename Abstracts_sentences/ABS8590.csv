1,8590,Direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC) is a potential and prospective technology to convert chemical energy from real-world coal fuels into electricity with environment friendliness and high efficiency.,A vanadium-doped La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite as a promising anode of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells for brown coal utilization,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167212
2,8590,"However, the limited three-phase reaction boundaries and the challenge of sluggish carbon oxidation ac-tivity have always hindered the development and application of DC-SOFCs.",A vanadium-doped La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite as a promising anode of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells for brown coal utilization,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167212
3,8590,"On this account, here vanadium-doped B-site-deficient La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-delta (LSFVx, x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) perovskite materials are synthesized and developed as the anode of DC-SOFCs for brown coal utilization.",A vanadium-doped La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite as a promising anode of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells for brown coal utilization,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167212
4,8590,"The best electrochemical performance at 850 ? belongs to the LSFV0.1 cell, delivering a maximum power density of 249 mW cm(-2), and the lowest polarization resistance of 0.37 omega cm(2),along with the longest discharging time up to 8.65 h.",A vanadium-doped La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite as a promising anode of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells for brown coal utilization,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167212
5,8590,"Compared with the pure LSF, the electrochemical performances of all perovskites doped with vanadium have been greatly promoted, demonstrating that the doping of vanadium can effectively expand the three-phase reaction boundaries of the cell, thus enhance the catalytic activity due to the promotion of oxygen deficiencies and tailing of electronic structures.(c) 2022",A vanadium-doped La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ perovskite as a promising anode of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells for brown coal utilization,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.167212
