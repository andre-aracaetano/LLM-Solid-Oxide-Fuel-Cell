1,15654,"In this work, different contents of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (10, 20, 30 and 40 wt% LSCF) are added into YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBC) to investigate its effect on the performance of solid oxide fuel cell cathode.",Performance of YBa2Cu3O7-δ-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160458
2,15654,"The result shows that with addition of 30 wt% LSCF, the polarization resistance is decreased from 0.137 to 0.044 omega cm2, and the output of the single cell is increased about 50% at 800 degrees C. O2 temperature-programmed desorption and electrical conductivity test show that the oxygen exchange capacity and conductivity of YBC-LSCF are greatly improved from 600 to 800 degrees C.",Performance of YBa2Cu3O7-δ-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160458
3,15654,"The equivalent circuit fitting results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy curves under the different oxygen partial pressures of 0.05, 0.1, 0.21 and 1 atm indicate that the resistance associated with charge transfer and gas transport in the composite cathode are about 80% and 60-80% decreased, respectively.",Performance of YBa2Cu3O7-δ-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160458
4,15654,It is found that the low conductivity and poor oxygen adsorption behavior may be the two obstacles for using YBC as a cathode material.,Performance of YBa2Cu3O7-δ-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160458
5,15654,"It also can be seen that by taking the advantages of LSCF, the drawbacks of YBC are largely remedied and the synergistic effect is achieved.",Performance of YBa2Cu3O7-δ-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160458
