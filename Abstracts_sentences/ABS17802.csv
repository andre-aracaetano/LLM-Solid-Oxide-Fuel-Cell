1,17802,"A novel compressive Phlogopite mica seal was developed that showed superior thermal cycle stability with very low leak rates at 800degreesC. A commercially available Phlogopite mica paper was infiltrated with a wetting or melt-forming agent, and tested in a hybrid form during thermal cycling.",Novel infiltrated phlogopite mica compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.02.037
2,17802,"The results of H3BO3-infiltrated mica showed a continued decrease in leak rates over thermal cycling, and very low rates (<5 x 10(-4) sccm/cm) were obtained after similar to15 thermal cycles.",Novel infiltrated phlogopite mica compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.02.037
3,17802,The results of Bi-nitrate infiltrated mica exhibited a constant leak rate of (1-4) x 10(-3) sccnVcm over 36 thermal cycles.,Novel infiltrated phlogopite mica compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.02.037
4,17802,The leak rates of the infiltrated mica were one to two orders of magnitude lower than leak rates for the as-received micas.,Novel infiltrated phlogopite mica compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.02.037
5,17802,Open circuit voltage tests were also conducted using dense 8YSZ plates to assess the effectiveness of the mica seals.,Novel infiltrated phlogopite mica compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.02.037
6,17802,"Open circuit voltages equivalent to, or close to, the theoretical (Nernst) values were obtained.",Novel infiltrated phlogopite mica compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.02.037
