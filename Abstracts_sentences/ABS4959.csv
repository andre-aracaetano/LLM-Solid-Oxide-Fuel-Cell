2,4959,In addition the response of the SOFC towards waste ammonia has been studied.,Running solid oxide fuel cells on biogas,10.1007/BF02376583
3,4959,"It is possible to run the SOFC on biogas, even at remarkably low levels of methane, at which conventional heat engines would not work, thus offering a valuable and environmentally friendly use for poor-quality biogas that is currently wasted by detrimental venting to the atmosphere.",Running solid oxide fuel cells on biogas,10.1007/BF02376583
4,4959,"The power output varies with methane content of the biogas, with maximum power production occurring at 45% methane, corresponding to maximal production of H-2 and CO through internal dry reforming.",Running solid oxide fuel cells on biogas,10.1007/BF02376583
5,4959,Direct electrocatalytic oxidation of methane does not contribute to the power output of the cell.,Running solid oxide fuel cells on biogas,10.1007/BF02376583
6,4959,"For biogas with higher methane contents methane decomposition becomes significant, leading to increased H-2.",Running solid oxide fuel cells on biogas,10.1007/BF02376583
7,4959,"production, and hence transiently higher power production, and deleterious carbon deposition and thus eventual cell deactivation.",Running solid oxide fuel cells on biogas,10.1007/BF02376583
8,4959,"SOFCs are tolerant to ammonia, actually utilising the ammonia present in biogas to produce electrical power, at the same time acting as an environmental clean-up device breaking down the ammonia pollutant to N-2 and water, with no formation of any undesirable nitrogen oxides.",Running solid oxide fuel cells on biogas,10.1007/BF02376583
