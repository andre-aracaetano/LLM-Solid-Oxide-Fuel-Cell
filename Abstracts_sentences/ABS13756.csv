1,13756,This paper deals with the fabrication and electrochemical study of a high temperature solid electrolyte supporting cell operating as SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell) and SOEC (Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell).,Study of reversible SOFC/SOEC based on a mixed anionic-protonic conductor,10.1007/s10800-015-0838-8
2,13756,"The cell is based on a dual membrane (DM) electrolyte design, advantageously separating the cell into three different chambers: hydrogen side, oxygen side, and dual membrane (DM), where H2O production or splitting takes place in SOFC or SOEC mode respectively.",Study of reversible SOFC/SOEC based on a mixed anionic-protonic conductor,10.1007/s10800-015-0838-8
3,13756,"The supporting electrolyte consists of a dense/porous/dense tri-layer, exclusively made of BaCe0.85Y0.15O3-delta (monolithic design), which is a mixed anionic-protonic conductor.",Study of reversible SOFC/SOEC based on a mixed anionic-protonic conductor,10.1007/s10800-015-0838-8
4,13756,"The assembly was fabricated by tape casting, adding pore formers to control porosity.",Study of reversible SOFC/SOEC based on a mixed anionic-protonic conductor,10.1007/s10800-015-0838-8
5,13756,"The cell was then electrochemically studied under different operating conditions of temperature, overpotentials and gas feeding, either in SOFC and SOEC mode.",Study of reversible SOFC/SOEC based on a mixed anionic-protonic conductor,10.1007/s10800-015-0838-8
6,13756,"From the results presented here, it can be observed that, in spite of dense and thick electrolyte layers and platinum electrodes, the electrochemical study of the cell showed: (i) promising power density, (ii) interesting SOFC/SOEC operating mode reversibility, (iii) proved H2O production in the porous dual membrane when the cell operates as a fuel cell, and proved splitting of the H2O molecules contained in the porous dual membrane when the cell operates as an electrolyser.",Study of reversible SOFC/SOEC based on a mixed anionic-protonic conductor,10.1007/s10800-015-0838-8
7,13756,Investigations of cell performance degradation were also conducted.,Study of reversible SOFC/SOEC based on a mixed anionic-protonic conductor,10.1007/s10800-015-0838-8
