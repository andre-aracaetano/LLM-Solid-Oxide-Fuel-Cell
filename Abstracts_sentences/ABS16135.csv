1,16135,"Reversible solid oxide cells based on proton conducting electrolytes (H-RSOC) are regarded as efficient energy conversion devices for practical application of renewable energy, such as solar energy and wind energy to smooth out their fluctuation and intermittence.",Reversible Solid Oxide Cell with Proton Conducting Electrolyte: Materials and Reaction Machanism,
2,16135,"In this paper, the requirements and development of electrode and electrolyte materials for H-RSOC are briefly reviewed, and especially, the reaction mechanisms of air electrode with respect to their demand on air electrode materials are summarized.",Reversible Solid Oxide Cell with Proton Conducting Electrolyte: Materials and Reaction Machanism,
3,16135,"Working in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) mode, the migration of protons to triple phase boundaries (TPBs) and the surface diffusion of oxygen ions to TPBs are supposed to be the rate limiting steps, which favors the composite consisting of oxygen ion-electron mixed conductors and proton conductors as air electrode.",Reversible Solid Oxide Cell with Proton Conducting Electrolyte: Materials and Reaction Machanism,
4,16135,"While in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) mode, the transferring of protons decomposed from water to TPBs and the protons at TPBs transferring to the electrolyte are deemed as the rate limiting steps, and novel proton-electron mixed conductor might be the best choice of such air electrode.",Reversible Solid Oxide Cell with Proton Conducting Electrolyte: Materials and Reaction Machanism,
5,16135,"That's because that the proton transfer in such proton-electron mixed conducting air electrode would be greatly improved for their high volume ratio (similar to 60%) and for their greatly enlarged electro active sites, which expands from traditional TPBs in composite electrodes to the interface of gas phase/mixed conducting air electrode.",Reversible Solid Oxide Cell with Proton Conducting Electrolyte: Materials and Reaction Machanism,
