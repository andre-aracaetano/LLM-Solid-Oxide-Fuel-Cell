2,15085,"A three-dimensional computational model (CFD-ACE package), with the relevant sub-models was used for the study.",Innovative design to improve the power density of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.030
3,15085,"The performance of the SOFC was examined with a thin wall, which splits the inlet section and runs up to half the length of the flow channels.",Innovative design to improve the power density of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.030
4,15085,The results obtained with this (thin-walled) geometry were consistently better than those obtained with plain geometry (without the thin wall).,Innovative design to improve the power density of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.030
5,15085,The polarization characteristics of the thin-walled geometry indicated that the maximum power density obtained was 1.18 W cm(-2) at an efficiency of around 60%.,Innovative design to improve the power density of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.030
6,15085,"The corresponding values of maximum power density and the efficiency at which it was obtained for a plain geometry were 0.88 W cm(-2) and 50%, respectively.",Innovative design to improve the power density of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.030
7,15085,The enhanced performance of the thin-walled geometry was attributed to a better distribution of the reactants along the length of the SOFC.,Innovative design to improve the power density of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.030
8,15085,Studies were also conducted to verify the performance of the thin-walled geometry over a wide range of inlet mass flow rates.,Innovative design to improve the power density of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.030
9,15085,They revealed a superior performance of the thin-walled geometry compared to the plain geometry.,Innovative design to improve the power density of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.030
10,15085,"At lower inlet mass flow rates, the difference between the two in performance was small, but at higher inlet mass flow rates the difference in performance was significant.",Innovative design to improve the power density of a solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.10.030
