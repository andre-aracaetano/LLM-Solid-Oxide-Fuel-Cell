2,19706,The possibility of stable operation of SOFCs with ethane fuel at a low steam/carbon (S/C) ratio of 1.2 mol% H2O-98.8 mol% C2H6 was investigated with anode-supported SOFCs utilizing a scandia stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) electrolyte and a Ni-ScSZ anode.,Feasibility of Ni-based cermet anode for direct HCSOFCs: Fueling ethane at a low S/C condition to Ni-ScSZ anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.087

5,19706,"However, at a low fuel utilization rate (U-f) around 20%, nickel was heavily disintegrated accompanied by severe carbon deposition even at T approximate to 823 K. With increasing U-f, the disintegration became less, and a stable cell operations were achieved only with a small amount of deposited carbon for over a week at high U-f > 46%.",Feasibility of Ni-based cermet anode for direct HCSOFCs: Fueling ethane at a low S/C condition to Ni-ScSZ anode-supported cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.12.087
