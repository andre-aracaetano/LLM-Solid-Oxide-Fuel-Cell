1,16746,"In this paper, the integration of a solid oxide fuel cell operating at a very high temperature (900-1000 degreesC, 55-60% efficiency) in a near-zero emission power cycle is presented.",Towards the hydrogen era using near-zero CO2 emissions energy systems,10.1016/j.energy.2004.03.007
2,16746,A more efficient and powerful hybrid near-zero emission CO2/O-2 cycle is obtained with a CO2 release as small as 6 g CO2/kW h(e).,Towards the hydrogen era using near-zero CO2 emissions energy systems,10.1016/j.energy.2004.03.007
3,16746,"Based on a trade-off analysis, the net efficiency is around 47-48%, similar to a current one-pressure level natural gas fired combined cycle, and the power output (940 kW(e)) is increased by 66% compared to the so-called E-MATIANT cycle but currently at a much higher cost than those of other known zero-emission power cycles.",Towards the hydrogen era using near-zero CO2 emissions energy systems,10.1016/j.energy.2004.03.007
