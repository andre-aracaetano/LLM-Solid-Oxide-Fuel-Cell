1,9131,NiO is used as a sintering aid to modify BaZ(0.1)Ce(0.7)Y(0.2)O(3-delta) by an external addition method and by an internal doping strategy to improve the sinterability of BaZ(0.1)Ce(0.7)Y(0.2)O(3-delta).,Exploring the role of NiO as a sintering aid in BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.07.087
2,9131,"In both cases, the modified BaZ(0.1)Ce(0.7)Y(0.2)O(3-delta) materials show an improved sinterability compared with the original BaZ(0.1)Ce(0.7)Y(0.2)O(3-delta).",Exploring the role of NiO as a sintering aid in BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.07.087
3,9131,"However, doping BaZ(0.1)Ce(0.7)Y(0.2)O(3-delta) with NiO to form BaZr0.1Ce0.66Ni0.04Y0.2O3-delta is found to be an effective strategy to significantly improve the electrolyte properties.",Exploring the role of NiO as a sintering aid in BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.07.087
4,9131,The BaZr0.1Ce0.66Ni0.04Y0.2O3-delta sample shows a high density and large grain size after sintering at a relatively low temperature (1400 degrees C).,Exploring the role of NiO as a sintering aid in BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.07.087
5,9131,Electrochemical studies reveal that the doping strategy offers a high proton conductivity in both the bulk and across grain boundaries.,Exploring the role of NiO as a sintering aid in BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.07.087
6,9131,"The conductivity of BaZr0.1Ce0.66Ni0.04Y0.2O3-delta sintered at 1400 degrees C is observed to be higher than that of BaZ(0.1)Ce(0.7)Y(0.2)O(3-delta) sintered at 1600 degrees C. With BaZr0.1Ce0.66Ni0.04Y0.2O3-delta as the electrolyte, a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell displays a large peak power density of 477 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C and a high electrolyte membrane conductivity of 6.3 x 10(-3) S cm(-1).",Exploring the role of NiO as a sintering aid in BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ electrolyte for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.07.087
