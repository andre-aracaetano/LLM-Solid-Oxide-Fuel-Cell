2,18078,"After the calcination at 900 degrees C and then removal of La2O3 by acid-washing, pure stoichiometric La10Si6O27 nanopowders are obtained, and are characterized by XRD, BET, TEM and ICP, respectively.",Synthesis and electrical properties of apatite-type La10Si6O27,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.088
3,18078,"The oxy-apatite ceramic with the density higher than 95% can be obtained at rather low sintering temperature of 1300 degrees C, which has comparable total conductivity with the samples sintered at 1650 degrees C from the powders prepared by solid-state reaction.",Synthesis and electrical properties of apatite-type La10Si6O27,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.088
4,18078,"Additionally, effects of sintering temperatures on electrical properties are also investigated in detail.",Synthesis and electrical properties of apatite-type La10Si6O27,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.088
5,18078,"It is found, that with the increasing sintering temperature from 1300 degrees C to 1650 degrees C, the grain conductivity monotonously increases; while the grain boundary conductivity increases first and then decreases with the maximum value at 1600 degrees C. The related mechanism is also discussed.",Synthesis and electrical properties of apatite-type La10Si6O27,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.088
