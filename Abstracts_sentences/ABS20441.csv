5,20441,"As a function of both the molar ratio between carbonate anions and total metallic cations, and the adopted mixing speed, the coprecipitate can be either amorphous, owning a very good morphology, or crystalline, owning worse morphology, packing aptitude, and sinterability.",Controlled Coprecipitation of Amorphous Cerium-Based Carbonates with Suitable Morphology as Precursors of Ceramic Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs,10.3390/ma12050702
6,20441,"The amorphous powders, upon a mild calcination step, gave rise to the formation of stable solid solutions of fluorite-structured ceria maintaining the same morphology of the starting powders.",Controlled Coprecipitation of Amorphous Cerium-Based Carbonates with Suitable Morphology as Precursors of Ceramic Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs,10.3390/ma12050702
7,20441,"Such calcined powders are excellent precursors for sintering ceramic electrolytes at low temperatures and with very high electrical conductivity in the intermediate temperature range (i.e., 500-700 degrees C).",Controlled Coprecipitation of Amorphous Cerium-Based Carbonates with Suitable Morphology as Precursors of Ceramic Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs,10.3390/ma12050702
8,20441,"Therefore, irrespective of the actual composition of ceria-based systems, by providing an accurate control of both chemical conditions and physical parameters, the coprecipitation in the presence of ammonium carbonate can be considered as one of the most promising synthesis route in terms of cost/effectiveness to prepare excellent ceramic precursors for the next generation of IT-SOFC solid electrolytes.",Controlled Coprecipitation of Amorphous Cerium-Based Carbonates with Suitable Morphology as Precursors of Ceramic Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs,10.3390/ma12050702
