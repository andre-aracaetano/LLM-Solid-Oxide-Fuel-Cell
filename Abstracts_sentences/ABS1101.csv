1,1101,The mesoporous NiO-SDC was synthesized using a cationic surfactant (cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide; CTAB) for obtaining wide triple-phase boundary (TPB) in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Mesoporous NiO-Samaria Doped Ceria Fuel Cell Materials,10.1166/jnn.2009.C092
2,1101,"The microstructure of mesoporous NiO-SDC was characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, and HRTEM and the results showed that the mesoporous NiO-SDC with 6.3 nm pores could be obtained.",Mesoporous NiO-Samaria Doped Ceria Fuel Cell Materials,10.1166/jnn.2009.C092
3,1101,"After calcined at 600 degrees C, the surface area of NiO-SDC was 206 m(2)/g, which was sufficiently high for providing large TPB in SOFC anode.",Mesoporous NiO-Samaria Doped Ceria Fuel Cell Materials,10.1166/jnn.2009.C092
4,1101,"In addition, FT-IR measurements revealed that Ni(OH)(2) and SDC were incorporated with amine group of CTAB.",Mesoporous NiO-Samaria Doped Ceria Fuel Cell Materials,10.1166/jnn.2009.C092
