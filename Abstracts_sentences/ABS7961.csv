1,7961,"In this paper, the authors present the first demonstration of a liquid-tin anode solid-oxide fuel cell (LTA-SOFC) operating on pure biodiesel (B100) prepared via base-catalyzed transesterification of virgin and waste cooking oils.",Demonstration of a Liquid-Tin Anode Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC) Operating from Biodiesel Fuel,10.1021/ef9003413
2,7961,"The LTA-SOFC was able to convert the biodiesel to electricity at commercially viable power densities, i.e., greater than 100 mW cm(-2).",Demonstration of a Liquid-Tin Anode Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC) Operating from Biodiesel Fuel,10.1021/ef9003413
3,7961,"The peak power for each cell was 3.5 W over an active area of 30 cm(-2), which translates to a power density of 117 mW cm(-2) and current density of 217 mA cm(-2).",Demonstration of a Liquid-Tin Anode Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC) Operating from Biodiesel Fuel,10.1021/ef9003413
4,7961,The peak power densities correspond to similar to 80% fuel use at the liquid-tin anode surface and overall cell efficiencies of >40%.,Demonstration of a Liquid-Tin Anode Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC) Operating from Biodiesel Fuel,10.1021/ef9003413
5,7961,These findings demonstrate the flexibility in operating a solid-oxide fuel cell capable of internal reforming from a blend of petroleum- and biomass-derived diesels for greater resource flexibility.,Demonstration of a Liquid-Tin Anode Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC) Operating from Biodiesel Fuel,10.1021/ef9003413
6,7961,"Cells were operated for short times (similar to 4.5 h), owing to the experimental nature of the balance of plant.",Demonstration of a Liquid-Tin Anode Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC) Operating from Biodiesel Fuel,10.1021/ef9003413
7,7961,Results support future efforts in developing an efficient balance-of-plant system for demonstrating long-term (>1000 h) power generation from biodiesel using the LTA-SOFC design.,Demonstration of a Liquid-Tin Anode Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC) Operating from Biodiesel Fuel,10.1021/ef9003413
