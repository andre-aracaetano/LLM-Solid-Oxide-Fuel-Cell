4,3404,"The fuel cell using Tm-doped SrCeO2-delta electrolyte achieved the power output of 682 mW/cm(2) at 550 degrees C with an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.03 V, whereas the fuel cell with Sr0.1Ce0.9O2-delta electrolyte produced a power density of 515 mW/cm(2) with an OCV of 1.02 V. Doping of 10% Tm into SrCeO2-delta enables the creation of oxygen vacancies in the structure, which enables the enhancement in ionic conductivity and provides the fast transport path.",Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells based on Tm-doped SrCeO2-δ semiconductor electrolytes,10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100661

6,3404,The calculated ionic conductivity of Tm-doped SrCeO2-delta is 0.13 S/cm which is appreciably higher than that of the pure SrCeO2-delta (0.104 S/cm at 550 degrees C).,Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells based on Tm-doped SrCeO2-δ semiconductor electrolytes,10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100661
7,3404,"Moreover, the enhancement of power output can also be ascribed to band bending at the electrolyte-electrode interface, which overall decreases the inherent electronic properties of reduced ceria while increases the ionic conductivity.",Low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells based on Tm-doped SrCeO2-δ semiconductor electrolytes,10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100661
