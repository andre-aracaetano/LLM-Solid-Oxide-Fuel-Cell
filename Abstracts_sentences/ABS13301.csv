4,13301,"Two other electrodes run with sulfur-containing natural gas, one with a sulfur filter and the other without, show an XAS spectrum with a very broad peak, covering the entire Sulfur absorption range, and thus not allowing for identification of specific sulfur signatures.",Molecular speciation of sulfur in solid oxide fuel cell anodes with X-ray absorption spectroscopy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.048
5,13301,"These appear to be the first ever reported sulfur XAS data on SOFC anodes, and the XAS technique shows promise to resolve some hitherto unsolved issues on Sulfur poisoning of SOFC, particularly regarding the molecular speciation of the sulfur components.",Molecular speciation of sulfur in solid oxide fuel cell anodes with X-ray absorption spectroscopy,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.048
