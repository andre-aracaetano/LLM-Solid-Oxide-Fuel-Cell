6,15153,The single SOFC cells gave a maximum power density at 850 C of 937 mW cm(-2) with pure H-2 as a fuel.,Fe-based perovskites as electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.122
7,15153,"Sizeable power densities were also observed with alternative fuels: 694 and 499 mW cm(-2) with H-2 containing 5 parts per million of H2S and CH4, respectively, at 800 degrees C. Moreover, only a slight degradation of about 3.6% of the power density has been obtained after 65 different cycles of fuel-cell test in H-2 at 750 degrees C and 14% at 850 degrees C in 50 cycles using H-2-H2S. This remarkable behavior has been correlated to the structural features determined in a neutron powder diffraction experiment in the usual working conditions of a SOFC for a cathode (air) and an anode (low pO(2)).",Fe-based perovskites as electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.122
