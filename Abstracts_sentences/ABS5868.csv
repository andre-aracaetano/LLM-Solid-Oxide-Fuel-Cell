1,5868,In this paper strontium-site-deficient Sr2Fe2.4Co0.2Mo0.5O6-delta-based perovskite oxides (SXFCM) were prepared and evaluated as the cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Evaluation of strontium-site-deficient Sr2Fe1.4Co0.1Mo0.5O6-δ-based perovskite oxides as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.094
2,5868,All samples exhibited a cubic phase structure and the lattice shrinked with increasing the Sr-deficiency as shown in XRD patterns.,Evaluation of strontium-site-deficient Sr2Fe1.4Co0.1Mo0.5O6-δ-based perovskite oxides as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.094
3,5868,"XPS results determined that the transition elements (Co/Fe/Mo) in SXFCM oxides were in a mixed valence state, demonstrating the small polaron hopping conductivity mechanism existed.",Evaluation of strontium-site-deficient Sr2Fe1.4Co0.1Mo0.5O6-δ-based perovskite oxides as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.094
4,5868,"Among the samples, S1.950FCM presented the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of 15.62 x 10(-6) K-1, the highest conductivity value of 28 Omega cm(-1) at 500 degrees C, and the lowest interfacial polarization resistance of 0.093 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, respectively.",Evaluation of strontium-site-deficient Sr2Fe1.4Co0.1Mo0.5O6-δ-based perovskite oxides as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.094
5,5868,"Furthermore, an anode-supported single cell with a S1.950FCM cathode was prepared, demonstrating a maximum power density of 1.16 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C by using wet H-2 (3% H2O) as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant.",Evaluation of strontium-site-deficient Sr2Fe1.4Co0.1Mo0.5O6-δ-based perovskite oxides as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.094
6,5868,"These results indicate that the introduction of Sr-deficiency can dramatically improve the electrochemical performance of Sr2Fe1.4Co0.1Mo0.5O6-delta, showing great promise as a novel cathode candidate material for IT-SOFCs.",Evaluation of strontium-site-deficient Sr2Fe1.4Co0.1Mo0.5O6-δ-based perovskite oxides as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.094
