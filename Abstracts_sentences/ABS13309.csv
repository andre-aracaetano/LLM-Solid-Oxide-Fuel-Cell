1,13309,"The physical and electrochemical properties of strontium substituted cerium vandates in which a portion of the cerium cations have been substituted with transition metals (Ce0.8Sr0.1Cu0.05TM0.05VO4-0.5x, TM = Ni or Co) were investigated and their suitability for use in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes was assessed.",Polarization-Induced Hysteresis in CuCo-Doped Rare Earth Vanadates SOFC Anodes,10.1149/2.042211jes
2,13309,"Upon reduction at elevated temperature, Cu and Co or Cu and Ni were exsolved from the electronically conductive Ce1-xSrxVO4 lattice to produce Cu-Ni and Cu-Co catalytic nanoparticles.",Polarization-Induced Hysteresis in CuCo-Doped Rare Earth Vanadates SOFC Anodes,10.1149/2.042211jes
3,13309,"The Ce0.8Sr0.1Cu0.05Co0.05VO3 appears to have high activity and relatively high hydrocarbon tolerance, suggesting that intimate contact between the exsolved Cu and Co and that the majority of the Co nanoparticles must be at least partially coated with the Cu.",Polarization-Induced Hysteresis in CuCo-Doped Rare Earth Vanadates SOFC Anodes,10.1149/2.042211jes
4,13309,"The electrochemical performance when used in anodes operating on hydrogen has been characterized, and the results demonstrate the exsolution of both metals from the host lattice; but observed dynamic changes in the structure of the resulting metal nanoparticles as a function of SOFC operating conditions complicate their use in SOFC anodes.",Polarization-Induced Hysteresis in CuCo-Doped Rare Earth Vanadates SOFC Anodes,10.1149/2.042211jes
