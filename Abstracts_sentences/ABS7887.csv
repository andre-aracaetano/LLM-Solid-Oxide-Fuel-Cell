1,7887,This paper examines the important mechanical properties of commercially purchased La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 at room temperature and 800 degrees C. Sr and Mg-doped lanthanum gallates (LSGM) are strong candidates for use as solid electrolytes in lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells operating at or below 800 degrees,Mechanical behavior of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 perovskites,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.06.013

4,7887,The four point bending strength of the LSGM samples remained almost constant from 121 +/- 35 MPa at room temperature to 126 +/- 20 MPa at 800 degrees C.,Mechanical behavior of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 perovskites,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.06.013
5,7887,"The fracture toughness, as measured by the single edge V notch beam (SEVNB) method, was 1.22 +/- 0.06 MPa root m at room temperature, 1.04 +/- 0.09 MPa root m at 700 degrees C followed by a small increase 1.31 +/- 0.16 MPa root m at 800 degrees C. We also report, for the first time, the static subcritical (or slow) crack-growth (SCG) behavior of natural cracks in LSGM performed in four point bending tests at room temperature.",Mechanical behavior of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 perovskites,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.06.013
6,7887,"The exponent of a power-law representation in the SCG tests was found to be n = 15, a rather low value showing LSGM to be highly susceptible to room temperature SCG.",Mechanical behavior of La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 perovskites,10.1016/j.ceramint.2008.06.013
