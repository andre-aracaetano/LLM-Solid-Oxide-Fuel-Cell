4,8618,"The CeO2-delta reached an ionic conductivity of 0.1 S/cm and was used as the electrolyte in a fuel cell, resulting in a remarkable power output of 660 mW/cm(2) at 550 degrees C. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) clearly clarified that a surface buried layer on the order of a few nanometers was composed of Ce3+ on ceria particles to form a CeO2-delta@CeO2 core-shell heterostructure.",Fast ionic conduction in semiconductor CeO2-δ electrolyte fuel cells,10.1038/s41427-019-0152-8
