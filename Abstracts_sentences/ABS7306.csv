1,7306,The development of cathode materials with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in in-termediate temperature (IT) environments is a key factor in the commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Sc-doped Co-based perovskites as IT-SOFC cathode with high oxygen reduction reaction and CO2 tolerance,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116377
2,7306,"In this paper, the ORR activity of the cathode is improved by doping high-valent Sc3+ ions at the B-site of the Sr0.5La0.5Co0.8Cu0.2-xScxO3-delta (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04), in which Sr0.5La0.5Co0.8Cu0.18Sc0.02O3-delta (SLCCS2) shows the best electrochemical performance, and the area-specific resistance of SLCCS2 at 700 degrees C is only 0.047 omega cm2, much lower than the 0.087 omega cm2 of Sr0.5La0.5Co0.8Cu0.2O3-delta (SLCC), and the peak power density of SLCCS2 reached 1.098 W cm-2, which is 1.84 times that of SLCC (0.598 W cm-2).",Sc-doped Co-based perovskites as IT-SOFC cathode with high oxygen reduction reaction and CO2 tolerance,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116377
3,7306,"In addition, SLCCS2 effectively reduces the thermal expansion coefficient, improves thermal matching with traditional electrolytes, and overcomes the problem of insufficient long-term SOFC stability caused by the high thermal expansion coefficient of Co-based perovskite to a certain extent.",Sc-doped Co-based perovskites as IT-SOFC cathode with high oxygen reduction reaction and CO2 tolerance,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116377
