5,20628,An electrolysis current of 0.85 A cm(-2) is achieved at 750 degrees C with an applied voltage of 13 V. and no degradation as well as delamination are observed for the cell after 50 h electrolysis under voltage of 1.60 V (similar to 1.27 A cm(-2)) at 800 degrees C.,A robust high performance cobalt-free oxygen electrode La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.15Nb0.05O3-δ for reversible solid oxide electrochemical cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.088
6,20628,"The high performance of the LSFCN at both cathodic and anodic conditions may be attributed to the inherent high electrochemical activity of copper-iron based perovskites; and the incorporation of Nb5+ cations into perovskite lattice is responsible for the stability of LSFCN, which leads to the more stable crystal structure, lower thermal expansion coefficient and the reduced Sr segregation at surface.",A robust high performance cobalt-free oxygen electrode La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Cu0.15Nb0.05O3-δ for reversible solid oxide electrochemical cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.088
