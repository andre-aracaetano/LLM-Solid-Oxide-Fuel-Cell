4,757,Thin YSZ films were deposited on NiO-YSZ anode supports with the YSZ Suspensions and then heated to 1400degreesC in air.,Dip-coating thin yttria-stabilized zirconia films for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.10.026
5,757,"Dense and crack-free films were obtained with thickness in the range of 20-30 muM. La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) paste was printed on the YSZ electrolyte/anode to assemble single fuel cell and tested in the temperature range of 650-800degreesC. The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the cells reached 0.98 V and maximum power density 190 mW/cm(2) at 800degreesC, showing a reasonable performance.",Dip-coating thin yttria-stabilized zirconia films for solid oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.10.026
