4,5477,2.5 mu m shows the maximum power density of 0.36 W cm(-2) in SOFC mode and 0.42 A cm(-2) at 1.6 V in SOEC mode at 873 K. Spike potential noise which may be caused by insufficient gas diffusion in NiO-YSZ porous substrate was observed under constant current electrolysis condition in case of NiO-YSZ tube with narrow channel and the spike noise is suppressed by increasing channel size.,Controlled Pore Size of NiO-YSZ Tubular Substrate for Improved Performance of Reversible Solid Oxide Cell Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte Film,10.1149/1945-7111/ad2815
5,5477,NiO-YSZ tube with large channel size is also effective for increasing long term stability in electrolysis mode.,Controlled Pore Size of NiO-YSZ Tubular Substrate for Improved Performance of Reversible Solid Oxide Cell Using LaGaO3 Electrolyte Film,10.1149/1945-7111/ad2815
