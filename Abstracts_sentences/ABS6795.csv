1,6795,The Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) cathode was fabricated under slightly overfired condition and was in situ treated with 25% CO2(V/V) under single cell operating circumstance.,Effect of CO2 treatment on the performance of SM0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathode electrocatalyst,10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60011-X
2,6795,"XRD and TG analysis demonstrated that some SrCO3 and Co3O4, appeared on the SSC surface after CO2 treatment at 600 V. The existence of SrCoO3-delta and Co3O4 under air sweep condition resulted in the changes of physicochemical properties of cathode surface to some extent.",Effect of CO2 treatment on the performance of SM0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathode electrocatalyst,10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60011-X
3,6795,The acceleration of oxygen reduction rate of the cathode electrocatalyst evidently decreased the polarization resistance and consequently yielded about 20 % higher cell performance than the untreated one.,Effect of CO2 treatment on the performance of SM0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ cathode electrocatalyst,10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60011-X
