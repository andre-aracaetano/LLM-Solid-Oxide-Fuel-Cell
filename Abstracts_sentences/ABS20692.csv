2,20692,"(x - 0.1, 0.2) oxides have been prepared and investigated as possible solid electrolytes for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC).",Low activation energies for interstitial oxygen conduction in the layered perovskites La1+xSr1-xInO4+δ,10.1039/c5ta03185k
3,20692,These materials were synthesized using a citrate-nitrate soft-chemistry technique followed by annealing in air at a temperature of 1000 degrees C. Preliminary by X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that these layered perovskites crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with the space group Pbca.,Low activation energies for interstitial oxygen conduction in the layered perovskites La1+xSr1-xInO4+δ,10.1039/c5ta03185k
4,20692,The crystal structural features were explored at RT by neutron powder diffraction (NPD).,Low activation energies for interstitial oxygen conduction in the layered perovskites La1+xSr1-xInO4+δ,10.1039/c5ta03185k
5,20692,"Their capability to incorporate interstitial oxygen atoms (delta) and their effect on the crystal structure were identified by difference Fourier maps in the NaCl layers of the K2NiF4 structure; subsequent Rietveld refinements yielded excess oxygen values, delta = 0.07(1) and 0.11(2) for x = 0.1 and 0.2, respectively.",Low activation energies for interstitial oxygen conduction in the layered perovskites La1+xSr1-xInO4+δ,10.1039/c5ta03185k
6,20692,The electrical properties were studied by impedance spectroscopy (IS) in the temperature range of 500-900 degrees C and compared with those of the parent compound LaSrInO4.,Low activation energies for interstitial oxygen conduction in the layered perovskites La1+xSr1-xInO4+δ,10.1039/c5ta03185k
7,20692,"A better conductivity was observed for La1.2Sr0.8InO4.11, which is consistent with the higher quantity of interstitial oxygen found from NPD data.",Low activation energies for interstitial oxygen conduction in the layered perovskites La1+xSr1-xInO4+δ,10.1039/c5ta03185k
8,20692,"The extremely low activation energy of only 0.51 eV for the conduction mechanism via interstitials at low temperatures (T < 650 degrees C) is significantly smaller than that of other electrolytes working with a vacancy mechanism, typically of 1 eV, as theoretically predicted.",Low activation energies for interstitial oxygen conduction in the layered perovskites La1+xSr1-xInO4+δ,10.1039/c5ta03185k
9,20692,The present result endorses the validity of this design procedure and supports K2NiF4-related compounds as promising candidates for solid-oxide electrolytes.,Low activation energies for interstitial oxygen conduction in the layered perovskites La1+xSr1-xInO4+δ,10.1039/c5ta03185k
