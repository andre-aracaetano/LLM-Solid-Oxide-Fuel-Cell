2,12893,"Nonetheless, the development of a reliable bifunctional electrocatalyst as an electrode material for R-SOC devices presents considerable challenges.","Improved Performance of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells with Ba0.9Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1F0.1O2.9-δ Semiconductor: Synthesis, Characterization, and Performance Evaluation",10.1021/acs.iecr.4c00957
3,12893,"Hence, two semiconductors, Ba0.9Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-delta (BCFeN) and Ba0.9Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1F0.1O2.9-delta (BCFeNF) are synthesized.","Improved Performance of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells with Ba0.9Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1F0.1O2.9-δ Semiconductor: Synthesis, Characterization, and Performance Evaluation",10.1021/acs.iecr.4c00957
4,12893,"F doping causes a significant reduction in the average valence states of Co, Fe, and Nb elements, ultimately leading to a rise in the concentration of oxygen vacancies, further enhancing the oxygen migration capability of BCFeN. Furthermore, F doping enhances the catalytic performance for the oxidation of hydrogen and the reduction of oxygen.","Improved Performance of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells with Ba0.9Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1F0.1O2.9-δ Semiconductor: Synthesis, Characterization, and Performance Evaluation",10.1021/acs.iecr.4c00957
5,12893,"The rate-determining step (RDS) in hydrogen oxidation reaction on BCFeN and BCFeNF surfaces is the H-2 adsorption and dissociation process, while the RDS in oxygen reduction reaction is the reduction of adsorbed oxygen atoms to O- species.","Improved Performance of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells with Ba0.9Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1F0.1O2.9-δ Semiconductor: Synthesis, Characterization, and Performance Evaluation",10.1021/acs.iecr.4c00957
6,12893,"Remarkably, the outstanding reversible performance is exhibited by the single cell employing BCFeNF with O-2 as the oxidant and humidified H-2 (30% H2O) as the fuel.","Improved Performance of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells with Ba0.9Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1F0.1O2.9-δ Semiconductor: Synthesis, Characterization, and Performance Evaluation",10.1021/acs.iecr.4c00957
7,12893,"At 700 degrees C, when operating in solid oxide fuel cell mode, the maximum power density reaches 288.9 mW cm(-2), and the R-SOC maintains a current density of -301.6 mA cm(-2) at 1.3 V in solid oxide electrolysis cell mode.","Improved Performance of Reversible Solid Oxide Cells with Ba0.9Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1F0.1O2.9-δ Semiconductor: Synthesis, Characterization, and Performance Evaluation",10.1021/acs.iecr.4c00957
