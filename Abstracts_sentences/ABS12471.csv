5,12471,"K2CO3 achieved a maximum power density of 202, 262, and 271 mW/cm(2) at 750, 800, and 850 degrees C, respectively; the SO-CFC fueled with activated carbon fuel without a catalyst meanwhile yielded maximum power density of 168 mW/cm(2) at 850 degrees C. By using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the effect of adding the catalyst on the gasification products and subsequently on the performance of the SO-CFC was studied.",Effect of reverse Boudouard reaction catalyst on the performance of solid oxide carbon fuel cells integrated with a dry gasifier,10.1016/j.enconman.2016.10.047
6,12471,"A long-term degradation test was conducted by continuously operating the SO-CFC at 50 mA/cm(2) for 518 h at 750 degrees C. During the long-term degradation test, the average degradation rate of the SO-CFC was found to be 183 mV/kh.",Effect of reverse Boudouard reaction catalyst on the performance of solid oxide carbon fuel cells integrated with a dry gasifier,10.1016/j.enconman.2016.10.047
7,12471,"The post-mortem SEM and XRD analyses of the SO-CFC after the long-term test revealed the presence of carbon deposits and oxidation of Ni at the anode, causing a relatively higher degree of degradation in the SO-CFC integrated with the dry gasifier during the long-term operation.",Effect of reverse Boudouard reaction catalyst on the performance of solid oxide carbon fuel cells integrated with a dry gasifier,10.1016/j.enconman.2016.10.047
8,12471,"The addition of the K2CO3 based dry gasification catalyst significantly enhances the performance of the SO-CFC integrated with dry gasification, but during long-term operation, the degradation rate is found to be higher than that of conventional H-2 fueled SOFCs.",Effect of reverse Boudouard reaction catalyst on the performance of solid oxide carbon fuel cells integrated with a dry gasifier,10.1016/j.enconman.2016.10.047
