2,44,"The fuel cell using LiAlO2-carbonate (LiNaCO3) as electrolyte exhibits excellent performances, when we used hydrogen and air as fuel and oxidant respectively, instead of molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) environment.",Novel ceramic fuel cell using non-ceria-based composites as electrolyte,10.1016/j.elecom.2007.10.010
3,44,The maximum output power density can reach 466 mW/cm(2) at 650 degrees C and the discharging current keeps constant.,Novel ceramic fuel cell using non-ceria-based composites as electrolyte,10.1016/j.elecom.2007.10.010
4,44,The ion transport mechanics of the ceramic fuel cell were discussed.,Novel ceramic fuel cell using non-ceria-based composites as electrolyte,10.1016/j.elecom.2007.10.010
5,44,"In the H-2/air atmosphere, the new fuel cell function should be performed only by proton or oxygen ion conduction, which differs essentially from the MCFC function, in which the CO32- conduction dominates process.",Novel ceramic fuel cell using non-ceria-based composites as electrolyte,10.1016/j.elecom.2007.10.010
