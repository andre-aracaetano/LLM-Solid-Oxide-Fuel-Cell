4,3975,"The coatings were evaluated on multiple criteria; including phase stability, microstructural stability, con-ductivity, Cr gettering ability, ability to act as a diffusion barrier to outward chromium and inward oxygen diffusion, and the ability to limit the increase in the area specific resistance (ASR) during high temperature oxidation exposures.",Comparison of Cu-Mn and Mn-Co spinel coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.08.239
5,3975,"The results showed that, while different coatings have best individual characteristics, overall CuNi0.2Mn1.8O4 was the best candidate for the coatings operating in the intermediate temperature range due to its best sinterability, highest conductivity, lowest ASR, phase stability over the operational tem-perature range, lower cost and good resistance to outward chromium and inward oxygen diffusion.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.",Comparison of Cu-Mn and Mn-Co spinel coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.08.239
