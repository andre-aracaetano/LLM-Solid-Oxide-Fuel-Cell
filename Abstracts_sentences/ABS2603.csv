5,2603,"The gasifier and fuel cell stack were the most significant components of exergy destruction in this system, accounting for 41.0% and 15.1%, respectively, which were primarily caused by the gasification and electrochemical reactions' irreversibility.","Thermodynamic Analysis of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power System Integrated with Biomass Gasification",10.3390/e23081029
6,2603,"The influences of the key parameters of the ratio of steam to biomass mass flow rate (S/B), the biomass flow rate (M-bio), and the temperature and pressure of the fuel cell (T-op and P-sofc) on system energy performances were analyzed: doubling S/B (from 0.5 to 1.0) reduced the energy efficiency by 5.3%, while increasing the electrical efficiency by 4.6% (from 52.6% to 55.0%) and raising the biomass mass flow rate by 40% increased the energy and exergy efficiencies by 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively.","Thermodynamic Analysis of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power System Integrated with Biomass Gasification",10.3390/e23081029
7,2603,"When raising the SOFC operating temperature by 31.3%, the energy and exergy efficiencies rose by 61.2% (from 50.0% to 80.6%) and 45.1% (from 32.8% to 47.6%), respectively, but this likely would result in a higher operating cost.","Thermodynamic Analysis of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power System Integrated with Biomass Gasification",10.3390/e23081029
8,2603,"Increasing the SOFC pressure from 2 to 7 bar increased the electrical efficiency by 10.6%, but additional energy for pumping and compression was consumed.","Thermodynamic Analysis of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power System Integrated with Biomass Gasification",10.3390/e23081029
