2,11516,"The optimization of dispersant and solid concentration in anode slurries provides a reduction in their viscosity, shear stress and yield stress; concurrently, solvent evaporation and hysteresis in flow behaviour are minimized, thus improving the suspension stability.",Influence of processing conditions on the microstructure of NiO-YSZ supporting anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.168
3,11516,The corresponding sintered compacts produced from the optimized slurry demonstrated uniform microstructure with specific porosity distribution.,Influence of processing conditions on the microstructure of NiO-YSZ supporting anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.168
4,11516,"It is shown that the residual porosity can be tailored in the range of 12-23% exclusively by controlling the conditions of drying, burn-out and sintering process; the lower limit allows effective gas permeation during anode reduction owing to an interconnected pore structure obtained already at 12-14% porosity.",Influence of processing conditions on the microstructure of NiO-YSZ supporting anode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.168
5,11516,This indicates a stable pore structure derived from the burn-out of pore former even for sintering temperature as high as 1400 degrees C.
