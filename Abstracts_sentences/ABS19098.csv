1,19098,The effect of the Cr poisoning on the electrochemical properties of NdBaCo2O5+delta cathode for IT-SOFCs was investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the cathodic polarization analysis.,Effect of chromium poisoning on the electrochemical properties of NdBaCo2O5+δ cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.023
2,19098,"With the Cr poisoning, the area-specific resistances (ASRs) increased at 500-600 degrees C and did not increase with the increasing temperature.",Effect of chromium poisoning on the electrochemical properties of NdBaCo2O5+δ cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.023
3,19098,"The Cr poisoning made a negative effect on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) below 600 degrees C. Besides, the Cr poisoning decreased the exchange current density i(o).",Effect of chromium poisoning on the electrochemical properties of NdBaCo2O5+δ cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.023
4,19098,"The activation energies of io were higher than those of the ASRs, indicating that the charge transfer process was the rate-determining step for the ORR.",Effect of chromium poisoning on the electrochemical properties of NdBaCo2O5+δ cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.023
5,19098,"With or without the Cr poisoning, the polarization curves were independent of the on the sweep rate, indicating that there were no mass transport limitations on the ORR rate.",Effect of chromium poisoning on the electrochemical properties of NdBaCo2O5+δ cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.023
6,19098,"Hence, the Cr poisoning deteriorated the charge transfer process of the ORR for NdBaCo2O5+delta and decreased the ORR activity.",Effect of chromium poisoning on the electrochemical properties of NdBaCo2O5+δ cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.023
