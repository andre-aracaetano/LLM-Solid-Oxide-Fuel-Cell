1,13924,"Solid Oxide Cells (SOCs) have gained an increasing interest as electrochemical energy converters due to their high efficiency, fuel flexibility and ability of reversible fuel cell/electrolysis operation.",Testing of solid oxide cells at high current densities,10.1515/teme-2021-0102
2,13924,"During the development process as well as in quality assurance tests, the performance of single cells and cell stacks is commonly evaluated by means of current/voltage- (CV-) characteristics.",Testing of solid oxide cells at high current densities,10.1515/teme-2021-0102
3,13924,"Despite of the fact that the measurement of a CV-characteristic seems to be simple compared to more complex, dynamic methods as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or current interrupt techniques, the resulting performance strongly depends on the test setup and the chosen operating conditions.",Testing of solid oxide cells at high current densities,10.1515/teme-2021-0102
4,13924,"In this paper, the impact of different single cell testing environments and operating conditions on the CV-characteristic of high performance cells is discussed.",Testing of solid oxide cells at high current densities,10.1515/teme-2021-0102
5,13924,"The influence of cell size, contacting and current collection, contact pressure, fuel flow rate and composition on the achievable cell performance is presented and limitations arising from the test bed and testing conditions will be pointed out.",Testing of solid oxide cells at high current densities,10.1515/teme-2021-0102
6,13924,As today's high performance cells are capable of delivering current densities of several ampere per cm(2) a special emphasis will be laid on single cell testing in this current range.,Testing of solid oxide cells at high current densities,10.1515/teme-2021-0102
