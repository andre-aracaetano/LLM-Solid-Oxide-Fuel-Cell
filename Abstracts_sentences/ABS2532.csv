1,2532,Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) with Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode have been fabricated and studied using H-2-CO syngas fuels.,Assessment of the performance of Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes in anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells operating on H2-CO syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.016
2,2532,"Syngas fuels with different compositions of H-2-CO are supplied and the cell performance is measured at 750 degrees C. A high CO content has caused carbon deposition and crack formation in the Ni-YSZ anode after long-term operation, even though it is diluted with H2O and N-2.",Assessment of the performance of Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes in anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells operating on H2-CO syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.016
3,2532,"However, it was found that a Cu-CeO2 coating on Ni-YSZ can greatly improve the anode stability in syngas by facilitating the water gas shift reaction.",Assessment of the performance of Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes in anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells operating on H2-CO syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.016
4,2532,The optimized single cell has run in sygas with a composition of 65%H-2-32%CO-3%H2O for 1050h without obvious degradation of its performance.,Assessment of the performance of Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anodes in anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells operating on H2-CO syngas fuels,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.04.016
