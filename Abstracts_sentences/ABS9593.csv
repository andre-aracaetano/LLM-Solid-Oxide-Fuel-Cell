1,9593,Here we report the use of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-delta/carbon nanotube (LNF/CNT) hybrids as novel and robust anode catalysts that are in situ fabricated by exposure of nano-scale LNF perovskite oxide catalysts to slightly humidified methane.,In situ formation of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-δ-carbon nanotube hybrids as anodes for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.035
2,9593,TEM observations confirm the formation of CNTs with the inner diameter and the wall thickness both at approximate to 15 nm.,In situ formation of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-δ-carbon nanotube hybrids as anodes for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.035
3,9593,"Combined XRD and EDX analyses show that LNF oxides decompose into a mixture of La2O3, FeNi3 alloy and LaFeO3, where FeNi3 alloy particles have an average diameter of 45 nm, largely exist outside of these CNTs and are surrounded by nano-scale La2O3 and LaFeO3 oxides.",In situ formation of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-δ-carbon nanotube hybrids as anodes for direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.035
