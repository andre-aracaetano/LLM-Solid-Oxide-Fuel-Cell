1,6219,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anode of 1 cm(2) area was set up with a porous disk of gadolinia-doped ceria-impregnated FeCr as a gas diffusion layer (GDL) under direct-methane feeding.,"Effect of methane concentration on reaction behavior in direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells with (Ce,Gd)O2-x-impregnated FeCr layer for fuel processing",10.1016/j.cej.2009.07.008
2,6219,"In this setup of SOFC plus GDL, the tests at 800 degrees C and ambient pressure show that the current density, the methane conversion rate, the product formation rates, and the CO2 selectivity increased with increasing methane concentration.","Effect of methane concentration on reaction behavior in direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells with (Ce,Gd)O2-x-impregnated FeCr layer for fuel processing",10.1016/j.cej.2009.07.008
