2,628,"Especially high temperature fuel cells are suited for this task because of their higher tolerance to impurities, their internal steam reforming potential, and favorable thermal integration possibilities.",Biosyngas utilization in solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/GDC anodes,10.1115/1.2349535
3,628,This paper presents the results of biosyngas utilization in solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/GDC anodes at 850 and 920 degrees C.,Biosyngas utilization in solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/GDC anodes,10.1115/1.2349535
4,628,"The relation between the fuel composition and the electrochemical performance is discussed, as well as the impact of sulfur up to a concentration of 9 ppm H2S. The investigations have made clear that Ni/GDC anodes can be operated within a wide range of biosyngas compositions.",Biosyngas utilization in solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/GDC anodes,10.1115/1.2349535
5,628,Sulfur has appeared to deactivate the anode for methane reforming.,Biosyngas utilization in solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/GDC anodes,10.1115/1.2349535
6,628,The oxidation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are insensitive to sulfur suggesting that both nickel and GDC are active electrocatalysts.,Biosyngas utilization in solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/GDC anodes,10.1115/1.2349535
