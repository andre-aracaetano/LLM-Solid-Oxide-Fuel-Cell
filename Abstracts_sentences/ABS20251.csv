1,20251,The redox behavior of terbium and praseodymium doped yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is studied.,Probing High Oxygen Activity in YSZ Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac60f2
2,20251,The aim is to identify spectroscopic probes and a suitable experimental procedure to monitor the oxygen activity in YSZ electrolytes in solid oxide cells with spatial resolution and at operation conditions (e.g. at high temperatures).,Probing High Oxygen Activity in YSZ Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac60f2
3,20251,Sintered ceramics and crystals with 0.3 to 10 at% content of Pr or Tb ions in YSZ were prepared.,Probing High Oxygen Activity in YSZ Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac60f2
4,20251,"Upon equilibration in atmospheres from 10-20 to 100 bar PO2 around 800 degrees C, the majority of these rare earth ions are in the 3 + oxidation state.",Probing High Oxygen Activity in YSZ Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac60f2
5,20251,"At oxygen pressures above 0.001 bar, the small proportion of Tb4+ and Pr4+ formed give rise to intense optical absorption around 300-500 nm and to decreased reflectance.",Probing High Oxygen Activity in YSZ Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac60f2
6,20251,"From the reflectance measurements it is shown that the Tb4+ concentration increases as PO2 1/4, as correspond to the trapping of the holes generated upon the oxygen incorporation as Tb4+.",Probing High Oxygen Activity in YSZ Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac60f2
7,20251,This competitive absorption causes a decrease of the Tb3+ luminescence.,Probing High Oxygen Activity in YSZ Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac60f2
8,20251,"A quantitative relationship of the Tb3+ luminescence intensity with PO2 at 800 degrees C has been found, which is compatible with the trapping model.",Probing High Oxygen Activity in YSZ Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac60f2
9,20251,The spatial resolution of the experimental procedure could be very roughly estimated of the order of 100 mu m.,Probing High Oxygen Activity in YSZ Electrolyte,10.1149/1945-7111/ac60f2
