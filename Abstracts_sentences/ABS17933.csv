1,17933,Nickel particles supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) play a significant role in the performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Ni Deposition on Yttria-Stabilized ZrO2(111) Surfaces: A Density Functional Theory Study,10.1021/jp512594j
2,17933,We have investigated both pristine and doped ZrO2 surfaces using spin polarized density functional theory (DFT) and also considering long-range dispersion forces.,Ni Deposition on Yttria-Stabilized ZrO2(111) Surfaces: A Density Functional Theory Study,10.1021/jp512594j
3,17933,"We have systematically studied Ni deposition on the bare ZrO2(111) surface and on surfaces with two Concentrations of Y, all at both high and low oxygen chemical potential.",Ni Deposition on Yttria-Stabilized ZrO2(111) Surfaces: A Density Functional Theory Study,10.1021/jp512594j
4,17933,"Among the several independent sites explored, the Ni adsorption preference is as follows: YSZ(111) without oxygen vacancy > YSZ(111) with oxygen vacancy > stoichiometric ZrO2(111).",Ni Deposition on Yttria-Stabilized ZrO2(111) Surfaces: A Density Functional Theory Study,10.1021/jp512594j
5,17933,"For each surface, the adsorption site is similar: over the top oxygen.",Ni Deposition on Yttria-Stabilized ZrO2(111) Surfaces: A Density Functional Theory Study,10.1021/jp512594j
6,17933,The evaluation of the geometric and electronic structure shows a mixing of Ni orbitals with surface atom orbitals.,Ni Deposition on Yttria-Stabilized ZrO2(111) Surfaces: A Density Functional Theory Study,10.1021/jp512594j
7,17933,"We have also investigated the influence of the yttrium atom on the Ni adsorption by considering up to 52 different configurations, which showed that Ni tends to adsorb away from the yttrium atom for any YSZ(111) surface, leading to a mixed electronic structure with enhanced charge transfer.",Ni Deposition on Yttria-Stabilized ZrO2(111) Surfaces: A Density Functional Theory Study,10.1021/jp512594j
