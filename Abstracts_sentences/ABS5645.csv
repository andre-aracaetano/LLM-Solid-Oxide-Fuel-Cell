1,5645,"The direct electrochemical oxidation of coal gas was studied by pyrolyzing a sample of Ohio 45 coal in flowing Ar at 700, 800, 900, and 950 degrees C and transporting the resulting gaseous products to a Cu (Copper) anode solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operated at 950 degrees C. Pyrolysis of coal at 700 degrees C produced a H-2-rich Coal gas containing 89% H-2, 4% CO, 6% CH4, 1% CO2, and sulfur compounds (i.e. 1% COS and 1% SO2), which yielded a maximum current density of 320 mA/cm(2) at 0.5 V.",Performance and Byproduct Analysis of Coal Gas Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ef9009636
2,5645,"Raising the pyrolysis temperature from 700 to 950 degrees C increased the CO concentration in the coal gas (i.e., 42 vol % CO), which lit turn reduced the fuel cell maximum current density.",Performance and Byproduct Analysis of Coal Gas Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ef9009636
3,5645,No sulfur compounds were present in the coal gas produced at temperatures higher than 700 degrees C. Coal gas fuel operation did not degrade the fuel cell performance.,Performance and Byproduct Analysis of Coal Gas Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/ef9009636
