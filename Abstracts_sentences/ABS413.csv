1,413,The Rolls-Royce integrated-planar solid oxide fuel cell (IP-SOFC) consists of ceramic modules with electrochemical cells printed on the outer surfaces.,Diffusion and chemical reaction in the porous structures of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2211637
2,413,The cathodes are supplied with oxygen from air flowing over the outside of the module and the anodes are supplied with fuel diffusing from the internal gas channels.,Diffusion and chemical reaction in the porous structures of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2211637
3,413,Natural gas is reformed into hydrogen in a separate reformer module of similar design except that the fuel cells are replaced by a reforming catalyst layer The performance of the modules is intrinsically linked to the behavior of the gas flows within their porous structures.,Diffusion and chemical reaction in the porous structures of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1115/1.2211637
