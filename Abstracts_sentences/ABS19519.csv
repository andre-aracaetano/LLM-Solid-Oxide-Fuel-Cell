3,19519,"Using nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, we show that a Cl-rich channel with Br-rich end points configuration leads to low vacancy migration barriers in the LEAP structure.",Rational Composition Optimization of the Lithium-Rich Li3OCl1-xBrx Anti-Perovskite Superionic Conductors,10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00988
4,19519,"By incorporating the halide-environment-dependent NEB barriers in a bond percolation model, we predict that there are potentially higher conductivity Li3OCl1-xBrx structures near 0.235 <= x <= 0.395.",Rational Composition Optimization of the Lithium-Rich Li3OCl1-xBrx Anti-Perovskite Superionic Conductors,10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00988
5,19519,"This prediction is confirmed by AIMD simulation that finds Li3OCl0.75Br0.25 to have a higher Li+ conductivity than Li3OCl0.5Br0.5, the highest conductivity LRAP identified experimentally thus far.",Rational Composition Optimization of the Lithium-Rich Li3OCl1-xBrx Anti-Perovskite Superionic Conductors,10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00988
6,19519,These results highlight that there is scope for further enhancing the conductivity in the LRAP chemistry.,Rational Composition Optimization of the Lithium-Rich Li3OCl1-xBrx Anti-Perovskite Superionic Conductors,10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b00988
