1,4256,"We report that the long-term stability of a conventional mixed oxide-ion and electron conducting solid oxide fuel cell cathode, La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (LSCF-GDC) composite, can be markedly improved by functionalizing its surfaces with a conformal layer of nanoscale ZrO2 films through atomic layer deposition (ALD).",Atomic Layer Deposition Functionalized Composite SOFC Cathode La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ -Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9: Enhanced Long-Term Stability,10.1021/cm402879r
2,4256,"Over a >1100 h testing at 800 degrees C, the overcoated LSCF-GDC cathode exhibited respective polarization and ohmic area-specific-resistances 3 and 1.5 times lower than the pristine sample, whereas the pristine LSCF-GDC cathode degraded at a rate 4 times faster than the overcoated one.",Atomic Layer Deposition Functionalized Composite SOFC Cathode La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ -Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9: Enhanced Long-Term Stability,10.1021/cm402879r
3,4256,"The multifunctionality of porosity, mixed conductivity, and suppressed Sr-enrichment enabled by the nanoscaled ALD-ZrO2 overcoats are attributed to the performance retention observed for the overcoated cathode.",Atomic Layer Deposition Functionalized Composite SOFC Cathode La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-δ -Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9: Enhanced Long-Term Stability,10.1021/cm402879r
