1,5325,The nickel/yttrium-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been operated under various simulated syngases at different temperatures to investigate the degradation behavior of the cells caused by carbon deposition.,Evaluation of carbon deposition behavior on the nickel/yttrium-stabilized zirconia anode-supported fuel cell fueled with simulated syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.095
2,5325,The results show that the carbon morphology and the cell performance degradation are influenced significantly by the operation temperature.,Evaluation of carbon deposition behavior on the nickel/yttrium-stabilized zirconia anode-supported fuel cell fueled with simulated syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.095
3,5325,"The stability of the cell fueled with syngas can be improved by applying a constant current, but the cell degraded quickly after carbon deposition.",Evaluation of carbon deposition behavior on the nickel/yttrium-stabilized zirconia anode-supported fuel cell fueled with simulated syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.095
4,5325,"The microstructure damage is close to the anode surface and leads to a conductivity decrease, which is an important reason for the cell degradation and failure at 750 degrees C. Conversely, the degradation behavior at 650 degrees C is mainly due to solid carbon deposits inside of the anode that impede fuel diffusion and electrochemical reactions on the anodic side.",Evaluation of carbon deposition behavior on the nickel/yttrium-stabilized zirconia anode-supported fuel cell fueled with simulated syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.095
5,5325,The effect of carbon deposition on the microstructure degradation is also investigated using transmission electron microscope.,Evaluation of carbon deposition behavior on the nickel/yttrium-stabilized zirconia anode-supported fuel cell fueled with simulated syngas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.095
