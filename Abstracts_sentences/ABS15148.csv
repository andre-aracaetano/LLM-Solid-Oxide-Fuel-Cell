1,15148,Dimethyl ether (DME)-oxygen mixture as the fuel of an anode-supported SOFC with a conventional nickel-cermet anode for operating at reduced temperatures is systematically investigated.,Reducing the operation temperature of a solid oxide fuel cell using a conventional nickel-based cermet anode on dimethyl ether fuel through internal partial oxidation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.04.056
2,15148,"The results of the catalytic tests indicate that sintered Ni-YSZ has high activity for DME partial oxidation, and DME conversion exceeds 90% at temperatures higher than 700 degrees C. Maximum methane selectivity is reached at 700 degrees C. Cell performance is observed between 600 and 800 degrees C. Peak power densities of approximately 400 and 1400 mW cm(-2) at 600 and 800 degrees C, respectively, are reached for the cell operating on DME-O-2 mixture.",Reducing the operation temperature of a solid oxide fuel cell using a conventional nickel-based cermet anode on dimethyl ether fuel through internal partial oxidation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.04.056
3,15148,"These values are comparable to those obtained using hydrogen as a fuel, and cell performance is reasonably stable at 700 degrees C for a test period of 340 min. SEM results demonstrate that the cell maintains good geometric integrity without any delimitation of respective layer after the stability test, and EDX results show that carbon deposition occurrs only at the outer surface of the anode.",Reducing the operation temperature of a solid oxide fuel cell using a conventional nickel-based cermet anode on dimethyl ether fuel through internal partial oxidation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.04.056
4,15148,O-2-TPO analysis shows that carbon deposition over the Ni-YSZ operating on DME is greatly suppressed in the presence of oxygen.,Reducing the operation temperature of a solid oxide fuel cell using a conventional nickel-based cermet anode on dimethyl ether fuel through internal partial oxidation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.04.056
