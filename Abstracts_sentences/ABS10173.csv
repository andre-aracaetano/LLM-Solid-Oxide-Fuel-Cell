1,10173,An analytical model is developed to study fuel type effect on polarizations and performance of SOFC.,Analytical modeling of polarizations in a solid oxide fuel cell using biomass syngas product as fuel,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2006.10.011
2,10173,We consider especially two types of fuel: pure hydrogen and syngas (mixture of H-2 and CO) produced by biomass gasification.,Analytical modeling of polarizations in a solid oxide fuel cell using biomass syngas product as fuel,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2006.10.011
3,10173,The proposed model is based on simultaneous direct oxidation of H-2 and CO at the anode side and uses the dusty-gas model with appropriate diffusion coefficient (binary or mixture coefficient in porous material) to evaluate the concentration polarization and the Butler-Volmer equation to calculate the activation polarization when ohmic polarization is expressed by the well known Ohm's law.,Analytical modeling of polarizations in a solid oxide fuel cell using biomass syngas product as fuel,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2006.10.011
4,10173,Results analysis show that a fraction of CO of about 24% in syngas improves the performance of SOFC by 23% compared to that obtained by pure H-2.,Analytical modeling of polarizations in a solid oxide fuel cell using biomass syngas product as fuel,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2006.10.011
