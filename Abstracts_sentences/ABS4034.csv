1,4034,Anode-supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are manufactured by aqueous electrophoretic deposition (EPD).,Anode morphology and performance of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.069
2,4034,"The process of these micro-tubular SOFCs includes consecutive aqueous EPDs of a porous anode layer (8YSZ-NiO), a dense electrolyte layer (8YSZ), and a porous cathode layer (LSM) onto a thin wire electrode, followed by stripping, drying, and a single-step co-sintering.",Anode morphology and performance of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.069
3,4034,"The microstructure of the micro-tubular SOFCs, including the thickness and porosity of each layer, is controlled by the processing parameters such as solid loading, current density, deposition time, and sintering temperature.",Anode morphology and performance of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.069
4,4034,"In particular, the effects of the morphology of the anode layer on the electrochemical performance of such micro-tubular SOFCs are investigated and discussed based on the microstructural and voltage current power analyses.",Anode morphology and performance of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells made by aqueous electrophoretic deposition,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.069
