1,947,"Because noble metal catalysts (e. g. Pt) are one of the main contributors to low-temperature (<500 degrees C) fuel cell costs, significant efforts have been made to lower the noble metal loading in constructing fuel cell electrodes.",Ultra-thin platinum catalytic electrodes fabricated by atomic layer deposition,10.1039/c3cp50996f
2,947,"In this work, ultra-thin (similar to 10 nm) platinum (Pt) cathode/catalyst layers were patterned by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and tested as catalytic electrodes (cathode) for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.",Ultra-thin platinum catalytic electrodes fabricated by atomic layer deposition,10.1039/c3cp50996f
3,947,"We found that 180 cycles or approximately 10 nm of ALD Pt, with a Pt loading of only 0.02 mg cm(-2), were sufficient for the purpose of a catalytic cathode.",Ultra-thin platinum catalytic electrodes fabricated by atomic layer deposition,10.1039/c3cp50996f
4,947,"Furthermore, this ALD Pt resulted in fuel cell performance comparable to that achieved by 80 nm-thick sputtered Pt.",Ultra-thin platinum catalytic electrodes fabricated by atomic layer deposition,10.1039/c3cp50996f
5,947,"Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations revealed the optimized number of ALD cycles of Pt for the catalytic electrode, which renders both contiguity and high triple-phase boundary (TPB) density.",Ultra-thin platinum catalytic electrodes fabricated by atomic layer deposition,10.1039/c3cp50996f
6,947,"This result suggests the ability to significantly reduce Pt loading, thereby reducing the cost, and furthermore, can be easily applied to high performance fuel cells with complex 3-D structures.",Ultra-thin platinum catalytic electrodes fabricated by atomic layer deposition,10.1039/c3cp50996f
