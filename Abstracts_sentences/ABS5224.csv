2,5224,"Typically, applying general wet chemical coating processes and heat treatment at low temperature is desirable for fabricating metal supported solid oxide fuel cells when considering manufacturing productivity and efficiency.","Evaluation of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs) fabricated at low temperature (∼1,000 °C) using wet chemical coating processes and a catalyst wet impregnation method",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.027
3,5224,"However, in the case of conventional anodes, a well-organized structure for high performance is rarely formed by sintering at low temperatures when using general fabrication processes.","Evaluation of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs) fabricated at low temperature (∼1,000 °C) using wet chemical coating processes and a catalyst wet impregnation method",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.027
4,5224,"For this reason, a catalyst-impregnated anode is designed and applied to overcome the above issue.","Evaluation of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs) fabricated at low temperature (∼1,000 °C) using wet chemical coating processes and a catalyst wet impregnation method",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.027
5,5224,"First, to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the designed anode, the area-specific resistances of half-cells are investigated.","Evaluation of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs) fabricated at low temperature (∼1,000 °C) using wet chemical coating processes and a catalyst wet impregnation method",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.027
6,5224,"Then, the newly designed anode is applied to a single cell, and microstructural analysis and electrochemical performance measurements are performed.","Evaluation of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs) fabricated at low temperature (∼1,000 °C) using wet chemical coating processes and a catalyst wet impregnation method",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.027
7,5224,"These results confirm that the catalysts are well distributed, that the electrolyte is fully dense and that the electrochemical performances are reasonable.","Evaluation of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs) fabricated at low temperature (∼1,000 °C) using wet chemical coating processes and a catalyst wet impregnation method",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.027
8,5224,"Additionally, the high durability is also verified through a long-term test over 1000 h. Finally, the metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a catalyst impregnated anode fabricated at low temperature is completely validated through the evaluation of a large-size single cell.","Evaluation of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs) fabricated at low temperature (∼1,000 °C) using wet chemical coating processes and a catalyst wet impregnation method",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.027
