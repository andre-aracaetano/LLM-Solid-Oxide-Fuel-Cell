5,8099,"The reaction mechanism is explored by it comparative study with a conventional fixed-bed reactor, suggesting a direct CH4 partial oxidation route below 800 degrees C and obvious CO2 and steam reforming activities above 850 degrees C.",Catalytic Partial Oxidation of Methane over Perovskite La4Sr8Ti12O38-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Anode Material in an Oxygen-Permeable Membrane Reactor,10.1021/ef900995t
6,8099,"The reaction pathway would involve lattice oxygen species and a surface formaldehyde intermediate, which could explain the difference in the reactivity for both reactors, The possible application of this reaction in the membrane reactor was discussed with respect to the syngas production and characterization oil the catalytic behavior of SOFC mode material for the direct methane fuel cell by simulating a SOFC anode operating environment.",Catalytic Partial Oxidation of Methane over Perovskite La4Sr8Ti12O38-δ Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Anode Material in an Oxygen-Permeable Membrane Reactor,10.1021/ef900995t
