1,5037,The strongly correlated perovskites RNiO3 (R = rare earth) have been featured of appreciable ionic conduction and catalytic activity in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in recent years.,Catalytic membrane with high ion-electron conduction made of strongly correlated perovskite LaNiO3 and Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ for fuel cells,10.1016/j.jcat.2020.04.004
2,5037,"In this study, to tap more potentials of RNiO3, we promote a typical member from this material family, LaNiO3 (LNO) for SOFC electrolyte membrane use in a form of composite with Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta d (SDC) by taking advantage of their ionconducting and catalytic capabilities.",Catalytic membrane with high ion-electron conduction made of strongly correlated perovskite LaNiO3 and Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ for fuel cells,10.1016/j.jcat.2020.04.004
3,5037,"The developed composite materials are found to be competent electrolyte membranes possessing improved ionic conductivities along with good auxiliary catalytic effect to the cell electrode reaction, realizing good fuel cell power outputs of 268-688 mW cm(-2) and high OCV above 1.0 V at 530 degrees C. Comparative study reveals that the 5LNO-5SDC composite gains the highest ionic conductivity (0.203 S cm(-1) at 530 degrees C) and results in the lowest electrode polarization resistance (0.2973 Omega cm(2) at 530 degrees C).",Catalytic membrane with high ion-electron conduction made of strongly correlated perovskite LaNiO3 and Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ for fuel cells,10.1016/j.jcat.2020.04.004
