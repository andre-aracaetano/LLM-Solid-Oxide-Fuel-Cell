4,3492,"It reveals that the RE LNCS possesses a comparable ionic and an electronic conductivities, 0.11 S cm(-1) and 0.20 S cm(-1) at 550 degrees C, respectively.",Rare-earth oxide Li0.3Ni0.9Cu0.07Sr0.03O2-δ composites for advanced fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.025
5,3492,"An excellent power output of 1180 mW cm(-2) has been achieved at 550 degrees C, which is much better than that of the conventional anode/electrolyte/cathode based SOFCs, only around 360 mW cm(-2) by using ionic conducting rare-earth material as the electrolyte.",Rare-earth oxide Li0.3Ni0.9Cu0.07Sr0.03O2-δ composites for advanced fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.025
6,3492,Engineering large size cells with active area of 25 cm(2) prepared by tape-casting and hot-pressing gave a power output up to 12 W. This work develops a new functional single layer composite material for EFFCs and further explores the device functions.,Rare-earth oxide Li0.3Ni0.9Cu0.07Sr0.03O2-δ composites for advanced fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.025
