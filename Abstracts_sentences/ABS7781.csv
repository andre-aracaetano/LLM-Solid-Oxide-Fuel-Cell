1,7781,"In present paper, effect of holding time at 600 & DEG;C during the brazing cooling process on creep life of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with bonded compliant seal (BCS) is investigated by the finite element method.",Effect of holding time in brazing cooling process on creep life of the solid oxide fuel cell with bonded compliant seal,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.051
2,7781,The research indicates that creep crack initiation time in BCS structure increases significantly with the holding time increasing.,Effect of holding time in brazing cooling process on creep life of the solid oxide fuel cell with bonded compliant seal,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.051
3,7781,"Compared with that the traditional cooling method during the brazing process, the creep crack initiation time can be prolonged more than twice by the holding time of 150 h with the operating temperature of 600 & DEG;C, it increases from 14,949 h to 31,911 h. When the operating temperature is 800 & DEG;C, the creep crack initiation time of SOFC can hardly be affected if the holding time exceeds 10 h. Based on the creep damage analysis and considering the cost of the SOFC manufacturing process, it is recommended that the holding time should not be exceeded 300 h if the operating temperature is below 750 & DEG;C.",Effect of holding time in brazing cooling process on creep life of the solid oxide fuel cell with bonded compliant seal,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.051
4,7781,"And when the operating temperature is 800 & DEG;C, the recommended holding time should not be longer than 10 h. The research of the present paper can provide theoretical guidance for the long life manufacturing and reliability operation of SOFC.& COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.",Effect of holding time in brazing cooling process on creep life of the solid oxide fuel cell with bonded compliant seal,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.051
