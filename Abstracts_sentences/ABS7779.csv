2,7779,"Cathode- supported cells with ceria- infiltrated Ni - YSZ anode delivered power density of 220 - 240 mW cm(-2), at 0.6 V, under an applied current of 0.4 A cm(-2), when operating on humidified H-2 fuel containing 40 ppm H2S, at 973 K, for 500 h. In contrast, the power density of a cell with traditional Ni - YSZ anode dropped to near 0 mW cm(-2), in similar to 13 min, when similarly exposed.",Ceria nanocoating for sulfur tolerant Ni-based anodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2748630
3,7779,The results indicate that ceria nanoparticle infiltration can effectively increase the sulfur tolerance of conventional Ni - YSZ anodes.,Ceria nanocoating for sulfur tolerant Ni-based anodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2748630
