1,9280,"Nano-composite powders consisting of Sr-doped SmCoO3 (SSC) and Sm-doped CeO2 (SDC) were synthesized by spray pyrolysis using different cation concentration solutions, and the effect of this cation concentration on the electrochemical performance of electrodes fabricated using the powders was investigated.",Effect of starting solution concentration in spray pyrolysis on powder properties and electrochemical electrode performance,10.1016/j.apt.2016.05.002
2,9280,"Regardless of the cation concentration, spherical particles consisting of nano-order fine SSC and SDC crystallites were successfully obtained.",Effect of starting solution concentration in spray pyrolysis on powder properties and electrochemical electrode performance,10.1016/j.apt.2016.05.002
3,9280,"Although the crystal size of all the synthesized powders was almost the same, the particle size increased with increasing cation concentration.",Effect of starting solution concentration in spray pyrolysis on powder properties and electrochemical electrode performance,10.1016/j.apt.2016.05.002
4,9280,The microstructure of the cathodes fabricated using the nano-composite powders clearly depended on the particle size of the starting powders; the microstructure became coarser with increasing particle size and the original particle shapes partially remained in the cathode network.,Effect of starting solution concentration in spray pyrolysis on powder properties and electrochemical electrode performance,10.1016/j.apt.2016.05.002
5,9280,"Also, electrochemical measurements for solid oxide fuel cells with these cathodes revealed that the electrode performance was related to the microstructure.",Effect of starting solution concentration in spray pyrolysis on powder properties and electrochemical electrode performance,10.1016/j.apt.2016.05.002
6,9280,"The electrode polarization resistance decreased with decreasing particle size, and a relatively fine microstructure cathode exhibited lower electrode polarization resistance, resulting in a high performance of 1.52 W cm (2) at 700 degrees C. These results indicate that controlling the particle size, as well as controlling the nanostructure within the particles, is crucial to attain high performance electrodes.",Effect of starting solution concentration in spray pyrolysis on powder properties and electrochemical electrode performance,10.1016/j.apt.2016.05.002
