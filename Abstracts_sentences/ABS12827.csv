5,12827,"40 mV at 400 MA cm(-2) at 1000 C. However, supplying the simulated biogas, AMg and AMgAl showed smaller losses of 25 and 29 mV, respectively, than those in supplying hydrogen, whereas A showed the loss of more than 40 mV. Through this study, it was revealed that when the biogas is selected as a fuel, the electrochemical efficiency of the internal reforming SOFC is enhanced by using AMg or AMgAl as anode materials instead of A.",Ni1-x-yMgxAlyO-ScSZ anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2006.06.010
