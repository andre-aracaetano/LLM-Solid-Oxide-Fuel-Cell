3,9250,The most common powder-processed (screen-printed and sintered) La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95(LSCF-GDC) composite cathode is applied over vacuum-deposited thin-film components.,Sintered powder-base cathode over vacuum-deposited thin-film electrolyte of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell: Performance and stability,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.11.018
4,9250,When LSCF-GDC is sintered at a general sintering temperature of 1050 degrees C then the continuity of the GDC buffer is lost and excessive interdiffusion between the cathode and the electrolyte has occurred at the interface.,Sintered powder-base cathode over vacuum-deposited thin-film electrolyte of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell: Performance and stability,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.11.018

6,9250,"Moreover, the operation stability of the hybrid SOFC (degradation rate similar to 8%/000 h) is superior to that of the SOFC with a vacuum-processed nanostructure cathode (degradation rate similar to 21%/100 h) when exposed to 0.7 A cm(-2) at 650 degrees C, which is a significantly harsh degradation test condition for LT-SOFCs.",Sintered powder-base cathode over vacuum-deposited thin-film electrolyte of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell: Performance and stability,10.1016/j.electacta.2018.11.018
