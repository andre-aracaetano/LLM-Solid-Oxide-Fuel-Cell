1,16633,A single chamber cell constructed from an yttria-stabilized zirconia solid electrolyte with a nickel anode and a strontium-doped lanthanum manganese oxide (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) cathode can generate an electromotive force (emf) of 795 mV and a power density of 121 mW cm(-2) in a mixture of methane and air at a flow rate of 300 mL min(-1) and 950 degrees C.,Single chamber solid oxide fuel cell constructed from an yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1149/1.1390822
2,16633,"The simultaneous additions of 25 wt % gadolinium-doped cerium oxide (Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9) and 15 wt % manganese oxide (MnO2) to the anode and cathode, respectively, further increased the emf to 833 mV and the power density to 162 mW cm(-2).",Single chamber solid oxide fuel cell constructed from an yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte,10.1149/1.1390822
