3,18748,The experimental results show that the addition of H-2 into the cathode inlet gas flow and the increase of electrolysis current could significantly promote CH4 production rate.,Experimental Characterization and Theoretical Modeling of Methane Production by H2O/CO2 Co-Electrolysis in a Tubular Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.1149/2.0171510jes
4,18748,"In the case of the experiments without H-2, the CH4 production ratio increased by less than 0.04% when the operating voltage varied from OCV to 1.5 V. After feeding the H-2 into the cathode atmosphere, the CH4 production ratio increases by 3-4%.",Experimental Characterization and Theoretical Modeling of Methane Production by H2O/CO2 Co-Electrolysis in a Tubular Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.1149/2.0171510jes
5,18748,"A CH4 yield of 9.94% and a CH4 production ratio of 12.34% were achieved at 550 degrees C with 20% H-2 fed into cathode and an applied voltage of 1.5 V. Finally, a theoretical model is developed by considering the chemical/electrochemical reaction and transport processes, and the thermal distribution and optimal operating condition of the TSOEC are studied.",Experimental Characterization and Theoretical Modeling of Methane Production by H2O/CO2 Co-Electrolysis in a Tubular Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,10.1149/2.0171510jes
