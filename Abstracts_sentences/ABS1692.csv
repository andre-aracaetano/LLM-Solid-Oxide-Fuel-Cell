2,1692,"However, broader commercialization of SOFCs is hindered by inadequate performance and limited durability due to the sluggish hydrocarbon reforming/oxidation kinetics and coking on the SOFC anode.",A Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Runs on Hydrocarbon Fuels with Exceptional Durability and Power Output,10.1002/aenm.202202928
3,1692,"Here it has been reported that these findings in design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel anode catalyst Ba(Zr0.8Y0.2)(0.9)(Ni0.5Ru0.5)(0.1)O3-delta (BZYNR) that overcomes the problems, enabling direct utilization of nearly dry hydrocarbon fuels (e.g., methane, ethanol, and iso-octane with only 3 vol% H2O) with exceptional power output for over 1000 h on both button cells and tubular cells.",A Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Runs on Hydrocarbon Fuels with Exceptional Durability and Power Output,10.1002/aenm.202202928
4,1692,The outstanding performance of BZYNR is attributed to the high activity of hydrocarbon reforming and the accelerated water-mediated carbon cleaning process on Ni-based SOFC anode.,A Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Runs on Hydrocarbon Fuels with Exceptional Durability and Power Output,10.1002/aenm.202202928
