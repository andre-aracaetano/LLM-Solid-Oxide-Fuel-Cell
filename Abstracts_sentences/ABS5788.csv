1,5788,"The paper presents the results of cyclic oxidation studies performed for two ferritic stainless steels: Crofer 22 APU and H25T. The surface of the steels was coated with particles of oxides of the following active elements: yttrium, cerium, samarium, and gadolinium.",Improving the Oxidation Resistance and Electrical Properties of Ferritic Stainless Steels for Application in SOFC Interconnects,10.1007/s11085-015-9605-9
