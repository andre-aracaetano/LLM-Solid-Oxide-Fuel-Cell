1,12684,"In situ temperature-programmed (TP) analyses in a multi-analytical approach including X-ray diffractometry (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), thermogravimetry (TGA), near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) are used to study the relationship between redox properties and structural changes in Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-delta (m-PBM), PrBaMn2O5+delta (r-PBM), and PrBaMn2O5+delta (o-PBM) when exposed to reduction/oxidation cycles.",Insights into the Redox Behavior of Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-δ-Derived Perovskites for CO2 Valorization Technologies,10.1021/acsaem.2c00163
2,12684,"TP-XRD analysis shows that under reducing conditions, between 300 and 850 degrees C, the biphase perovskite m-PBM turns into the monolayered perovskite r-PBM.",Insights into the Redox Behavior of Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-δ-Derived Perovskites for CO2 Valorization Technologies,10.1021/acsaem.2c00163
3,12684,"Stabilization of the latter phase at room temperature requires early oxidation in air at a high temperature (850 degrees C) to avoid segregation, resulting in the formation of the oxidized layered phase (o-PBM).",Insights into the Redox Behavior of Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-δ-Derived Perovskites for CO2 Valorization Technologies,10.1021/acsaem.2c00163
4,12684,"The o-PBM layered perovskite is characterized by the H-2-TPR profile, showing two reduction peaks at temperatures below 500 degrees C. TP-NEXAFS characterization reveals the copresence of Mn(IV) (60%), Mn(III) (30%), and Mn(II) (10%) and helps to interpret the reduction profile: Mn(IV) converts to Mn(III) at similar to 300 degrees C (I pk), Mn(III) to Mn(II) at similar to 450 degrees C (II pk).",Insights into the Redox Behavior of Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-δ-Derived Perovskites for CO2 Valorization Technologies,10.1021/acsaem.2c00163
5,12684,"The TGA characterization confirms the reversibility of the o-PBM <-> r-PBM process at 800 degrees C; in addition, it shows that the r-PBM can be oxidized almost completely (similar to 99%) also by CO2 without accumulation of carbonates.",Insights into the Redox Behavior of Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-δ-Derived Perovskites for CO2 Valorization Technologies,10.1021/acsaem.2c00163
