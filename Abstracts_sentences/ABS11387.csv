3,11387,"However, high solid loading and binder content cause high viscosity of the slurry, which makes removal of air bubbles and handling difficult.",Fabrication of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by solvent-controlled co-tape casting technique,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.066
4,11387,"In this study, a new method to fabricate uniform green tapes with high solid loading and binder content by controlling solvent ratio under vacuum condition is proposed.",Fabrication of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by solvent-controlled co-tape casting technique,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.066
5,11387,"As a result, high solid loading and binder content with 39% improved storage shear modulus, 26% improved LVR length, tensile strength of 5.0 MPa, and packing density of 57.5% were achieved at solvent ratio of 22 wt%.",Fabrication of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by solvent-controlled co-tape casting technique,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.066
6,11387,"To fabricate unit cells using the green tapes, thermal decomposition and shrinkage behavior are characterized, and heat treatment steps at 250 degrees C, 350 degrees C, and 500 degrees C and co-sintering temperature were determined at 1250 degrees C. A fabricated unit cell showed open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.10 V and the maximum power density of 1.20 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. To fabricate crack-free Phi 5.0 cm unit cells, the mechanical strength of the anode support tapes after thermal decomposition was measured to determine the tape compositions that can minimize cracks at the unit cell.",Fabrication of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by solvent-controlled co-tape casting technique,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.066
7,11387,"As a result, a crack-free unit cell with a diameter of 5.0 cm was fabricated, achieving OCV of 1.05 V and power of 4.3 W at 800 degrees C.
