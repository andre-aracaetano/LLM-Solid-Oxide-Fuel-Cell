7,19257,"Ex-situ XRD analysis and cell assessment of catalyst infiltration temperature revealed that the optimal range is 750-850 & DEG;C. The best cell performance and durability was achieved with LSCF-SDC oxygen electrocatalyst and SDC-Ni (60:40 vol%) steam electrocatalyst infiltrated 11 times at 800 & DEG;C and operated at 700 & DEG;C. At low steam content, a significant mass transport limitation on the steam side results in limiting current behavior.",Optimization of metal-supported solid oxide electrolysis cells with infiltrated catalysts,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.039
