5,4319,"In metal supported SOCs (MSCs) the thickest layer in the cell, the support layer of a few hundred mu m, uses metal instead of Ni/YSZ cermet as in state-of-the-art (SoA) fuel electrode supported cells, thereby enabling a significant cost reduction.",Reversible Operation of Metal Supported Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3aaa
6,4319,"The present study investigates SoA Ni/YSZ SOCs and MSCs, fabricated by tape casting, lamination, and screen-printing, in reversible operation at 650 degrees C in 50/50 steam/hydrogen.",Reversible Operation of Metal Supported Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3aaa
7,4319,"In the initial few hundred hours, the degradation rate in electrolysis mode is smaller on a MSC compared to a SoA Ni/YSZ cell, while they are comparable in fuel cell mode.",Reversible Operation of Metal Supported Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3aaa
8,4319,"According to electrochemical impedance evaluation, the degradation is due to a simultaneous increase of the serial and polarization resistances in the MSC, while it is mainly due to an increase of the polarization resistance in the SoA cell.",Reversible Operation of Metal Supported Solid Oxide Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/ad3aaa
