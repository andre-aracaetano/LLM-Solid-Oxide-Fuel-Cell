1,4938,A solid-state mixing method was adopted to prepare a new Pr0.8Sr0.2Fe0.7Ni0.3O3-delta-Pr1.2Sr0.8Fe0.4Ni0.6O4+delta (PSFN113-214) composite cathode oxide for the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Heterointerface Effect in Accelerating the Cathodic Oxygen Reduction for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3389/fchem.2022.959863
2,4938,"Herein, heterointerface engineering was investigated for the performance enhancement.",Heterointerface Effect in Accelerating the Cathodic Oxygen Reduction for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3389/fchem.2022.959863
3,4938,"It was found that the oxygen vacancy content could be increased by mixing the PSFN214 with PSFN113, which gave rise to the formation of a heterostructure, and resulted in the promotion of oxygen ion transport as well as the specific surface area.",Heterointerface Effect in Accelerating the Cathodic Oxygen Reduction for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3389/fchem.2022.959863
4,4938,"The optimum mixing ratio 5:5 resulted in the highest oxygen vacancy content and the largest specific surface area, indicating the strongest interface effect.",Heterointerface Effect in Accelerating the Cathodic Oxygen Reduction for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3389/fchem.2022.959863
5,4938,"Polarization resistance of PSFN113-214 (5:5) was 0.029 omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, which was merely 24% of PSFN113 and 39% of PSFN214.",Heterointerface Effect in Accelerating the Cathodic Oxygen Reduction for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3389/fchem.2022.959863
6,4938,"The corresponding maximum power density was 0.699 W cm(-2), which was nearly 1.44 times of PSFN113 and 1.24 times of PSFN214.",Heterointerface Effect in Accelerating the Cathodic Oxygen Reduction for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3389/fchem.2022.959863
7,4938,"Furthermore, the voltage attenuation rate after 100 h was merely 0.0352% h(-1).",Heterointerface Effect in Accelerating the Cathodic Oxygen Reduction for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3389/fchem.2022.959863
8,4938,"Therefore, the new PSFN113-214 composite could be a prospective cathode oxide for SOFCs.",Heterointerface Effect in Accelerating the Cathodic Oxygen Reduction for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3389/fchem.2022.959863
