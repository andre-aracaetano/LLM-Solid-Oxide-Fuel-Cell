1,8266,Yttria-doped bismuth (YDB) and gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) are investigated as a bilayer electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Application of GDC-YDB bilayer and LSM-YDB cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-013-9796-x
2,8266,LSM-YDB is used as a cathode material in order to improve the poor ionic conduction of LSM and the compatibility with the YDB electrolyte.,Application of GDC-YDB bilayer and LSM-YDB cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-013-9796-x
3,8266,The performance of the bilayer cell was measured under humidified H-2 (3 % H2O) atmosphere and an operating temperature between 500 A degrees C and 650 A degrees C.,Application of GDC-YDB bilayer and LSM-YDB cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-013-9796-x
4,8266,"The polarization resistance and ohmic resistance of the GDC-YDB bilayer cell were 0.189 abroken vertical bar cm(2) and 0.227 abroken vertical bar cm(2) at 650 A degrees C, respectively.",Application of GDC-YDB bilayer and LSM-YDB cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-013-9796-x
5,8266,"The bilayer cell showed 0.527 Wcm(-2) in the maximum power density at 650 A degrees C, which is about two times higher than the single-layer cell of 0.21 Wcm(-2).",Application of GDC-YDB bilayer and LSM-YDB cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-013-9796-x
6,8266,"The OCV of the bilayer cell was 0.89 V at 650 A degrees C, suggesting that the electronic conduction caused by the reduction of ceria was successfully suppressed by the YDB layer.",Application of GDC-YDB bilayer and LSM-YDB cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-013-9796-x
7,8266,The introduction of an YDB-GDC bilayer cell with LSM-YDB cathode thus appears to be a promising method for improving the performance of GDC-based SOFCs and reducing operating temperature.,Application of GDC-YDB bilayer and LSM-YDB cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-013-9796-x
