1,20393,"The segregation behavior in 3 and 10 mol % polycrystalline yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), calcined at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1600 degreesC, is characterized using low-energy ion scattering (LEIS).",Subsurface segregation of yttria in yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1063/1.1499748
2,20393,"In order to be able to separate the Y and Zr LEIS signals, YSZ samples have been prepared using isotopically enriched (ZrO2)-Zr-94 instead of natural zirconia.",Subsurface segregation of yttria in yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1063/1.1499748
3,20393,The samples are made via a special precipitation method at a low temperature.,Subsurface segregation of yttria in yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1063/1.1499748
4,20393,The segregation to the outermost surface layer is dominated by impurities.,Subsurface segregation of yttria in yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1063/1.1499748
5,20393,"The increased impurity levels are restricted to this first layer, which underlines the importance of the use of LEIS for this study.",Subsurface segregation of yttria in yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1063/1.1499748
6,20393,"For temperatures of 1000 degreesC and higher, the oxides of the impurities Na, Si, and Ca even cover the surface completely.",Subsurface segregation of yttria in yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1063/1.1499748
7,20393,"The performance of a device like the solid oxide fuel cell which has an YSZ electrolyte and a working temperature around 1000 degreesC, will, therefore, be strongly hampered by these impurities.",Subsurface segregation of yttria in yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1063/1.1499748
8,20393,"The reduction of impurities, to prevent accumulation at the surface, will only be effective if the total impurity bulk concentration can be reduced below the 10 ppm level.",Subsurface segregation of yttria in yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1063/1.1499748
9,20393,"Due to the presence of the impurities, yttria cannot accumulate in the outermost layer.",Subsurface segregation of yttria in yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1063/1.1499748
10,20393,"It does so, in contrast to the general belief, in the subsurface layer and to much higher concentrations than the values reported previously.",Subsurface segregation of yttria in yttria stabilized zirconia,10.1063/1.1499748
