2,20869,"The simulated reactor consists of double tubes in which the reactants and the heat transfer fluid (i.e. molten salts) are concurrently pumped through the inner and the outer tubes, respectively.",An integrated approach for the production of hydrogen and methane by catalytic hydrothermal glycerol reforming coupled with parabolic trough solar thermal collectors,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.045
3,20869,"The first section of the reactor essentially serves as a preheater to increase the feed temperature to 20 K below the desired reaction temperature (i.e. 773 K), while the second section is comprised of a catalyst appropriate for the reforming of glycerol and water-gas shift reaction (e.g. Ru and Ni catalysts).",An integrated approach for the production of hydrogen and methane by catalytic hydrothermal glycerol reforming coupled with parabolic trough solar thermal collectors,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.045
4,20869,The required energy for heating up the reactants to the final reaction temperature in the preheating section as well as the heat of reaction needed throughout the catalyst bed is provided by a co-currently fed molten salts mixture previously heated to 823 K in parabolic trough solar collectors.,An integrated approach for the production of hydrogen and methane by catalytic hydrothermal glycerol reforming coupled with parabolic trough solar thermal collectors,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.045
