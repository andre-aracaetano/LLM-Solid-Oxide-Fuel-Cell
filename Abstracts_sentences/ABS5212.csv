2,5212,"In this work, we investigated Zr-substituted Ba3Y4O9 as an ionic conductor at intermediate temperatures and found that the Zr substitution for Y dramatically improves the phase stability in humidified atmospheres at 300-800 degrees C.",New ionic conductor: Ba-deficient Ba3Y4O9 with Zr substitution,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115709
3,5212,The total electrical conductivity of nominally 20 mol% Zr-substituted Ba3Y4O9 sample is about 0.1 mS/cm at 500 degrees C in both dry H-2 and O-2 atmospheres.,New ionic conductor: Ba-deficient Ba3Y4O9 with Zr substitution,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115709
4,5212,"Because an increase in the conductivity in a humidified atmosphere was not observed, the conducting carriers may be oxygen ions.",New ionic conductor: Ba-deficient Ba3Y4O9 with Zr substitution,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115709
5,5212,"Besides, in the Zr-substituted Ba3Y4O9 samples, we observed that BaO-rich phase coexists with the main phase whose composition is estimated to be Ba:(Y + Zr) similar to 2:3.",New ionic conductor: Ba-deficient Ba3Y4O9 with Zr substitution,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115709
6,5212,"Therefore, the main conducting phase might be Ba-deficient Ba3Y4O9.",New ionic conductor: Ba-deficient Ba3Y4O9 with Zr substitution,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115709
7,5212,The mechanism of the ionic conduction and the improvement of chemical stability has not been revealed yet due to the lack of crystallographic information about the Ba-deficient phase.,New ionic conductor: Ba-deficient Ba3Y4O9 with Zr substitution,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115709
8,5212,"While we are now working on further investigation, we promptly report the characteristic of the new compound.",New ionic conductor: Ba-deficient Ba3Y4O9 with Zr substitution,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115709
