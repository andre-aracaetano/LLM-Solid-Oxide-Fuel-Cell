4,16251,"An operation of intermittent methane supply was designed to take advantage of three driving forces, i.e. methane in the gas phase, the deposited carbon at the anode surface, and a deficiency of the bulk lattice-oxygen concentration on the anode side, for the generation of the electrical current.",A new phenomenon of a fuel-free current during intermittent fuel flow over Ni-YSZ anode in direct methane SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.011

7,16251,It was also found that hydrogen from methane has been mostly evolved to the outlet gaseous product and the amount of CO formation is much higher than that of CO2; the operation of intermittent methane flow can further increase the amount of CO over that of CO2; these are beneficial for the co-generation of synthesis gas.,A new phenomenon of a fuel-free current during intermittent fuel flow over Ni-YSZ anode in direct methane SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.011
