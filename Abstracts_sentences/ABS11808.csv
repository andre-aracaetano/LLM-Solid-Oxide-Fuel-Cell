4,11808,"During the synthesis, a slightly W-doped SP and a W-rich B-site cation ordered DP with the dominant SP phase of approximately 80 wt% are formed simultaneously.",A single-/double-perovskite composite with an overwhelming single-perovskite phase for the oxygen reduction reaction at intermediate temperatures,10.1039/c7ta07760b
5,11808,This new composite shows obviously enhanced stability owing to the W doping effect in the SP phase and increased activity from the synergistic effect between the SP and DP phases compared to the W-free SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3 - delta perovskite.,A single-/double-perovskite composite with an overwhelming single-perovskite phase for the oxygen reduction reaction at intermediate temperatures,10.1039/c7ta07760b
6,11808,We anticipate that the synthesis of this perovskite-type composite could pave the way to discover more perovskite-based composite catalysts for SOFCs.,A single-/double-perovskite composite with an overwhelming single-perovskite phase for the oxygen reduction reaction at intermediate temperatures,10.1039/c7ta07760b
