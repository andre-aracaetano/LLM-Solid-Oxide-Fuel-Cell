1,11813,Cell performance was measured at 773-1073 K for Ni-GDC(Gd-doped ceria) anode-supported GDC film (60 mu m thickness) with SrRuO3 cathode using a 3 vol% H2O-containing H-2 fuel.,Cell performance of strontium ruthenium oxide cathode/Gd-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte/nickel-GDC anode system,10.2109/jcersj2.117.1141
2,11813,Reduction of particle size (< 1 mu m) of SrRuO3 cathode was effective to decrease the voltage drop at the cathode because of the increased length of triple phase boundary (GDC electrolyte-SrRuO3 cathode-O-2 gas).,Cell performance of strontium ruthenium oxide cathode/Gd-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte/nickel-GDC anode system,10.2109/jcersj2.117.1141
3,11813,Open circuit voltage (OCV) of GDC electrolyte in an anode atmosphere without H-2 fuel was close to the value calculated by Nernst equation for no electronic conduction.,Cell performance of strontium ruthenium oxide cathode/Gd-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte/nickel-GDC anode system,10.2109/jcersj2.117.1141
4,11813,"However, the OCV in a H-2-containing atmosphere decreased from the values by Nernst equation owing to the increased electronic conduction in a GDC mull.",Cell performance of strontium ruthenium oxide cathode/Gd-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte/nickel-GDC anode system,10.2109/jcersj2.117.1141
5,11813,This tendency of decrease in OCV became significant for thinner GDC film.,Cell performance of strontium ruthenium oxide cathode/Gd-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte/nickel-GDC anode system,10.2109/jcersj2.117.1141
6,11813,This result was interpreted by the dissolution and dissociation of H-2 fuel in a GDC film to form protons and electrons (H-2 -> 2H(+) + 2e(-)).,Cell performance of strontium ruthenium oxide cathode/Gd-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte/nickel-GDC anode system,10.2109/jcersj2.117.1141
