1,9737,"The suitability of impedance measurements in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) is an important concern, especially in case of measuring separately the behaviour of one of the electrode when an overvoltage is applied.",Experimental approach for the study of SOFC cathodes,
2,9737,"In this case a thin electrolyte-supported cell with the RE (Reference Electrode) coplanar with the WE (Working Electrode) is experimentally convenient, but many authors highlighted that incorrect results can be obtained if an inappropriate geometric configuration is used.",Experimental approach for the study of SOFC cathodes,
3,9737,"In this work LSM cathodes ((La0.8Sr0.2)MnO3-x) were investigated in a Yttria-stabilised Zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte-supported cell, using an electrolyte 3 mm thick.",Experimental approach for the study of SOFC cathodes,
4,9737,Two types of cells were prepared: the first (Cell1) according to the geometric requirements suggested in literature: little WE (diameter 3 mm) aligned to the CE (Counter Electrode) and with equal Rpol(polarisation resistance) and time constant; RE co-planar around the WE and placed at a distance greater than three-electrolyte thicknesses from the WE; the second one (Cell2) equal to Cell1,Experimental approach for the study of SOFC cathodes,
5,9737,but with a bigger WE (diameter 8 mm).,Experimental approach for the study of SOFC cathodes,
6,9737,"Impedance measurements were carried out both in two-and three-electrode configuration, at OCV (Open Circuit Voltage) and under applied overpotentials.",Experimental approach for the study of SOFC cathodes,
7,9737,A preliminary comparison between the results extracted from Cell2 at two- and three-electrodes confirms that a thick electrolyte allows extracting suitable three-electrode impedance results in case of OCV and small overpotentials.,Experimental approach for the study of SOFC cathodes,
8,9737,"On the other side, when an overpotential over 0.2 V is applied, a comparison between Cell1 and Cell2 gives quite different results.",Experimental approach for the study of SOFC cathodes,
9,9737,The investigation here presented considers also an experimental approach useful for the comprehension of the main phenomena governing the kinetic of the process.,Experimental approach for the study of SOFC cathodes,
