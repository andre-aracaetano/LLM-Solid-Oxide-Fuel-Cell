1,13464,The promotion of direct electrochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons in a solid oxide fuel cell was investigated using a ceria-based electrolyte with different noble metals-containing anode at 600degreesC.,An intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell providing higher performance with hydrocarbons than with hydrogen,10.1149/1.1508551
2,13464,"The objective was to avoid interference from a large amount of steam and CO2 being produced by discharging the cell, because these gases degrade the anode performance, especially at a high fuel utilization.",An intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell providing higher performance with hydrocarbons than with hydrogen,10.1149/1.1508551
3,13464,Ru was an effective catalyst for removing these gases from the anode surface due to its high catalytic activity for the steam and CO2 reforming of hydrocarbons.,An intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell providing higher performance with hydrocarbons than with hydrogen,10.1149/1.1508551
4,13464,"The resulting peak power densities reached 750 mW cm(-2) with dry methane, which was comparable to the peak power density of 769 mW cm(-2) with wet (2.9 vol %H2O) hydrogen.",An intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell providing higher performance with hydrocarbons than with hydrogen,10.1149/1.1508551
5,13464,The cell performance was maintained at a high level regardless of the change in methane utilization from 12 to 46% but was significantly reduced by increasing hydrogen utilization from 13 to 42%.,An intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell providing higher performance with hydrocarbons than with hydrogen,10.1149/1.1508551
6,13464,"The anodic reaction of hydrogen was controlled by the slow surface diffusion of hydrogen, while the anodic reaction of methane was not subject to the onset of such a gas-diffusion process.",An intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell providing higher performance with hydrocarbons than with hydrogen,10.1149/1.1508551
