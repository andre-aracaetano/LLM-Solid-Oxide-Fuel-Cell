2,4573,"Different additive contents of Samaria-doped ceria (SDC), i.e., (CeO2)(1-x)(SmO1.5)(X), were investigated to determine its possible application as an electrode-catalyst.",Internal methanol reforming over Samaria-doped ceria electrode in solid oxide fuel cell,
3,4573,Experiments were performed over a temperature range of 750 similar to 900) degreesC and under a steam/methanol molar ratio of 2.,Internal methanol reforming over Samaria-doped ceria electrode in solid oxide fuel cell,
4,4573,It may be concluded that the selectivity for methanol reforming is associated with the oxygen ionic conductivity.,Internal methanol reforming over Samaria-doped ceria electrode in solid oxide fuel cell,
5,4573,It: was found that the Ni-SDC cermet exhibited a higher open-circuit potential than did that of Ni-YSZ (Yttria-stabilized zirconia).,Internal methanol reforming over Samaria-doped ceria electrode in solid oxide fuel cell,
6,4573,"Furthermore, (CeO2)(0.9)(SmO1.5)(0.1) showed the highest depolarization ability in the SDC system because of the enhancement of electrical conductivity and also had the highest selectivity for methanol reforming.",Internal methanol reforming over Samaria-doped ceria electrode in solid oxide fuel cell,
