4,9260,"The electrical conductivity of Pr2-xCexCuO4 oxides demonstrates semiconducting behavior up to 900 degrees C. Small Ce-doping (2.5 at%) allows an increase in electrical conductivity from 100 to 130 S cm(-1) in air at 500-800 degrees C. DFT calculations revealed that the density of states directly below the Fermi level, comprised mainly of Cu 3d and O 2p states, is significantly affected by atoms in rare earth positions, which might give an indication of a correlation between calculated electronic structures and measured conducting properties.",Evaluation of Ce-doped Pr2CuO4 for potential application as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6ra21970e
