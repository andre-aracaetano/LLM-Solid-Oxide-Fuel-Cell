1,1239,A family of sealant materials has been developed for use in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and in other applications in the temperature range of 800-1000 degrees C. These materials are based on glasses and glass-ceramics in the SrO-La2O3-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 system.,Glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cells .1. Physical properties,10.1557/JMR.1996.0185
2,1239,"The coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) for these materials are in the range of 8-13 x 10(-6)/degrees C, a good match with those of the SOFC components.",Glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cells .1. Physical properties,10.1557/JMR.1996.0185
