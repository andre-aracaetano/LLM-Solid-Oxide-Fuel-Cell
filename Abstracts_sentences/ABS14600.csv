4,14600,"Our results first show that, the field effects on the Ni surface of the Ni/(YSZ+O) model are different as compared to a pure Ni(111) surface due to a difference in the charge distribution on the said surfaces.",Hydrogen Oxidation and Water Dissociation over an Oxygen-Enriched Ni/YSZ Electrode in the Presence of an Electric Field: A First-Principles-Based Microkinetic Model,10.1021/acs.iecr.6b04028
5,14600,"Between 400 to 1200 K, the negative fields assist in hydrogen oxidation over the TPB region of the Ni/(YSZ+O) cermet, which can potentially result in a larger probability for the said model to have oxygen vacancies at the TPB.",Hydrogen Oxidation and Water Dissociation over an Oxygen-Enriched Ni/YSZ Electrode in the Presence of an Electric Field: A First-Principles-Based Microkinetic Model,10.1021/acs.iecr.6b04028
