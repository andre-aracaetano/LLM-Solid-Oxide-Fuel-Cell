1,8041,This work highlights the possibility of the application of YBaCo4O7+delta-modified materials as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells based on protonic electrolytes.,Affinity of YBaCo4O7+δ-based layered cobaltites with protonic conductors of cerate-zirconate family,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.083
2,8041,"To reach this goal, the basic YBaCo4O7+delta oxide material and its YBaCo3.5Zn0.5O7+delta (YBCZ) and YBaCo3.5Fe0.5O7-delta (YBCF) substituted members were successfully synthesized and their structural, thermal and electrochemical properties were evaluated for their suitability for application.",Affinity of YBaCo4O7+δ-based layered cobaltites with protonic conductors of cerate-zirconate family,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.083
3,8041,It was found that the substitution of cobalt with zinc results in the structural stabilization of such 114 phases and the convergence of the thermal expansion coefficient with that of the selected BaCe0.5Zr0.3Dy0.2O3-delta (BCZD) electrolyte as well as superior electrochemical activity below 700 degrees C.,Affinity of YBaCo4O7+δ-based layered cobaltites with protonic conductors of cerate-zirconate family,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.083
4,8041,The Ni-BCZD|BCZD|YBCZ cell yields relatively high power density (200 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C) and exhibits low polarization resistance (0.51 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C).,Affinity of YBaCo4O7+δ-based layered cobaltites with protonic conductors of cerate-zirconate family,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.083
5,8041,"This, combined with the low activation energy values found for electrode polarization conductivity of both symmetrical and fuel cells allow assuming that the Zn-substituted YBaCo4O7+delta material could be successfully used in electrochemical devices based on proton-conducting electrolytes.",Affinity of YBaCo4O7+δ-based layered cobaltites with protonic conductors of cerate-zirconate family,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.08.083
