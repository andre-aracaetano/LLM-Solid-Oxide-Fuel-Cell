1,11242,"Research into novel cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs) attracted significant interest, primarily driven by the need for lower operating temperatures.",Self-assembled triple-conductive La2Ni1-xCe2xO4+δ cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d3se01345f
2,11242,"In this study, doping the Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) oxide La2NiO4+delta (LNO) with Ce led to the formation of LNCO, which exhibited a two-phase structure consisting of LNO and La2Ce2O7 (LCO).",Self-assembled triple-conductive La2Ni1-xCe2xO4+δ cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d3se01345f
3,11242,"This unique composition endowed La(2)Ni(1-x)Ce(2)xO(4+delta) (LNCOx) with triple conductivity, effectively expanding electrochemical active sites across the entire cathode.",Self-assembled triple-conductive La2Ni1-xCe2xO4+δ cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d3se01345f
4,11242,"Consequently, H-SOFCs employing the novel composite La2Ni0.8Ce0.4O4+delta (LNCO04) cathode demonstrated significant improvements in catalytic activity and durability, achieving an impressive maximum power density of 1516 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C. Notably, this performance surpasses that of most LNO-based cathodes previously reported in earlier studies, underscoring the substantial promise of LNCO oxide as a proton-conductive cathode material for H-SOFCs.",Self-assembled triple-conductive La2Ni1-xCe2xO4+δ cathodes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d3se01345f
