4,12015,"Here, we describe a strategy of naturally diffused sintering aid allowing the fabrication of defect-free doped-zirconia/doped-ceria bilayer electrolyte with full density and reduced interdiffusion layer at lower sintering temperature owing to the supply of small but appropriate amount of sintering aid from doped zirconia to doped ceria that makes the thermal shrinkages of both layers perfectly congruent.",Naturally diffused sintering aid for highly conductive bilayer electrolytes in solid oxide cells,10.1126/sciadv.abj8590
5,12015,The resulting SOCs exhibit a minimal ohmic loss of 0.09 ohm cm(2) and remarkable performances in both fuel cell (power density exceeding 1.3 W cm(-2)) and electrolysis (current density of -1.27 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V) operations at 700 degrees C.,Naturally diffused sintering aid for highly conductive bilayer electrolytes in solid oxide cells,10.1126/sciadv.abj8590
