2,12986,"an SSC cathode, and a Ni-SSZ anode, were analyzed using polarization curves, impedance spectroscopy, and post-mortem SEM observation.",Stability study of cermet-supported solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.08.070
3,12986,"The cell performance degradation at 650 degrees C in H-2/air both with and without DC bias conditions was manifested primarily as an increase in polarization resistance, approximately at a rate of 2.3 m Omega cm(2) h(-1) at OCV, suggesting a decrease in electrochemical kinetics as the main phenomenon responsible for the performance decay.",Stability study of cermet-supported solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.08.070
4,12986,"In addition, the initial series resistance was about ten times higher than the calculated resistance corresponding to the electrolyte, reflecting a possible inter-reaction between the electrolyte layers that occurred during the sintering stage.",Stability study of cermet-supported solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.08.070
5,12986,In situ and ex situ sintered cathodes showed no obvious difference in cell performance or decay rate.,Stability study of cermet-supported solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.08.070
6,12986,The stability of the cells with and without electrical load was also investigated and no significant influence of DC bias was recorded.,Stability study of cermet-supported solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.08.070
7,12986,"Based on the experimental results presented, we preliminarily attribute the performance degradation to electrochemical and microstructural degradation of the cathode.",Stability study of cermet-supported solid oxide fuel cells with bi-layered electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.08.070
