3,1551,"SEM and TEM observations it was concluded that after high temperature sintering a tetragonal (Mn,Al)(3)O(4) forms at the interface, which during prolonged fuel cell operation forms a cubic (Mn,Al)(3)O(4) phase.",Effect of alumina additions in YSZ on the microstructure and degradation of the LSM-YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.04.006
4,1551,This transformation is associated with volume decrease creating voids which ultimately weaken the cathode-electrolyte interface sufficiently for the cathode layer to delaminate off the YSZ-Al(2)O(3) electrolyte.,Effect of alumina additions in YSZ on the microstructure and degradation of the LSM-YSZ interface,10.1016/j.ssi.2009.04.006
