1,8081,The application of a thin film electrolyte layer with a thickness in the micrometer range could greatly improve current solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in terms of operating temperature and power output.,Assembly of 8YSZ nanoparticles into gas-tight 1-2 μm thick 8YSZ electrolyte layers using wet coating methods,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.07.012
2,8081,"Since the achievable minimal layer thickness with conventional powder coating methods is limited to similar to 5 mu m, a variety of thin film methods have been studied, but results on regular large-scale anode substrates are still lacking in the literature.",Assembly of 8YSZ nanoparticles into gas-tight 1-2 μm thick 8YSZ electrolyte layers using wet coating methods,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.07.012
3,8081,"In this paper, a wet coating process is presented for fabricating gas-tight 1-2 mu m thick 8YSZ electrolyte layers on a regular NiO/8YSZ substrate, with a rough surface, a high porosity and a large pore size.",Assembly of 8YSZ nanoparticles into gas-tight 1-2 μm thick 8YSZ electrolyte layers using wet coating methods,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.07.012
4,8081,"These layers were deposited in a similar way as conventional suspension based layers, but the essential difference includes the use of coating liquids (nano-dispersion, sol) with a considerably smaller particle size (85 nm, 60 nm, 35 nm, 6 nm).",Assembly of 8YSZ nanoparticles into gas-tight 1-2 μm thick 8YSZ electrolyte layers using wet coating methods,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.07.012
5,8081,"Successful deposition of such layers was accomplished by means of an innovative coating process, which involves the preparation of a hybrid polyvinyl alcohol/8YSZ membrane by dip-coating or spin-coating and subsequently burning out the polymer part at 500 degrees C. Results from He leak tests confirmed that the sintered layers posses a very low number of defects and with values in the range 10(-4)-10(-6) (hPa dm(3))/(s cm(2))",Assembly of 8YSZ nanoparticles into gas-tight 1-2 μm thick 8YSZ electrolyte layers using wet coating methods,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.07.012
6,8081,the gas-tightness of the thin film layers is satisfactory for fuel cell operation.,Assembly of 8YSZ nanoparticles into gas-tight 1-2 μm thick 8YSZ electrolyte layers using wet coating methods,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.07.012
7,8081,"Moreover, preliminary results have also indicated a potential reduction of the sintering temperature from 1400 degrees C to the range 1200-1300 degrees C, using the presented coating process.",Assembly of 8YSZ nanoparticles into gas-tight 1-2 μm thick 8YSZ electrolyte layers using wet coating methods,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2011.07.012
