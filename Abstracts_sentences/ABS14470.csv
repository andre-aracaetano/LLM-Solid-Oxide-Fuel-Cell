1,14470,The nano-sized composite cathodes prepared by infiltrating La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) or La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LCCF) into the Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) scaffolds exhibit different electrocatalytic activity and microstructure evolution.,Improved stability of nano-sized La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes by substituting Sr2+ with Ca2+,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.124
2,14470,"Compared with LSCF-SDC nano-sized composite cathode, the LCCF-SDC composite cathode shows the higher microstructure stability.",Improved stability of nano-sized La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes by substituting Sr2+ with Ca2+,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.124
3,14470,"There is no observable coarsening or sintering and no diffraction peaks of other impurity phase are detected for both LSCF and LCCF after being aged at 600 degrees C for 500 h, but the lattice distortion is less if La3+ ions are substituted by Ca2+ ions instead of by Sr2+ in LaCo0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LCFO) lattice.",Improved stability of nano-sized La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes by substituting Sr2+ with Ca2+,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.124
4,14470,The oxygen vacancy concentration is also less in LCCF than in LSCF.,Improved stability of nano-sized La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes by substituting Sr2+ with Ca2+,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.124
5,14470,The less lattice distortion and oxygen vacancy concentration prohibit the Ca2+ ions segregation on the LCCF cathode surface because of less strain in the LCCF lattice and less electrostatic interactions between the negatively charge A-site dopants (Ca'(La)) and the positively charged oxygen vacancies (V-o(..)) on LCCF surface.,Improved stability of nano-sized La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes by substituting Sr2+ with Ca2+,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.124
6,14470,The greater binding energy of Ca-O maybe also hinder the enrichment of Ca2+ ions on the cathode surface.,Improved stability of nano-sized La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes by substituting Sr2+ with Ca2+,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.124
7,14470,"After being aged in air at 600 degrees C for 500 h, more Sr2+ ions gather on the LSCF cathode surface to form a Sr-rich inert phase, which is detrimental to the oxygen reduction reaction on the cathode surface.",Improved stability of nano-sized La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes by substituting Sr2+ with Ca2+,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.124
