4,19924,The remarkable characteristic of GdNi-YSZ anode cell is that the cell performance for humidified methane fuel is greatly improved due to the high anode activity for methane reforming and electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen.,Fine interface contact and high activity of nickel-based anode modified by gadolinium for hydrogen and methane fuel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.035
5,19924,"The maximum power density of GdNi-YSZ anode cell with humidified methane as fuel can reach 1.59 W/cm(2) at 800 degrees C and 0.46 W/cm(2) at 650 degrees C. High performance of GdNi-YSZ anode cell with humidified methane as fuel leads to much H2O produced during the electrochemical oxidation process, which can depress carbon deposition and improve the cell stability for humidified methane fuel.",Fine interface contact and high activity of nickel-based anode modified by gadolinium for hydrogen and methane fuel,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.035
