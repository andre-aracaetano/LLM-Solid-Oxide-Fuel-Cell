3,4235,"The performances of anode-supported single cells with a configuration of Sn-Ni-SDC vertical bar SDC vertical bar Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta are investigated in the range of 600-700 degrees C. With increasing Sn content of the anode, the performances of the cells fed with H-2 and dry methane both decrease slightly, indicating a reduced anodic catalytic activity.",Effect of Sn addition on improving the stability of Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode material for solid oxide fuel cells fed with dry CH4,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.030
4,4235,"However, the stability of the cell with dry methane as fuel improves remarkably with the addition of Sn due to the suppression of carbon deposition on the anode.",Effect of Sn addition on improving the stability of Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode material for solid oxide fuel cells fed with dry CH4,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.030
