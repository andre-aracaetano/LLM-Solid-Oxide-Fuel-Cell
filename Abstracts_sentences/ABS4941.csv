3,4941,"For example, at 800 degrees C, 10 % bismuth doping reduces interfacial polarization resistance from 0.80 to 0.32 Omega cm(2) and increases peak power density by similar to 40 % to 0.55 W cm(-2) in hydrogen.","A-site bismuth doping, a new strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performances of lanthanum chromate anodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118809
4,4941,"In addition, bismuth doping decreases the interfacial polarization resistance by 74 % in air.","A-site bismuth doping, a new strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performances of lanthanum chromate anodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118809
5,4941,"Consequently, bismuth doping improves peak power density by up to 80 % at 800 degrees C for symmetrical structured single cells.","A-site bismuth doping, a new strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performances of lanthanum chromate anodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118809
6,4941,"The doped material is stable in both air and reducing atmospheres such as in hydrogen at 850 degrees C for 100 h. The doped bismuth presents a sub-oxidation state, which elevates the average valence states of Cr and Fe, and increases the electronic conductivities and concentrations of surface oxygen species in both air and hydrogen atmospheres.","A-site bismuth doping, a new strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performances of lanthanum chromate anodes for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118809
