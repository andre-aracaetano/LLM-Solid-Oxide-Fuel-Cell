2,10419,"The alloys were formed by in situ reduction of FexCo0.5-xNi05OY composities, which were synthesized using a glycine-nitrate technique.",FexCo0.5-xNi0.5-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.08.039
3,10419,"Symmetrical cells consisted of FexCo05-xNi05-SDC electrodes and GDC electrolytes, and single cells consisted of FexCo05-xNi05-SDC (Ce08SM02O1.9) anodes, GDC electrolytes, and SSC (Sm05Sr05CoO3)-SDC cathodes were prepared using a co-pressing and co-firing process.",FexCo0.5-xNi0.5-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.08.039
4,10419,"Interfacial polarization resistances and I-V curves of these cells were measured at temperature from 450 to 600 degrees C. With Fe0.25Co025Ni05-SDC as anodes, the cells showed the lowest interfacial resistance and highest power density.",FexCo0.5-xNi0.5-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.08.039
5,10419,"For example, at 600 degrees C, the resistance was about 0.11 Omega cm(2) and power density was about 750 mW cm(-2) when humidified (3% H2O) hydrogen was used as fuel and stationary air as oxidant.",FexCo0.5-xNi0.5-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.08.039
6,10419,"Further, the cell performance was improved when the molar ratio of Fe:Co:Ni approached 1: 1:2, i.e. Fe025CO025Ni0.5.",FexCo0.5-xNi0.5-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.08.039
7,10419,"In addition, higher power density and lower interfacial resistance were obtained for cells with the Fe025Co025Ni05-SDC anodes comparing to that with Ni-SDC anodes, which have been usually used for LT-SOFCs.",FexCo0.5-xNi0.5-SDC anodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2005.08.039
