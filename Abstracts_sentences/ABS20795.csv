1,20795,Phase pure powders of SrCeO3 and Sr2CeO4 have been synthesized by calcination at 1000 degrees C for 14 h via solid state ceramic route.,"Study of structural, electrical, and photoluminescent properties of SrCeO3 and Sr2CeO4",10.1007/s40145-019-0320-x
2,20795,"Ceramics/pellets of these samples have been obtained by sintering at 1200 celcius for 12 h. The Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of sintered powders confirmed orthorhombic structure of both the samples with space group Pnma and Pbam for SrCeO3 and Sr2CeO4, respectively.","Study of structural, electrical, and photoluminescent properties of SrCeO3 and Sr2CeO4",10.1007/s40145-019-0320-x
3,20795,"Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies indicated that both the compounds have dense microstructure, but morphology and size of the grains are different.","Study of structural, electrical, and photoluminescent properties of SrCeO3 and Sr2CeO4",10.1007/s40145-019-0320-x
4,20795,The impedance spectroscopy technique has been employed to study the relaxation phenomenon.,"Study of structural, electrical, and photoluminescent properties of SrCeO3 and Sr2CeO4",10.1007/s40145-019-0320-x
5,20795,DC conductivity of the samples has been measured in the temperature range of 200-600 celcius to understand the conduction mechanism.,"Study of structural, electrical, and photoluminescent properties of SrCeO3 and Sr2CeO4",10.1007/s40145-019-0320-x
6,20795,The activation energy for relaxation (E-relax) and DC conduction (E-cond) are found to be the same for both the compounds.,"Study of structural, electrical, and photoluminescent properties of SrCeO3 and Sr2CeO4",10.1007/s40145-019-0320-x
7,20795,"Based on the numerical value of activation energies, relaxation and conduction mechanism in both the samples are attributed to migration of doubly ionized oxygen vacancies (V-o(center dot center dot)).","Study of structural, electrical, and photoluminescent properties of SrCeO3 and Sr2CeO4",10.1007/s40145-019-0320-x
