5,11600,"The presence of a nickel layer, to simulate the contact between ferritic steel interconnects and nickel mesh in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) results in the formation of an austenitic zone and in accelerated formation of a sigma-phase rich layer at the ferrite/austenite interface, due to interdiffusion processes.",Sigma-phase formation in high chromium ferritic steels at 650 °C,10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.03.076
