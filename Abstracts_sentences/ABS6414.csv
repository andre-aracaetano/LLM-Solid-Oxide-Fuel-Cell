1,6414,"The status and opportunity of metallic interconnects for an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell stack is reviewed with special emphasis on the variation of contact resistance of currently developed interconnects at operating temperatures, as well as the prevailing approaches to reduce contact resistance.",Opportunity of metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells: a status on contact resistance,10.1016/S0025-5408(03)00076-X
2,6414,"It appears that without a coating, current metallic interconnects are not suitable for practical applications at 800degreesC since they may cause drastic performance degradation of the stack within its expected service lifetime.",Opportunity of metallic interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells: a status on contact resistance,10.1016/S0025-5408(03)00076-X
