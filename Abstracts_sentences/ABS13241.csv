1,13241,Developing catalytic materials with highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for lower-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and electrolysis cell (SOEC) technologies.,Novel Perovskite Structured Nd0.5Ba0.5Co1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O3-δ as Highly Efficient Catalyst for Oxygen Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/acsami.3c14336
2,13241,"In this work, a novel triple perovskite material, Nd0.5Ba0.5Co1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O3-delta, has been developed and employed as a catalyst for both ORR and OER in SOFC and SOEC operations at relatively lower temperatures, showing a low polarization resistance of 0.327 Omega cm(2), high-power output of SOFC up to 773 mW cm(-2) at 650 C-degrees, and a high current density of 1.57 A cm(-2) from SOEC operation at 1.5 V at 600 C-degrees.",Novel Perovskite Structured Nd0.5Ba0.5Co1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O3-δ as Highly Efficient Catalyst for Oxygen Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/acsami.3c14336
3,13241,"The relaxation time distribution reveals that Nd0.5Ba0.5Co1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O3-delta could maintain a slow polarization process at the relatively low operating temperature, offering a significant antipolarization advantage over other perovskite electrode materials.",Novel Perovskite Structured Nd0.5Ba0.5Co1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O3-δ as Highly Efficient Catalyst for Oxygen Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/acsami.3c14336
4,13241,"The Nd0.5Ba0.5Co1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O3-delta electrode provides a low energy barrier of about 0.36 eV in oxygen ion mobility, which is beneficent for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction processes.",Novel Perovskite Structured Nd0.5Ba0.5Co1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O3-δ as Highly Efficient Catalyst for Oxygen Electrode in Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/acsami.3c14336
