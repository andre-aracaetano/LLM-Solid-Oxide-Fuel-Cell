1,10347,"The development of protective coatings for porous metal supports is critical for sufficient life time for the fuel cells by enabling improved oxidation resistance, reduced chromium evaporation, and increased conductivity of the protective oxide scale.",Improvement of corrosion properties of porous alloy supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.170
2,10347,"The oxidation of coated and non-coated substrates has been compared, and shows that it is possible to increase the oxidation resistance at 600 C-omicron in air by a factor of 10 and in wet hydrogen by a factor of 1000, after vacuum coating of the porous metal supports by infiltration of a lanthanum-manganese-cobalt solution and fast curing in air at 900 C-omicron.",Improvement of corrosion properties of porous alloy supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.170
3,10347,Chromium evaporation is also lowered by a factor of 10 in air at 600 C-omicron.,Improvement of corrosion properties of porous alloy supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.170
4,10347,The experiments on pre-coated porous metal supports verify that the coating is well suited to use for metal supported fuel cells prepared by a low temperature fabrication route (below 1100 C-omicron).,Improvement of corrosion properties of porous alloy supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.170
5,10347,An alternative coating procedure for coating of the metal supports after co-sintering of the anode and electrolyte has also been investigated and is well suited for the high-temperature fabrication route.,Improvement of corrosion properties of porous alloy supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.170
6,10347,"For the high temperature fabrication route, the oxidation tests at 600 C-omicron for 500 h in air and 100 h in wet hydrogen showed that post-coating is better than the pre-coating approach since the cell sintering steps has a detrimental effect on the pre-coated samples.",Improvement of corrosion properties of porous alloy supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.170
