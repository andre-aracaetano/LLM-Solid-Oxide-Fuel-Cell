1,20217,"The poisoning effects of S atom on the (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (1 1 1) metal surfaces of pure Ni and Ni-based alloy with IB (coinage) metals (Cu, Ag, Au) are systematically studied.",Resistance to sulfur poisoning of Ni-based alloy with coinage (IB) metals,10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.10.061
2,20217,The effects of IB metal dopants on the S poisoning features are analyzed combining the density functional theory (DFT) results with thermodynamics data using the ab initio atomistic thermodynamic method.,Resistance to sulfur poisoning of Ni-based alloy with coinage (IB) metals,10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.10.061
3,20217,"It is found that introducing IB doping metals into Ni surface can shift the d-band center downward from the Fermi level and weaken the adsorption of S on the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) surfaces, and the S tolerance ability increases in the order of Ni, Cu/Ni, Ag/Ni and Au/Ni.",Resistance to sulfur poisoning of Ni-based alloy with coinage (IB) metals,10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.10.061
4,20217,"Nevertheless, on the (1 1 1) surface, the S tolerance ability increases in the order of Ag/Ni (or Cu/Ni), Ni, and Au/Ni.",Resistance to sulfur poisoning of Ni-based alloy with coinage (IB) metals,10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.10.061
5,20217,"When we increase the coverage of the IB metal dopants, we found that not only Au, but Cu and Ag can increase its S tolerance.",Resistance to sulfur poisoning of Ni-based alloy with coinage (IB) metals,10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.10.061
6,20217,"We therefore propose that alloying can increase its S tolerance and alloying with Au would be a better way to increase the resistance to sulfur poisoning of the Ni anode as compared with the pure Ni and the Ag- or, Cu-doped Ni materials.",Resistance to sulfur poisoning of Ni-based alloy with coinage (IB) metals,10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.10.061
