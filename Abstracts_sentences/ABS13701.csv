1,13701,The reaction process for the Ni-SDC cermet anode on the ScSZ electrolyte was examined by impedance spectrometry with wet hydrogen fuels and results were compared with previously obtained data for the Ni-ScSZ anode.,Reaction Process in the Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.190
2,13701,Area specific conductivities (sigma(SDC)) for each rate controlling steps were obtained from the impedance spectra.,Reaction Process in the Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.190
3,13701,"Hydrogen and water vapor pressure (P-H2 and PH2O, respectively) dependencies and temperature (T) dependence of sigma for the Ni-SDC are compared with those of the Ni-ScSZ.",Reaction Process in the Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.190
4,13701,Three rate controlling steps were observed for the Ni-SDC anode.,Reaction Process in the Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.190
5,13701,"The sigma(SDC) obtained at the lowest frequency region (sigma(SDC)(L)) shows slightly negative dependence on the T and it was proportional to the P-H2O. The sigma(SDC)(M) obtained in the middle frequency region is activated with increasing P-H2, PH2O and T This process should be associated with the electrochemical oxidation reaction step accompanied with charge transfer.",Reaction Process in the Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.190
6,13701,"The sigma(SDC)(H) obtained at the highest frequency region is independent on both P-H2 and PH2O, but it is activated with increasing temperature.",Reaction Process in the Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.190
7,13701,"This process appears only in the Ni-SDC anode, and therefore, it is reasonable to assume formation of proton at the Ni/SDC interface.",Reaction Process in the Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.190
8,13701,The difference in reaction processes between the Ni-SDC anode and the Ni-ScSZ anode is discussed.,Reaction Process in the Ni-SDC Cermet Anode,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.190
