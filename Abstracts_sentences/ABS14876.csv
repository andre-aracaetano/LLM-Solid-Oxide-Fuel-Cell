5,14876,Detailed analysis of the Co 2p spectra suggests that the films lose oxygen as a function of temperature.,Near-Ambient Pressure XPS of High-Temperature Surface Chemistry in Sr2Co2O5 Thin Films,10.1007/s11244-015-0532-4
6,14876,"Moreover, deconvolution of the O 1s spectra shows distinct behavior for (114)-oriented SCO films compared to (001)-oriented SCO films, where an additional bulk oxygen species is observed.",Near-Ambient Pressure XPS of High-Temperature Surface Chemistry in Sr2Co2O5 Thin Films,10.1007/s11244-015-0532-4
7,14876,"These findings indicate a change to a perovskite-like oxygen chemistry that occurs more easily in (114) SCO than (001) SCO, likely due to the orientation of oxygen vacancy channels out-of-plane with respect to the film surface.",Near-Ambient Pressure XPS of High-Temperature Surface Chemistry in Sr2Co2O5 Thin Films,10.1007/s11244-015-0532-4
8,14876,This difference in surface chemistry is responsible for the anisotropy of the oxygen surface exchange coefficient of SCO and may contribute to the enhanced ORR kinetics of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta thin films by SCO surface particles observed previously.,Near-Ambient Pressure XPS of High-Temperature Surface Chemistry in Sr2Co2O5 Thin Films,10.1007/s11244-015-0532-4
