3,13635,X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) shows the presence of two structural phases in the series belonging to Pm-3m for Sr0.9Ho0.1CoO3-delta and I4/mmm for Sr0.8Ho0.2CoO3-delta and Sr0.7Ho0.3CoO3-delta .,"Cathode materials Sr1-x Ho x CoO3-δ (SHC, x aparts per thousandcurrency sign 0.3) for IT-SOFC",10.1007/s11581-015-1614-9
4,13635,Electrical conductivity measurements show that the conductivity is all higher than 182 S cm(-1) from 170 to 800 A degrees C. TGA and thermal expansion measurement shows that oxygen vacancies and TEC decrease with increasing x at high temperature.,"Cathode materials Sr1-x Ho x CoO3-δ (SHC, x aparts per thousandcurrency sign 0.3) for IT-SOFC",10.1007/s11581-015-1614-9
5,13635,The TECs are influenced by the concentration of oxygen vacancies and the transition of the Co(III) ions from a low-spin to a high-spin state.,"Cathode materials Sr1-x Ho x CoO3-δ (SHC, x aparts per thousandcurrency sign 0.3) for IT-SOFC",10.1007/s11581-015-1614-9
6,13635,AC impedance measurements in symmetrical cells with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 (LSGM) as an electrolyte show that the ASR and activation energy increase with increasing x. Sr0.9Ho0.1CoO3-delta exhibits the best cathode characteristics with a maximum power density of 839 mW/cm(2).,"Cathode materials Sr1-x Ho x CoO3-δ (SHC, x aparts per thousandcurrency sign 0.3) for IT-SOFC",10.1007/s11581-015-1614-9
