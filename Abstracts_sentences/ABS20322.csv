1,20322,"Using density functional theory methods, we investigate the relative stability of three types of 1D Ni nanostructures.",One-Dimensional Ni-Based Nanostructures and Their Application as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes: A DFT Investigation,10.1021/jp307326p
2,20322,"The first two are conceived from the growth of either I-h or O-h symmetry 0D nanoparticles of Ni, and the third, a Ni (6,3) nanorod (NR), is a hexagonal close-packed structure (both on the surface and along the axis direction).",One-Dimensional Ni-Based Nanostructures and Their Application as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes: A DFT Investigation,10.1021/jp307326p
3,20322,"Our calculations show that 1D Ni NRs as well as Ni double-walled and triple-walled nanotubes, are more stable than comparable-sized Ni 0D nanoparticles.",One-Dimensional Ni-Based Nanostructures and Their Application as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes: A DFT Investigation,10.1021/jp307326p
4,20322,"We explore the potential of NRs as a prototype catalyst by calculating the alloying effect of M (M = Mo, Fe, Co, and Cu) on the adsorption of C and S under full coverage of atomic O. The calculated results suggest that Ni-based ID NRs are highly reactive toward O-binding, an indication that anode oxidation may be achieved at much lower temperatures.",One-Dimensional Ni-Based Nanostructures and Their Application as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes: A DFT Investigation,10.1021/jp307326p
5,20322,"By forming a NiM surface alloy, the binding strength of C and S can be reduced.",One-Dimensional Ni-Based Nanostructures and Their Application as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes: A DFT Investigation,10.1021/jp307326p
6,20322,"In particular, Fe and Cu seem to be the most promising metal dopants in Ni-based ID NR systems for suppressing the formation of C and S (whereas Co promotes the binding of C).",One-Dimensional Ni-Based Nanostructures and Their Application as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes: A DFT Investigation,10.1021/jp307326p
7,20322,"Also, it is found that the Ni0.75Mo0.25 (6,3) NR model collapses its tubular structure due to strong binding with O.",One-Dimensional Ni-Based Nanostructures and Their Application as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes: A DFT Investigation,10.1021/jp307326p
