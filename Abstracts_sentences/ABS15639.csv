6,15639,The thermal expansion coefficient increases slightly from 12.74 x 10(-6) K-1 to 13.28 x 10(-6) K-1 after infiltrating 20 wt% SSC into the SDC scaffold.,Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved oxygen reduction activity and stability,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.068
7,15639,The infiltrated cathode with 20 wt% SSC + 80 wt% SDC shows the electrical conductivity of 15 S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C.

8,15639,"Cathode polarization resistance values as low as 0.05 Omega cm(2), peak power density values as high as 936 mW cm(-2) and stable performance throughout 325 h of operation at 700 degrees C suggest that the cathodes with the 20 wt% SSC-infiltrated SDC are suitable for practical application.",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved oxygen reduction activity and stability,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.068
9,15639,"However, for the SSC infiltrated into the 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia scaffold, the interfacial reaction continues to occur during the stability test at 700 degrees C. SDC is preferred as a scaffold for the infiltration of SSC to ensure long-term operational stability.",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-infiltrated cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells with improved oxygen reduction activity and stability,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.068
