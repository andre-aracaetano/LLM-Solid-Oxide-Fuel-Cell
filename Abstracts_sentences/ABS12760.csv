4,12760,"In spite of the similar crystal structure, growth habits and orientation relationships of NiO-YSZ and CoO-YSZ are different.",Orientation relationship and interfaces in Ni and Co-YSZ cermets prepared from directionally solidified eutectics,10.2478/s11534-009-0030-z
5,12760,"Also the crystallographic behaviour, when cermets are produced, differs.",Orientation relationship and interfaces in Ni and Co-YSZ cermets prepared from directionally solidified eutectics,10.2478/s11534-009-0030-z
6,12760,However the metal-YSZ interfaces are about the most stable ones giving good metal-ceramic adhesion.,Orientation relationship and interfaces in Ni and Co-YSZ cermets prepared from directionally solidified eutectics,10.2478/s11534-009-0030-z
7,12760,"Due to their lamellar microstructure and good metal-ceramic adhesion these composites present long-term stability at working conditions, which makes them good candidates to be used as anodes in solid oxide fuel cells or electrolyzers.",Orientation relationship and interfaces in Ni and Co-YSZ cermets prepared from directionally solidified eutectics,10.2478/s11534-009-0030-z
