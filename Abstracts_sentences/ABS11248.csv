2,11248,"Rheological parameters of the ceramic particle suspensions, directly influencing on casting and production, were investigated as a function of process parameters: solid loading, dispersant and agarose amounts.",Manufacturing of anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells by a new shaping technique using aqueous gel-casting,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.059
3,11248,"Afterwards, a SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9) electrolyte film was deposited on NiO-SDC tubular anode substrates by colloidal spray-coating technique and co-sintering at 1400 degrees C for 5 h. The shrinkage and microstructure of the sintered cell components were studied.",Manufacturing of anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells by a new shaping technique using aqueous gel-casting,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.059
4,11248,"SEM results revealed high porosities of anode (40%) and cathode (La0.5Sr0.5CoO3, LSC), a dense SDC film electrolyte with a thickness of 30 mu m and a good adhesion between the electrolyte, and the anode and cathode.",Manufacturing of anode-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells by a new shaping technique using aqueous gel-casting,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.059
