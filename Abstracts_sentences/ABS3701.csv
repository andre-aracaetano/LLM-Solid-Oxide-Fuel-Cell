1,3701,The power output of solid oxide fuel cells using samarium doped ceria electrolyte fabricated by a single-step co-firing process is enhanced by using a surface modification strategy.,Surface Modification Allows High Performance for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated by a Single-step Co-firing Process,10.1002/fuce.201700098
2,3701,"This strategy leads to the cell performance improving from 401 mW cm(-2) to 523 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C, with an increase of more than 30% been achieved, which is very encouraging considering the large electrolyte thickness (approximate to 500 mu m).",Surface Modification Allows High Performance for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated by a Single-step Co-firing Process,10.1002/fuce.201700098
3,3701,"The cell resistance, including both polarization resistance and the ohmic resistance, decreases dramatically by employing the surface modification method.",Surface Modification Allows High Performance for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated by a Single-step Co-firing Process,10.1002/fuce.201700098
4,3701,"Those results reveal that the surface modification improves the cathode/electrolyte interfacial contact, which results in a reduced total cell resistance and leads to a better cell performance.",Surface Modification Allows High Performance for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated by a Single-step Co-firing Process,10.1002/fuce.201700098
