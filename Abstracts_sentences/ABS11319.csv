1,11319,"Oxy-apatites are one of the most promising oxide ion conducting electrolytes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells, those operating close to 950 K. La-9.33(SiO4)(6)O-2 has the simplest stoichiometry among the oxy-apatite family of compounds, and the range of oxide ion conductivity reported for dense ceramic pellets is very high, almost two orders of magnitude at a given temperature.",Microstructure and Oxide Ion Conductivity in a Dense La9.33(SiO4)6O2 Oxy-Apatite,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03032.x
