1,9460,Microstructural evolution of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9/NiO (CGO/NiO) co-infiltrated nanoparticles in Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 (STN94 YSZ) anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is investigated during electrochemical testing in a symmetric cell setup.,Instability and growth of nanoscale Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9/NiO infiltrate in Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.051
2,9460,The CGO/NiO infiltrated symmetric cells were subjected to varying atmospheres of H2O/H-2 between 650 and 850 degrees C and characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.,Instability and growth of nanoscale Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9/NiO infiltrate in Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.051
3,9460,"Analytical high resolution transmission electron microscopy showed that the CGO/NiO infiltrate was found to coalesce and grow from an indistinguishable CGO/NiO fluorite structure of an average diameter of 5 nm to individual well-connected, but phase-separated, CGO and Ni particles of 50 nm in average.",Instability and growth of nanoscale Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9/NiO infiltrate in Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.051
4,9460,This study confirms that instability and growth of CGO/NiO infiltrates in STN-based SOFC electrodes affect the morphology and can potentially be linked to reported losses in electrochemical performance.,Instability and growth of nanoscale Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9/NiO infiltrate in Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 anodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.02.051
