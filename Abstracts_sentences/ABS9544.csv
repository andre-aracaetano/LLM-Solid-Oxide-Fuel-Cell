1,9544,"For detailed thermal modelling of SOFC stacks, in particular research of improved thermal management, start-up and shut-down processes, thermal contact resistances (TCR) are required input parameters.",Thermal contact resistance in solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.031
2,9544,"These parameters are difficult to access analytically and strongly depend on temperature, geometry and material properties of the contact.",Thermal contact resistance in solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.031
3,9544,"Therefore, this work presents an experimental study of thermal contact resistance between different components of one SOFC stack repeating unit at varying temperatures up to typical operating temperatures (800 degrees C).",Thermal contact resistance in solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.031
