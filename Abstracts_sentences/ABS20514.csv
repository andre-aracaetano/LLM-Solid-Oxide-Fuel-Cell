1,20514,"Joining of NiO-YSZ cermet with 316 stainless steel was carried out using B-Ni3 brazing alloy (4.5 wt% Si, 3.2 wt% B, 0.06 wt% C, 0.02 wt% P, Ni-balance, m.p. 982-1038 degrees C) to realize reliable sealing of the NiO-YSZ cermet anode/316 stainless steel interconnect structure in a SOFC.",Interfacial morphologies between NiO-YSZ fuel electrode/316 stainless steel as the interconnect material and B-Ni3 brazing alloy in a solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.076
2,20514,"In the present research, interfacial (chemical) reactions during brazing at the NiO-YSZ/316 stainless steel interconnect were promoted by either of the two processing methods, (a) addition of an electroless nickel-plate to NiO-YSZ cermet as a coating or (b) deposition of titanium layer onto NiO-YSZ cermet by magnetron plasma sputtering method, with relevant process variables and procedures optimized during either of the pre-processing.",Interfacial morphologies between NiO-YSZ fuel electrode/316 stainless steel as the interconnect material and B-Ni3 brazing alloy in a solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.08.076
