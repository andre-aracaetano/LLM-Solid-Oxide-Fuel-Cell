1,9671,"Hybrid systems, which are based on a micro gas turbine (muGT) and a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), are expected to achieve much higher efficiency than traditional muGT's.",Cycle analysis of gas turbine-fuel cell cycle hybrid micro generation system,10.1115/1.1787505
2,9671,"In this paper the effects of cycle design parameters on the performance and feasibility of a,muGT-SOFC hybrid system of 30 kW power output are investigated.",Cycle analysis of gas turbine-fuel cell cycle hybrid micro generation system,10.1115/1.1787505
3,9671,It is confirmed that the hybrid system is much superior to a recuperated gas turbine in terms of its power generation efficiency and aptitude for small distributed generation.,Cycle analysis of gas turbine-fuel cell cycle hybrid micro generation system,10.1115/1.1787505
4,9671,"General design strategy is found that less direct fuel input to a combustor as well as higher recuperator effectiveness leads to higher generation efficiency, while higher steam-carbon ratio moderates requirements for the material strength.",Cycle analysis of gas turbine-fuel cell cycle hybrid micro generation system,10.1115/1.1787505
5,9671,The best possible conceptual design of a 30-kW muGT-SOFC hybrid system is shown to give power generation efficiency over 65% (lower heating value).,Cycle analysis of gas turbine-fuel cell cycle hybrid micro generation system,10.1115/1.1787505
