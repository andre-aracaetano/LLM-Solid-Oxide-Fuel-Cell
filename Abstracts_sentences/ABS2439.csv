4,2439,The enhancement of Sr diffusion during cathodic polarization is explained by a shift to higher values of the thermodynamic activity of Sr at the LSCF/GDC interface that also leads to a decrease in oxygen potential.,Effect of polarization on Sr and Zr diffusion behavior in LSCF/GDC/YSZ system,10.1016/j.ssi.2014.04.002
