1,1196,We investigate the utilization of anode exhaust gas from high temperature fuel cells as gasification or reforming agent in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) power plants.,A mass integration concept for high temperature fuel cell plants,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.022
2,1196,The minimal anodic recirculation ratio is determined by two approaches: based on stoichiometric considerations and using detailed modeling of all process units.,A mass integration concept for high temperature fuel cell plants,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.022
3,1196,"In the latter case, the risk of carbon formation and system heat integration are considered.",A mass integration concept for high temperature fuel cell plants,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.022
4,1196,The results indicate that the stoichiometric approach can be used as a shortcut method only for the SOFC systems due to good agreements with the detailed calculations.,A mass integration concept for high temperature fuel cell plants,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.022
5,1196,"Furthermore, the mass integration concept is a feasible option for a wide variety of fuels in SOFC plants thanks to their relatively high operating temperatures.",A mass integration concept for high temperature fuel cell plants,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.022
6,1196,"In MCFC systems, significantly higher recycle ratios are required to suppress carbon deposition which makes this concept unattractive.",A mass integration concept for high temperature fuel cell plants,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.022
