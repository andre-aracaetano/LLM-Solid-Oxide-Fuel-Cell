1,20522,The composite cathode LaBiMn2O6-Sm0.2Ce0.8OL9 (LBM-SDC) was prepared by glycine-nitrate combustion method.,Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of LaBiMn2O6-Sm0.2Ce0.8OL9 Composite Cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.11862/CJIC.2019.081
2,20522,"The phase and morphology evolution of the composite cathode were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively.",Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of LaBiMn2O6-Sm0.2Ce0.8OL9 Composite Cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.11862/CJIC.2019.081
3,20522,"The results showed that LBM had good chemical stability with SDC at 1 000 degrees C. Due to the introduction of SDC, the length of the thriple-phase boundary was extended and the thermal matching between the cathode and the electrolyte was enhanced, resulting in an improvement in the electrochemical performance of the composite cathode.",Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of LaBiMn2O6-Sm0.2Ce0.8OL9 Composite Cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.11862/CJIC.2019.081
4,20522,"The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) results indicated that the cathode polarization resistance (1?,) decreased steadily with the addition of SDC.",Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of LaBiMn2O6-Sm0.2Ce0.8OL9 Composite Cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.11862/CJIC.2019.081
5,20522,"The optimum addition of 30%(w/w) SDC in the composite cathode leads to the lowest R, of 0.186 Sicm(2) at 700 degrees C in air, which is 74% less than the pristine LBM cathode (Rp=0.717 SZ cm(2)).",Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of LaBiMn2O6-Sm0.2Ce0.8OL9 Composite Cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.11862/CJIC.2019.081
6,20522,This is because an additional oxygen ion conduction path is generated after the introduction of SDC; thereby the oxygen reduction reaction is promoted.,Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of LaBiMn2O6-Sm0.2Ce0.8OL9 Composite Cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.11862/CJIC.2019.081
7,20522,The maximum power density of the electrolyte-support single cell Ni-SDC/SDC/LBM-30% SDC reached 234 mWcm' at 700 degrees C.,Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of LaBiMn2O6-Sm0.2Ce0.8OL9 Composite Cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.11862/CJIC.2019.081
8,20522,"The power density maintains a stable value at 230 mWcm' throughout a test period of 90 h, indicating that LBM-30%SDC had sufficient stability during the operation.",Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of LaBiMn2O6-Sm0.2Ce0.8OL9 Composite Cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.11862/CJIC.2019.081
9,20522,The oxygen partial pressure measurement indicated that the oxygen molecule adsorption-diffusion process is the reaction rate-limiting step of the composite cathode.,Preparation and Electrochemical Properties of LaBiMn2O6-Sm0.2Ce0.8OL9 Composite Cathode for IT-SOFCs,10.11862/CJIC.2019.081
