3,7339,"The performance pseudohomogeneous model of the reactor, consisting of the catalytic ESR using a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, has been developed based on the principles of classical kinetics and thermodynamics through a complex reaction scheme and a Lagmuir-Hishelwood kinetic pattern.",Bioethanol steam reforming for ecological syngas and electricity production using a fuel cell SOFC system,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.047
4,7339,"The resulting model is employed to evaluate the effect of several design and operation parameters on the process (tube diameter between 3.81 and 7.62 cm, catalyst pellets diameter 0.1-0.5 cm, temperature 673-873 K, space time (theta) 1-10 (g min/cm(3)) and water/ethanol molar ratio (R-AE), 1-6).",Bioethanol steam reforming for ecological syngas and electricity production using a fuel cell SOFC system,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.047
5,7339,It can be concluded that higher water/ethanol ratio (R-AE = 5: 1) and temperatures (above 773 K) favors hydrogen yield (Y-H = 4.1) and,Bioethanol steam reforming for ecological syngas and electricity production using a fuel cell SOFC system,10.1016/j.cej.2007.03.047
