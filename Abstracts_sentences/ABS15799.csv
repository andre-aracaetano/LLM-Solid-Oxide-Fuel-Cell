1,15799,"A one-pot, soft-chemistry, surfactant-assisted co-assembly approach to prepare La(1-x)Sr(x)WnO(3) (LSM)/Y(2)O(3)-stabilized ZrO(2) (YSZ) nanocomposites for use as solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes has been investigated.","Lanthanum strontium manganite/yttria-stabilized zirconia nanocomposites derived from a surfactant assisted, co-assembled mesoporous phase",10.1021/ja027881p
2,15799,This material with sub-hundred nanometer grain sizes for each phase is the first such nanocomposite where aqueous-based precursors of each component are incorporated in a single synthetic step.,"Lanthanum strontium manganite/yttria-stabilized zirconia nanocomposites derived from a surfactant assisted, co-assembled mesoporous phase",10.1021/ja027881p
3,15799,"This approach utilizes the co-assembly of an anionic yttrium/zirconium acetatoglycolate gel, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as the cationic surfactant template, and inorganic La, Mn, and Sr salts under alkaline aqueous conditions.","Lanthanum strontium manganite/yttria-stabilized zirconia nanocomposites derived from a surfactant assisted, co-assembled mesoporous phase",10.1021/ja027881p
4,15799,"The resulting as-synthesized product is an amorphous mesostructured organic/inorganic composite, which is transformed to a mesoporous inorganic oxide with nanocrystalline YSZ walls upon calcination.","Lanthanum strontium manganite/yttria-stabilized zirconia nanocomposites derived from a surfactant assisted, co-assembled mesoporous phase",10.1021/ja027881p
5,15799,"Calcination to temperatures above 600 degreesC lead to collapse of the mesopores followed by further crystallization of the nanocrystalline YSZ phase and a final crystallization of the LSM perovskite phase above 1000 degreesC. Both the fully crystalline LSMNSZ and,the mesoporous intermediate phase have been investigated for phase homogeneity by TEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping and spot analysis which confirm the dispersion of LSM within a YSZ matrix at the nanometer scale.","Lanthanum strontium manganite/yttria-stabilized zirconia nanocomposites derived from a surfactant assisted, co-assembled mesoporous phase",10.1021/ja027881p
6,15799,Impedance spectroscopy analysis of LSMNSZ nanocomposite electrodes demonstrate a low polarization resistance of around 0.2 Omega cm(2) with an activation energy (E(a)) as low as 1.42 eV. Cathodic polarization studies show stable current densities over a 40 h test demonstration.,"Lanthanum strontium manganite/yttria-stabilized zirconia nanocomposites derived from a surfactant assisted, co-assembled mesoporous phase",10.1021/ja027881p
