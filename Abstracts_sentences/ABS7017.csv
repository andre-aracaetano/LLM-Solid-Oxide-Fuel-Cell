2,7017,"The electrochemical performance, physical properties and rate-determining step of BaCo1-xNbxO3-delta as a cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) were investigated.",BaCo1-xNbxO3-δ as a Promising Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/slct.201902805
3,7017,The introduction of Nb in BaCo0.8Nb0.2O3-delta(BCN20)brings a stable cubic phase and a relative lower TEC (similar to 16.94x10-6 K-1) compared BCN20 with other Co-based perovskites.,BaCo1-xNbxO3-δ as a Promising Cathode for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/slct.201902805
