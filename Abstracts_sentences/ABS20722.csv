1,20722,A novel disk-shaped packed bed micro-reactor containing Rh/ceria/zirconia nanoparticles is investigated with respect to catalytic butane-to-syngas processing at moderate temperatures of 550 degrees C.,Disk-shaped packed bed micro-reactor for butane-to-syngas processing,10.1016/j.ces.2008.06.024
2,20722,"The main goal of this study is the development of an efficient butane processor which can be integrated into a micro solid oxide fuel cell system due to its small size, easily packaged geometry in layered microdevices, high compactness, low pressure drop, and low reaction temperature.",Disk-shaped packed bed micro-reactor for butane-to-syngas processing,10.1016/j.ces.2008.06.024
3,20722,"It is shown that Rh/ceria/zirconia has an excellent long-term stability and achieves very high C4H10 conversion and syngas selectivity, considering the relatively low operating temperature.",Disk-shaped packed bed micro-reactor for butane-to-syngas processing,10.1016/j.ces.2008.06.024
4,20722,"The yields of H-2 and CO can be increased up to 71% and 57%, respectively, by optimizing operational parameters such as the C/O ratio and the total inlet flow rate.",Disk-shaped packed bed micro-reactor for butane-to-syngas processing,10.1016/j.ces.2008.06.024
5,20722,"The introduced disk-shaped packed bed reactor shows significant advantages in catalytic behavior, at a 6.5 times lower pressure drop compared to an equivalent tubular packed bed reactor.",Disk-shaped packed bed micro-reactor for butane-to-syngas processing,10.1016/j.ces.2008.06.024
6,20722,"This increased catalytic performance is pursued extensively by investigating possible reaction pathways in three regions of the radial-flow reactor, leading to the significant discovery of a threefold pathway of syngas production on a single catalyst.",Disk-shaped packed bed micro-reactor for butane-to-syngas processing,10.1016/j.ces.2008.06.024
7,20722,"To this end, it is shown that the excellent selectivities to H-2 and CO for high flow rates are due to the combination of partial oxidation, steam reforming, and dry reforming Of C4H10, indicating one direct and two indirect reaction paths.",Disk-shaped packed bed micro-reactor for butane-to-syngas processing,10.1016/j.ces.2008.06.024
