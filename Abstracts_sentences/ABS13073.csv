1,13073,Doped and co-doped ceria ceramics are used as electrolyte materials in solid oxide fuel cells.,Effect of Dopants and Sintering Method on the Properties of Ceria-Based Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs Applications,10.1007/s11837-018-2928-7
2,13073,"In this work, ceria-based oxides, Ce0.90Gd0.06Y0.02M0.02O2-delta (M = Ca, Fe, La, and Sr) were prepared by conventional as well as microwave processing from the precursors prepared by the mixed oxide method.",Effect of Dopants and Sintering Method on the Properties of Ceria-Based Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs Applications,10.1007/s11837-018-2928-7
3,13073,The consolidated calcined powders in pellet form were sintered in microwave energy at 1400A degrees C for 20 min and in an electric furnace of IR radiation at 1400A degrees C for 6 h. The x-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that all the compositions were crystallized into a cubic fluorite structure.,Effect of Dopants and Sintering Method on the Properties of Ceria-Based Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs Applications,10.1007/s11837-018-2928-7
4,13073,Surface morphology of the sintered products was studied using scanning electron microscopy and the microhardness was investigated using the Vickers hardness test.,Effect of Dopants and Sintering Method on the Properties of Ceria-Based Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs Applications,10.1007/s11837-018-2928-7
5,13073,"The comparative results analysis shows that the microwave-sintered samples have uniform grain growth, higher density and higher microhardness than the corresponding conventionally sintered products.",Effect of Dopants and Sintering Method on the Properties of Ceria-Based Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs Applications,10.1007/s11837-018-2928-7
6,13073,The microwave-sintered sample of composition Ce0.90Gd0.06Y0.02Sr0.02O2-delta was found to have the highest microhardness among the four compositions due to its high density and smallest grain size.,Effect of Dopants and Sintering Method on the Properties of Ceria-Based Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs Applications,10.1007/s11837-018-2928-7
