1,4512,"The synthesis and performance of (La(0.75)Sr(0.25))(Cr(0.5)Mn(0.5))O(3)/Y(2)O(3)-ZrO(2) (LSCM/YSZ) composites are investigated as alternative anodes for the direct utilization of methane (i.e., natural gas) in solid oxide fuel cells.",(La0.75Sr0.25)(Cr0.5Mn0.5)O3/YSZ composite anodes for methane oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.09.010
2,4512,Addition of YSZ phase greatly improves the adhesion and reduces the electrode polarization resistance of the LSCM/YSZ composite anodes.,(La0.75Sr0.25)(Cr0.5Mn0.5)O3/YSZ composite anodes for methane oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.09.010
3,4512,LSCM/YSZ composite anodes show reasonably good performance for the methane oxidation reaction in wet CH(4) and the best electrode performance was achieved for the composite with LSCM contents of 50-60 wt.% with polarization resistances of 2-3 Omega cm(2) in 97% CH(4)/3% H(2)O at 850 degrees C.,(La0.75Sr0.25)(Cr0.5Mn0.5)O3/YSZ composite anodes for methane oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.09.010
4,4512,The electrode impedance for the methane oxidation in wet CH(4) on the LSCM/YSZ composite anodes was characterized by three separable arcs and the electrode behavior could be explained based on the ALS model for the reaction on the MIEC electrode.,(La0.75Sr0.25)(Cr0.5Mn0.5)O3/YSZ composite anodes for methane oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.09.010
5,4512,The results indicate that electrocatalytic activity of the LSCM/YSZ composite anodes for the methane oxidation is likely limited by the oxygen vacancy diffusion in the substituted lanthanum chromite-based materials.,(La0.75Sr0.25)(Cr0.5Mn0.5)O3/YSZ composite anodes for methane oxidation reaction in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2005.09.010
