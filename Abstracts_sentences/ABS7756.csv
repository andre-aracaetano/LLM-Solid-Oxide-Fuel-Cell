1,7756,"This study reports the micro-structural and electrochemical properties of metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs) with an La(0.8)Sra(2)MnO(3-d) (LSM)/8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) composite cathode, fabricated at room temperature using the aerosol deposition process (ADP).",Metal-supported SOFC with an aerosol deposited in-situ LSM and 8YSZ composite cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.039
2,7756,The composite cathode fabricated with the ADP technique shows uniform distribution of components and pores and the interface between the cathode and the electrolyte displays excellent joining properties.,Metal-supported SOFC with an aerosol deposited in-situ LSM and 8YSZ composite cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.039
3,7756,"The area specific resistance (ASR) of the ADP-LSM/8YSZ sample is approximately 1.50 Omega cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, so this sample shows a significantly lower ASR value than the values usually reported for samples fabricated by the in-situ treatment method for MS-SOFCs.",Metal-supported SOFC with an aerosol deposited in-situ LSM and 8YSZ composite cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.039
4,7756,The power density of the cells with the ADP-LSM/8YSZ cathode coated on MS-SOFCs shows a maximum value of 0.38 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and stable performance in the severe thermal durability test.,Metal-supported SOFC with an aerosol deposited in-situ LSM and 8YSZ composite cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.039
5,7756,"Therefore, these research results can broaden the opportunities for adoption of the ADP coating processes to fabricate cathode materials in MS-SOFCs.",Metal-supported SOFC with an aerosol deposited in-situ LSM and 8YSZ composite cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.10.039
