1,4463,The present work investigates electrochemical performance of anode-supported protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) with composite cathodes consisting of an electronic conductive perovskite oxide and a protonic conductive BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta(BZCYYb).,Performance Comparison of Perovskite Composite Cathodes with BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δin Anode-Supported Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abab26

3,4463,"Thus, to enhance cathode performance, three conventional perovskite oxides, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta(LSCF), La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta(LSC), and La0.6Ba0.4CoO3-delta(LBC), that are commonly used in traditional solid oxide fuel cells, are evaluated here as the electronic conductive phase in cathodes containing BZCYYb.",Performance Comparison of Perovskite Composite Cathodes with BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δin Anode-Supported Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abab26
4,4463,Results show that all three of these electronic conductive perovskite oxides are compatible with BZCYYb and stably function as a cathode in PCFC operation.,Performance Comparison of Perovskite Composite Cathodes with BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δin Anode-Supported Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abab26
5,4463,"Comparison among these three composite cathodes reveals that the PCFC with the LBC-BZCYYb cathode demonstrate the highest performance, e.g., maximum power densities of 0.57 W cm(-2)at 600 degrees C and 1.0 W cm(-2)at 700 degrees C.",Performance Comparison of Perovskite Composite Cathodes with BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δin Anode-Supported Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abab26
6,4463,"In addition, impedance spectra and fitting analysis reveal that the low electrode polarization resistance in the lower frequency range of the LBC-BZCYYb cathode contributes to the PCFC performance.",Performance Comparison of Perovskite Composite Cathodes with BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δin Anode-Supported Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abab26
7,4463,"In summary, composites of perovskite oxides, particularly LBC-BZCYYb, are suitable as cathode material to achieve high performance as well as stable operation in PCFCs.",Performance Comparison of Perovskite Composite Cathodes with BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δin Anode-Supported Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abab26
