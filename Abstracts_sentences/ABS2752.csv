1,2752,Powders of Pr0.70Sr0.30MnO3 +/-delta (PSM) and Nd0.70Sr0.30MnO3 +/-delta (NSM) compositions are being investigated as alternative cathode materials for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells.,Synthesis of Pr0.70Sr0.30MnO3±δ and Nd0.70Sr0.30MnO3±δ Powders by Solution-Combustion Technique,10.1590/S1516-14392011005000024
2,2752,The compositions were synthesized by a solution-combustion method using metal nitrates and urea as fuel.,Synthesis of Pr0.70Sr0.30MnO3±δ and Nd0.70Sr0.30MnO3±δ Powders by Solution-Combustion Technique,10.1590/S1516-14392011005000024
3,2752,Combustion synthesis is a highly suitable synthesis route for achieving fine and homogeneous powders at low temperatures.,Synthesis of Pr0.70Sr0.30MnO3±δ and Nd0.70Sr0.30MnO3±δ Powders by Solution-Combustion Technique,10.1590/S1516-14392011005000024
4,2752,Single phase pseudo-perovskite was obtained by X-ray diffraction after heat treatment of PSM and NSM powders at 900 degrees C. The synthesized and milling powders had an average particle size between 0.27 to 0.07 mu m. Chemical analyses of the powders calcined was performed by X-ray fluorescence and morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy.,Synthesis of Pr0.70Sr0.30MnO3±δ and Nd0.70Sr0.30MnO3±δ Powders by Solution-Combustion Technique,10.1590/S1516-14392011005000024
5,2752,"The results were compared with literature values, indicating characteristics adjusted for preparation of ceramic suspensions.",Synthesis of Pr0.70Sr0.30MnO3±δ and Nd0.70Sr0.30MnO3±δ Powders by Solution-Combustion Technique,10.1590/S1516-14392011005000024
