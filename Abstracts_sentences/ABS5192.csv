1,5192,Ferritic stainless steels have become promising candidate materials for interconnects in tubular metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell stacks.,Evaluation of commercial alloys as cathode current collector for metal-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.corsci.2008.10.010
2,5192,A number of ferritic alloys containing between 18 and 26 mass% Cr and discrete changes in minor alloying elements and reactive elements were isothermally oxidized at 800 degrees C in air and their electrical resistance was measured with the objective of obtaining an overview of the properties relevant for applications for cathode side interconnect.,Evaluation of commercial alloys as cathode current collector for metal-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.corsci.2008.10.010

4,5192,"The electrical conductivity of the steels forming this kind of oxide layer was higher than the measured for only Cr2O3 former or oxide dispersion strengthened alloys and increased when the alloy contained Ti or Nb. Oxide scale spallation was observed for F18TNb and E-Brite, both containing Si.",Evaluation of commercial alloys as cathode current collector for metal-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.corsci.2008.10.010
5,5192,"The influence of different cyclic oxidations was studied for the Crofer22APU steel, showing an irregular oxide growth as well as an increase in conductivity of the oxide scale formed when 12-h cycles were applied.",Evaluation of commercial alloys as cathode current collector for metal-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.corsci.2008.10.010
