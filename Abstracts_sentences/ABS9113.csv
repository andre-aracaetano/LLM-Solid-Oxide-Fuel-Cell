6,9113,"Chemical stability of the BZY oxide was evaluated upon exposure to CO2 for 3 h at 900 degrees C, and BZY showed no degradation in the testing conditions.",Design of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ protonic conductor to improve the electrochemical performance in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs),10.1002/fuce.200700045
7,9113,"Fuel cell polarisation curves on symmetric Pt/BZY/Pt cells of different thicknesses were measured at 500-700 degrees C. Improvements in the electrochemical performance were obtained using alternative materials for electrodes, such as NiO-BZY cermet and LSCF (La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3) and reducing the thickness of the BZY electrolyte, reaching a maximum value of power density of 7.0 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C.",Design of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-δ protonic conductor to improve the electrochemical performance in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs),10.1002/fuce.200700045
