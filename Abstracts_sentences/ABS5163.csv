1,5163,Ni1-xCoxO-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) composite is investigated as an anode material for solid oxide fuel cells with methanol as fuel.,Carbon-resistant Ni1-xCox-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode for solid oxide fuel cells fed with methanol,10.1016/j.cattod.2017.03.060
2,5163,"The interaction between NiO and SDC phases is enhanced by Co. Besides, Co reduces the particle size and improves the dispersion of Ni1-xCoxO by inhibiting the grain growth of NiO, which results in larger three-phase boundary in the anode layer.",Carbon-resistant Ni1-xCox-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode for solid oxide fuel cells fed with methanol,10.1016/j.cattod.2017.03.060
3,5163,The Ni0.9Co0.1-SDC anode shows the lowest polarization resistance.,Carbon-resistant Ni1-xCox-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode for solid oxide fuel cells fed with methanol,10.1016/j.cattod.2017.03.060
4,5163,A maximum power density of 675 mW cm(-2) is achieved by a single cell with Ni0.9Co0.1-SDC anode and SDC-carbonate composite electrolyte at 700 degrees C. Co also increases the resistance to carbon deposition of the anode and decreases the graphitization degree of deposited carbon with methanol as fuel.,Carbon-resistant Ni1-xCox-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode for solid oxide fuel cells fed with methanol,10.1016/j.cattod.2017.03.060
5,5163,The cell with the Ni0.9Co0.1-SDC anode exhibits a stable performance during a 500-min discharge period.,Carbon-resistant Ni1-xCox-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode for solid oxide fuel cells fed with methanol,10.1016/j.cattod.2017.03.060
