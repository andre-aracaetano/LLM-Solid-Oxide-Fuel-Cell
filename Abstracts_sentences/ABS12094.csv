4,12094,The area specific resistances (ASR) of a La2NiO4+delta/YSZ/La2NiO4+delta symmetrical cell were determined between 600 and 800 degrees C.,La2NiO4+δ as cathode for SOFC: Reactivity study with YSZ and CGO electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.077
5,12094,The ASR values increases with time suggesting a chemical reaction between the cells components.,La2NiO4+δ as cathode for SOFC: Reactivity study with YSZ and CGO electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.077
6,12094,Reactivity studies were carried out between La2NiO4+delta and both YSZ and CGO electrolytes.,La2NiO4+δ as cathode for SOFC: Reactivity study with YSZ and CGO electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.077
7,12094,"The reactivity studies were performed by means of two different tests: La2NiO4+delta films deposited onto both electrolytes and heated at 900 degrees C for 72 h (Pellet Test), and intimate mixture of La2NiO4+delta with either YSZ or CGO powders were heat treated at 900 degrees C during 2 h (Powders Test).",La2NiO4+δ as cathode for SOFC: Reactivity study with YSZ and CGO electrolytes,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.077
