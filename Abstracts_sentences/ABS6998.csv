4,6998,Our experimental results show that the employment of platinum catalysts in the post-combustor or rhodium catalysts in the reformer for total oxidation of butane by air combined with an electrically heated wire led to a faster and more efficient start-up than conventional start-up methods using only electrical energy.,Fast and exergy efficient start-up of micro-solid oxide fuel cell systems by using the reformer or the post-combustor for start-up heating,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.04.020
