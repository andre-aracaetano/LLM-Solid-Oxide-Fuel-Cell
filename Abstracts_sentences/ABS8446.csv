1,8446,La27W4NbO55-delta (LWNO) has been tested as electrolyte for proton conductor Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (PC-SOFCs).,Evaluation of lanthanum tungstates as electrolytes for proton conductors Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.102
2,8446,"For this purpose, different electrodes and composite electrodes are considered, including: La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta, La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xFexO3-delta, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta, SrFe0.75Nb0.25O3-delta and NiO. Chemical compatibility between the cell components is investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).",Evaluation of lanthanum tungstates as electrolytes for proton conductors Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.102
3,8446,"Furthermore, area specific resistance (ASR) for the different electrodes is determined in symmetrical cells by impedance spectroscopy.",Evaluation of lanthanum tungstates as electrolytes for proton conductors Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.102
4,8446,XRPD and EDS analysis does not reveal significant bulk reactivity between most of these electrodes and LWNO electrolyte in the typical operating temperature range of an SOFC (600-900 degrees C).,Evaluation of lanthanum tungstates as electrolytes for proton conductors Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.102
5,8446,"However, minor interdiffusion of elements at the electrolyte/electrode interface has negative effects on both the ohmic losses and electrode polarization of the cells.",Evaluation of lanthanum tungstates as electrolytes for proton conductors Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.102
6,8446,"ASR values are significantly improved by using a porous buffer layer of Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (CGO), deposited between the electrolyte and electrode materials, to prevent reactivity.",Evaluation of lanthanum tungstates as electrolytes for proton conductors Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.102
7,8446,"A single cell with a 350 mu m-thick electrolyte, NiO-CGO and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta-CGO composite as anode and cathode, respectively, generates maximum power densities of 140 and 18 mWcm(-2) at 900 and 650 degrees C, respectively.",Evaluation of lanthanum tungstates as electrolytes for proton conductors Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.102
