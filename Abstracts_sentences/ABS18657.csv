1,18657,Elevating the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the cathode material is crucial to the development and widespread application of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Attenuating a metal-oxygen bond of a double perovskite oxide via anion doping to enhance its catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction,10.1039/d0ta04820h
2,18657,"Herein, a novel SOFC cathode, with superior ORR activity, is designed by incorporating F anions at O-sites of a double perovskite oxide (Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta, SFM).",Attenuating a metal-oxygen bond of a double perovskite oxide via anion doping to enhance its catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction,10.1039/d0ta04820h
3,18657,"The resulting F-doped SFM cathode (Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-x-delta Fx, SFMF,x= 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3) exhibits improved crystal structure symmetry and enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the ORR.",Attenuating a metal-oxygen bond of a double perovskite oxide via anion doping to enhance its catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction,10.1039/d0ta04820h
4,18657,"At 800 degrees C, the polarization resistance of F-doped SFM is significantly decreased to 0.072 omega cm(2), which can be ascribed to the enhanced oxygen reduction capacity.",Attenuating a metal-oxygen bond of a double perovskite oxide via anion doping to enhance its catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction,10.1039/d0ta04820h
5,18657,"Moreover, F-doping reduces the metal-oxygen bond energy and accelerates the transportation of O-ions during the electrochemical process, resulting in significantly enhanced ORR activity.",Attenuating a metal-oxygen bond of a double perovskite oxide via anion doping to enhance its catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction,10.1039/d0ta04820h
