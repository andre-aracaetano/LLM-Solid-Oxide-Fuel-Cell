1,5008,"We examined the carbon deposition behavior on a nickel-based anode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operated at 1073 K under dry or humidified methane (CH4) Stream conditions, by observing the anode microstructures, open circuit voltages (OCVs) and anode/electrolyte interfacial resistance.",Carbon Deposition Behavior in Methane Stream on Nickel Based Anode in SOFCs Operated at 1073 K,10.5796/electrochemistry.76.747
2,5008,"When the measurement was made in the dry methane stream, the OCV gradually decreased and the interfacial resistance increased, with carbon deposition on the whole anode.",Carbon Deposition Behavior in Methane Stream on Nickel Based Anode in SOFCs Operated at 1073 K,10.5796/electrochemistry.76.747
3,5008,"In a humidified methane stream with a steam/carbon ratio (S/C) of 0.25 or 0.50, the OCV gradually decreased while the interfacial resistance was nearly constant and there was no carbon deposition near the anode/electrolyte interface.",Carbon Deposition Behavior in Methane Stream on Nickel Based Anode in SOFCs Operated at 1073 K,10.5796/electrochemistry.76.747
4,5008,It is shown that the OCV decrease under the humidified methane conditions is associated with the decrease in the reaction sites for steam reforming.,Carbon Deposition Behavior in Methane Stream on Nickel Based Anode in SOFCs Operated at 1073 K,10.5796/electrochemistry.76.747
5,5008,It is expected that the OCV decrease is an indication of carbon deposition.,Carbon Deposition Behavior in Methane Stream on Nickel Based Anode in SOFCs Operated at 1073 K,10.5796/electrochemistry.76.747
