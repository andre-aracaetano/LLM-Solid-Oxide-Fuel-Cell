1,14477,"SmBaCo2O5+d (SBCO) showed the lowest observed Area Specific Resistance (ASR) value in the LnBaCo(2)O(5+d) (Ln: Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) oxide system for the overall temperature ranges tested.",Electrochemical properties of composite cathodes using Sm doped layered perovskite for intermediate temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.02.211
2,14477,The ASR of a composite cathode (mixture of SBCO and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-d) on a Ce0.9Gd0.1O2- d (CGO91) electrolyte decreased with respect to the CGO91 content; the percolation limit was also achieved for a 50 wt% SBCO and 50 wt% CGO91 (SBCO50) composite cathode.,Electrochemical properties of composite cathodes using Sm doped layered perovskite for intermediate temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.02.211
3,14477,The ASRs of SBCO50 on the dense CGO91 electrolyte in the overall temperature range of 500-750 degrees C were relatively lower than those of SBCO50 on the CGO91 coated dense 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) electrolyte for the same temperature range.,Electrochemical properties of composite cathodes using Sm doped layered perovskite for intermediate temperature-operating solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.02.211
