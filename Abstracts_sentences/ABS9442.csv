1,9442,"The oxidation resistance and electrical contact property of a low-Cr-containing alloy, named as FeCro, was examined as metallic interconnect at 750 degrees C in simulated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode environment.",Characterization of a new Fe-based alloy as metallic interconnect in SOFC anode environment,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.197
2,9442,"This alloy was proved to process excellent oxidation resistance at 750 degrees C in N-2 + 4.85% H-2 + 3% H2O (g) for up to 1000 h. The thermally grown oxide scale, around 1 mu m thick, consisted of Mn doped (Mn, Cr)(3)O-4 spinel with Cr2O3 sub layer.",Characterization of a new Fe-based alloy as metallic interconnect in SOFC anode environment,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.197
3,9442,"The oxidation kinetics obeyed the parabolic law with two rate constants, 5.23 x 10(-14) g(2) cm(-4) s(-1) (0-100 h) and 3.85 x 10(-15) g(2) cm(-4)",Characterization of a new Fe-based alloy as metallic interconnect in SOFC anode environment,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.197

7,9442,"Owing to a poor supply of Cr, Fe-rich external oxide scale composed of Fe3O4 and FeO was formed on the surface of FeCro alloy in which metallic compound Ni3Fe was embedded.",Characterization of a new Fe-based alloy as metallic interconnect in SOFC anode environment,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.197
8,9442,"Although FeCro alloy suffered from severe corrosion with non-protective Fe-rich oxide scale at 750 degrees C in N-2 + 3.75% H-2 + 25% H2O (g), the area specific resistance of Ni mesh/FeCro alloy was considerably low to offer sufficient metallic conduction.",Characterization of a new Fe-based alloy as metallic interconnect in SOFC anode environment,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.197
