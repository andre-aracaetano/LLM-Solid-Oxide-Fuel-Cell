2,9052,This approach enables low-temperature (425-550 degrees C) electrochemical properties of dense ultra-thin nanocrystalline LSCF to be characterized.,Low-temperature electrochemical characterization of dense ultra-thin lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3) cathodes synthesized by RF-sputtering on nanoporous alumina-supported Y-doped zirconia membranes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.024
3,9052,The results reveal that the electrochemical resistance of nanocrystalline ultra-thin LSCF is dominated by the oxygen surface exchange reaction at the electrode surface with an activation energy of 1.1eV. Area-specific resistance of LSCF was obtained and the results are of potential relevance to utilizing nanostructured oxide cathodes for micro-SOFCs operated at low temperatures.,Low-temperature electrochemical characterization of dense ultra-thin lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3) cathodes synthesized by RF-sputtering on nanoporous alumina-supported Y-doped zirconia membranes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.024
