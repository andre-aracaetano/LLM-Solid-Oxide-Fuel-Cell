2,7606,"The model considers the coupling effects of chemical and electrochemical reactions, mass transport, momentum and heat transfer in the SOFC unit.",Thermal Modeling and Management of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating with Internally Reformed Methane,10.1007/s11630-018-1001-8
3,7606,"After model validation, parametric simulations are conducted to investigate how the methane pre-reforming ratio affects the transport and electrochemistry of the SOFC unit.",Thermal Modeling and Management of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating with Internally Reformed Methane,10.1007/s11630-018-1001-8
4,7606,"It is found that the methane steam reforming reaction has a smoothing effect, which can achieve more uniform distributions of gas compositions, current density and temperature among the cell plane.",Thermal Modeling and Management of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating with Internally Reformed Methane,10.1007/s11630-018-1001-8
5,7606,"In the case of 1500 W/m(2) power density output, adding 20% methane absorbs 50% of internal heat production inside the cell, reduces the maximum temperature difference inside the cell from 70 K to 22 K and reduces the cathode air supply by 75%, compared to the condition of completely pre-reforming of methane.",Thermal Modeling and Management of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating with Internally Reformed Methane,10.1007/s11630-018-1001-8
6,7606,"Under specific operating conditions, the pre-reforming ratio of methane has an optimal range for obtaining a good temperature distribution and good cell performance.",Thermal Modeling and Management of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Operating with Internally Reformed Methane,10.1007/s11630-018-1001-8
