1,20912,"Perovskite powders prepared by combustion synthesis with a nominal composition of La0.800Sr0.200Cr0.920Co0.080O3.000-delta were obtained from the corresponding metal nitrates, and characterised in terms of in-situ phase development (crystalline structure and thermal behaviour).",Strontium and cobalt doped-lanthanum chromite: Characterisation of synthesised powders and sintered materials,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.09.046
2,20912,Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRPD) and Rietveld analyses demonstrated that the as-prepared powder showed an orthorhombic perovskite structure with an estimated composition of La0.803Sr0.197Cr0.966Co0.034O3.000-delta.,Strontium and cobalt doped-lanthanum chromite: Characterisation of synthesised powders and sintered materials,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.09.046
3,20912,"Second phases present in the as-prepared powder were m-LaCrO4, CoLa1.250Sr0.750O4.000, c-CoCr2.000O4.000 and m-SrCrO4.000.",Strontium and cobalt doped-lanthanum chromite: Characterisation of synthesised powders and sintered materials,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.09.046
4,20912,"Sintering processes, including phase transition (from orthorhombic to rhombohedral) of the main phase and, melting/evaporation of second phases have been studied by DTA/TGA and dilatometric studies; the results were in full agreement with those detected by High-Temperature Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (HT-SXRPD).",Strontium and cobalt doped-lanthanum chromite: Characterisation of synthesised powders and sintered materials,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.09.046
