2,14436,"It was obtained by reduction of a Ni-containing scheelite oxide, from which Ni is segregated to the surface as metal nanoparticles with average size of 30-35 nm, as demonstrated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM).",Defective Sr0.9Mo0.9O3-δ perovskites with exsolved Ni nanoparticles as high-performance composite anodes for solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d1nj02295d
3,14436,"An in situ neutron powder diffraction (NPD) study of the Sr0.9Mo0.9O3-delta matrix shows an oxygen deficient cubic perovskite, defined in the Pm3m space group; no crystalline transitions were detected in the tested temperature range up to 850 degrees C. Morphological observations using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and pore size determinations by Hg porosimetry showed a highly porous material with macropores.",Defective Sr0.9Mo0.9O3-δ perovskites with exsolved Ni nanoparticles as high-performance composite anodes for solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d1nj02295d
