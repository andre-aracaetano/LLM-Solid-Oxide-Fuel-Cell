1,16728,The structural stability of the Ni-4 and Ni-4 Re-x(x) clusters on the yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) surfaces under sulfur adsorption is systematically studied using a first-principles method based on density functional theory.,The mechanism of the high resistance to sulfur poisoning of the rhenium doped nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.04.010
2,16728,It is found that the Ni-4 Re-x(x) alloy cluster is more difficult to deform under sulfur adsorption than the pure Ni-4 cluster on the YSZ(1 1 1) surfaces.,The mechanism of the high resistance to sulfur poisoning of the rhenium doped nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.04.010
3,16728,The results are helpful for explaining why Ni alloyed with Re is more tolerant for sulfur poisoning and provide guidance for designing Ni-based catalyst with high sulfur tolerance.,The mechanism of the high resistance to sulfur poisoning of the rhenium doped nickel/yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.04.010
