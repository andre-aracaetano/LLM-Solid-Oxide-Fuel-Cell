3,8308,We investigate the structure of the coherently strained CeO2 ultrathin films on yttria-stabilized zirconia (001) single crystals by specular synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) under oxidizing conditions as a first step to study the surface structure in situ.,Surface structure of coherently strained ceria ultrathin films,10.1103/PhysRevB.94.205420
4,8308,An excellent agreement between the experiment data and the model is achieved by using a stacks and islands model that has a two-component roughness.,Surface structure of coherently strained ceria ultrathin films,10.1103/PhysRevB.94.205420
5,8308,"One component is due to the tiny clusters of nanometer scale in lateral dimensions on each terrace, while the other component is due to slightly different CeO2 thickness that span over hundreds of nanometers on neighboring terraces.",Surface structure of coherently strained ceria ultrathin films,10.1103/PhysRevB.94.205420
6,8308,We attribute the nonuniform thickness to step depairing during the thin film deposition that is supported by the surface morphology results on the microscopic level.,Surface structure of coherently strained ceria ultrathin films,10.1103/PhysRevB.94.205420
