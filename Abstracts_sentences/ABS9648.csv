2,9648,"incorporating BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY) electrolyte, NiO-BZCY anode, and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SSC-SDC) cathode, were successfully fabricated by a combined co-pressing and printing technique after a one-step co-firing process at 1100, 1150, or 1200 degrees C. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results revealed that the co-firing temperature significantly affected not only the density of the electrolyte membrane but the grain size and porosity of the electrodes.",Evaluation of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by a one-step co-firing process,10.1016/j.electacta.2010.10.048
3,9648,Influences of the co-firing temperature on the electrochemical performances of the single cells were also studied in detail.,Evaluation of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by a one-step co-firing process,10.1016/j.electacta.2010.10.048
4,9648,"Using wet hydrogen (2% H2O) as the fuel and static air as the oxidant, the cell co-fired at 1150 degrees C showed the highest maximum power density (PDmax) of 552 and 370 mW cm(-2) at 700 and 650 degrees C, respectively, while the one co-fired at 1100 degrees C showed the highest PDmax of 276 and 170 mWcm(-2) at 600 and 550 degrees C. respectively.",Evaluation of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by a one-step co-firing process,10.1016/j.electacta.2010.10.048
5,9648,"The Arrhenius equation was proposed to analyze the dependence of the PDmax on the operating temperature, and revealed that PDmax of the cell co-fired at a lower temperature was less dependent on operating temperature.",Evaluation of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by a one-step co-firing process,10.1016/j.electacta.2010.10.048
6,9648,"The influences of the co-firing temperature on the resistances of the single cells, which were estimated from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measured under open circuit conditions, were also investigated.",Evaluation of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by a one-step co-firing process,10.1016/j.electacta.2010.10.048
