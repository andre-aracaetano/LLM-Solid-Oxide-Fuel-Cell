1,8765,The degradation of composite LSCF-SDC cathodes on porous 430 stainless steel supports was investigated.,Degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3--Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Cathodes on Coated and Uncoated Porous Metal Supports,10.1002/fuce.201500139
2,8765,"Two degradation mechanisms were observed: a multi-layer oxide scale, believed to consist of Cr2O3 and SrCrO4, formed at the support-cathode interface, and small amounts of chromium were detected within the cathodes.",Degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3--Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Cathodes on Coated and Uncoated Porous Metal Supports,10.1002/fuce.201500139
3,8765,"To reduce degradation, La2O3 and Y2O3 reactive element oxide coatings were deposited on the internal pore surfaces of the metal supports.",Degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3--Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Cathodes on Coated and Uncoated Porous Metal Supports,10.1002/fuce.201500139
4,8765,The reactive element oxide coatings reduced the amount of volatile chromium that deposited in the cathodes.,Degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3--Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Cathodes on Coated and Uncoated Porous Metal Supports,10.1002/fuce.201500139
5,8765,"As a result, the degradation rates of the cathodes on coated supports were significantly lower than the degradation rates of cathodes madeon uncoated metal supports.",Degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3--Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Cathodes on Coated and Uncoated Porous Metal Supports,10.1002/fuce.201500139
6,8765,"In cathode symmetrical cells, polarization resistance degradation rates as low as 2.56x10(-6)cm(2)h(-1) were observed over 100 hours on coated metal supports, compared to an average of 1.23x10(-4)cm(2)h(-1) on uncoated supports.",Degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3--Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Cathodes on Coated and Uncoated Porous Metal Supports,10.1002/fuce.201500139
