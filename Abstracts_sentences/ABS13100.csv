1,13100,"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) can utilize various fuels, such as natural gas, hydrogen and biogas, but often, it is sensible to use a pre-reformer that converts the fuel into a hydrogen-rich gas stream.",Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
2,13100,"Relevant testing conditions, including the fuel to be used in SOFC systems, are important because cell performance depends on test conditions, such as fuel composition.",Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
3,13100,"Still, a majority of the reported single-cell and short stack tests are performed with pure hydrogen or synthetic reformate mixed from gas bottles.",Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
4,13100,"In this article, the development of a fuel feeder used to pre-reform natural gas for a single cell SOFC test station is presented.",Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
5,13100,"To mimic SOFC system conditions, natural gas is taken from the grid, desulfurized with commercial sulfur sorbent and reformed with a commercial precious metal catalyst.",Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
6,13100,"The fuel feeder is designed to be a versatile and efficient research tool, capable to be used in a wide temperature and gas flow range and with different reforming techniques, such as steam reforming, catalytic partial oxidation and simulated anode off-gas recycling.",Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
7,13100,"The construction, operation and characterization of the fuel feeder as well as methods of avoiding carbon formation are discussed.",Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
8,13100,The performance is evaluated by comparing measured outlet temperatures and compositions against equilibrium values.,Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
9,13100,"All measured gas compositions matched closely with the calculated equilibrium values, and the identified deviations were small and to no harm in practical use.",Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
10,13100,The operator can control the product gas composition by setting the fuel feeder heater to the temperature corresponding to the targeted composition.,Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
11,13100,Results show that the fuel feeder design can be used as such for single-cell testing or scaled to fit larger stack test stations.,Development of a fuel feeder for a solid oxide fuel cell test station,10.1002/er.3437
