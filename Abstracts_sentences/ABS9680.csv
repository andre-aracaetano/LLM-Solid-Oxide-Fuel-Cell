6,9680,"The other metastable intermediate phase, YMn2O5, was formed as a decomposition product of a portion of the major hexagonal YMnO3 at 840 degrees C, and subsequently reacted with Y2O3 back to the hexagonal YMnO3 at 1200 degrees C. For the studied compositions, densities higher than 95% theoretical could be obtained by sintering in air at temperatures above 1400 degrees C for 2 h. The investigated system was comparable in electrical conductivity with the current cathode material La1-xSrxMnO3, and had an average apparent thermal expansion coefficient between 5 and 7 ppm/degrees C in the temperature range between 200 degrees and 1000 degrees C. Unfortunately microcracking was observed in all sintered specimens, possibly caused by a high-temperature phase transition between the hexagonal and cubic polymorphs of Y1-xSrxMnO3.",SYNTHESIS AND PROPERTIES OF STRONTIUM-DOPED YTTRIUM MANGANITE,10.1557/JMR.1994.2645
