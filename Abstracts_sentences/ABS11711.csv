4,11711,The unit volume of this perovskite structure increased as the amount of Ti dopant increased.,"Structural, morphological, and electrochemical behavior of titanium-doped SrFe1-xTixO3-δ (x=0.1-0.5) perovskite as a cobalt-free solid oxide fuel cell cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.216
5,11711,Morphological analysis revealed that the porosity of the SrFe1-xTixO3-delta perovskite cathode film was inversely proportional to the amount of Ti dopant.,"Structural, morphological, and electrochemical behavior of titanium-doped SrFe1-xTixO3-δ (x=0.1-0.5) perovskite as a cobalt-free solid oxide fuel cell cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.216
6,11711,"The cathode SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3-delta film exhibited a high porosity of 24.74 +/- 0.52%, a low but acceptable hardness value of 0.70 +/- 0.01 GPa and an area specific resistance of 0.57 Omega cm(2).","Structural, morphological, and electrochemical behavior of titanium-doped SrFe1-xTixO3-δ (x=0.1-0.5) perovskite as a cobalt-free solid oxide fuel cell cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.216
7,11711,These results suggested that cobalt-free SrFe1-xTixO3-delta cathode was still not good enough to be compared with the existing cobalt-containing cathode such as lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite.,"Structural, morphological, and electrochemical behavior of titanium-doped SrFe1-xTixO3-δ (x=0.1-0.5) perovskite as a cobalt-free solid oxide fuel cell cathode",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.03.216
