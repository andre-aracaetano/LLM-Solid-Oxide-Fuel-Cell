7,18653,It is found that the Ni atom tends to be adsorbed to O sites and away from the Y atoms on both the surfaces.,The first-principles study on the interaction of Ni with the yttria-stabilized zirconia and the activity of the interface,10.7498/aps.65.068201
8,18653,"The most favorable adsorption site is the oxygen vacancy, which has an adsorption energy of 2.85 eV. Compared with YSZ, the single Ni atom loses 1.06 electrons and is oxidized as Ni+ on YSZ+O, which produces a strong interaction between the Ni atom and YSZ+O. Strong adsorption is mainly attributed to the interaction between Ni 3d and O-u 2p orbitals.",The first-principles study on the interaction of Ni with the yttria-stabilized zirconia and the activity of the interface,10.7498/aps.65.068201
9,18653,And the oxidation of Ni can lead to the decrease of electrocatalytic activity of the Ni catalyst.,The first-principles study on the interaction of Ni with the yttria-stabilized zirconia and the activity of the interface,10.7498/aps.65.068201
10,18653,"The d-band DOS (density of states) peaks of the Ni-1/YSZ+O are lower than that of the Ni-1/YSZ, and the corresponding d-band centers are shifted away from the Fermi level to lower energy with the epsilon(d) value of -3.69",The first-principles study on the interaction of Ni with the yttria-stabilized zirconia and the activity of the interface,10.7498/aps.65.068201
