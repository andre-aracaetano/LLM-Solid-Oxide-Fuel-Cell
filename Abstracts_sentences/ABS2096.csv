4,2096,"In order to study aluminum diffusion in YTZP, aluminum oxide was deposited on the surface of 3 mol.% yttria stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (3Y-TZP).",ELECTROLYTES FOR INTERMEDIATE TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1515/amm-2015-0225
5,2096,The samples were annealed at temperatures from 1523 to 1773 K. Diffusion profiles of Al in the form of mean concentration vs. depth in B-type kinetic region were investigated by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS).,ELECTROLYTES FOR INTERMEDIATE TEMPERATURE SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS,10.1515/amm-2015-0225
