1,13866,The high performance of intermediate-to-low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ILT-SOFCs) closely depends on the catalytic activity of the cathode material.,Self-Assembled Nanocomposite Based on SrCo0.7Fe0.2Sc0.1O3-δ as an Efficient Intermediate-to-Low-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1021/acsami.4c05284
2,13866,"However, most high-activity perovskite cathodes are rich in Sr and will arise from Sr segregation during the long-term working, resulting in the decay of activity and stability.",Self-Assembled Nanocomposite Based on SrCo0.7Fe0.2Sc0.1O3-δ as an Efficient Intermediate-to-Low-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1021/acsami.4c05284
3,13866,"Herein, by regulating the calcined way and temperature, a type of self-assembled nanocomposite perovskite cathode is developed, the stoichiometric SrCo0.7Fe0.2Sc0.1O3-delta (SCFSc) powder self-separates into a cubic phase (Pm3m, Sc-rich) and a tetragonal phase (P4/mmm, Sc-fewer).",Self-Assembled Nanocomposite Based on SrCo0.7Fe0.2Sc0.1O3-δ as an Efficient Intermediate-to-Low-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1021/acsami.4c05284
4,13866,"Meanwhile, a single cubic phase is prepared with the same formula via calcining the SCFSc pellet.",Self-Assembled Nanocomposite Based on SrCo0.7Fe0.2Sc0.1O3-δ as an Efficient Intermediate-to-Low-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1021/acsami.4c05284
5,13866,"It is found that the nanocomposite cathode shows better oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity than single cubic SCFSc, caused by lower impedance of oxygen surface exchange and bulk diffusion.",Self-Assembled Nanocomposite Based on SrCo0.7Fe0.2Sc0.1O3-δ as an Efficient Intermediate-to-Low-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1021/acsami.4c05284
6,13866,"Particularly, the nanocomposite SCFSc cathode with the self-assembled heterointerfaces mitigates the Sr segregation and shows a peak power density of 1.17 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C and excellent stability for similar to 101 h at 600 degrees C.",Self-Assembled Nanocomposite Based on SrCo0.7Fe0.2Sc0.1O3-δ as an Efficient Intermediate-to-Low-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1021/acsami.4c05284
7,13866,This work provides a strategy for the development of nanocomposite cathodes to mitigate cation segregation and improve catalytic activity and stability.,Self-Assembled Nanocomposite Based on SrCo0.7Fe0.2Sc0.1O3-δ as an Efficient Intermediate-to-Low-Temperature SOFC Cathode,10.1021/acsami.4c05284
