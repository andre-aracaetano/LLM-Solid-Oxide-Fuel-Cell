1,20218,"The electronic structure of the (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)Mn1-xCrxO3 model series (x = 0, 0.05, or 0.1) was measured using soft X-ray synchrotron radiation at room and elevated temperature.","Electronic structure origin of conductivity and oxygen reduction activity changes in low-level Cr-substituted (La, Sr)MnO3",10.1063/1.4931033
2,20218,"O K-edge near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra showed that low-level chromium substitution of (La, Sr)MnO3 resulted in lowered hybridisation between O 2p orbitals and M 3d and M 4sp valance orbitals.","Electronic structure origin of conductivity and oxygen reduction activity changes in low-level Cr-substituted (La, Sr)MnO3",10.1063/1.4931033
3,20218,Mn L-3-edge resonant photoemission spectroscopy measurements indicated lowered Mn 3d-O 2p hybridisation with chromium substitution.,"Electronic structure origin of conductivity and oxygen reduction activity changes in low-level Cr-substituted (La, Sr)MnO3",10.1063/1.4931033
4,20218,Deconvolution of O K-edge NEXAFS spectra took into account the effects of exchange and crystal field splitting and included a novel approach whereby the pre-peak region was described using the nominally filled t(2g) up arrow state.,"Electronic structure origin of conductivity and oxygen reduction activity changes in low-level Cr-substituted (La, Sr)MnO3",10.1063/1.4931033
5,20218,"10% chromium substitution resulted in a 0.17 eV lowering in the energy of the t(2g) up arrow state, which appears to provide an explanation for the 0.15 eV rise in activation energy for the oxygen reduction reaction, while decreased overlap between hybrid O 2p-Mn 3d states was in qualitative agreement with lowered electronic conductivity.","Electronic structure origin of conductivity and oxygen reduction activity changes in low-level Cr-substituted (La, Sr)MnO3",10.1063/1.4931033
6,20218,"An orbital-level understanding of the thermodynamically predicted solid oxide fuel cell cathode poisoning mechanism involving low-level chromium substitution on the B-site of (La, Sr)MnO3 is presented.","Electronic structure origin of conductivity and oxygen reduction activity changes in low-level Cr-substituted (La, Sr)MnO3",10.1063/1.4931033
