1,8050,Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) are cost-effective and efficient energy conversion systems.,Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Activity and Cr Tolerance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes by a Multiphase Catalyst Coating,10.1002/adfm.202100034
2,8050,The sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the degradation of cathodes are critical challenges to the commercialization of IT-SOFCs.,Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Activity and Cr Tolerance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes by a Multiphase Catalyst Coating,10.1002/adfm.202100034
3,8050,"Here, a highly efficient multiphase (MP) catalyst coating, consisting of Ba1-xCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta (BCFN) and BaCO3, to enhance the ORR activity and durability of the state-of-the-art lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta, LSCF) cathode is reported.",Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Activity and Cr Tolerance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes by a Multiphase Catalyst Coating,10.1002/adfm.202100034
4,8050,"The conformal MP catalyst-coated LSCF cathode shows a polarization resistance (R-p) of 0.048 omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C, about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the bare LSCF.",Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Activity and Cr Tolerance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes by a Multiphase Catalyst Coating,10.1002/adfm.202100034
5,8050,"In an accelerated Cr-poisoning test, the degradation rate of the catalyst-coated LSCF electrode is 10(-3) omega cm(2) h(-1) (0.59% h(-1)) over 200 h, only one fifth of the degradation rate of the bare LSCF electrode at 750 degrees C.",Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Activity and Cr Tolerance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes by a Multiphase Catalyst Coating,10.1002/adfm.202100034
6,8050,"In addition, anode-supported single cells with the MP catalyst-coated LSCF cathode show a dramatically enhanced peak power density (1.4 W cm(-2) vs 0.67 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C) and increased durability against Cr and H2O. Both experimental results and density functional theory-based calculations indicate that the BCFN phase improves the ORR activity while the BaCO3 phase enhances the stability of the LSCF cathode.",Enhancing Oxygen Reduction Activity and Cr Tolerance of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes by a Multiphase Catalyst Coating,10.1002/adfm.202100034
