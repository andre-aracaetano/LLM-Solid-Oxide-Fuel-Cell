2,18235,"The unit is used to convert various fuels into hydrogen-rich gas, which is then fed into the anodic compartments of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack.","Kinetic model of a plate fin heat exchanger with catalytic coating as a steam reformer of methane, biogas, and dimethyl ether",10.1002/er.4465
3,18235,"The study looks at the fuel processor for methane, biogas, and dimethyl ether (DME).","Kinetic model of a plate fin heat exchanger with catalytic coating as a steam reformer of methane, biogas, and dimethyl ether",10.1002/er.4465
4,18235,"In the first phase, the reaction kinetics model was based on data from the literature.","Kinetic model of a plate fin heat exchanger with catalytic coating as a steam reformer of methane, biogas, and dimethyl ether",10.1002/er.4465
5,18235,This was followed by tuning and validation of the numerical model using data collected during an experimental campaign.,"Kinetic model of a plate fin heat exchanger with catalytic coating as a steam reformer of methane, biogas, and dimethyl ether",10.1002/er.4465
6,18235,"Four values of the steam to carbon ratio (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5) were used to analyze the performance of the heat exchanger, which was investigated in a temperature range of 500 degrees C to 750 degrees C.","Kinetic model of a plate fin heat exchanger with catalytic coating as a steam reformer of methane, biogas, and dimethyl ether",10.1002/er.4465
7,18235,The experimental data are compared with predictions of the model implemented in Aspen HYSYS modeling software and discussed.,"Kinetic model of a plate fin heat exchanger with catalytic coating as a steam reformer of methane, biogas, and dimethyl ether",10.1002/er.4465
8,18235,It was found that the relative prediction error of the simulator does not exceed 3.5%.,"Kinetic model of a plate fin heat exchanger with catalytic coating as a steam reformer of methane, biogas, and dimethyl ether",10.1002/er.4465
