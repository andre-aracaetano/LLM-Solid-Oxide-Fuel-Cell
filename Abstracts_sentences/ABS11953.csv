2,11953,From these powders microtubes with a dual structure comprising of a dense layer and a porous substrate layer were fabricated in a single step through a phase inversion/sintering technique.,Fabrication and Characterization of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Microtubular Dual-Structured Electrolyte Membranes for Application in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Technology,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03267.x
3,11953,A sintering temperature in excess of 1450 degrees C is required for SDC to achieve gastight microtubes.,Fabrication and Characterization of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Microtubular Dual-Structured Electrolyte Membranes for Application in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Technology,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03267.x
4,11953,The mechanical strength of the SDC microtubes increases with increasing sintering temperature and may attain up to 208 MPa when sintered at 1500 degrees C. Electrical impedance spectroscopy studies indicate that the SDC microtubes have electrical conductivities of 4.46 x 10-4-0.072 S/cm and corresponding activation energy of 81.9 kJ/mol at temperatures between 400 degrees and 800 degrees,Fabrication and Characterization of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Microtubular Dual-Structured Electrolyte Membranes for Application in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Technology,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03267.x
5,11953,"C. Full fuel cells were fabricated by coating Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) on to the inner surface and a Ni-SDC cermet on to the outer surface of the gastight microtubes to act as the cathode and the anode, respectively.",Fabrication and Characterization of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Microtubular Dual-Structured Electrolyte Membranes for Application in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Technology,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03267.x
