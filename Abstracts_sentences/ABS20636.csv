7,20636,"By explorative technoeconomic analysis and sensitivity analysis, we found an electric efficiency of 57%, which is similar to that of a natural gas combined cycle plant.",Converting Waste Toilet Paper into Electricity: AFirst-Stage Technoeconomic Feasibility Study,10.1002/ente.201700247
8,20636,"The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) was 20.3 cent kWh(-1), which is comparable at present to that of residential photovoltaic installations.",Converting Waste Toilet Paper into Electricity: AFirst-Stage Technoeconomic Feasibility Study,10.1002/ente.201700247
9,20636,"The system's capital costs are relatively high, mainly as a result of SOFC investment costs, but we expect these costs to decrease as the market of cells develops.",Converting Waste Toilet Paper into Electricity: AFirst-Stage Technoeconomic Feasibility Study,10.1002/ente.201700247
10,20636,"The operating costs are relatively low, partly thanks to the high thermodynamic efficiency (approximate to 70%).",Converting Waste Toilet Paper into Electricity: AFirst-Stage Technoeconomic Feasibility Study,10.1002/ente.201700247
11,20636,"Currently, the fuel costs are negative (because we use waste as a raw material), yet this could change if the value of WTP would increase as a result of this process.",Converting Waste Toilet Paper into Electricity: AFirst-Stage Technoeconomic Feasibility Study,10.1002/ente.201700247
