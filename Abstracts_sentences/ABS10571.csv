1,10571,Cr poisoning has been identified as a critical issue for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes degradation when metallic alloys are used for intermediate temperature SOFCs.,"Combined Cr and Mo poisoning of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 - δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes at the nanoscale",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.030
2,10571,"In addition, Mo is also a common alloying element in ferritic stainless steel or Ni based alloys considered as interconnect materials and molybdenum trioxide is very volatile, raising concerns on Mo poisoning to the cathodes.","Combined Cr and Mo poisoning of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 - δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes at the nanoscale",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.030
3,10571,"In this work, the intrinsic reactivity of Cr with a porous (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.95) (Co0.2Fe0.8)O3 - delta cathode (LSCF6428) with and without the presence of Mo was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in order to reveal the nanoscale incorporation and evolution behavior of Cr and/or Mo in LSCF.","Combined Cr and Mo poisoning of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 - δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes at the nanoscale",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.030
4,10571,"Cr incorporation was identified with formation of Cr containing phases including chromium oxide and SrCrOx with sizes of as small as similar to 00 nm, suggesting that the poisoning can take effect with subtle changes at the very small scale.","Combined Cr and Mo poisoning of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 - δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes at the nanoscale",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.030
5,10571,Co-poisoning of Mo with Cr significantly changes the pattern of Cr behavior.,"Combined Cr and Mo poisoning of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 - δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes at the nanoscale",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.030
6,10571,CrCo2Fe3Ox spinel becomes the main reaction product in addition to chromium oxide as a result of Sr reacting preferentially with Mo to form SrMoO4.,"Combined Cr and Mo poisoning of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 - δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes at the nanoscale",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.030
7,10571,The LSCF grain boundary was found to be rich in Cr and deficient in Co.,"Combined Cr and Mo poisoning of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 - δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes at the nanoscale",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.030
8,10571,These results suggest that potential Mo poisoning effects should be considered when developing metallic interconnects containing Mo. (C) 2016,"Combined Cr and Mo poisoning of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3 - δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes at the nanoscale",10.1016/j.ssi.2015.12.030
