1,5875,The electrochemical performances of Nd0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta Ag composite cathodes have been investigated in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Electrochemical performance of Nd0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-δ-Ag composite cathodes in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.027
2,5875,The Nd0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta-Ag cathodes prepared by ball milling followed by firing at 920 degrees C show the maximum performance (power density: 0.15 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C) at 3 wt.% Ag.,Electrochemical performance of Nd0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-δ-Ag composite cathodes in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.027

4,5875,"Ag that were prepared by an impregnation of Ag into Nd0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta followed by filing at 700 degrees C (but the electrolyte-Nd0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta assembly was prepared first by firing at 1100 degrees C) exhibit much better performance (power density: 0.27 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C) than the composite cathodes prepared by ball milling, despite a much smaller amount of Ag due to a better dispersion and an enhanced adhesion.",Electrochemical performance of Nd0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-δ-Ag composite cathodes in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.027
5,5875,AC impedance analysis indicates that the Ag catalysts dispersed in the porous Nd0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta cathode reduce the ohmic and the polarization resistances due to an increased electronic conductivity and enhanced electrocatalytic activity.,Electrochemical performance of Nd0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-δ-Ag composite cathodes in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.02.027
