4,11854,"The results demonstrated that the leakage rate of infiltrated fiber paper was 0.04 scan cm(-1) for a 10 kPa gradient, under 1.0 MPa compressive load, while for mica it was 0.60 and 0.63 sccm cm(-1) which indicated that the infiltrated ceramic fiber paper showed a much lower leakage than mica.",Comparison of infiltrated ceramic fiber paper and mica base compressive seals for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.014
