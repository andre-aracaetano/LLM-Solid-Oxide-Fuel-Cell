6,8768,The anode material presenting the cubic phase showed a better electrochemical performance.,Ni-Free SOFC Anode Material with Thermal and Redox Stabilities for the Direct Utilization of Ethanol,10.3390/catal13010134
7,8768,The Al2O3 phase provided thermal stability and prevented the coarsening of the solid solution and loss of Ceria's redox activity.,Ni-Free SOFC Anode Material with Thermal and Redox Stabilities for the Direct Utilization of Ethanol,10.3390/catal13010134
8,8768,"It allowed for SOFC operation at high temperatures, since the yield increased as the operating temperature rose from 750 to 950 & DEG;C. An analysis of the results before and after the SOFC operation at 950 & DEG;C for 200 h revealed that there was no significant copper grains coarsening since the performance increased with the temperature.",Ni-Free SOFC Anode Material with Thermal and Redox Stabilities for the Direct Utilization of Ethanol,10.3390/catal13010134
9,8768,The redox behavior during the SOFC operation is also explained through a theoretical physical-chemical mechanism.,Ni-Free SOFC Anode Material with Thermal and Redox Stabilities for the Direct Utilization of Ethanol,10.3390/catal13010134
