1,16228,"The mechanical properties of magnesia-spinel composite ceramics, which are candidate materials for supporting solid oxide fuel cells, have been measured as a function of porosity (up to 30%) and temperature (up to 900 degrees C).",Mechanical properties of magnesia-spinel composites,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01733.x
2,16228,The theory for the ring-on-ring test has been re-examined to resolve an inconsistency in the literature.,Mechanical properties of magnesia-spinel composites,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01733.x
3,16228,The Young's modulus shows an exponential dependence on porosity that is in agreement with the expectation of minimum solid area models.,Mechanical properties of magnesia-spinel composites,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01733.x
4,16228,"Fracture toughness, fracture energy, and flexural strength are all approximately proportional to Young's modulus.",Mechanical properties of magnesia-spinel composites,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01733.x
5,16228,"The mechanical properties are not greatly dependent on temperature, but there is a detectable increase in fracture toughness with temperature, which could be due to some limited plasticity.",Mechanical properties of magnesia-spinel composites,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01733.x
