1,13594,An anode gas recycle (AGR) system using an ejector for 1 kW solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was developed to increase the electrical efficiency of combined power generation.,Development of Anode Gas Recycle System Using Ejector for 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028361
2,13594,We call this an AGR-SOFC.,Development of Anode Gas Recycle System Using Ejector for 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028361
3,13594,"The effects of recirculation ratio, externally steam feed rate, and fuel utilization were determined experimentally on the AGR-SOFC performance (i.e., output power, stack temperature, and gas composition) using a variable flow ejector and a recirculation ratio of 0.55-0.62, overall fuel utilization of 0.720-84, and steam feed rate of 0-1.5 g/min.",Development of Anode Gas Recycle System Using Ejector for 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028361
4,13594,"A quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to identify the recirculation ratio, the gas composition of reformed gas at the AGR-SOFC inlet, and that of the recycle gas at the outlet.",Development of Anode Gas Recycle System Using Ejector for 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028361
5,13594,"Compared to one-path SOFC systems, i.e., without an AGR, the AGR-SOFC was stable and generated about 15 W more electricity when the overall fuel utilization was 0.84 and the recirculation ratio was 0.622 with no steam supply.",Development of Anode Gas Recycle System Using Ejector for 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028361
6,13594,This improved performance was due to the reduced H2O concentration in the anodic gas.,Development of Anode Gas Recycle System Using Ejector for 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028361
7,13594,"In addition, although the recirculation ratio did not affect the AGR-SOFC performance, a high recirculation ratio can provide steam produced via the electrochemical reaction to the injected fuel for the steam reforming process.",Development of Anode Gas Recycle System Using Ejector for 1 kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1115/1.4028361
