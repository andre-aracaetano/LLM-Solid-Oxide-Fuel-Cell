1,15408,The Ni-YSZ cermet anode of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has excellent electrochemical performance in a clean blended synthetic coal syngas mixture.,The effect of HCl in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.079
2,15408,"However, chloride, one of the major contaminants existing in coal-derived syngas, may poison the Ni-YSZ cermet and cause degradation in cell performance.",The effect of HCl in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.079
3,15408,Both hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine (Cl(2)) have been reported to attack the Ni in the anode when using electrolyte-supported SOFCs.,The effect of HCl in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.079
4,15408,"In this paper, a commercial anode-supported SOFC was exposed to syngas with a concentration of 100 ppm HCl under a constant current load at 800 degrees C for 300 h and 850 degrees C for 100 h. The cell performance was evaluated periodically using electrochemical methods.",The effect of HCl in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.079
5,15408,A unique feature of this experiment is that the active central part of the anode was exposed directly to the fuel without an intervening current collector.,The effect of HCl in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.079
6,15408,"Post-mortem analyses of the SOFC anode were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).",The effect of HCl in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.079
7,15408,The results show that the 100 ppm concentration of HCl causes about 3% loss of performance for the Ni-YSZ anode-supported cell during the 400 h test.,The effect of HCl in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.079
8,15408,Permanent changes were noted in the surface microstructure of the nickel particles in the cell anode.,The effect of HCl in syngas on Ni-YSZ anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.079
