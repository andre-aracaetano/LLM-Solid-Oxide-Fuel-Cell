1,17466,"This paper reviews and assesses phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties of phases in the Sr-Co-Fe-O system, with a focus on oxides, especially the SrCo1 - xFexO3 (-) (delta) perovskite.",Thermodynamic modeling of the Sr-Co-Fe-O system,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.05.011
2,17466,"In our work, the SrCo1 - xFexO3 (-) (delta) perovskite was modeled with a three-sublattice model, where the three sublattices correspond to the A, B and oxygen sites in an ABO(3) perovskite, respectively.",Thermodynamic modeling of the Sr-Co-Fe-O system,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.05.011
3,17466,A number of other important ternary oxide phases in Sr-Co-O and Sr-Co-Fe-O were also considered.,Thermodynamic modeling of the Sr-Co-Fe-O system,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.05.011
4,17466,Available thermodynamic and phase diagram data were carefully assessed.,Thermodynamic modeling of the Sr-Co-Fe-O system,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.05.011
5,17466,"A thermodynamic description of Sr-Co-O was derived using the CALPHAD approach and was further extrapolated to that of Sr-Co-Fe-O. The thermodynamic database of Sr-Co-Fe-O established in this work allows for calculating phase diagrams, thermodynamic properties, cation distribution and defect chemistry properties, and therefore enables material composition optimization for various applications, including solid oxide fuel cells and oxygen membranes.",Thermodynamic modeling of the Sr-Co-Fe-O system,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.05.011
