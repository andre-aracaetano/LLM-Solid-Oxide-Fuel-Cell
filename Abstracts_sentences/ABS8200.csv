1,8200,Single chamber solid oxide fuel cells (SC-SOFCs) with interdigitating electrodes were prepared and operated in CH4/air mixtures.,From macro- to micro-single chamber solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.204
2,8200,Both electrodes (Ni-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 cermet and Sm0.5Sr0.5O3-delta perovskite) were placed on the same side of a Ce0.8Gd0.1O1.95 electrolyte disc.,From macro- to micro-single chamber solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.204
3,8200,"The separating gap between the electrodes was varied from 1.2 to 0.27 mm and finally down to 10 mu m. Screen-printing was used for the preparation of the cells with a gap in the millimetre range, whereas micromolding in capillaries (MIMIC) was used for the preparation of the micro-SC-SOFCs.",From macro- to micro-single chamber solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.204
4,8200,The prepared micro-SC-SOFCs consisted of an array of 49 individual cells that were connected in parallel having 100 mu m wide electrodes.,From macro- to micro-single chamber solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.204
5,8200,An open circuit voltage of 0.65-0.75 V was measured in flowing mixtures of methane and air.,From macro- to micro-single chamber solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.204
6,8200,The maximum power density of 17 mW cm(-2) was limited by the ohmic resistance of the long conduction paths along the thin electrodes to the active sites of the individual cells.,From macro- to micro-single chamber solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.204
7,8200,The feasibility of the micro-cell was demonstrated by comparing the performance with the performance of the cells having feature sizes in the millimetre range.,From macro- to micro-single chamber solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.204
8,8200,The cell resistance of micro-SC-SOFCs may be significantly reduced when connecting the cells in series using interconnections between anode and cathodes of adjacent cells.,From macro- to micro-single chamber solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.06.204
