1,65,A basic requirement for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is the sintering of electrolyte into a dense impermeable membrane to prevent the mixing of fuel and oxygen for a sufficiently high open-circuit voltage (OCV).,Carbonate-superstructured solid fuel cells with hydrocarbon fuels,10.1073/pnas.2208750119
2,65,"However, herein, we demonstrate a different type of fuel cell, a carbonate-superstructured solid fuel cell (CSSFC), in which in situ generation of superstructured carbonate in the porous samarium-doped ceria layer creates a unique electrolyte with ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 0.17 S center dot cm(-1) at 550 degrees C.",Carbonate-superstructured solid fuel cells with hydrocarbon fuels,10.1073/pnas.2208750119
3,65,The CSSFC achieves unprecedented high OCVs (1.051 V at 500 degrees C and 1.041 V at 550 degrees C) with methane fuel.,Carbonate-superstructured solid fuel cells with hydrocarbon fuels,10.1073/pnas.2208750119
4,65,"Furthermore, the CSSFC exhibits a high peak power density of 215 mW center dot cm(-2) with dry methane fuel at 550 degrees C, which is higher than all reported values of electrolyte-supported SOFCs.",Carbonate-superstructured solid fuel cells with hydrocarbon fuels,10.1073/pnas.2208750119
5,65,This provides a different approach for the development of efficient solid fuel cells.,Carbonate-superstructured solid fuel cells with hydrocarbon fuels,10.1073/pnas.2208750119
