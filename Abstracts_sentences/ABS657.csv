1,657,"Protonic ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) has attracted more and more research attention due to its special working features, compared with both the traditional oxygen ionic solid oxide fuel cell (O2--SOFC) and protonic exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).",Study the flow and species distribution characteristics in a typical 25-cell proton ceramic fuel cell stack by 3D large-scale modeling,10.1007/s11581-022-04465-y
2,657,The 3D CFD numerical method is generally considered to be an effective path to explore the proper air flow path design for the PCFC stack.,Study the flow and species distribution characteristics in a typical 25-cell proton ceramic fuel cell stack by 3D large-scale modeling,10.1007/s11581-022-04465-y
3,657,"In this paper, the 3D large-scale CFD models for the 25-cell PCFC stacks with both U-type and Z-type air flow paths and O2--SOFC stack are developed to compare and access the flow and species distribution features within the PCFC stacks.",Study the flow and species distribution characteristics in a typical 25-cell proton ceramic fuel cell stack by 3D large-scale modeling,10.1007/s11581-022-04465-y
4,657,The result shows that the U-type configuration would be a more proper choice for the PCFC air flow path to achieve higher air and oxygen feeding qualities than that of the Z-type configuration.,Study the flow and species distribution characteristics in a typical 25-cell proton ceramic fuel cell stack by 3D large-scale modeling,10.1007/s11581-022-04465-y
5,657,The flow and species uniformities within the 25-cell PCFC stack are worse than that of the O2--SOFC stack because the vapors are generated within the cathode side.,Study the flow and species distribution characteristics in a typical 25-cell proton ceramic fuel cell stack by 3D large-scale modeling,10.1007/s11581-022-04465-y
6,657,Different vapor generation sites and operation temperatures are two key factors contributing to the different item distributing features within the PCFC and traditional O2--SOFC stacks.,Study the flow and species distribution characteristics in a typical 25-cell proton ceramic fuel cell stack by 3D large-scale modeling,10.1007/s11581-022-04465-y
