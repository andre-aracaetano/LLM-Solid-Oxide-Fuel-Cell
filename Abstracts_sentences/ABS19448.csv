1,19448,"The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has recently discussed the introduction of a new design index called the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which is a measure of the total carbon dioxide emissions divided by the amount of cargo carried and by the distance travelled on a one-year basis.",Impact of SOFC Power Generation Plant on Carbon Intensity Index (CII) Calculation for Cruise Ships,10.3390/jmse10101478
2,19448,"In this study, authors have analysed a cruise ship assuming its size, the electrical and thermal power required, and its operative profile.",Impact of SOFC Power Generation Plant on Carbon Intensity Index (CII) Calculation for Cruise Ships,10.3390/jmse10101478
3,19448,"CII is calculated with reference to a 180,000 GRT cruise ship equipped with different possible power plant configurations.",Impact of SOFC Power Generation Plant on Carbon Intensity Index (CII) Calculation for Cruise Ships,10.3390/jmse10101478
4,19448,"Emissions in these scenarios are abated by employing alternative fuels like Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), a shore connection, or innovative technologies like Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC).",Impact of SOFC Power Generation Plant on Carbon Intensity Index (CII) Calculation for Cruise Ships,10.3390/jmse10101478
5,19448,The analysis affirms that a cruise ship powered only by MGO from 2024 will not comply with the CII regulation.,Impact of SOFC Power Generation Plant on Carbon Intensity Index (CII) Calculation for Cruise Ships,10.3390/jmse10101478
6,19448,"Results highlight the potential of LNG in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and, for the reference vessel, the use of LNG alone can guarantee a maximum CII rating up to 2026.",Impact of SOFC Power Generation Plant on Carbon Intensity Index (CII) Calculation for Cruise Ships,10.3390/jmse10101478
