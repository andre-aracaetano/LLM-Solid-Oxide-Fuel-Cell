3,4430,"At 1073 K, polarization resistance with the worm-like cathode is favorably reduced to 0.151 Omega cm(2), and the power peak of the corresponding single cell reaches to 512 mW cm(-2), showing a fast cathodic kinetics.",Catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction with a worm-like oxide Ca3Co2O6 in solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/s43578-024-01345-1
4,4430,"By contrast, the polarization resistance with the plain cathode is 0.275 Omega cm(2), and the power peak of the corresponding single cell is 406 mW cm(-2).",Catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction with a worm-like oxide Ca3Co2O6 in solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/s43578-024-01345-1
5,4430,"Under a constant voltage load of applied 0.6 V at 1023 K, cell power with the worm-like cathode maintains steadily from 420 to 400 mW cm(-2) after 14 h of running time, showing a less fading rate, a more stable performance, and a better application prospect than the plain cathode.",Catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction with a worm-like oxide Ca3Co2O6 in solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1557/s43578-024-01345-1
