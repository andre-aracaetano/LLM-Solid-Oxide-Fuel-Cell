1,17677,We present a study of Y2-xZnxRu2O7 pyrochlores as a function of the Zn doping level x. X-ray diffraction measurements show that single-phase samples could be obtained for x < 0.2.,Observation of Mixed Valence Ru Components in Zn Doped Y2Ru2O7 Pyrochlores,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12411

3,17677,Neutron diffraction data of the x = 0.2 sample showed that replacing Y3+ by Zn2+ does not result in the formation of oxygen vacancies.,Observation of Mixed Valence Ru Components in Zn Doped Y2Ru2O7 Pyrochlores,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12411
4,17677,"X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements revealed that part of the Ru ions are in the 5+ oxidation state to balance, in terms of electronic charge, the incorporation of Zn2+.",Observation of Mixed Valence Ru Components in Zn Doped Y2Ru2O7 Pyrochlores,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12411
5,17677,"The results give experimental evidence that the heterovalent doping promotes the increase of conductivity in the Y2Ru2O7 pyrochlores, making these systems promising as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathodes.",Observation of Mixed Valence Ru Components in Zn Doped Y2Ru2O7 Pyrochlores,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12411
