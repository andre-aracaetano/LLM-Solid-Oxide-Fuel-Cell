1,10071,"We report the long-term stability of a microtubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operable at similar to 500 degrees C. The SOFC consists of NiO-Gd doped ceria (GDC) as the anode as well as the tubular support, GDC as an electrolyte and La(0.6)Sr(0.4)Co(0.2)Fe(0.8)O(3-delta) (LSCF)-GDC as the cathode.",Electrochemical characterizations of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells under a long-term testing at intermediate temperature operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.061
2,10071,"A single tubular cell with a diameter of approximately 1.8 mm and an effective electrode length of approximately 20 mm generated 150 mW cm(-2) and 340 mW cm(-2) at 500 degrees C and 550 degrees C, respectively, under the operation conditions of 0.7 V and humidified H(2) fuel flow.",Electrochemical characterizations of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells under a long-term testing at intermediate temperature operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.061
3,10071,The cell exhibited good stability with a degradation rate of 0.25%/100 h under operation conditions of 200 mA and 0.75 V.
