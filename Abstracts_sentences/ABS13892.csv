1,13892,The electrochemical properties of mixed-conducting ceramic-ceramic (cer-cer) composites for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (PC-SOFCs) based on La0.995Ca0.005NbO4-delta (LCN) have been investigated.,Electrochemical properties of composite cathodes for La0.995Ca0.005NbO4-δ-based proton conducting fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.041
2,13892,Different ratios of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta/La0.995Ca0.005NbO4-delta (LSM/LCN) composites have been tested as cathodes in symmetrical cells based on La0.995Ca0.005NbO4-delta dense electrolytes while two different electrode sintering temperatures (1050 and 1150 degrees C) have been studied.,Electrochemical properties of composite cathodes for La0.995Ca0.005NbO4-δ-based proton conducting fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.041
3,13892,"Additionally, different LCN doped materials (Pr, Ce and Mn), which present a different conduction behavior, have been used as components in composite cathodes (mixtures of LSM/doped-LCN 50/50 vol.%).",Electrochemical properties of composite cathodes for La0.995Ca0.005NbO4-δ-based proton conducting fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.041

5,13892,Different oxygen partial pressures (pO(2)) have been employed in order to characterize the processes (surface reaction and charge transport) occurring at the composite electrode under oxidizing conditions.,Electrochemical properties of composite cathodes for La0.995Ca0.005NbO4-δ-based proton conducting fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.041
6,13892,The main outcome of the present study is that the mixture of LSM (electronic phase) and LCN (protonic phase) enables to decrease substantially the electrode polarization resistance.,Electrochemical properties of composite cathodes for La0.995Ca0.005NbO4-δ-based proton conducting fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.041
7,13892,This is ascribed to the increase in the three-phase-boundary length and therefore it allows electrochemical reactions to occur in a larger region (thickness) of the electrode.,Electrochemical properties of composite cathodes for La0.995Ca0.005NbO4-δ-based proton conducting fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.07.041
