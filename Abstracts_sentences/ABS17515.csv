1,17515,Concentration polarization is important because it determines the maximum power output of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) at high fuel utilization.,Diffusion limitations in the porous anodes of SOFCs,10.1149/1.1586300
2,17515,Anodic concentration polarization occurs when the demand for reactants exceeds the capacity of the porous cermet anode to supply them by gas diffusion mechanisms.,Diffusion limitations in the porous anodes of SOFCs,10.1149/1.1586300
3,17515,High tortuosities (bulk diffusion resistances) are often assumed to explain this behavior.,Diffusion limitations in the porous anodes of SOFCs,10.1149/1.1586300
4,17515,"However, recent experiments show that anodic concentration polarization originates in the immediate vicinity of the reactive triple phase boundary (TPB) sites near the anode/electrolyte interface.",Diffusion limitations in the porous anodes of SOFCs,10.1149/1.1586300
5,17515,"A model is proposed to describe how concentration polarization is controlled by two localized phenomena: competetive adsorption of reactants in areas adjacent to the reactive TPB sites, followed by relatively slow surface diffusion to the reactive sites.",Diffusion limitations in the porous anodes of SOFCs,10.1149/1.1586300
6,17515,"Results suggest that future SOFC anode design improvements should focus on optimization of the reactive area, adsorption, and surface diffusion at the anode/electrolyte interface.",Diffusion limitations in the porous anodes of SOFCs,10.1149/1.1586300
