1,9042,"The oxygen stoichiometry of La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-delta perovskite powders LSCF 8228, 6428 and 2882 (numbers refer to stoichiometry) was investigated by means of solid electrolyte coulometry (SEC) and temperature-programmed reduction using carbon monoxide (CO-TPR), Experiments were performed at reduced oxygen partial pressures between 1.3 x 10 (- 3) and 6 x 10 (- 5) atm, applicable to cathodic bias under solid oxide fuel cell operating conditions.",Reactivity of LSCF perovskites,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00327-2
2,9042,"It was found that the degree of oxygen nonstoichiometry (delta) increased with increasing temperature, decreasing oxygen partial pressure and increasing Sr or Co content.",Reactivity of LSCF perovskites,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00327-2
3,9042,"CO-TPR studies indicate that the rate of CO2 production is dependent on the heating rate (beta), as well as the perovskite composition.",Reactivity of LSCF perovskites,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00327-2
4,9042,"In situ mass analysis during carbon monoxide oxidation indicates that the samples with low Sr or Co content (6428, 8228) show increased resistance to carbon deposition and/or carbonate formation.",Reactivity of LSCF perovskites,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00327-2
