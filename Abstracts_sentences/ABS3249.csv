3,3249,The electrical conductivity was relatively low with a maximum value of 13.89 S cm(-1) at about 800 degrees C.,BaCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite Oxide as Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3115397
4,3249,"The area specific resistance value for the BCFN cathode was as low as 0.014 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Using BCFN as the cathode, the Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolyte-supported single cell exhibited peak power intensities of 618 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. Preliminary results demonstrated that BCFN is a very promising cathode material for application in IT-SOFCs.",BaCo0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite Oxide as Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3115397
