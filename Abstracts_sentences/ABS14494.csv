4,14494,"A sample coated with 0.10 M CoSO4 and 0.50 MnSO4 at 350 mA cm(-2) showed the best oxidation resistance after being oxidized at 800 degrees C for 90 h. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) result revealed that the oxide growth on the surface of the coated samples mainly formed oxides of MnCo2O4, MnCr2O4, and Cr2O3.",Fabrication of Mn-Co Alloys Electrodeposited on AISI 430 Ferritic Stainless Steel for SOFC Interconnect Applications,10.3390/met13030612
