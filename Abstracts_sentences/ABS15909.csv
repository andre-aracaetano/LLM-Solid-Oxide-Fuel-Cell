1,15909,"A composite anode composing of in-situ exsolved Fe-Ni alloy (FNA) nanoparticles and Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite SrLaFeO4 (SLF) substrate has been prepared by reducing La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.8Ni0.20O3-delta(LSFN) perovskite precursor in humidified H-2 (3% H2O) at 800 degrees C. Roles of FNA and SLF, respectively, in performance and stability of the anode are systematically studied.",Roles of Fe-Ni nanoparticles and SrLaFeO4 substrate in the performance and reliability of a composite anode prepared through in-situ exsolution for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (I),10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.090
2,15909,The electric conductivity of the reduced LSFN and single cell performance of the composite (SLF-FNA) are examined in comparison with those of the SrLaFeO4-delta(SLFO4) anode alone.,Roles of Fe-Ni nanoparticles and SrLaFeO4 substrate in the performance and reliability of a composite anode prepared through in-situ exsolution for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (I),10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.090
3,15909,The significantly improved performance of the composite anode cell at lower temperatures (<700 degrees C) maybe predominately ascribed to the enhanced electrochemical activity as well as electric conductivity due to the presence of FNA exsolution.,Roles of Fe-Ni nanoparticles and SrLaFeO4 substrate in the performance and reliability of a composite anode prepared through in-situ exsolution for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (I),10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.090
4,15909,"The maximum power densities (PmaxS) of a single cell with the composite anode achieve 0.74, 0.58, 0.40, and 0.25 W cm(-2) at 800, 750, 700 and 650 degrees C, respectively, which is comparable to the performance of Fe-Ni-SDC cermets anode.",Roles of Fe-Ni nanoparticles and SrLaFeO4 substrate in the performance and reliability of a composite anode prepared through in-situ exsolution for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (I),10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.090
5,15909,"However, the long time stability of the composite anode is superior to that of the Fe-Ni-SDC cermets in various fuels, suggesting that SLF-FNA is sulfur tolerant and coking-tolerant composite anode material, which possess great potentials for future application.",Roles of Fe-Ni nanoparticles and SrLaFeO4 substrate in the performance and reliability of a composite anode prepared through in-situ exsolution for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (I),10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.090
