2,10244,"In this work, we prepared SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 composite cathodes with different layers (1x, 3x, 5x, 7x, and 9x layer).",Layering Optimization of the SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Composite Cathode,10.3390/molecules27082549
3,10244,The microstructural and electrochemical performance of each cell was then explored through scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).,Layering Optimization of the SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Composite Cathode,10.3390/molecules27082549
4,10244,EIS analysis showed that the area-specific resistance (ASR) decreased from 0.65 omega cm(2) to 0.12 omega cm(2) with the increase in the number of layers from a 1x to a 7x.,Layering Optimization of the SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Composite Cathode,10.3390/molecules27082549
5,10244,"However, the ASR started to slightly increase at the 9x layer to 2.95 omega cm(2) due to a higher loss of electrode polarization resulting from insufficient gas diffusion and transport.",Layering Optimization of the SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Composite Cathode,10.3390/molecules27082549
6,10244,"Therefore, increasing the number of cathode layers could increase the performance of the cathode by enlarging the active area for the reaction up to the threshold point.",Layering Optimization of the SrFe0.9Ti0.1O3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 Composite Cathode,10.3390/molecules27082549
