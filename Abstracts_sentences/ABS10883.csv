1,10883,Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-delta (SYT) was investigated as an alternative anode in humidified CH4 fuel for SOFCs at low temperatures (650 degrees C-750 degrees C) and compared with the conventional Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) anode.,Characteristics of Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ Anode in Humidified Methane Fuel for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5229/JECST.2016.7.1.33
2,10883,The goal of the study was to directly use a hydrocarbon fuel in a SOFC without a reforming process.,Characteristics of Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ Anode in Humidified Methane Fuel for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5229/JECST.2016.7.1.33
3,10883,The cell performance of the SYT anode was relatively low compared with that of the Ni/YSZ anode because of the poor electrochemical catalytic activity of SYT.,Characteristics of Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ Anode in Humidified Methane Fuel for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5229/JECST.2016.7.1.33
4,10883,"In the presence of CH4 fuel, however, the cell performance with the SYT anode decreased by 20%, in contrast to the 58% decrease in the case of the Ni/YSZ anode.",Characteristics of Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ Anode in Humidified Methane Fuel for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5229/JECST.2016.7.1.33
5,10883,The severe degradation of cell performance observed with the Ni/YSZ anode was caused by carbon deposition that resulted from methane thermal cracking.,Characteristics of Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ Anode in Humidified Methane Fuel for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5229/JECST.2016.7.1.33
6,10883,Carbon was much less detected in the SYT anode due to the catalytic oxidation.,Characteristics of Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ Anode in Humidified Methane Fuel for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5229/JECST.2016.7.1.33
7,10883,"Otherwise, a significant amount of bulk carbon was detected in the Ni/YSZ anode.",Characteristics of Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ Anode in Humidified Methane Fuel for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5229/JECST.2016.7.1.33
