4,6223,"It was found that the pressed pellets fabricated from both the phases had undergone shape changes due to swelling at temperatures above 800 degreesC. Since the processes of volume expansion and crystallization were found to compete with the sintering process, it was expected to be very difficult to achieve compact layers from these materials.",High-temperature superconductor materials for contact layers in solid oxide fuel cells: I.
