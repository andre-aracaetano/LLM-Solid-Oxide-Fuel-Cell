1,7640,"The heterointerface electrode, porous LaSrCoO4-delta on porous La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta, was examined by an ac impedance analysis.","Composite Cathode of Perovskite-Related Oxides, (La,Sr)CoO3-δ/(La,Sr)2CoO4-δ, for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/1.3170903
2,7640,The performance of the heterointerface electrode was higher than those of LaSrCoO4-delta and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta.,"Composite Cathode of Perovskite-Related Oxides, (La,Sr)CoO3-δ/(La,Sr)2CoO4-δ, for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/1.3170903
3,7640,The better performance is attributed to the enhancement of oxygen surface reaction at the heterointerface of LaSrCoO4-delta and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta.,"Composite Cathode of Perovskite-Related Oxides, (La,Sr)CoO3-δ/(La,Sr)2CoO4-δ, for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/1.3170903
4,7640,"The results are consistent with high surface exchange coefficients at the heterointerface between LaSrCoO4-delta and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta, which were determined by oxygen isotope diffusion experiment.","Composite Cathode of Perovskite-Related Oxides, (La,Sr)CoO3-δ/(La,Sr)2CoO4-δ, for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1149/1.3170903
