2,9484,The anode microstructure has a more severe effect on the electrochemical properties of the anode-supported microtubular SOFCs because of the small inside diameter and thickness of the anode.,AC impedance characteristics for anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2012.02.021
3,9484,"For example, the maximum current density and fuel utilization for the cells sintered at 1400 degrees C were lower than that at 1350 degrees C due to the low porosity of the anode.",AC impedance characteristics for anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2012.02.021
4,9484,"However, it is difficult to separate the anode and cathode impedances by the general method of complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) with equivalent circuit models, because several components overlap for the impedance spectra measured between the anode and cathode without a reference electrode.",AC impedance characteristics for anode-supported microtubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2012.02.021
