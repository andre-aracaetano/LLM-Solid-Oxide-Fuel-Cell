3,5969,"XRD results suggest that a solid solution reaction occurs between YSZ and CCO after sintering at 1400 degreesC for 10 h. From the impedance results, the conclusion can be drawn that the (CCO)(0.25)(YSZ)(0.75) solid solution is a mixed conductor (ionic and electronic).",An anode for solid oxide fuel cells:: NiO+(Ce0.9Ca0.1O1.9)0.25 (YSZ)0.75 solid solution,10.1016/S0925-8388(03)00378-5
