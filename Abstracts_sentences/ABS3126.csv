1,3126,Gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering is utilized as the anode interlayer for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) with a nanothin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and Ni/Pt electrodes.,Doped ceria anode interlayer for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with nanothin electrolyte,10.1016/j.tsf.2015.05.005
2,3126,"When the thickness ratio of YSZ electrolyte versus 100 nm GDC anode interlayer is at or below 1.5, the electrochemical performance of the LT-SOFC is severely poor due to the microstructural instability of the GDC anode interlayer under high-temperature reducing atmospheric conditions.",Doped ceria anode interlayer for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with nanothin electrolyte,10.1016/j.tsf.2015.05.005
3,3126,"At 500 degrees C, the peak power density of the LT-SOFC with a Ni anode and a 20 nm GDC anode interlayer is similar to 30% higher than that without the GDC anode interlayer due to faster reaction kinetics on the anode side.",Doped ceria anode interlayer for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with nanothin electrolyte,10.1016/j.tsf.2015.05.005
