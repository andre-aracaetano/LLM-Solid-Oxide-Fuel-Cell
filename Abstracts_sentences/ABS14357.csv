1,14357,"In order to understand the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) mechanism in real Ni/YSZ porous anodes, the electrochemical properties as a function of hydrogen partial pressure p(H-2) and water vapor pressure p(H2O) (dry, 1% - 60% humidity) at 973 K of a commercial anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) were measured.",Dependence of hydrogen oxidation reaction on water vapor in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115565
2,14357,The impedance spectra from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement were analyzed by 1-D approximation transmission line model (TLM) to observe changes in the reaction resistance (r(P)) between the Ni/YSZ and reaction capacitance (C-p) from the anode.,Dependence of hydrogen oxidation reaction on water vapor in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115565
3,14357,"From the analysis, r(p) is essentially independent over p(H-2) in dry atmosphere but decreased with increasing p(H2O) at the anode side.",Dependence of hydrogen oxidation reaction on water vapor in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115565
4,14357,"In contrast, the r(p) shows a large dependency on p(H-2) in wet atmosphere indicating that the rate-limiting step of HOR is probably different between dry and wet atmospheres.",Dependence of hydrogen oxidation reaction on water vapor in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115565
5,14357,"On the other hand, the C-p is independent of p(H-2) in dry and wet condition.",Dependence of hydrogen oxidation reaction on water vapor in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115565
6,14357,"However, similar to r(p), it has strong dependency on p(H2O).",Dependence of hydrogen oxidation reaction on water vapor in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115565
7,14357,"From these results, the difference in HOR between dry and wet atmospheres is assumed to be an additional reaction pathway formed in the latter where the formation of OHad- on the Ni metal surface possibly enhanced the HOR rate.",Dependence of hydrogen oxidation reaction on water vapor in anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2021.115565
