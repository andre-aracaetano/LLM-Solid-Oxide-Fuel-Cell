1,7713,"(Ba0.5Sr0.5)(1+x)Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, or BSCF(I + x), (0 <= x <= 0.3) oxides were synthesized and investigated as cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells.",Barium- and strontium-enriched (Ba0.5Sr0.5)1+xCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ oxides as high-performance cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2008.02.002
2,7713,"The A-site cation excess in BSCF(I + x) resulted in a lattice expansion and the creation of more active sites for oxygen reduction reaction due to the lowered valence states of the B-site ions and the increased oxygen vacancy concentration, which improved the oxygen adsorption process.",Barium- and strontium-enriched (Ba0.5Sr0.5)1+xCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ oxides as high-performance cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2008.02.002
3,7713,"On the other hand, the A-site excess could also result in higher resistances for oxygen adsorption (due to the formation of BaO and/or SrO impurities), and oxygen-ion transfer (by facilitating the solid-phase reaction between the cathode and the electrolyte).",Barium- and strontium-enriched (Ba0.5Sr0.5)1+xCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ oxides as high-performance cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2008.02.002
4,7713,"By taking all these factors into account, we found BSCF1.03 to be the optimal composition, which lead to a peak power density of 1026.2 +/- 12.7 mW cm(-2) at 650 degrees C for a single cell.",Barium- and strontium-enriched (Ba0.5Sr0.5)1+xCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ oxides as high-performance cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.actamat.2008.02.002
