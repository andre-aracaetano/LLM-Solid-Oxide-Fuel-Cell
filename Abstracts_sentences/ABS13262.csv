5,13262,"In terms of cell performance, Cell B demonstrates an OCV value (>1.07 V) similar to that of Cell A and a maximum power density (0.26W cm(-2)) 44.4% greater than that of Cell A (0.17 W cm(-2)) at 850 degrees C. It can thus be concluded that using the LSCF-GDC composite-cathode layer and inserting the GDC interlayer help reduce the total cell impedance, thereby improving the power density of the tubular cells.",Effects of cathode materials on the characteristics of electrolyte supported micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.113
