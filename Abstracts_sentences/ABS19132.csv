1,19132,"Doped ceria electrolytes of Ce1-aGda-ySmyO2 0.5a, wherein a=0.15 or 0.2, and 0 less than or equal to y less than or equal to a, were prepared with the citrate method, and characterized by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry, energy dispersive spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and AC impedance spectroscopy.",Study on Gd3+ and Sm3+ co-doped ceria-based electrolytes,10.1007/s10008-004-0575-0
2,19132,The effect of composition on the structure and conductivity was studied.,Study on Gd3+ and Sm3+ co-doped ceria-based electrolytes,10.1007/s10008-004-0575-0
3,19132,All the samples were fluorite-type ceria-based solid solutions.,Study on Gd3+ and Sm3+ co-doped ceria-based electrolytes,10.1007/s10008-004-0575-0
4,19132,"For the singly doped samples, the optimal composition was Ce0.85Gd0.15O1.925 for Gd3+-doped ceria (CGO), which showed higher ionic conductivity than the best Sm3+-doped ceria (CSO) at 773-973 K. For the co-doped samples, the ionic conductivities were higher than those of the singly doped ones in the temperature range 673-973 K when a=0.15, but only better in 673-773 K when a=0.2.",Study on Gd3+ and Sm3+ co-doped ceria-based electrolytes,10.1007/s10008-004-0575-0
5,19132,"For the samples of Ce0.85Gd0.15-ySmyO1.925, wherein 0.05 less than or equal to y less than or equal to 0.1, much higher ionic conductivity was observed than those of the singly doped ceria at 773Ksimilar to973 K. Therefore, these co-doped samples would be better than CGO and CSO to be the electrolytes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.",Study on Gd3+ and Sm3+ co-doped ceria-based electrolytes,10.1007/s10008-004-0575-0
