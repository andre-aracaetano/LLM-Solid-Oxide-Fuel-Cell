1,15993,"In this work, a cerium-gadolinium oxide (CGO)/nickel (Ni)-CGO hollow fibre (HF) for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which consists of a fully gas-tight outer electrolyte layer supported on a porous inner composite anode layer, has been developed via a novel single-step co-extrusion/co-sintering technique, followed by an easy reduction process.",Novel fabrication technique of hollow fibre support for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.006
2,15993,"After depositing a multi-layers cathode layer and applying current collectors on both anode and cathode, a micro-tubular SOFC is developed with the maximum power densities of 440-1000W m(-2) at 450-580 degrees C. Efforts have been made in enhancing the performance of the cell by reducing the co-sintering temperature and improving the cathode layer and current collection from inner (anode) wall.",Novel fabrication technique of hollow fibre support for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.006
3,15993,"The improved cell produces maximum power densities of 3400-6800W m(-2) at 550-600 degrees C, almost fivefold higher than the previous cell.",Novel fabrication technique of hollow fibre support for micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.006
