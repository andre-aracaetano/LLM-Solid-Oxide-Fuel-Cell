1,20016,"Mechanical and electrical properties of specimens of ZrO2 (3Y) doped with RENbO4 (RE =Yb, Er, Y, Dy, YNd, Sm, Nd) were investigated using micro-indentation and impedance spectroscopy in this work.","Mechanical and electrical properties of ZrO2 (3Y) doped with RENbO4 (RE = Yb, Er, Y, Dy, YNd, Sm, Nd)",10.1051/jp4:2005128032
2,20016,"The results show that ZrO2 (3Y) doped with RENbO4 (RE =Yb, Er, Y, Dy) possess outstanding mechanical properties, and specimens with RENbO4 (RE=Y, Nd, Sm) exhibit increasing amount of the monoclinic phase after fabrication, but still show fairly good mechanical behavior compared to those of 3Y-TZP and 8YSZ, indicating that mechanical properties can be correlated with the phase transformation behavior modified by ionic radius of dopants.","Mechanical and electrical properties of ZrO2 (3Y) doped with RENbO4 (RE = Yb, Er, Y, Dy, YNd, Sm, Nd)",10.1051/jp4:2005128032
3,20016,The total conductivity of 5 mol %RENbO4-doped ZrO2 (3Y) comprises the intragrain conductivity and grain boundary (GB).,"Mechanical and electrical properties of ZrO2 (3Y) doped with RENbO4 (RE = Yb, Er, Y, Dy, YNd, Sm, Nd)",10.1051/jp4:2005128032
4,20016,The intragrain conductivity of 5 mol %RENbO4-doped ZrO2 (3Y) are lower than 3Y-TZP and 8YSZ.,"Mechanical and electrical properties of ZrO2 (3Y) doped with RENbO4 (RE = Yb, Er, Y, Dy, YNd, Sm, Nd)",10.1051/jp4:2005128032
5,20016,"The addition of RENb04 to ZrO2 (3Y) increases average binding energy and activation energy, and reduces the amount of oxygen vacancies.","Mechanical and electrical properties of ZrO2 (3Y) doped with RENbO4 (RE = Yb, Er, Y, Dy, YNd, Sm, Nd)",10.1051/jp4:2005128032
6,20016,"The results imply that a specific doping content in zirconia which contributes a maximum content of non-interfering oxygen vacancies, the average radius of doping ions close to that of Zr4+ and average binding energy as smaller as possible help to achieve the highest conductivity of zirconia.","Mechanical and electrical properties of ZrO2 (3Y) doped with RENbO4 (RE = Yb, Er, Y, Dy, YNd, Sm, Nd)",10.1051/jp4:2005128032
7,20016,"The conditions deviate from those possessing the best mechanical properties, suggesting that to obtain an appropriate electrolyte in the application of a solid oxide fuel cell, mechanical properties and electrical properties of zirconia need to be compromised.","Mechanical and electrical properties of ZrO2 (3Y) doped with RENbO4 (RE = Yb, Er, Y, Dy, YNd, Sm, Nd)",10.1051/jp4:2005128032
