1,6645,In the present paper the use of Ni infiltration into preformed porous yttria-stabilized zirconia structures is investigated as a possible solution to the redox problem of Ni-based solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes and anode supports.,Ni infiltration as a possible solution to the redox problem of SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2959078
2,6645,"It is shown that cermets containing 12-16 wt % Ni prepared by infiltration exhibited a conductivity above 300 S cm(-1) at room temperature, which dropped by 20% after one redox cycle, but was not accompanied by bulk dimensional changes.",Ni infiltration as a possible solution to the redox problem of SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2959078
3,6645,The dimensional stability is attributed to the properties of the microstructure that is produced by infiltration.,Ni infiltration as a possible solution to the redox problem of SOFC anodes,10.1149/1.2959078
