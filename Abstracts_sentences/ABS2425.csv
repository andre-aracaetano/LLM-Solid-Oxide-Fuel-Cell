1,2425,A high-performance composite anode has been developed for H2S-air solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,High-performance anode for H2S-Air SOFCs,10.1149/1.1636177
2,2425,The anode design is based on the requirements of three-phase boundary theory.,High-performance anode for H2S-Air SOFCs,10.1149/1.1636177
3,2425,"The anode material comprises a mixture of composite metal sulfide (Mo-Ni-S) catalyst prepared from MoS2 and NiS (1: 1 weight ratio), admixed with up to 10% each of Ag as electronic conductor and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as ionic conductor.",High-performance anode for H2S-Air SOFCs,10.1149/1.1636177
4,2425,"The optimum composition is about 90 wt % Mo-Ni-S, 5 wt % Ag, and 5 wt % YSZ.",High-performance anode for H2S-Air SOFCs,10.1149/1.1636177
5,2425,"A fuel cell using a 0.2 mm thick YSZ membrane produced a maximum sustainable current density over 480 mA cm(-2) at 750 degreesC and over 800 mA cm(-2) at 850 degreesC, and maximum power density 50 mW cm(-2) at 750 degreesC and over 200 mW cm(-2) at 850 degreesC.
