1,20254,"The present research, as a part of the OTM materials development and testing effort, examines the combined effect of the Cr: Fe ratio (7:3, 8:2 and 9:1) and oxygen partial pressure (PO2) on the densification, microstructural development, and chemical stability of lanthanum chromite (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)Cr1-xFexO3 (LSCrF) for application in oxygen transport membrane and solid oxide fuel cell electrode.",Role of chromium: Iron ratio and oxygen partial pressure on the processing and chemical stability of iron doped lanthanum strontium chromite based OTM,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.08.140
2,20254,"While highest density of 96.3 (+/- 0.5) % is achieved for LSCrF with Cr: Fe ratio of 7:3 at 1400 degrees C and PO2 similar to 10(-10) atm., the relative density decreases with increase in Cr: Fe ratio and PO2. LSCrF perovskite stability increases with increase in Cr: Fe ratio in reducing gas atmosphere.",Role of chromium: Iron ratio and oxygen partial pressure on the processing and chemical stability of iron doped lanthanum strontium chromite based OTM,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.08.140
