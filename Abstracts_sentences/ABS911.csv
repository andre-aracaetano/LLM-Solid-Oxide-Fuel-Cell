1,911,A quickly rechargeable direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (RDCFC) that uses a solid carbon fuel supplied by thermal decomposition of propane was developed.,Quickly rechargeable direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell with propane for recharging,10.1149/1.2203948
2,911,"This RDCFC, after a fuel charging time of only 5 min, maintained a power density of 44.2-50.4 mW/cm(2) for 83 min, had a maximum power density of 52 mW/cm(2), and exhibited these stable characteristics for at least six cycles of power generation and charging.",Quickly rechargeable direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell with propane for recharging,10.1149/1.2203948
3,911,"This new type of solid oxide fuel cell can be used as a compact, portable power unit.",Quickly rechargeable direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell with propane for recharging,10.1149/1.2203948
