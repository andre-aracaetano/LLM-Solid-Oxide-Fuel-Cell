1,11988,"Among promising applications, LiKCO3 can be used as component of the oxide carbonate electrolytes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs), but the species ensuring the transport at the interface between the two phases is still undetermined.",Defect Formation and Diffusion on the (001) Surface of LiKCO3 for Fuel Cell Applications: Insight from Hybrid DFT,10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b04000
2,11988,"In view of better clarifying the role of the carbonate phase in these materials, we studied the dominant Li-related diffusion carriers and their diffusion pathways on the LiKCO3 (001) surface by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, based on the hybrid functional PBEO for the exchange and correlation terms.",Defect Formation and Diffusion on the (001) Surface of LiKCO3 for Fuel Cell Applications: Insight from Hybrid DFT,10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b04000
3,11988,"Among the four different defect types considered, Vlii was found to be the thermodynamically most stable defect in LiKCO3, but the dominant diffusion carrier was Li-i(+), with low diffusion barriers whose origin could be related to high O-coordination and low electrostatic repulsion arguments.",Defect Formation and Diffusion on the (001) Surface of LiKCO3 for Fuel Cell Applications: Insight from Hybrid DFT,10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b04000
4,11988,The effect of the voltage applied in SOFC devices on diffusion paths was also taken into account by performing calculations in the presence of an external electric field and was found to play a major role in some cases.,Defect Formation and Diffusion on the (001) Surface of LiKCO3 for Fuel Cell Applications: Insight from Hybrid DFT,10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b04000
