1,14180,A planar anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has been tested to investigate gas tightness of the electrolyte and the applied seals.,Study of Internal and External Leaks in Tests of Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800019
2,14180,Gas leaks reduce the efficiency of the SOFC and it is thus important to determine and minimise them.,Study of Internal and External Leaks in Tests of Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800019
3,14180,Probe gases (He and Ar) and a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer were used to detect both internal (through electrolyte) and external (through seals) gas leaks.,Study of Internal and External Leaks in Tests of Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800019
4,14180,"The internal gas leak through the electrolyte was quantified under different conditions, as was the external leak from the surroundings to the anode.",Study of Internal and External Leaks in Tests of Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800019
5,14180,"The internal gas leak did not depend on the pressure difference between the anode and the cathode gas compartment, and can thus be described as diffusion driven.",Study of Internal and External Leaks in Tests of Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800019
6,14180,"External leaks between the surroundings and the anode, but not the cathode gas compartment was observed.",Study of Internal and External Leaks in Tests of Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800019
7,14180,They were influenced by the pressure difference and are thus driven by both concentration and pressure gradients.,Study of Internal and External Leaks in Tests of Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800019
8,14180,The measured gas leaks deduced from the probe gas experiments and the total leak calculated from the deviation between the Emf defined by the gases and the cell OCV (which contains all gas leaks as well as effects of electronic leaks) were compared.,Study of Internal and External Leaks in Tests of Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800019
9,14180,Good agreement between the two measures was observed.,Study of Internal and External Leaks in Tests of Anode-Supported SOFCs,10.1002/fuce.200800019
