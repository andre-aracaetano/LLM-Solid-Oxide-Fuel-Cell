1,12714,"Sr2-xLaxMnO4+delta (x = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) oxides were studied as the cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).",Substituted Sr2MnO4 as a possible cathode material in SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.12.090
2,12714,"The reactivity tests indicated that no reaction occurred between Sr2-xLaxMnO4+delta and CGO at annealing temperature of 1000 degrees C, and the electrode formed good contact with the electrolyte after being sintered at 1000 degrees C for 4 h. The total electrical conductivity, which has strong effect on the electrode properties, was determined in a temperature range from 100 to 800 degrees C.",Substituted Sr2MnO4 as a possible cathode material in SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.12.090
