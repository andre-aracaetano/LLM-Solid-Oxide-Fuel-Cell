3,2953,"The anode-supported button solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), NiO-BCZY7/BCZY7/La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta(LSCF)-BCZY7, was fabricated by combining the dip-coating and co-sintering processes.",Fabrication and Characterization of Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on Proton Conductor Electrolyte,10.15541/jim20190576
4,2953,It operated by using H-2 (containing 3vol% H2O) as fuel and ambient air as oxidant.,Fabrication and Characterization of Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on Proton Conductor Electrolyte,10.15541/jim20190576
5,2953,"The maximum power density of the cell reaches 203, 123 and 92 mW.cm(-2) at 600, 550 and 500 degrees C, respectively.",Fabrication and Characterization of Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on Proton Conductor Electrolyte,10.15541/jim20190576
6,2953,"However, traditional SOFCs based on (ZrO2)(0.92)(Y2O3)(0.08) electrolyte usually display only tens of milliwatts output per unit area at 600 degrees C. Proton conducting electrolyte greatly improves the low and medium temperature performance of SOFCs and provides a promising solution to reduce SOFCs' operating temperature.",Fabrication and Characterization of Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Based on Proton Conductor Electrolyte,10.15541/jim20190576
