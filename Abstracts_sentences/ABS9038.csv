1,9038,"The impact of thiophene in the fuel gas of a commercial solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system is investigated for concentrations up to 400 ppmV. Based on the measured voltage-current curves, an empiric correlation for the estimation of the expectable power output of the investigated SOFC system when operated with sulfur containing fuel gases is derived.",The impact of sulfur on the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system operated with hydrocarboneous fuel gas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.092
2,9038,An interrelation between the open circuit voltage (OCV) and the sulfur concentration of the investigated hydrocarboneous fuel gas is presented and discussed based on corresponding model simulations.,The impact of sulfur on the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system operated with hydrocarboneous fuel gas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.092
3,9038,The reduction of the steam reforming(STR) activity of the anode cermet material and of the catalytic partial oxidation catalyst used for the fuel gas processing in the investigated SOFC system are found important factors regarding the power output reduction induced by sulfur traces in the fuel gas of SOFCs.,The impact of sulfur on the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system operated with hydrocarboneous fuel gas,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.12.092
