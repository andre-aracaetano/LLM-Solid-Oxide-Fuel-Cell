2,11869,Also determined is the concentration of these gases and of diluent gases as a function of position across the anode.,Anode-pore tortuosity in solid oxide fuel cells found from gas and current flow rates,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.073
3,11869,The calculation is based on the dusty-gas model which includes a Knudsen (molecule-wall) collision term in the Stefan-Maxwell equation which is based on unlike-molecule collisions.,Anode-pore tortuosity in solid oxide fuel cells found from gas and current flow rates,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.073
4,11869,Commonly made approximations are avoided in order to obtain more exact results.,Anode-pore tortuosity in solid oxide fuel cells found from gas and current flow rates,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.073
5,11869,One such approximation is the assumption of uniform total gas pressure across the anode.,Anode-pore tortuosity in solid oxide fuel cells found from gas and current flow rates,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.073
6,11869,Another such approximation is the assumption of zero fuel gas concentration at the anode-electrolyte interface under the anode saturation condition for which the SOFC output voltage goes to zero.,Anode-pore tortuosity in solid oxide fuel cells found from gas and current flow rates,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.073
7,11869,Elimination of this approximation requires use of a model we developed (published elsewhere) for terminal voltage V as a function of electrolyte current density i. Key formulae from this model are presented.,Anode-pore tortuosity in solid oxide fuel cells found from gas and current flow rates,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.073

10,11869,"They are in fair agreement with those obtained by the other group, once a difference in nomenclature is taken into account.",Anode-pore tortuosity in solid oxide fuel cells found from gas and current flow rates,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.073
11,11869,"This difference consists in their definition of tortuosity being what some call tortuosity factor, which is the square of what we and some others call tortuosity.",Anode-pore tortuosity in solid oxide fuel cells found from gas and current flow rates,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.073
12,11869,"The results emphasize the need for careful design of anode pore structures, especially in anode-supported SOFCs which require thicker anodes.",Anode-pore tortuosity in solid oxide fuel cells found from gas and current flow rates,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.073
