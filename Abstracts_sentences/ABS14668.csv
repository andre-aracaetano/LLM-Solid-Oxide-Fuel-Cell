6,14668,"W doped in TiO2 mainly exists as W. W doping not only hinders the outward diffusion of Ti by decreasing the concentration of native Ti interstitials in TiO2, but also restrains the inward diffusion of oxygen by decreasing the concentration of O vacancies.","Exploring a novel ceramic (Ti,W)3SiC2 for interconnect of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.02.162
7,14668,"Furthermore, W dopant in TiO2 enhances the electrical conductivity of TiO2 by increasing the concentration of semi-free electron.","Exploring a novel ceramic (Ti,W)3SiC2 for interconnect of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.02.162
8,14668,"Therefore, the low ASR of (Ti,W)(3)SiC2 after oxidation owes to high electrical conductivity of TiO2 as well as the reduced thickness of oxide scale.","Exploring a novel ceramic (Ti,W)3SiC2 for interconnect of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.02.162
