1,9176,"As part of an effort to develop cost-effective ferritic stainless steel-based interconnects for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks, both bare A1S1441 and AIS1441 coated with (Mn,Co)(3)O-4 protection layers were studied in terms of its metallurgical characteristics, oxidation behavior, and electrical performance.",Investigation of iron-chromium-niobium-titanium ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.037
2,9176,"The addition of minor alloying elements, in particular Nb, led to formation of Laves phases both inside grains and along grain boundaries, In particular, the Laves phase which precipitated out along grain boundaries during exposure at intermediate SOFC operating temperatures was found to be rich in both Nb and Si.",Investigation of iron-chromium-niobium-titanium ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.037
3,9176,"The capture of Si in the Laves phase minimized the Si activity in the alloy matrix and prevented formation of an insulating silica layer at the scale/metal interface, resulting in a reduction in area-specific electrical resistance (ASR).",Investigation of iron-chromium-niobium-titanium ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.037
4,9176,"However, the relatively high oxidation rate of the steel, which leads to increasing ASR overtime, and the need to prevent volatilization of chromium from the steel necessitates the application of a conductive protection layer on the steel.",Investigation of iron-chromium-niobium-titanium ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.037
5,9176,"In particular, the application of a Mn1.5Co1.5O4 spinel Protection layer substantially improved the electrical performance of the 441 by reducing the oxidation rate.",Investigation of iron-chromium-niobium-titanium ferritic stainless steel for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.05.037
