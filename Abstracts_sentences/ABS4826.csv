1,4826,"An engineering analysis based on calibrated numerical predictions was performed to estimate the minimum allowable impurity concentrations in coal syngas intended to be used in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) operating for over 10,000 h. Arsine and phosphine, impurities that are known to have the most deleterious effects on the cell performance due to their affinity to have strong relations with the anode catalyst by formation of secondary phases, were investigated.",A Degradation Model for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes Due to Impurities in Coal Syngas: Part II Estimation of Tolerance Limits,10.1002/fuce.201500056
2,4826,"Time to failure was taken as the operation time when 60% performance loss is incurred, estimated by the previously developed one-dimensional degradation model.",A Degradation Model for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Anodes Due to Impurities in Coal Syngas: Part II Estimation of Tolerance Limits,10.1002/fuce.201500056
