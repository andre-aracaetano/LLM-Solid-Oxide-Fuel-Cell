1,780,"While cobalt-containing perovskite-type cathode materials facilitate the activation of oxygen reduction, they also suffer from problems like poor chemical stability in CO2, high thermal expansion coefficients, etc. Partial B site substitution with Fe element is expected to be able to mitigate these problems while keeping high catalyst performance.",Novel layered perovskite GdBaCoFeO5+δ as a potential cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.02.027
2,780,"In this paper, a layered perovskite GdBaCoFeO5+delta (GBCF) was developed as a cathode material for protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells (PCMFCs) based on proton-conducting electrolyte of stable BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY7).",Novel layered perovskite GdBaCoFeO5+δ as a potential cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.02.027
3,780,The button cells of Ni-BZCY7 vertical bar BZCY7 vertical bar GBCF were fabricated and tested from 600 to 700 degrees C with humidified H-2 (similar to 3% H2O) as a fuel and ambient oxygen as oxidant.,Novel layered perovskite GdBaCoFeO5+δ as a potential cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.02.027
