3,15643,"Notably, the effect of naphthalene is almost negligible with pure H-2 feed to the SOFC, whereas a severe degradation is observed when using a bio-syngas with an H-2:CO = 1.",The effect of heavy tars (toluene and naphthalene) on the electrochemical performance of an anode-supported SOFC running on bio-syngas,10.1016/j.renene.2016.07.029
4,15643,"The tar compound showed to have a remarkable effect on the inhibition of the WGS shift-reaction, possibly also on the CO direct electro-oxidation at the three-phase-boundary.",The effect of heavy tars (toluene and naphthalene) on the electrochemical performance of an anode-supported SOFC running on bio-syngas,10.1016/j.renene.2016.07.029
5,15643,An interaction through adsorption of naphthalene on nickel catalytic and electrocatalytic active sites is a plausible explanation for observed degradation and strong performance loss.,The effect of heavy tars (toluene and naphthalene) on the electrochemical performance of an anode-supported SOFC running on bio-syngas,10.1016/j.renene.2016.07.029
6,15643,Different sites seem to be involved for H-2 and CO electro-oxidation and also with regard to catalytic water gas shift reaction.,The effect of heavy tars (toluene and naphthalene) on the electrochemical performance of an anode-supported SOFC running on bio-syngas,10.1016/j.renene.2016.07.029
7,15643,"Finally, heavy tars (C >= 10) must be regarded as a poison more than a fuel for SOFC applications, contrarily to lighter compounds such benzene or toluene that can directly reformed within the anode electrode.",The effect of heavy tars (toluene and naphthalene) on the electrochemical performance of an anode-supported SOFC running on bio-syngas,10.1016/j.renene.2016.07.029
8,15643,The presence of naphthalene strongly increases the risk of anode re-oxidation in a syngas stream as CO conversion to H-2 is inhibited and also CH4 conversion is blocked.,The effect of heavy tars (toluene and naphthalene) on the electrochemical performance of an anode-supported SOFC running on bio-syngas,10.1016/j.renene.2016.07.029
