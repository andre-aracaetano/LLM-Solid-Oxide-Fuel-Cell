1,5443,Doped lanthanum chromites are investigated as ceramic interconnect materials to be used in high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,PhysicoChemical Characterization of Strontium- and Cobalt-Doped Lanthanum Chromite Powders Produced by Combustion Synthesis,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02302.x
2,5443,"In this work, a La(0.80)Sr(0.20)Cr(0.92)Co(0.08)O(3) powder was produced by combustion synthesis and characterized in terms of phases and crystalline structure, thermal evolution, particle size, and surface behavior.",PhysicoChemical Characterization of Strontium- and Cobalt-Doped Lanthanum Chromite Powders Produced by Combustion Synthesis,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02302.x
3,5443,The effects of milling time on the particle size distribution and the agglomeration factor were also studied.,PhysicoChemical Characterization of Strontium- and Cobalt-Doped Lanthanum Chromite Powders Produced by Combustion Synthesis,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02302.x
4,5443,The physicochemical characterization was completed with zeta potential measurements in order to establish the isoelectric point and the best pH conditions because slurry-processing techniques are mostly used for the manufacture of the SOFC devices.,PhysicoChemical Characterization of Strontium- and Cobalt-Doped Lanthanum Chromite Powders Produced by Combustion Synthesis,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02302.x
