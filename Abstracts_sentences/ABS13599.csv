1,13599,Cobalt-free perovskite oxides Pr1-xCaxFe0.8Ni0.2O3 (PCFN) were investigated as novel cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,A novel one step synthesized Co-free perovskite/brownmillerite nanocomposite for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c1jm10911a
2,13599,"Ca and Ni substitution in the PrFeO3 material shows that a wide range of perovskites Pr1-xCaxFe0.8Ni0.2O3 (0 < x < 0.9) can be prepared by sintering in air at 600 degrees C. Perovskites with 0 < x < 0.4 exhibit orthorhombic single phases (Pnma space group), whereas 0.4 < x < 0.9 show a coexistence of the perovskite and the brownmillerite-type structure (Ca2Fe2O5).",A novel one step synthesized Co-free perovskite/brownmillerite nanocomposite for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c1jm10911a
