1,3507,A new type of bilayered-anode for application in biogas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was investigated.,Preparation of La/Co/Ni-based anode catalyst for biogas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-015-9994-9
2,3507,The bilayered-anode consisted of lanthanum- and cobalt-doped nickel oxide mixed with Sc2O3-stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte material (LaCoNi-ScSZ) as a functional catalyst layer mainly for the reforming reaction and NiO-ScSZ as an active anode layer mainly for the electrochemical reaction.,Preparation of La/Co/Ni-based anode catalyst for biogas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-015-9994-9
3,3507,The cell performance was characterized by recording I-V curves and impedance spectra.,Preparation of La/Co/Ni-based anode catalyst for biogas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-015-9994-9
4,3507,The SOFC featuring the LaCoNi-ScSZ functional catalyst anode layer exhibited a power density of 0.32 W/cm(2) when operated under a humidified synthetic biogas (60 % CH4 and 40 % CO2) at 700 A degrees C.,Preparation of La/Co/Ni-based anode catalyst for biogas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-015-9994-9
5,3507,"The presence of LaCoNi-ScSZ functional catalyst afforded a high coking resistance, and thus the cell was stable when operated under the synthetic biogas at 700 A degrees C for 45 h.",Preparation of La/Co/Ni-based anode catalyst for biogas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10832-015-9994-9
