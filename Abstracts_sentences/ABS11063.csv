2,11063,It was found that the as-prepared nanofibers manifested ferromagnetism at low temperatures.,Low-temperature electrical and magnetic properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ nanofibers prepared by electrospinning,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.198
3,11063,"Moreover, the resistance and magnetoresistance (MR) data conformed to the one-dimensional variable range hopping (1D VRH) model and revealed that LSCFO nanofibers had different electronic conduction behavior at different temperatures and magnetic fields.",Low-temperature electrical and magnetic properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ nanofibers prepared by electrospinning,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.198
4,11063,"LSCFO nanofibers had small negative MR at low temperatures and large positive MR at high temperatures, and the transition temperature ranged between 240 and 260 K. The negative MR and the positive MR of LSCFO nanofibers manifested a fit to the 1D weak localization model and the 1D VRH model, respectively.",Low-temperature electrical and magnetic properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ nanofibers prepared by electrospinning,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.198
5,11063,"Therefore, the proposed work can provide an important reference to the design of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on the LSCFO cathode.",Low-temperature electrical and magnetic properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ nanofibers prepared by electrospinning,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.12.198
