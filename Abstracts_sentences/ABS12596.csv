3,12596,"Single test cells with samarium oxide doped ceria (SDC) as the electrolyte, Ni-SDC cermet as the anode, and the above-mentioned cathode material were fabricated for cell performance measurements at 700 degrees C. Current interruption measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis revealed that the cathode properties of Pr2NiO4, Pr2Ni0.9Cu0.1O4, Pr2Ni0.75Cu0.25O4, and Pr1.91Ni0.71Cu0.24Ga0.05O4 were comparable to that of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) and the cathode properties of Pr2NiO4 were improved by doping with Cu or Cu-Ga at the Ni site of Pr2NiO4.",Electrode properties of doped Pr2NiO4-based oxide cathode for intermediate-temperature SOFCs,10.2109/jcersj2.120.534
