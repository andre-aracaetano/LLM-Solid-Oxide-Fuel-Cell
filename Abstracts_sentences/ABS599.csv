6,599,It is shown that the hybrid system can achieve greater dynamic response over a larger operating envelope than either individual sub-system; the fuel cell or gas turbine.,Fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid system design part II: Dynamics and control,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.123
7,599,"Results indicate that a combined feed-forward, P-1 and cascade control strategy is capable of handling moderate perturbations and achieving a 2:1 (MCFC) or 4:1 (SOFC) turndown ratio while retaining >65% fuel-to-electricity efficiency, while maintaining an acceptable stack temperature profile and stall/surge margin.",Fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid system design part II: Dynamics and control,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.11.123
