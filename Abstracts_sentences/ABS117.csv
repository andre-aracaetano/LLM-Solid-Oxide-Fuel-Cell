1,117,Conversion of biomass in syngas by means of indirect gasification offers the option to improve the economic situation of any fuel cell system due to lower costs for feedstock and higher power revenues in many European countries.,Conversion of Syngas From Biomass in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.2971172
2,117,The coupling of an indirect gasification of biomass and residues with highly efficient solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems is therefore a promising technology for reaching economic feasibility of small decentralized combined heat and power production (CHP).The predicted efficiency of common high temperature fuel cell systems with integrated gasification of solid feedstock is usually significantly lower than the efficiency of fuel cells operated with hydrogen or methane.,Conversion of Syngas From Biomass in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.2971172
3,117,Additional system components like the gasifier as well as the gas cleaning reduce this efficiency.,Conversion of Syngas From Biomass in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.2971172

6,117,A simple combination of a SOFC and an allothermal gasifier enables then electrical efficiencies above 50%.,Conversion of Syngas From Biomass in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.2971172
7,117,"However, this system requires an innovative cooling concept for the fuel cell stack.",Conversion of Syngas From Biomass in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.2971172
8,117,Another significant question is the influence of impurities on the fuel cell degradation.,Conversion of Syngas From Biomass in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.2971172
9,117,The European Research Project BioCellus focuses on both questions-the influence of the biogenous syngas on the fuel cells and an innovative cooling concept based on liquid metal heat pipes.,Conversion of Syngas From Biomass in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.2971172
10,117,"First experiments showed that, in particular, higher hydrocarbons-the so-called tars-do not have any significant influence on the performance of SOFC membranes.",Conversion of Syngas From Biomass in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.2971172
