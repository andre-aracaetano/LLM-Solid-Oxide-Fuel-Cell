2,18564,"In the next step, the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method was used to apply the NiFe2O4 spinel, as an oxidation-resistant layer, on a commercially available stainless steel (SUS 430) in a potential range of 100 to 300 V. Microscopic studies of the deposited layers showed that crack-free NiFe2O4 films were obtained at 100 V. The coated and uncoated samples were then pre-sintered in air and 5% H-2 bal Ar atmospheres at 900 A degrees C for 3 h followed by cyclic oxidation at 800 A degrees C for 500 h. The investigation of the oxidation resistance of the samples using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) revealed that the NiFe2O4 coating acted as an effective barrier against chromium migration into the coating.",NiFe2O4 Spinel Protection Coating for High-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Interconnect Application,10.1007/s11665-016-1949-z
