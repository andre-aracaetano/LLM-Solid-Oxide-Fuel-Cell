1,6282,The layered PrBaCo2O5+delta (PBCO) perovskite oxides were synthesized by modified Pechini method and investigated as a cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on a stable and easily sintered perovskite oxide BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3-delta (BCZYZ) as electrolyte.,Layered PrBaCo2O5+δ perovskite as a cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.01.040
2,6282,The fabricated single cell of NiO-BCZYZ/BCZYZ (similar to 20 mu m)/PBCO was operated from 550 to 700 degrees C with humidified hydrogen (similar to 5% H2O) as fuel and the static air as oxidant.,Layered PrBaCo2O5+δ perovskite as a cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.01.040
3,6282,"The BCZYZ perovskite electrolyte was completely dense after sintered at 1250 degrees C for 5 h, lower than that without zinc dopant about 150 degrees C. A high open-circuit potential of 1.007 V, a peak power density of 361 mW cm(-2), and a low polarization resistance of the electrodes of 0.12 Omega cm(2) was achieved at 700 degrees C.",Layered PrBaCo2O5+δ perovskite as a cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.01.040
4,6282,"The ratio of polarization resistance to total cell resistance decreased with the increase of operating temperature, from 54.2% at 550 degrees C to 17.9% at 700 degrees C, respectively.",Layered PrBaCo2O5+δ perovskite as a cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.01.040
