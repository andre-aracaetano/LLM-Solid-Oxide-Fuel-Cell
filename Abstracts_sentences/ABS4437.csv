1,4437,"This study simulates the heat-up process of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with the cross-flow configuration, and investigates the effect of the non-uniform inlet flow pattern and the non-uniform deviation on the maximum temperature gradient and preheating time.",Effect of non-uniform inlet flow rate on the heat-up process of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with cross-flow configuration,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.260
2,4437,The numerical method is precise and reliable through the comparison with the analytical solution of previous literature.,Effect of non-uniform inlet flow rate on the heat-up process of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with cross-flow configuration,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.260
3,4437,"The results show that the effect of non-uniform inlet flow pattern on the maximum temperature gradient is obvious, and the effect in the fuel side is more obvious than that in the air side.",Effect of non-uniform inlet flow rate on the heat-up process of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with cross-flow configuration,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.260
4,4437,"The best choice of the inlet flow pattern is C, which the fuel side is uniform and the air side is the progressively increasing profile.",Effect of non-uniform inlet flow rate on the heat-up process of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with cross-flow configuration,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.260
5,4437,"Additionally, the effect of non-uniform inlet flow pattern on the preheating time can not be neglected, and this effect becomes larger when the non-uniform deviation increases.",Effect of non-uniform inlet flow rate on the heat-up process of a solid oxide fuel cell unit with cross-flow configuration,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.260
