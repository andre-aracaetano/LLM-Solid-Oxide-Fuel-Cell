3,17454,"The cell consists of NiO-Gd doped ceria (GDC) as an anode (support tube), GDC as an electrolyte, and (La, Sr)(Fe, Co)O-3 (LSCF)-GDC as a cathode.","Improvement of SOFC performance using a microtubular, anode-supported SOFC",10.1149/1.2185284
4,17454,"The single tubular cell with 1.6-mm diam and 1-cm length generated about 140, 300, and 350 mW at 500, 550, and 570 degrees C with H-2 fuel.","Improvement of SOFC performance using a microtubular, anode-supported SOFC",10.1149/1.2185284
5,17454,"This indicates that a cell stack of 5 X 5 cell arrangement whose volume is about 1 cm can possibly generate 3.5, 7.5, and 8.7 W at 500, 550, and 570 degrees C using the microtubular cells.","Improvement of SOFC performance using a microtubular, anode-supported SOFC",10.1149/1.2185284
