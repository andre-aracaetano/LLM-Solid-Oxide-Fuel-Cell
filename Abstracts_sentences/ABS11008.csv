2,11008,Recent work has suggested that materials of the La2NiO4 composition possess sufficient activity to act as an effective cathode.,Novel K2NiF4-Type Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Compatibility with Electrolytes in the Intermediate Temperature Range,10.1002/fuce.200800023
3,11008,Whilst there have been many studies of the transport properties of materials of this family the reactivity with electrolyte compositions has received relatively little attention.,Novel K2NiF4-Type Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Compatibility with Electrolytes in the Intermediate Temperature Range,10.1002/fuce.200800023
4,11008,In this work we have investigated the compatibility of La2NiO4 + d (LNO) with LSGM and ceria gadolinium oxide (CGO) electrolytes.,Novel K2NiF4-Type Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Compatibility with Electrolytes in the Intermediate Temperature Range,10.1002/fuce.200800023
5,11008,It is clear that under an air atmosphere LNO reacts readily with CGO electrodes with the formation of a higher order Ruddlesden-Popper (La-n + 1NinO3n + 1) phase as one of the reaction products.,Novel K2NiF4-Type Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: Compatibility with Electrolytes in the Intermediate Temperature Range,10.1002/fuce.200800023
