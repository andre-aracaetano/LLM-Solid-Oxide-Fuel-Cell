1,3802,The electrochemical performances of solid oxide fuel cells with thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes and YSZ/Ni anodes were studied with two intergrowth oxides cathodes (Sr2.7La0.3Fe1.4Co0.6O7-delta and LaSr3Fe1.5Co1.5O10-delta) and the results compared to a related perovskite cathode (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta).,Perovskite-related intergrowth cathode materials with thin YSZ electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.072
2,3802,"It was found that cells produced with LaSr3Fe1.5Co1.5O10-delta exhibited peak power densities close to 0.75 W cm(-2), despite the relatively modest electrical conductivity of this compound.",Perovskite-related intergrowth cathode materials with thin YSZ electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.072
3,3802,"In contrast, cells produced with Sr2.7La0.3Fe1.4Co0.6O7-delta, and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta cathodes both exhibited peak power densities of less than 0.4 W cm(-1).",Perovskite-related intergrowth cathode materials with thin YSZ electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.072
4,3802,The greater performance for the cells produced with LaSr3Fe1.5Co1.5O10-delta may be attributed to a higher catalytic activity for this compound or to an improved adhesion of the cathode to the interlayer/electrolyte.,Perovskite-related intergrowth cathode materials with thin YSZ electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.02.072
