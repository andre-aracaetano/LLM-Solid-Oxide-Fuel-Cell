1,15237,"Molybdenum(Mo)-doped ceria (CMO) nanoparticles were synthesized by the combustion method with three different Mo compositions: 5 wt.%, 7 wt.%, and 10 wt.%.",Mo-doped CeO2 Synthesized by the Combustion Method for Carbon-Air Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (CA-SOFC) Applications,10.1002/fuce.201800160
2,15237,"The catalytic activity of CMO for wet gasification of carbon was studied in a fluidized bed reactor, while the mechanical and electrical properties of this material were characterized using dense sintered CMO pellets.",Mo-doped CeO2 Synthesized by the Combustion Method for Carbon-Air Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (CA-SOFC) Applications,10.1002/fuce.201800160
3,15237,"The Young's modulus was found to increase with the Mo content; the higher value measured was 289.4 GPa for CMO with 10 wt.% Mo. Measurements of Vickers microhardness demonstrated that an increase in the Mo content produces a decrease in the microhardness of the material, suggesting that Mo confers semi-metallic characteristics to CMO.",Mo-doped CeO2 Synthesized by the Combustion Method for Carbon-Air Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (CA-SOFC) Applications,10.1002/fuce.201800160
4,15237,"The higher fracture toughness value, determined by the Niihara equation, was 4.39 MPa m(0.5) for CMO with 10 wt.% Mo.",Mo-doped CeO2 Synthesized by the Combustion Method for Carbon-Air Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (CA-SOFC) Applications,10.1002/fuce.201800160
