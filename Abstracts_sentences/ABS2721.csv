1,2721,"Fuel cells, and in particular solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), enable high-efficiency conversion of chemical fuels into useful electrical energy and, as such, are expected to play a major role in a sustainable-energy future.",High electrochemical activity of the oxide phase in model ceria-Pt and ceria-Ni composite anodes,10.1038/NMAT3184
2,2721,A key step in the fuel-cell energy-conversion process is the electro-oxidation of the fuel at the anode.,High electrochemical activity of the oxide phase in model ceria-Pt and ceria-Ni composite anodes,10.1038/NMAT3184
3,2721,There has been increasing evidence in recent years that the presence of CeO2-based oxides (ceria) in the anodes of SOFCs with oxygen-ion-conducting electrolytes significantly lowers the activation overpotential for hydrogen oxidation.,High electrochemical activity of the oxide phase in model ceria-Pt and ceria-Ni composite anodes,10.1038/NMAT3184
4,2721,"Most of these studies, however, employ porous, composite electrode structures with ill-defined geometry and uncontrolled interfacial properties.",High electrochemical activity of the oxide phase in model ceria-Pt and ceria-Ni composite anodes,10.1038/NMAT3184
5,2721,"Accordingly, the means by which electrocatalysis is enhanced has remained unclear.",High electrochemical activity of the oxide phase in model ceria-Pt and ceria-Ni composite anodes,10.1038/NMAT3184
6,2721,"Here we demonstrate unambiguously, through the use of ceria-metal structures with well-defined geometries and interfaces, that the near-equilibrium H-2 oxidation reaction pathway is dominated by electrocatalysis at the oxide/gas interface with minimal contributions from the oxide/metal/gas triple-phase boundaries, even for structures with reaction-site densities approaching those of commercial SOFCs.",High electrochemical activity of the oxide phase in model ceria-Pt and ceria-Ni composite anodes,10.1038/NMAT3184
7,2721,"This insight points towards ceria nanostructuring as a route to enhanced activity, rather than the traditional paradigm of metal-catalyst nanostructuring.",High electrochemical activity of the oxide phase in model ceria-Pt and ceria-Ni composite anodes,10.1038/NMAT3184
