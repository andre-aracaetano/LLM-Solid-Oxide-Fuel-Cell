2,8014,"For this purpose, two single cells, one with and the other without Sm0.2Ce0.8O3-delta (SDC) buffer layer between anode and electrolyte, were studied in order to determine and compare the performance and short-term stability of cells under single-chamber conditions.",Performance and short-term stability of single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells based on La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.076
3,8014,The reactivity of the Ni-SDC anode with SDC (for the cell with buffer layer) and the LSGM electrolyte (for the cell without buffer layer) were studied by X-ray diffraction.,Performance and short-term stability of single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells based on La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.076
4,8014,The reaction between Ni and LSGM during anode sintering and cell operation leads to a substantial loss in the cell performance when no buffer layer is present.,Performance and short-term stability of single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells based on La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.076
5,8014,"As a result, maximum power densities of 246 and 132 mW cm(-2) were obtained for the buffered and non-buffered cells respectively, at 800 degrees C, under optimized gas composition (CH4/O-2 = 1.2) and a total flow rate of 400 ml min(-1).",Performance and short-term stability of single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells based on La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ electrolyte,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.076
