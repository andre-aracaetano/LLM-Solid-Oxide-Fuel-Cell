1,10380,Electrolyte supported SOFCs with Ni-YSZ/Ni-GDC bi-layer anodes were operated at 800 degrees C and 900 C with 8% H2O and 10-20 ppm of PH3/syngas to reduce steam-related interference accelerate degradation.,Accelerated anode failure of a high temperature planar SOFC operated with reduced moisture and increased PH3 concentrations in coal syngas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.169
2,10380,"Cell power output degraded rapidly within the first 12 h, with even faster degradation at 900 degrees C.
