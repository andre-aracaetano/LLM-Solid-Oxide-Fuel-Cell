1,14417,Understanding the migration of Ni/NiO in nickel yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) can potentially help to design a better solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode.,Bulk Migration of Ni/NiO in Ni-YSZ during Reducing Conditions,10.1149/1.3298442
2,14417,We observed that an extensive hydrogen reduction and methane steam reforming of Ni-YSZ caused bulk migration of Ni/NiO to at least similar to 5 mu m deeper from the Ni-YSZ surface.,Bulk Migration of Ni/NiO in Ni-YSZ during Reducing Conditions,10.1149/1.3298442
3,14417,No significant bulk migration effects were detected after simple thermal treatments in a nonreducing/nonreforming environment.,Bulk Migration of Ni/NiO in Ni-YSZ during Reducing Conditions,10.1149/1.3298442

5,14417,A three-dimensional electron backscattered diffraction analysis of the thermally treated sample before exposing it to reducing and reforming environments indicated a mixed NiO/YSZ phase with some porosity and random grain orientation.,Bulk Migration of Ni/NiO in Ni-YSZ during Reducing Conditions,10.1149/1.3298442
6,14417,"The surface analysis and mapping were carried out using time of flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy, whereas energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps on focused ion beam sliced areas on Ni-YSZ were utilized for the bulk analysis.",Bulk Migration of Ni/NiO in Ni-YSZ during Reducing Conditions,10.1149/1.3298442
7,14417,The results provide additional information related to complex reactions occurring in SOFCs during internal reforming conditions.,Bulk Migration of Ni/NiO in Ni-YSZ during Reducing Conditions,10.1149/1.3298442
