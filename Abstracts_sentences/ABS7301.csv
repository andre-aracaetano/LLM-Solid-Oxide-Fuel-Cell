3,7301,"A transition from an amorphous to a well-defined and -ordered structure, exhibiting almost single-crystalline ordering of either body-centered cubic Y2O3 or tetragonal ZrO2, both with uniform electronic structure, has been observed upon raising the substrate temperature from 300 to 573 K. Pronounced crystallographic relationships between the face-centered cubic NaCl structure and the structures of the deposited oxides have been held responsible for the observed epitaxial growth.",Thin film model systems of ZrO2 and Y2O3 as templates for potential industrial applications investigated by means of electron microscopy,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2012.11.071
