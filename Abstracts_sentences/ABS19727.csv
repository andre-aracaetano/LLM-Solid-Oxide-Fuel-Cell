1,19727,Zirconia (ZrO2) and alumina (Al2O3) ceramics are used in technical and biomedical applications.,Towards improving low-temperature degradation of zirconia/alumina ceramics via in-situ formation of an Al2O3 functional surface layer through sintering in the presence of graphite powder,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.152840
2,19727,"The great challenge in ZrO2-based ceramics, to improve their mechanical properties, is to take control of the stress-activated t -> m martensitic transformation, since this transformation causes accelerated low-temperature degradation (LTD) under ambient conditions, leading to premature failure by the presence of water or its vapor.",Towards improving low-temperature degradation of zirconia/alumina ceramics via in-situ formation of an Al2O3 functional surface layer through sintering in the presence of graphite powder,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.152840
3,19727,"Dispersion of Al2O3 in a ZrO2 matrix, the so-called alumina toughened zirconia (ATZ), can restrain LTD of mechanical properties of zirconia, however exposure of zirconia to moisture must be avoided to suppress the t -> m transformation.",Towards improving low-temperature degradation of zirconia/alumina ceramics via in-situ formation of an Al2O3 functional surface layer through sintering in the presence of graphite powder,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.152840
4,19727,"In this paper, the in-situ formation of an alumina layer surrounding ATZ pieces, during sintering under the presence of graphitic compounds and a low oxygen atmosphere, is reported.",Towards improving low-temperature degradation of zirconia/alumina ceramics via in-situ formation of an Al2O3 functional surface layer through sintering in the presence of graphite powder,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.152840
5,19727,"The layer formation mechanism consists of the reaction of CO with Al2O3 during the heating of the specimens, where a volatile species of aluminum forms, which, on contact with the specimen surface and due to the presence of CO2, is oxidized to the non-volatile Al2O3, thus forming the surface layer.",Towards improving low-temperature degradation of zirconia/alumina ceramics via in-situ formation of an Al2O3 functional surface layer through sintering in the presence of graphite powder,10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.152840
