3,4733,The treated LCCO powders are investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) to study the chemical stability.,A stable La1.95Ca0.05Ce2O7-δ as the electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.011
4,4733,"According to the XRD results, LCCO is very stable and shows no reactions with CO2 or H2O. A fuel cell with the LCCO electrolyte is prepared using the suspension spray method and is tested in the range from 600 degrees C to 700 degrees C using humidified hydrogen (similar to 3% H2O) as the fuel and static air as the oxidant.",A stable La1.95Ca0.05Ce2O7-δ as the electrolyte for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.011
5,4733,An open-circuit potential of 0.832 V and a maximum power density of 259 mW cm(-2) are obtained for a single cell with an interface resistance of 0.23 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C.
