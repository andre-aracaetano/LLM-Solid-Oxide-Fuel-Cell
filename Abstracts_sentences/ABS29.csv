1,29,The purpose of this paper is to obtain relevant data on materials that are the most commonly used in fuel-cell and hydrogen technologies.,Criticality and Life-Cycle Assessment of Materials Used in Fuel-Cell and Hydrogen Technologies,10.3390/su13063565
2,29,"The focus is on polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells, solid-oxide fuel cells, polymer-electrolyte-membrane water electrolysers and alkaline water electrolysers.",Criticality and Life-Cycle Assessment of Materials Used in Fuel-Cell and Hydrogen Technologies,10.3390/su13063565
3,29,"An innovative, methodological approach was developed for a preliminary material assessment of the four technologies.",Criticality and Life-Cycle Assessment of Materials Used in Fuel-Cell and Hydrogen Technologies,10.3390/su13063565
4,29,This methodological approach leads to a more rapid identification of the most influential or critical materials that substantially increase the environmental impact of fuel-cell and hydrogen technologies.,Criticality and Life-Cycle Assessment of Materials Used in Fuel-Cell and Hydrogen Technologies,10.3390/su13063565
5,29,The approach also assisted in amassing the life-cycle inventories-the emphasis here is on the solid-oxide fuel-cell technology because it is still in its early development stage and thus has a deficient materials' database-that were used in a life-cycle assessment for an in-depth material-criticality analysis.,Criticality and Life-Cycle Assessment of Materials Used in Fuel-Cell and Hydrogen Technologies,10.3390/su13063565
6,29,"All the listed materials-that either are or could potentially be used in these technologies-were analysed to give important information for the fuel-cell and hydrogen industries, the recycling industry, the hydrogen economy, as well as policymakers.",Criticality and Life-Cycle Assessment of Materials Used in Fuel-Cell and Hydrogen Technologies,10.3390/su13063565
7,29,"The main conclusion from the life-cycle assessment is that the polymer-electrolyte-membrane water electrolysers have the highest environmental impacts; lower impacts are seen in polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells and solid-oxide fuel cells, while the lowest impacts are observed in alkaline water electrolysers.",Criticality and Life-Cycle Assessment of Materials Used in Fuel-Cell and Hydrogen Technologies,10.3390/su13063565
8,29,"The results of the material assessment are presented together for all the considered materials, but also separately for each observed technology.",Criticality and Life-Cycle Assessment of Materials Used in Fuel-Cell and Hydrogen Technologies,10.3390/su13063565
