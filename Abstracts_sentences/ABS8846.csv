3,8846,A heat treatment of 100 h or 1000 h at 800 degrees C is applied for studying the thermal aging effect.,Interfacial fracture resistance of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.079
4,8846,Results show the variation trend of interfacial fracture energy with temperature is similar for all given material conditions.,Interfacial fracture resistance of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.079
5,8846,Interfacial fracture energy increases with temperature to reach a peak value at 700 degrees C and then drops at temperature above 700 degrees,Interfacial fracture resistance of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.079
6,8846,"C. A 100-h aging treatment does not change the interfacial fracture energy significantly, compared to the non-aged condition.",Interfacial fracture resistance of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.079
7,8846,"The 1000 h-aged joint, however, has greater interfacial fracture energy than the non-aged and 100 h-aged joints at 700 degrees C-800 degrees C. Two types of cracking path in the interior of fracture surface are identified.",Interfacial fracture resistance of the joint of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.079
