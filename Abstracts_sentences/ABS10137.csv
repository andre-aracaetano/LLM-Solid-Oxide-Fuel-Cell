1,10137,The Radio Frequency (RF) sputtering process is used to deposit the Ni2MnGa Heusler alloy on the Ni-based Sm-doped CeO2 (Ni-SDC) anode surface.,Enhancing the performance of ammonia-fed intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) through the application of Ni2MnGa Heusler alloy on the anode surface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234252
2,10137,"The peak power density (PPD) of the pristine Ni-SDC cell after 1 h NH3 feeding at 650 degrees C is 468.21 mW/cm(2), whereas with increasing time the PPD value continuously decreases and becomes 460.80 mW/cm(2) after 9 h. This decline in fuel cell performance is linked to Ni agglomeration and the formation of Ni3N on the anode surface.",Enhancing the performance of ammonia-fed intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) through the application of Ni2MnGa Heusler alloy on the anode surface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234252
3,10137,"For 15 min alloy deposited cell, the PPD values increase with time and become 490.18 mW/cm(2) after 9 h on the same reaction conditions, which is quite high compared to that of pristine Ni-SDC.",Enhancing the performance of ammonia-fed intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) through the application of Ni2MnGa Heusler alloy on the anode surface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234252
4,10137,"This improvement is attributed to the alloy's effectiveness in preventing Ni agglomeration and Ni3N formation, alongside accelerating the decomposition of NH3.",Enhancing the performance of ammonia-fed intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) through the application of Ni2MnGa Heusler alloy on the anode surface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234252
5,10137,"However, Ni-SDC cells with longer alloy deposition times of 30 and 60 min showed lower PPD values compared to the pristine and 15-min deposited cells, indicating that extended deposition acts as a shield and reduces the active reaction surface area.",Enhancing the performance of ammonia-fed intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) through the application of Ni2MnGa Heusler alloy on the anode surface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234252
6,10137,"Hence, a 15-min deposition of Ni2MnGa alloy shows the potential to improve fuel cell performance and preserve the stability of Ni-SDC at an intermediate temperature.",Enhancing the performance of ammonia-fed intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) through the application of Ni2MnGa Heusler alloy on the anode surface,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234252
