2,20175,"For distillates utilizing 20 wt% of the diesel fuel, 88 mol% of the carbon is converted into CO and 75 mol% of the hydrogen into H-2.",Dry catalytic partial oxidation of diesel-fuel distillates into syngas,10.1016/j.fuel.2009.09.031
3,20175,"Rationale is as follows: Long-chain n-alkanes such as n-hexadecane, with normal boiling point, 286.5 degrees C, but autoignition temperature, 205 degrees C, are the least thermally stable hydrocarbons in diesel fuel.",Dry catalytic partial oxidation of diesel-fuel distillates into syngas,10.1016/j.fuel.2009.09.031
4,20175,"If attempts are made to vaporize diesel fuel under oxygen-lean conditions without precautions, long-chain n-alkanes crack at autoignition temperatures forming radicals that initiate polymerization.",Dry catalytic partial oxidation of diesel-fuel distillates into syngas,10.1016/j.fuel.2009.09.031
