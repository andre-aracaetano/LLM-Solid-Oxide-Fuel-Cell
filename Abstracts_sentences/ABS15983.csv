1,15983,A combined phase inversion and sintering technique was used to fabricate highly asymmetric yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) hollow fibers with a 1.9 mm external diameter and 210 mu m total wall thickness.,Microstructure and Performance Investigation of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Highly Asymmetric YSZ Microtubular Electrolytes,10.1021/ie1002558
2,15983,"These consisted of a thin (similar to 10 mu m), dense outer layer and a much thicker (similar to 200 mu m) inner layer with finger-like voids.",Microstructure and Performance Investigation of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Highly Asymmetric YSZ Microtubular Electrolytes,10.1021/ie1002558
3,15983,Such highly asymmetric structures formed gas-tight electrolytes and mechanical supports of a microtubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Microstructure and Performance Investigation of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Highly Asymmetric YSZ Microtubular Electrolytes,10.1021/ie1002558
4,15983,"Nickel oxide yttria-stabilized zirconia (NiO-YSZ) particles were infused into the pores from alcoholic dispersions and then sintered at 1300 degrees C, prior to electroless Ni layers being deposited, forming composite anodes.",Microstructure and Performance Investigation of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Highly Asymmetric YSZ Microtubular Electrolytes,10.1021/ie1002558
5,15983,The Ni layer deposited by electroless plating had the function of improving the anodic current collection.,Microstructure and Performance Investigation of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Highly Asymmetric YSZ Microtubular Electrolytes,10.1021/ie1002558
6,15983,"Cathodes were deposited by slurry-coating lanthanum strontium manganite particles onto the outer surfaces of YSZ hollow fibers, followed by sintering at 1000 degrees C and reduction of the anode at 800 degrees C in a hydrogen environment, completing the fabrication of the microtubular SOFCs.",Microstructure and Performance Investigation of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Highly Asymmetric YSZ Microtubular Electrolytes,10.1021/ie1002558
7,15983,Mechanical strengths of similar to 226 MPa were derived from three-point bending tests on hollow fibers sintered at 1450 degrees C. Initial SOFC performance measurements with 5% H-2 as the fuel and air as the oxidant resulted in maximum power densities of 18 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C.,Microstructure and Performance Investigation of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Highly Asymmetric YSZ Microtubular Electrolytes,10.1021/ie1002558
8,15983,This low value resulted largely from the discontinuous nature of the electrolessly deposited nickel anode; present work aims to improve its structure and hence SOFC performance.,Microstructure and Performance Investigation of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Based on Highly Asymmetric YSZ Microtubular Electrolytes,10.1021/ie1002558
