1,7826,The effects of anode support tape length on the manufacturability and level of surface patterning in bolt-microtubular anode supports (BMASs) for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are investigated in this study.,Manufacturability of bolt-microtubular anode supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233971
2,7826,Continuous anode support tapes of similar to 5-25 cm are wrapped on a threaded rod for this purpose and five-layered boltmicrotubular cells (BMCs) are manufactured on these supports.,Manufacturability of bolt-microtubular anode supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233971
3,7826,"Similarly, microtubular anode supports (MASs) by using a pin and corresponding microtubular cells (MCs) are also fabricated and examined for comparison.",Manufacturability of bolt-microtubular anode supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233971
4,7826,The tape lengths <= 9.9 cm yield mechanically unstable BMASs or BMSs due to fractures that occur during sintering in the anode supports or during testing in the cells.,Manufacturability of bolt-microtubular anode supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233971
5,7826,The electrochemical performance tests show that all BMCs exhibit relatively higher performances compared to those of MCs for a certain tape length.,Manufacturability of bolt-microtubular anode supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233971
6,7826,"The highest maximum power density of 0.479 Wcm(-2) at 800 degrees C operating temperature is obtained from BMC prepared with 12 cm long anode support tape, whereas that of MC fabricated with the same anode support length is measured as 0.313 Wcm(-2) under the same testing conditions.",Manufacturability of bolt-microtubular anode supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233971
7,7826,The impedance measurements reveal that the improvement in the cell performances is due to reduced electrode polarization resistance achieved by the bolt-like microtube design.,Manufacturability of bolt-microtubular anode supports for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233971
