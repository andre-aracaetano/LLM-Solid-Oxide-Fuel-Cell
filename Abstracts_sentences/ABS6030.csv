1,6030,"We present single-step-co-sintering manufacture of a planar single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) with porous multilayer structures consisting of NiO/CGO, CGO and CGO-LSCF as anode, electrolyte, and cathode, respectively.",Single-step fabrication of an anode supported planar single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/ijac.13012
2,6030,"Their green tapes were casted with 20 m thickness and stacked into layers of anode, electrolyte, and cathode (10:2:2), then hot-pressed at 2 MPa and 60 degrees C for 5 minutes (deemed optimal).",Single-step fabrication of an anode supported planar single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/ijac.13012
3,6030,"Subsequently, hot laminated layers were cut into 40 x 40 mm cells and co-sintered up to 1200 degrees C via different sintering profiles.",Single-step fabrication of an anode supported planar single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/ijac.13012
4,6030,"Shrinkage behavior and curvature developments of cells were characterized, determining the best sintering profile.",Single-step fabrication of an anode supported planar single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/ijac.13012
5,6030,"Hence, anode-supported SC-SOFCs were fabricated via a single-step co-sintering process, albeit with curvature formation at edges.",Single-step fabrication of an anode supported planar single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/ijac.13012
6,6030,"Subsequently, anode thickness was increased to 800 m and electrolyte reduced to 20 m to obtain SOFCs with drastically reduced curvature with the help of a porous alumina cover plate.",Single-step fabrication of an anode supported planar single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell,10.1111/ijac.13012
