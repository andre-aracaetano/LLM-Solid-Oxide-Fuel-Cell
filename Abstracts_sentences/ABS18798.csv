6,18798,"Associated implications on the expected performance of nickel coated AISI 441 as interconnects for solid oxide cell stacks are postulated: Although no corrosion or scale spallation is observed and a good contact to the simulated oxygen electrode is maintained, there are signs of limited oxidation resistance and scale adhesion, which potentially affect lifetime and robustness of solid oxide cell stacks during (cyclic) oxidation of longer exposure than tested here.",Effects of interdiffusion in nickel coated AISI 441 steel,10.1016/j.matchar.2022.112413
