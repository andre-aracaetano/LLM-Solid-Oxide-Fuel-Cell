1,12886,Municipal Solid Waste in general and its organic fraction in particular is a potential renewable and non-seasonal resource.,Distributed generation by energy from waste technology: A life cycle perspective,10.1016/j.psep.2014.03.008
2,12886,"In this work, a life cycle assessment has been performed to evaluate the environmental impacts of two future scenarios using biogas produced from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) to supply energy to a group of dwellings, respectively comprising distributed generation using solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) micro-CHP systems and condensing boilers.",Distributed generation by energy from waste technology: A life cycle perspective,10.1016/j.psep.2014.03.008
3,12886,The London Borough of Greenwich is taken as the reference case study.,Distributed generation by energy from waste technology: A life cycle perspective,10.1016/j.psep.2014.03.008
4,12886,The system is designed to assess how much energy demand can be met and what is the best way to use the digestible waste for distributed energy purposes.,Distributed generation by energy from waste technology: A life cycle perspective,10.1016/j.psep.2014.03.008
5,12886,"The system is compared with two alternative scenarios fuelled by natural gas: a reference scenario, where the electricity is supplied by the grid and the heat is supplied from condensing boilers, and a fuel cell micro-CHP system.",Distributed generation by energy from waste technology: A life cycle perspective,10.1016/j.psep.2014.03.008
6,12886,"The results show that, although OFMSW alone can only supply between 1% and 4% of the total energy demand of the Borough, a saving of similar to 130 tonnes of CO2 eq per year per dwelling equipped with micro-CHP is still achievable compared with the reference scenario.",Distributed generation by energy from waste technology: A life cycle perspective,10.1016/j.psep.2014.03.008
7,12886,This is primarily due to the surplus electricity produced by the fuel cell when the micro-CHP unit is operated to meet the heat demand.,Distributed generation by energy from waste technology: A life cycle perspective,10.1016/j.psep.2014.03.008
8,12886,Use of biogas to produce heat only is therefore a less desirable option compared with combined heat and power production.,Distributed generation by energy from waste technology: A life cycle perspective,10.1016/j.psep.2014.03.008
9,12886,Further investigation is required to identify locally available feedstock other than OFMSW in order to increase the proportion of energy demand that can be met in this way.,Distributed generation by energy from waste technology: A life cycle perspective,10.1016/j.psep.2014.03.008
