8,12895,"Application of SOFC technology for flare gas recovery of Asalouyeh gas processing plant not only generates about 1200 MW electrical energy, but also it decreases the equivalent mass of greenhouse gas emission from 1700 kg/s to 68 kg/s. Economical evaluations show that the total capital investment of this method is significantly lower than other no gas flaring approaches.","Application of solid oxide fuel cell for flare gas recovery as a new approach; a case study for Asalouyeh gas processing plant, Iran",10.1016/j.jngse.2013.12.005
9,12895,"For parametric investigation, the effects of some related parameters such as temperature, recirculation, fuel utilization and air ratios are studied.","Application of solid oxide fuel cell for flare gas recovery as a new approach; a case study for Asalouyeh gas processing plant, Iran",10.1016/j.jngse.2013.12.005
10,12895,The results show that increasing the operating temperature of SOFC enhances the cell voltage and maximum power density.,"Application of solid oxide fuel cell for flare gas recovery as a new approach; a case study for Asalouyeh gas processing plant, Iran",10.1016/j.jngse.2013.12.005
11,12895,Decreasing the recirculation ratio from 0.6 to 0.2 increases the electrical efficiency of the cell.,"Application of solid oxide fuel cell for flare gas recovery as a new approach; a case study for Asalouyeh gas processing plant, Iran",10.1016/j.jngse.2013.12.005
12,12895,"Although at lower current densities, changing the recirculation ratio has no significant effect, it is observed that at average current density equals to 1.5 A/cm(2), increasing the recirculation ratio from 0.2 to 0.6 decreases the power density from 0.51 W/cm(2) to 0.48 W/cm(2).","Application of solid oxide fuel cell for flare gas recovery as a new approach; a case study for Asalouyeh gas processing plant, Iran",10.1016/j.jngse.2013.12.005
