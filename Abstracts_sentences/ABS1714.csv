1,1714,"A novel, simple, and cost-effective method allows material engineering for the creation of a 2D/3D matrix of cross-linked channels through whole solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrode materials.",Cost-Effective Microstructural Engineering of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Components for Planar and Tubular Designs,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02857.x
2,1714,"The size of the channels can be precisely tailored from a few micrometers up to 75-90 mu m and remains stable up to 1500 degrees C. Because of the versatility of the method proposed, it can be applied to practically any type of material commonly used in SOFC technology or in other fields.",Cost-Effective Microstructural Engineering of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Components for Planar and Tubular Designs,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02857.x
