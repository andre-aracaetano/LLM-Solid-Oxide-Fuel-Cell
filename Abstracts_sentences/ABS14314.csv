1,14314,"The study describes CuxMn1.25-0.5xCo1.75-0.5xO4 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5) spinels synthesized using EDTA gel processes in order to optimize the performance of high-quality spinel protective-conducting films deposited on steel interconnects.",Structure and electrical properties of Cu-doped Mn-Co-O spinel prepared via soft chemistry and its application in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.136
2,14314,The powders obtained after 12 h of calcination in air at 1073 K are solely cubic spinels.,Structure and electrical properties of Cu-doped Mn-Co-O spinel prepared via soft chemistry and its application in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.136
3,14314,"Sintering these spinels for 12 h in air at 1423 K also leads to the formation of small amounts of CoO, Mn2O3 or CuO; the type of phase depends on the quantity of copper introduced into the manganese-cobalt lattice.",Structure and electrical properties of Cu-doped Mn-Co-O spinel prepared via soft chemistry and its application in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.136
4,14314,"The highest electrical conductivity at 1073 K is observed for Cu0.3Mn1.1Co1.6O4 (162 S.cm(-1)), which is closely correlated with the lowest activation energy of conduction over the entire temperature range (373 <= T <= 1073 K); the lowest conductivity is measured for Mn1.25Co1.75O4 (84 S.cm(-1)).",Structure and electrical properties of Cu-doped Mn-Co-O spinel prepared via soft chemistry and its application in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.136
5,14314,The study confirms the suitability of the Cu0.3Mn1.1Co1.6O4 spinel as a potential material for the preparation of protective-conducting coatings on the surface of the DIN 50049 ferritic steel applied in IT-SOFC interconnects.,Structure and electrical properties of Cu-doped Mn-Co-O spinel prepared via soft chemistry and its application in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.136
6,14314,"The area-specific resistance of coated steel is 0.08 Omega.cm(2), which is lower than that of bare steel after 300 h of oxidation at 1073 K. Cr vaporization tests show that the Cu0.3Mn1.1Co1.6O4 coating is efficient at blocking the outward diffusion of chromium.",Structure and electrical properties of Cu-doped Mn-Co-O spinel prepared via soft chemistry and its application in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell interconnects,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.136
