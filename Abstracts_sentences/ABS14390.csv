1,14390,The relationship between the electrochemical performance of an anode in a solid oxide fuel cell and the distribution of yttrium-doped barium zirconate (BZY) in the electrochemically active zone of nickel (Ni)/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anodes was investigated to clarify the promoting effect of BZY on electrochemical reaction.,Electrochemical Behaviors of Nickel/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anodes with Distribution Controlled Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate by Ink-jet Technique,10.1149/2.068207jes
2,14390,"After BZY was injected into Ni/YSZ anodes using an ink-jet technique for control of the distribution of BZY, the anode performance improved in both humidified H-2 and dry CH4 fuels.",Electrochemical Behaviors of Nickel/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anodes with Distribution Controlled Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate by Ink-jet Technique,10.1149/2.068207jes
3,14390,The performance of the BZY-infiltrated Ni/YSZ anodes depended on the distribution of BZY; an increasing gradient of BZY from the electrolyte side to the anode surface side was particularly effective in improving the performance.,Electrochemical Behaviors of Nickel/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anodes with Distribution Controlled Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate by Ink-jet Technique,10.1149/2.068207jes
4,14390,These results suggest that the optimum amount of infiltrated BZY to enhance the electrochemical reaction depended on the distribution of the oxygen chemical potential in the Ni/YSZ anodes.,Electrochemical Behaviors of Nickel/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anodes with Distribution Controlled Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate by Ink-jet Technique,10.1149/2.068207jes
5,14390,"According to the competitive adsorption equilibrium of reactants and the Langmuir-type reaction on the surface of Ni at the triple-phase boundary, the oxygen coverage was a critical factor in the electrochemical reaction and depended on the oxygen chemical potential.",Electrochemical Behaviors of Nickel/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anodes with Distribution Controlled Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate by Ink-jet Technique,10.1149/2.068207jes
6,14390,"In conclusion, the enhanced electrochemical reaction in the BZY-infiltrated Ni/YSZ anodes was therefore due to the increased oxygen coverage.",Electrochemical Behaviors of Nickel/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Anodes with Distribution Controlled Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate by Ink-jet Technique,10.1149/2.068207jes
