1,11676,"La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (LSCF-GDC) composite oxygen electrodes have been widely used in intermediate temperature (<700 degrees C) solid oxide cells, with composite usually providing better electrochemical performance than single-phase LSCF.",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Surface Modification of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.12-δ Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abca6f

3,11676,Here we present an impedance spectroscopy study comparing the degradation behaviors of LSCF-GDC and Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) infiltrated LSCF-GDC electrodes.,Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Surface Modification of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.12-δ Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abca6f
4,11676,The LSCF-GDC polarization resistance increases by similar to 5 times over similar to 1000 h at 650 degrees C.,Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Surface Modification of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.12-δ Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abca6f
5,11676,"In contrast, the SSC-infiltrated electrode shows similar initial polarization resistance but much more stable performance.",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Surface Modification of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.12-δ Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abca6f
6,11676,The impedance modeling results show that the improved stability is associated with the low frequency oxygen dissociative adsorption/desorption process.,Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Surface Modification of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.12-δ Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abca6f
7,11676,"The results suggest that this adsorption/desorption process slows due to increased Sr segregation on LSCF over time, and that SSC does not degrade significantly due to Sr surface segregation.",Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ Surface Modification of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.12-δ Composite Oxygen Electrodes for Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells,10.1149/1945-7111/abca6f
