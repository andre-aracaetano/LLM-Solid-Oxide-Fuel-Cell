1,13641,Thin films of yttria-doped ceria (YDC) electrolyte were processed for the first time by atomic layer deposition (ALD) for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications.,"Synthesis of a Thin-Layered Ionic Conductor, CeO2-Y2O3, by Atomic Layer Deposition in View of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications",10.1021/cm9016968
2,13641,"The beta-diketonate complexes Y(thd)(3) and Cc(thd)(4) were used as yttrium and cerium precursors, respectively, whereas ozone was used as the oxygen source.","Synthesis of a Thin-Layered Ionic Conductor, CeO2-Y2O3, by Atomic Layer Deposition in View of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications",10.1021/cm9016968
3,13641,"Four-hundred-nanometer thick YDC films were deposited at 300 degrees C on soda lime, Si(100), stainless steel (430), La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSF) cathodes, and on Ni-YSZ anodes.","Synthesis of a Thin-Layered Ionic Conductor, CeO2-Y2O3, by Atomic Layer Deposition in View of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications",10.1021/cm9016968
4,13641,"Thickness, crystallinity, and morphology of YDC films were determined by UV-vis spectroscopy, XRD, and SEM/EDX, respectively.","Synthesis of a Thin-Layered Ionic Conductor, CeO2-Y2O3, by Atomic Layer Deposition in View of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications",10.1021/cm9016968
5,13641,Electrical properties of the thin films in the range of 250-475 degrees C were characterized by impedance spectroscopy.,"Synthesis of a Thin-Layered Ionic Conductor, CeO2-Y2O3, by Atomic Layer Deposition in View of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications",10.1021/cm9016968
6,13641,"The deposited layers were crystalline as deposited, Without any need for annealing.","Synthesis of a Thin-Layered Ionic Conductor, CeO2-Y2O3, by Atomic Layer Deposition in View of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications",10.1021/cm9016968
7,13641,"SEM observations showed that the Films were homogeneous and well-covering, Their conductivities were significantly lower than those reported in the literature for bulk YDC.","Synthesis of a Thin-Layered Ionic Conductor, CeO2-Y2O3, by Atomic Layer Deposition in View of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications",10.1021/cm9016968
8,13641,"Nevertheless, electrical properties of YDC thin films seem to be superior to those of the YSZ thin films, characterized under the same conditions, in the temperature range of 500-750 degrees C. Thus, YDC by ALD represents a new and promising SOFC generation.","Synthesis of a Thin-Layered Ionic Conductor, CeO2-Y2O3, by Atomic Layer Deposition in View of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications",10.1021/cm9016968
