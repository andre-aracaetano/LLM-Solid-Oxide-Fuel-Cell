1,5061,A model for Cr poisoning of the cathode functional layer (FL) in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is developed.,A Model for Cr Poisoning of SOFC Cathode,10.1149/1.3526321
2,5061,The model includes the FL performance equations and the rate equation for electrochemical deposition of the volatile Cr hydroxide.,A Model for Cr Poisoning of SOFC Cathode,10.1149/1.3526321
3,5061,"A solution to this system shows that in the FL the wave of chromium poisoning forms, which runs from the electrolyte surface to the current collector.",A Model for Cr Poisoning of SOFC Cathode,10.1149/1.3526321
4,5061,"At small cell currents, the wave propagation results in a slow linear growth of the activation polarization voltage with time.",A Model for Cr Poisoning of SOFC Cathode,10.1149/1.3526321
5,5061,"At large currents, the activation polarization rapidly increases with time and then stays at a nearly constant level corresponding to completely poisoned FL.",A Model for Cr Poisoning of SOFC Cathode,10.1149/1.3526321
6,5061,These results are consistent with recent experiments.,A Model for Cr Poisoning of SOFC Cathode,10.1149/1.3526321
