2,20751,The introduction of 10%v/v H2S into the fuel stream resulted in anodes that initially showed significant signs of degradation.,Improved performance of Ni- and Co-YSZ anodes via sulfidation to NiS- and CoS-YSZ. Effects of temperature on electrokinetic parameters,10.1021/jp073525n
3,20751,"However, when all of the metal was changed to metal-sulfide, the performance was enhanced under most tested conditions, suggesting that metal-sulfides are viable anode materials for SOFC systems.",Improved performance of Ni- and Co-YSZ anodes via sulfidation to NiS- and CoS-YSZ.

6,20751,"For three of the four anodes tested, the Lefat slope decreased with increasing T but not with the required slope of alpha F/R.",Improved performance of Ni- and Co-YSZ anodes via sulfidation to NiS- and CoS-YSZ. Effects of temperature on electrokinetic parameters,10.1021/jp073525n
7,20751,"The relationship was better represented by alpha F/R + K. The charge-transfer coefficient was determined to be 1.5 for Ni-, Co- and NiS-YSZ anodes, suggesting that the rate-determining step of hydrogen oxidation on these anodes is the electron transfer between H-ad and O2-.",Improved performance of Ni- and Co-YSZ anodes via sulfidation to NiS- and CoS-YSZ.

8,20751,The CoS-YSZ exhibited traditional Tafel behavior such that alpha remained constant over a wide temperature range but yielded a charge-transfer coefficient much less than that of the other anodes (alpha = 0.21 +/- 0.04).,Improved performance of Ni- and Co-YSZ anodes via sulfidation to NiS- and CoS-YSZ.
