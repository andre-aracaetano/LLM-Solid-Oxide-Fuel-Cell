1,2255,"Commercially available Phlogopite mica papers of varying thickness, similar to0.1, similar to0.2, and similar to0.5 mm, were evaluated as potential solid oxide fuel cell (SPFC) seal materials.",Phlogopite mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells: effect of mica thickness,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00805-X
2,2255,The micas were tested in two forms: plain and hybrid.,Phlogopite mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells: effect of mica thickness,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00805-X
3,2255,The hybrid form involved the addition of glass interlayers between the mica and the adjacent components.,Phlogopite mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells: effect of mica thickness,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00805-X
4,2255,"For each sample, about 30 thermal cycles were conducted and the 800degreesC leak rates were determined.",Phlogopite mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells: effect of mica thickness,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00805-X
5,2255,The results showed an excellent thermal cycle stability of the Phlogopite micas in the hybrid design in that the leak rates remained almost constant after similar to10 cycles.,Phlogopite mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells: effect of mica thickness,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00805-X
6,2255,"In addition, the leak rate appeared to increase with increasing mica thickness in the hybrid design, but showed no thickness dependence for mica in the plain design.",Phlogopite mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells: effect of mica thickness,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00805-X
7,2255,The Phlogopite micas also showed good mid-term (similar to500h) stability in both air and reducing environments.,Phlogopite mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells: effect of mica thickness,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00805-X
8,2255,Microstructure characterization showed no distinct degradation such as fragmentation and particle formation after thermal cycle and the mid-term stability tests.,Phlogopite mica-based compressive seals for solid oxide fuel cells: effect of mica thickness,10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00805-X
