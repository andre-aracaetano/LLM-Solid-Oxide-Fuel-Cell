1,19372,In the present study the behavior of the ferritic interconnect steel Crofer 22 APU and the nickel contacting material during exposure in anode gas of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack was investigated.,"Behavior of Metallic Components During 4,000 h Operation of an SOFC Stack with Carbon Containing Fuel Gas",10.1002/fuce.201600085
2,19372,"The stack had been operating for 4,000 h and was ten times subjected to thermal cycling within this time period.","Behavior of Metallic Components During 4,000 h Operation of an SOFC Stack with Carbon Containing Fuel Gas",10.1002/fuce.201600085
3,19372,A temporary high carbon activity in the fuel gas combined with temperature changes resulted in local disintegration of the nickel mesh.,"Behavior of Metallic Components During 4,000 h Operation of an SOFC Stack with Carbon Containing Fuel Gas",10.1002/fuce.201600085
4,19372,"Additionally, nickel diffusion from the nickel mesh into the steel resulted in the formation of an austenitic zone.","Behavior of Metallic Components During 4,000 h Operation of an SOFC Stack with Carbon Containing Fuel Gas",10.1002/fuce.201600085
5,19372,"Diffusion of steel constituents into the nickel mesh lead to the formation of Cr, Mn-oxides in the latter.","Behavior of Metallic Components During 4,000 h Operation of an SOFC Stack with Carbon Containing Fuel Gas",10.1002/fuce.201600085
6,19372,"Presence of the nickel/steel contact allows transport of carbon from the gas into the steel, resulting in local internal carburization of the steel.","Behavior of Metallic Components During 4,000 h Operation of an SOFC Stack with Carbon Containing Fuel Gas",10.1002/fuce.201600085
7,19372,"In areas which were not in direct contact with the nickel mesh, the Crofer 22 APU interconnect formed a protective surface oxide scale and no indications for carbon uptake were found.","Behavior of Metallic Components During 4,000 h Operation of an SOFC Stack with Carbon Containing Fuel Gas",10.1002/fuce.201600085
8,19372,"Mechanisms for the experimentally observed effects, including the local disintegration of the nickel mesh, are presented.","Behavior of Metallic Components During 4,000 h Operation of an SOFC Stack with Carbon Containing Fuel Gas",10.1002/fuce.201600085
