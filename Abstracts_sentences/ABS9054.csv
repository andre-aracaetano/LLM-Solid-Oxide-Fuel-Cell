1,9054,A high performance small-scale solid oxide fuel cell supported by a microtubular cathode was successfully developed via the extrusion of a (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.97)MnO3 cathode support and subsequent surface coating with a (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.97)MnO3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 activation layer followed by Sc2O3-doped ZrO2 electrolyte and NiO-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 anode slurries.,Fabrication and characterization of high performance cathode supported small-scale SOFC for intermediate temperature operation,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.07.013
2,9054,"The cell was electrochemically evaluated in a humidified hydrogen (3% H2O) atmosphere, and exhibited a stable open circuit voltage above 1.05 V in the temperature range from 550 to 750 degrees C. Maximum power densities of 46.5, 163.2 and 452.8 mW cm(-2) were generated at 550, 650 and 750 degrees C, respectively.",Fabrication and characterization of high performance cathode supported small-scale SOFC for intermediate temperature operation,10.1016/j.elecom.2008.07.013
