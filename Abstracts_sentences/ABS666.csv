1,666,Recent progress in the performance of intermediate temperature (500-600 degrees C) protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) has demonstrated both fuel flexibility and increasing power density that approach commercial application requirements.,"Benchmarking the expected stack manufacturing cost of next generation, intermediate-temperature protonic ceramic fuel cells with solid oxide fuel cell technology",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.024
2,666,These developments may eventually position the technology as a viable alternative to solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs).,"Benchmarking the expected stack manufacturing cost of next generation, intermediate-temperature protonic ceramic fuel cells with solid oxide fuel cell technology",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.024
3,666,"The PCFCs investigated in this work are based on a BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BZY20) thin electrolyte supported by BZY20/Ni porous anodes, and a triple conducting cathode material comprised of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-delta (BCFZY0.1).","Benchmarking the expected stack manufacturing cost of next generation, intermediate-temperature protonic ceramic fuel cells with solid oxide fuel cell technology",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.024
4,666,"These cells are prepared using a low-cost solid-state reactive sintering (SSRS) process, and are capable of power densities of 0.156 W cm(-2) at 500 degrees C operating directly from methane fuel.","Benchmarking the expected stack manufacturing cost of next generation, intermediate-temperature protonic ceramic fuel cells with solid oxide fuel cell technology",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.024
5,666,We develop a manufacturing cost model to estimate the Nth generation production costs of PCFC stack technology using high volume manufacturing processes and compare them to the state-of-the-art in SOFC technology.,"Benchmarking the expected stack manufacturing cost of next generation, intermediate-temperature protonic ceramic fuel cells with solid oxide fuel cell technology",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.024
6,666,The low-cost cell manufacturing enabled by the SSRS technique compensates for the lower PCFC power density and the trade-off between operating temperature and efficiency enables the use of lower-cost stainless steel materials.,"Benchmarking the expected stack manufacturing cost of next generation, intermediate-temperature protonic ceramic fuel cells with solid oxide fuel cell technology",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.09.024
7,666,PCFC stack production cost estimates are found to be as much as 27-37% lower at 550 degrees C than SOFCs operating at 800 degrees C.
