1,19391,Long term oxidation tests were carried out with a high-Cr ferritic steel at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C in simulated cathode and anode gas of a solid oxide fuel cell (air and an Ar/H-2/H2O mixture respectively).,Effect of component thickness on lifetime and oxidation rate of chromia forming ferritic steels in low and high pO2 environments,10.1179/mht.2005.029
2,19391,It was found that with decreasing sample thickness the life time of the steel decreases due to breakaway phenomena.,Effect of component thickness on lifetime and oxidation rate of chromia forming ferritic steels in low and high pO2 environments,10.1179/mht.2005.029
3,19391,This effect is caused by faster exhaustion of the chromium reservoir from the bulk alloy in the case of thinner components.,Effect of component thickness on lifetime and oxidation rate of chromia forming ferritic steels in low and high pO2 environments,10.1179/mht.2005.029
4,19391,During air exposure the oxidation rates increase with decreasing specimen thickness and this has to be taken into account in the calculation of the Cr-reservoir exhaustion.,Effect of component thickness on lifetime and oxidation rate of chromia forming ferritic steels in low and high pO2 environments,10.1179/mht.2005.029
5,19391,This thickness dependence is not found during the exposures in simulated anode gas.,Effect of component thickness on lifetime and oxidation rate of chromia forming ferritic steels in low and high pO2 environments,10.1179/mht.2005.029
6,19391,"Hence, especially for thin walled components, the oxidation rates in anode gas are substantially smaller and thus the life times are longer than during air exposure.",Effect of component thickness on lifetime and oxidation rate of chromia forming ferritic steels in low and high pO2 environments,10.1179/mht.2005.029
7,19391,The differences in oxidation behaviour in the two environments are discussed on the basis of scale formation mechanisms involving microcrack formation in the surface oxide scale and depletion of major and minor alloying additions in the bulk alloy.,Effect of component thickness on lifetime and oxidation rate of chromia forming ferritic steels in low and high pO2 environments,10.1179/mht.2005.029
