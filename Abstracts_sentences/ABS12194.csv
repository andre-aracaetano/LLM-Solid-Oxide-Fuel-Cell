1,12194,Multilayered electrolytes for microtubular solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been prepared and their electrochemical properties investigated.,Fabrication and characterization of microtubular SOFCs with multilayered electrolyte,10.1149/1.2895008
2,12194,Sc(2)O(3)-stabilized ZrO(2) (ScSZ) and Gd(2)O(3)-doped CeO(2) (GDC) were selected for the electrolyte materials; the multilayered electrolyte of GDC-ScSZ-GDC was successfully prepared on an anode tube (1.8 mm diameter) using multiple dip coating and a cofiring technique.,Fabrication and characterization of microtubular SOFCs with multilayered electrolyte,10.1149/1.2895008

4,12194,"The cell performance test showed an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of over 1 V at 600 degrees C or higher temperature for the SOFC with a multilayered electrolyte, while a SOFC with a 12 mu m thick GDC electrolyte showed an OCV of 0.84 V at 600 degrees C. The cell performances of 0.35 W cm(-2) at 0.7 V and 0.27 W cm(-2) at 0.8 V were obtained for the SOFC with multilayered electrolyte at the operating temperature of 650 degrees C.",Fabrication and characterization of microtubular SOFCs with multilayered electrolyte,10.1149/1.2895008
