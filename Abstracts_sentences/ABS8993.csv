1,8993,"Ba1-x La (x) FeO3-delta perovskites (BLF) capable of conducting electrons, protons, and oxygen ions are promising oxygen electrodes for efficient solid oxide cells (fuel cells or electrolyzers), an integral part of prospected large-scale power-to-gas energy storage systems.","Interface Diffusion and Compatibility of (Ba,La)FeO3-δ Perovskite Electrodes in Contact with Barium Zirconate and Ceria",10.1021/acsami.3c13013
2,8993,"We investigated the compatibility of BLF with lanthanum content between 5 and 50%, in contact with oxide-ion-conducting Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta and proton-conducting Ba-Zr0.825Y0.175O3-delta electrolytes, annealing the electrode-electrolyte bilayers at high temperature to simulate thermal stresses of fabrication and prolonged operation.","Interface Diffusion and Compatibility of (Ba,La)FeO3-δ Perovskite Electrodes in Contact with Barium Zirconate and Ceria",10.1021/acsami.3c13013
3,8993,"By employing both bulk X-ray diffraction and synchrotron X-ray microspectroscopy, we present a space-resolved picture of the interaction between electrode and electrolyte as what concerns cation interdiffusion, exsolution, and phase stability.","Interface Diffusion and Compatibility of (Ba,La)FeO3-δ Perovskite Electrodes in Contact with Barium Zirconate and Ceria",10.1021/acsami.3c13013
4,8993,"We found that the phase stability of BLF in contact with other phases is correlated with the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, in turn determined by the La/Ba ratio, and appropriate doping strategies with oversized cations (Zn2+, Y3+) could improve structural stability.","Interface Diffusion and Compatibility of (Ba,La)FeO3-δ Perovskite Electrodes in Contact with Barium Zirconate and Ceria",10.1021/acsami.3c13013
5,8993,"While extensive reactivity and/or interdiffusion was often observed, we put forward that most products of interfacial reactions, including proton-conducting Ba-(Ce,Gd)-O3-delta and mixed-conducting (Ba,La)-(Fe,Zr,Y)-O3-delta, may not be very detrimental for practical cell operation.","Interface Diffusion and Compatibility of (Ba,La)FeO3-δ Perovskite Electrodes in Contact with Barium Zirconate and Ceria",10.1021/acsami.3c13013
