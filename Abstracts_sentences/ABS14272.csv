1,14272,"This research presents the effects of oxygen pressure and ambient temperatures on the crack behavior of O-rings from a semi-EV of NR/EPDM rubber with silica/CB filler, exposed to the inlet flow and outflow oxygen pressure in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) environment.",Development of an O-ring from NR/EPDM filled silica/CB hybrid filler for use in a solid oxide fuel cell testing system,10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106568
2,14272,"Blends of NR/EPDM were prepared with various ratios of silica/CB filler at 00/60, 10/50, 20/40, 30/30, 40/20, 50/10, and 60/00 phr.",Development of an O-ring from NR/EPDM filled silica/CB hybrid filler for use in a solid oxide fuel cell testing system,10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106568
3,14272,"The fabricated O-ring complied with the standard for O-rings (TIS 2728-2559), with a minimum hardness of 65-75 Shore A, minimum tensile strength of 9 MPa, minimum elongation at break of 200%, and a minimum 100% modulus of 2.7 MPa.",Development of an O-ring from NR/EPDM filled silica/CB hybrid filler for use in a solid oxide fuel cell testing system,10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106568
4,14272,"The mechanical properties of the compounds were tested, and the appropriate compound was chosen to make the O-rings to test in SOFC.",Development of an O-ring from NR/EPDM filled silica/CB hybrid filler for use in a solid oxide fuel cell testing system,10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106568
5,14272,The crack morphology of the fabricated O-rings was investigated and compared with a commercial O-ring after testing in the SOFC.,Development of an O-ring from NR/EPDM filled silica/CB hybrid filler for use in a solid oxide fuel cell testing system,10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106568
6,14272,"As a result, the compound with silica/CB of 40:20 ratio provided the optimum mechanical properties, and passed the criteria standard of TIS 2728-2559.",Development of an O-ring from NR/EPDM filled silica/CB hybrid filler for use in a solid oxide fuel cell testing system,10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106568
7,14272,"The mechanical properties of the prepared and commercial O-rings were similar (P-value of commercial with 60/00 = 0.273, 50/10 = 0.273, 40/20 = 0.144, 30/30 = 0.465, 20/40 = 0.465, 10/50 = 1.000 and 00/60 = 0.273; all > 0.05) and and both could still be continued to be used in SOFC despite some inner cracks after 24 h. The price of the prepared O-ring is cheaper than the commercial O-rings due to the low price of NR used in its formulation.",Development of an O-ring from NR/EPDM filled silica/CB hybrid filler for use in a solid oxide fuel cell testing system,10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106568
8,14272,"Therefore, a prepared O-ring can be used in a SOFC, or other applications due to their mechanical properties and their reasonable price.",Development of an O-ring from NR/EPDM filled silica/CB hybrid filler for use in a solid oxide fuel cell testing system,10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106568
