4,15851,The effect of recirculation ratio on carbon deposition in both the flow configurations has also been reported.,"Computational analysis of IR-SOFC: Transient, thermal stress, carbon deposition and flow dependency",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.016
5,15851,"Moreover, in transient state the dynamic behavior during heat up, start up and load change phases for both the flow configuration has been presented.","Computational analysis of IR-SOFC: Transient, thermal stress, carbon deposition and flow dependency",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.016
6,15851,The obtained results have been compared with the available literature and the results shows good agreement.,"Computational analysis of IR-SOFC: Transient, thermal stress, carbon deposition and flow dependency",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.016
7,15851,It has been found that the air ratio helps in maintaining uniform temperature distribution within the cell especially in counter flow configuration which experiences higher thermal stress and that can be cut down by 3.1-5.8% respectively by the increasing air ratio from 2 to 8.5.,"Computational analysis of IR-SOFC: Transient, thermal stress, carbon deposition and flow dependency",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.016
8,15851,"However, counter flow configuration yields 8.23% higher current density as compared to the co-flow configuration, but co-flow configuration exhibits 22.58% higher efficiency.","Computational analysis of IR-SOFC: Transient, thermal stress, carbon deposition and flow dependency",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.016
