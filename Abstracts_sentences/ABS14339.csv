2,14339,"Key geometric properties of the constructed electrodes are calculated at various infiltration loadings, including the percolation probabilities of pores and infiltrated nanoparticles, the total and active three-phase boundary (TPB) length, backbone and nanoparticles surface areas, and backbone-nanoparticles boundary area.",Geometric Properties of Nanostructured Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1149/2.057303jes
3,14339,"The effects of backbone particle size, backbone porosity, nanoparticle size, and its aggregation risk are studied systematically.",Geometric Properties of Nanostructured Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1149/2.057303jes
4,14339,"Analytical models are developed to predict these geometric properties, and agree well with the numerical infiltration results, as well as the literature data.",Geometric Properties of Nanostructured Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1149/2.057303jes
5,14339,It is found that the peak TPB length can be achieved at 63% coverage of the backbone surface by infiltrated nanoparticles.,Geometric Properties of Nanostructured Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1149/2.057303jes
6,14339,"More interestingly, the backbone structure has little effect on nanoparticles surface area, but significantly affects TPB length, suggesting an strategy to identify electrode reaction mechanisms.",Geometric Properties of Nanostructured Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1149/2.057303jes
7,14339,"Decreasing infiltrated particle size increases its surface area, enhances the peak TPB length, and decreases the optimal infiltration loading, indicating small infiltrated particles essentially benefits electrode performance.",Geometric Properties of Nanostructured Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1149/2.057303jes
8,14339,The results provide valuable information for understanding the geometric properties of the infiltrated SOFC electrodes and contribute to the design of high performance SOFC electrodes.,Geometric Properties of Nanostructured Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electrodes,10.1149/2.057303jes
