2,4223,"A simple suspension chemistry (8-mol%-yttria-stabilized zirconia particles in acetic acid) yields films of similar quality to those from conventional approaches (such as electrochemical vapor deposition), but at potentially much less expense, A key factor in obtaining high-density, adherent films via the EPD approach is the application of a thin fugitive phase (carbon in this study) on the porous, doped lanthanum manganite cathode tubes prior to zirconia deposition.",Fabrication of dense zirconia electrolyte films for tubular solid oxide fuel cells by electrophoretic deposition,10.1111/j.1151-2916.2001.tb00604.x
