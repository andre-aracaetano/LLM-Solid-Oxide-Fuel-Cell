1,10193,Bi-layered cathodes with the LSM/LSM-YSZ structure for solid oxide fuel cells were successfully formed on the carbon-sputtered surface of a YSZ sheet by electrophoretic deposition (EPD).,Electrophoretic deposition of bi-layered LSM/LSM-YSZ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.079
2,10193,The thicknesses of the first layer of LSM-YSZ (LY) and the second layer of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) could be controlled by adjusting the deposition time in the EPD process.,Electrophoretic deposition of bi-layered LSM/LSM-YSZ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.079
3,10193,"The cathodic properties of the bi-layered structures were superior to those of the mono-layered structures, and were dependent on the thickness of each layer.",Electrophoretic deposition of bi-layered LSM/LSM-YSZ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.079
4,10193,Decreasing the thickness of the first layer and increasing that of the second layer tended to reduce both polarization and ohmic resistances.,Electrophoretic deposition of bi-layered LSM/LSM-YSZ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.079
5,10193,"The optimal thickness of the first layer at the operating temperature of 600 degrees C was 4 mu m, suggesting that an effective three-phase boundary was extended from the interface between the electrolyte and cathode film to around 4 mu m thickness.",Electrophoretic deposition of bi-layered LSM/LSM-YSZ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.079
