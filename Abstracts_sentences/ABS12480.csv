1,12480,"Ni catalyst-based anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating with natural gas fuel are vulnerable to coking (carbon deposition) and sulfur poisoning, resulting in impaired anodes and eventual cessation of SOFC operation.","Hydrogen tungsten bronze as a decoking agent for long-life, natural gas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ee01455c
2,12480,The incorporation of as small as 1 atom% W to Ni is found to overcome this formidable challenge.,"Hydrogen tungsten bronze as a decoking agent for long-life, natural gas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ee01455c
3,12480,The hydrogen tungsten bronze (HxWO3-delta WO3-x-delta(OH)(x)) formed by reaction with the water vapor produced during SOFC operation supplies the hydroxyl groups to oxidize carbon and eliminate coking on the Ni surface.,"Hydrogen tungsten bronze as a decoking agent for long-life, natural gas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ee01455c
4,12480,Mobile protons adhered to the oxide ions as well as the mobile oxide ions themselves in the AO(3) sublattice of the oxygen-deficient perovskite-type HxWO3-delta facilitate a rapid cleaning of the Ni surface.,"Hydrogen tungsten bronze as a decoking agent for long-life, natural gas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ee01455c
5,12480,We show here that Ni-HxWO3-delta-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC) anode-supported single cell SOFCs with GDC electrolyte and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta cathode exhibit more than 200 h of stable operation with methane fuel at 650-700 degrees C.,"Hydrogen tungsten bronze as a decoking agent for long-life, natural gas-fueled solid oxide fuel cells",10.1039/c4ee01455c
