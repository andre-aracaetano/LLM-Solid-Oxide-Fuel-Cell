1,8035,Researchers at Argonne National Laboratory have tested several cathodes on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and gadolinia-doped ceria (CGO) electrolytes for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,"Ln1-xSrxCoO3 (Ln=Gd, Pr) as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.021
2,8035,"The Pr0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (PSC) and Gd0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (GSC) cathodes show the best performance on CGO, achieving an area-specific resistance (ASR) between 0.1 and 0.2 Omega.cm(2) at 650 degreesC. However, the desirable operating temperature for CGO is between 500 and 600 degreesC, where the ASRs remain very high.","Ln1-xSrxCoO3 (Ln=Gd, Pr) as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.021

4,8035,"To prevent these reactions, a dense interlayer of CGO has been added between the YSZ and the cobalt-based cathodes.","Ln1-xSrxCoO3 (Ln=Gd, Pr) as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.021
5,8035,The results for the PSC and GSC cathodes on the YSZ electrolyte protected by a CGO layer reveal ASR values between 0.1 and 0.2 Omega.cm(2) at 750degreesC and 0.3 Omega.cm(2) at 700 degreesC. Long-term testing of both PSC and GSC cathodes on YSZ electrolytes with CGO interlayers showed stable ASR values for 500 h at 800 degreesC. Thermal cycling between room temperature and 800 degreesC after long-term testing showed minimal degradation.,"Ln1-xSrxCoO3 (Ln=Gd, Pr) as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.021
