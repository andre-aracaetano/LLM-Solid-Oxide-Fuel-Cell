1,3545,Efficient and direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuel in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFCs) is highly desirable.,Titanium-substituted ferrite perovskite: An excellent sulfur and coking tolerant anode catalyst for SOFCs,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.023
2,3545,"However, the carbon deposition and contaminants poisoning issue should be overcome.",Titanium-substituted ferrite perovskite: An excellent sulfur and coking tolerant anode catalyst for SOFCs,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.023
3,3545,"In this work, we developed a titanium-doped (La,Sr)FeO3 ceramic oxide (LSFT) anode which integrates the advantage of high durability of titanate perovskite and super electrocatalytic activity of ferrite-based perovskite for methane-fueled SOFCs with H2S impurity.",Titanium-substituted ferrite perovskite: An excellent sulfur and coking tolerant anode catalyst for SOFCs,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.023
4,3545,Its electrocatalytic activity and operational durability in H-2 with various H2S contents and humidified CH4 fuel were systematically investigated.,Titanium-substituted ferrite perovskite: An excellent sulfur and coking tolerant anode catalyst for SOFCs,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.023
5,3545,"We found that the LSFT perovskite oxide anode showed acceptable activity and durability toward methane direct oxidation, and excellent coke and sulfur tolerance up to 750 ppm, making it a promising electrocatalyst for direct use of hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas in high-temperature SOFCs.",Titanium-substituted ferrite perovskite: An excellent sulfur and coking tolerant anode catalyst for SOFCs,10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.023
