1,9863,Experiments using n-butane as a representative hydrocarbon fuel were conducted under gas-phase conditions similar to those expected in the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Importance of gas-phase kinetics within the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1021/jp037839w
2,9863,"Butane conversion and product formation were monitored in quartz reactor experiments at P similar to 0.8 atm, tau similar to 5 s, and T = 550-800 degreesC. Three different fuel mixtures were used: neat n-butane, 50% n-C4H10/50% H2O, and 50% n-C4H10/50% N-2.",Importance of gas-phase kinetics within the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1021/jp037839w
3,9863,These experiments demonstrate that substantial gas-phase chemistry does occur and that this must be accounted for when predicting fuel cell efficiency.,Importance of gas-phase kinetics within the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1021/jp037839w
4,9863,These data were compared to predictions using a plug-flow model that incorporated the experimentally measured temperature profile along the reactor.,Importance of gas-phase kinetics within the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1021/jp037839w
5,9863,The reaction mechanism used for these simulations consisted of similar to300 species and 2500 elementary reactions and included both pyrolysis and oxidation reactions.,Importance of gas-phase kinetics within the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1021/jp037839w
6,9863,"Comparisons of the model predictions to the experimental data show that the model, without any modifications, captures the observed strong temperature dependence of n-butane conversion and is also able to capture the changes in product selectivity with temperature for the neat butane and the diluted butane mixtures.",Importance of gas-phase kinetics within the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1021/jp037839w
7,9863,The model also properly predicts the observed onset of deposit formation near 700 degreesC. Both conversion and selectivity are shown to be sensitive to only a very small subset of the reactions in the mechanism.,Importance of gas-phase kinetics within the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1021/jp037839w
8,9863,"Comparison of the rate coefficients of this subset to literature values, where available, are generally reasonable and suggest that this kinetic model is adequate for describing the gas-phase reactions of small hydrocarbons in the anode channels of a SOFC.",Importance of gas-phase kinetics within the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1021/jp037839w
9,9863,Additional efforts are required to account for catalytic reactions on the surface of the porous anode.,Importance of gas-phase kinetics within the anode channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1021/jp037839w
