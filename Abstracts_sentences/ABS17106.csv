1,17106,Nano-crystalline and fluorite single-phased Ce0.8SmxNd0.2-xO1.9 powders were prepared by low-temperature combustion process in citric-nitrate system.,Study on Sm2O3 and Nd2O3 co-doped ceria based electrolyte,
2,17106,It is calculated from X-ray diffraction patterns that the size of the: powders was between 11.7 nm and 20.1 nm.,Study on Sm2O3 and Nd2O3 co-doped ceria based electrolyte,
3,17106,"A high density ceramic can be obtained after the powders were dry pressed and sintered at 1400 degrees C for 5 h. The SEM micrographs showed the microstructure of the ceramic was homogenous, and the grain size was between 2 mu m and 4 gm.",Study on Sm2O3 and Nd2O3 co-doped ceria based electrolyte,
4,17106,The electrical conductivity of the sample at 500 degrees C can reach to 0.012 S/cm.,Study on Sm2O3 and Nd2O3 co-doped ceria based electrolyte,
5,17106,It can be concluded that co-doped ceria based electrolyte possesses a higher electrical conductivity in comparison with single-doped ceria based materials.,Study on Sm2O3 and Nd2O3 co-doped ceria based electrolyte,
