2,8046,"Herein, we report the operating stability and microstructure at the electrode/electrolyte interface of La0.57Sr0.38Co0.18Fe0.72Nb0.1O3-delta (LSCFN) oxygen electrodes assembled on barrier-layer-free Y2O3-ZrO2 electrolyte under cyclic anodic/cathodic polarization mode at 0.5 A cm(-2) and 750 degrees C. During the cyclic polarization, the electrocatalytic activity of LSCFN electrode is drastically deteriorated in cathodic mode, but the performance loss is largely recoverable in anodic mode.",Cyclic polarization enhances the operating stability of La0.57Sr0.38Co0.18Fe0.72Nb0-1O3-δ oxygen electrode of reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.10.009
3,8046,This is due to the fact that the surface segregation of Sr and accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface by cathodic polarization can be remarkably mitigated by anodic polarization.,Cyclic polarization enhances the operating stability of La0.57Sr0.38Co0.18Fe0.72Nb0-1O3-δ oxygen electrode of reversible solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.10.009
