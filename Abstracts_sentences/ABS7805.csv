2,7805,A single solid oxide fuel cell has been prepared by applying a Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 cathode on the outside of the cylinders and a NiO-SDC (7:3 wt%) anode on the inside.,Slip-cast Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 cone-shaped SOFC,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02270.x
3,7805,"The open circuit voltage of the cell was 0.93 V at 400 degrees C, and a maximum power density of about 300 mW/cm(2) at 700 degrees C was obtained with humidified hydrogen (3% H2O) as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant.",Slip-cast Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 cone-shaped SOFC,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02270.x
4,7805,Impedance results showed that the performance of the cell was mainly influenced by the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte.,Slip-cast Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 cone-shaped SOFC,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02270.x
