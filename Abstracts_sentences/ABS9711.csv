1,9711,Lanthanum silicate (LS) with 1-5 wt% Bi2O3 addition (LSB) was investigated for bi-layer solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) electrolyte with gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC).,Modification of sinterability and electrical property by Bi2O3 addition to La9.333Si6O26 for co-sintering with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95,10.1016/j.inoche.2020.107974
2,9711,Thermal shrinkage analyses suggested that adding more than 3 wt% Bi2O3 to LS approached to sintering behavior of GDC and Ni-GDC.,Modification of sinterability and electrical property by Bi2O3 addition to La9.333Si6O26 for co-sintering with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95,10.1016/j.inoche.2020.107974
3,9711,Impedance measurement of GDC/LSB composites indicated that an additional resistive phase was formed in the grain boundary between GDC and LSB.,Modification of sinterability and electrical property by Bi2O3 addition to La9.333Si6O26 for co-sintering with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95,10.1016/j.inoche.2020.107974
4,9711,Grain boundary resistance increased significantly with 5 wt% Bi2O3.,Modification of sinterability and electrical property by Bi2O3 addition to La9.333Si6O26 for co-sintering with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95,10.1016/j.inoche.2020.107974
5,9711,This increase was inhibited in 1-3 wt% Bi2O3.,Modification of sinterability and electrical property by Bi2O3 addition to La9.333Si6O26 for co-sintering with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95,10.1016/j.inoche.2020.107974
6,9711,Adding 3 wt% Bi2O3 to GDC/LSB is expected to density electrolytes by co-sintering and limit the increase in resistance.,Modification of sinterability and electrical property by Bi2O3 addition to La9.333Si6O26 for co-sintering with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95,10.1016/j.inoche.2020.107974
