1,8788,"In a recent report, we demonstrated that fewnanometer-thick yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coating on a porous Pt cathode of a solid oxide fuel cell is an excellent facilitator of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics and an effective suppressor of Pt agglomeration.",Mechanism of Cathodic Performance Enhancement by a Few-Nanometer- Thick Oxide Overcoat on Porous Pt Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsomega.6b00433
2,8788,"In this article, we reveal the actual role of the YSZ overcoat in the ORR process through a series of electrochemical analyses.",Mechanism of Cathodic Performance Enhancement by a Few-Nanometer- Thick Oxide Overcoat on Porous Pt Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsomega.6b00433
3,8788,"Without the overcoat, the nanoporous Pt is significantly agglomerated during a high-temperature operation and the ORR becomes limited by the availability of triple phase boundaries (TPBs).",Mechanism of Cathodic Performance Enhancement by a Few-Nanometer- Thick Oxide Overcoat on Porous Pt Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsomega.6b00433
4,8788,An ultrathin YSZ overcoat prevents the ORR process from being limited by TPB area by preserving the morphology of its underlying Pt layer.,Mechanism of Cathodic Performance Enhancement by a Few-Nanometer- Thick Oxide Overcoat on Porous Pt Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsomega.6b00433
5,8788,"More importantly, the overcoat acts as an excellent facilitator of the atomic-oxygen-species-mediated chemical process(es) that used to be rate-limiting in the ORR of a noncoated Pt/YSZ system.",Mechanism of Cathodic Performance Enhancement by a Few-Nanometer- Thick Oxide Overcoat on Porous Pt Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsomega.6b00433
