1,14572,"Composite, Solid-Oxide-Fuel-Cell (SOFC) electrodes of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSF) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were prepared by infiltration methods and then modified by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of ZrO2, La2O3, Fe2O3, or La2O3-Fe2O3 codeposited films of different thicknesses to determine the effect of surface composition on cathode performance.",Modification of LSF-YSZ Composite Cathodes by Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1149/2.0181709jes
2,14572,"Film growth rates for ALD performed using vacuum procedures at 573 K for Fe2O3 and 523 K for ZrO2 and La2O3 were determined to be 0.024 nm ZrO2/cycle, 0.019 nm La2O3/cycle, and 0.018 nm Fe2O3/cycle.",Modification of LSF-YSZ Composite Cathodes by Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1149/2.0181709jes
3,14572,"For ZrO2 and Fe2O3, impedance spectra on symmetric cells at 873 K indicated that polarization resistances increased with coverage in a manner suggesting simple blocking of O-2 adsorption sites.",Modification of LSF-YSZ Composite Cathodes by Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1149/2.0181709jes
4,14572,"With La2O3, the polarization resistance decreased with small numbers of ALD cycles before again increasing at higher coverages.",Modification of LSF-YSZ Composite Cathodes by Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1149/2.0181709jes
5,14572,"When La2O3 and Fe2O3 were co-deposited, the polarization resistances remained low at high film coverages, implying that O-2 adsorption sites were formed on the co-deposited films.",Modification of LSF-YSZ Composite Cathodes by Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1149/2.0181709jes
6,14572,The implications of these results for future SOFC electrode development are discussed.,Modification of LSF-YSZ Composite Cathodes by Atomic Layer Deposition,10.1149/2.0181709jes
