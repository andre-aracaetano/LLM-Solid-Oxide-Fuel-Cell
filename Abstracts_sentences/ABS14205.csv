2,14205,"In this study, the performance of the reduced La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-delta (LSCFN) with anchored Co-Fe nanoparticles is investigated as the electrode in low concentration ethanol for the first time.",High-stable power generation from low concentration ethanol by catalyst layer modified solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165448
3,14205,"The cell with the LSCFN as the symmetrical electrodes demonstrates considerable peak power density (0.32 W cm-2) and excellent durability (160 h) at 800 C. Moreover, the reduced LSCFN is further applied as a catalyst layer to prevent the Ni-YSZ anode-supported cell from coking in ethanol fuel.",High-stable power generation from low concentration ethanol by catalyst layer modified solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165448
4,14205,"Interestingly, both cells modified with or without this LSCFN layer demonstrate similar output performance in H-2.",High-stable power generation from low concentration ethanol by catalyst layer modified solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165448
5,14205,"While in ethanol, the catalyst layer modified cell exhibits better coking resistance and stability than the conventional cell, showing 0.97 W cm-2 at 800 C, as well as excellent durability for 210 h.",High-stable power generation from low concentration ethanol by catalyst layer modified solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165448
6,14205,The results suggest that combining the Ni-YSZ anode-supported cells with the excellent carbon tolerance of the LSCFN can clean and stable directly generate power from ethanol.,High-stable power generation from low concentration ethanol by catalyst layer modified solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165448
