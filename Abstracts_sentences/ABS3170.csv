1,3170,The tolerance for the reduction and oxidation (redox) reactions of the segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cells (SIS-SOFCs) has been investigated.,Evaluation of the redox stability of segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.091
2,3170,"In conventional anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), the anode and the substrate are typically prepared from Ni-YSZ-based materials which exhibit a significant dimensional change because of the redox reaction and cannot retain their structure.",Evaluation of the redox stability of segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.091
3,3170,"The substrate of the SIS-SOFCs is prepared from Ni-doped MgO-based material, which has a high redox tolerance, and the SIS-SOFC exhibits a good performance after the redox cycles.",Evaluation of the redox stability of segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.091
4,3170,The degradation rate is approximately 0.15% per cycle in a redox condition of start-and-stop operation without fuel supply.,Evaluation of the redox stability of segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.091
5,3170,"In the other redox condition (when the fuel supply is interrupted for 1.5 min), the voltage of the SIS-SOFCs remains almost constant.",Evaluation of the redox stability of segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.091
6,3170,"However, the voltage of SIS-SOFCs decreases with an increase in the reoxiclation time of the interruption in the fuel supply.",Evaluation of the redox stability of segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.091
7,3170,"The high redox tolerance is attributed to the fact that the diffusion coefficients, mean free path, and existence of the Ni particles in the substrate can effectively deter the oxidation of the anode.",Evaluation of the redox stability of segmented-in-series solid oxide fuel cell stacks,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.091
