4,15243,The effects of these phenomena-carbon accumulation from methane and carbon removal by reforming agents-on the electrochemical capabilities of a device were monitored with electrochemical impedance and voltammetry measurements.,Comparing in Situ Carbon Tolerances of Sn-Infiltrated and BaO-Infiltrated Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Exposed to Methane,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b01345
5,15243,Vibrational spectra showed that the undoped and 1% Sn infiltrated anodes were very susceptible to carbon formation from methane while considerably less carbon accumulated on the 1% BaO anodes.,Comparing in Situ Carbon Tolerances of Sn-Infiltrated and BaO-Infiltrated Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Exposed to Methane,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b01345
6,15243,"Electrochemical data, however, implied that carbon accumulated in different regions of the anode and that both Sn and BaO effectively reduced carbon accumulation but also inhibited electrochemical oxidation.",Comparing in Situ Carbon Tolerances of Sn-Infiltrated and BaO-Infiltrated Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Exposed to Methane,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b01345
7,15243,"For each anode, H2O was the most effective reforming agent for removing carbon followed by O-2 and then CO2.",Comparing in Situ Carbon Tolerances of Sn-Infiltrated and BaO-Infiltrated Ni-YSZ Cermet Anodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Exposed to Methane,10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b01345
