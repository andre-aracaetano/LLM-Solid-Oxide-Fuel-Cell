1,17431,"For scanning x-ray microscopy, many attempts have been made to image the phase contrast based on a concept of the beam being deflected by a specimen, the so-called differential phase contrast imaging (DPC).",Quantitative x-ray phase imaging at the nanoscale by multilayer Laue lenses,10.1038/srep01307
2,17431,"Despite the successful demonstration in a number of representative cases at moderate spatial resolutions, these methods suffer from various limitations that preclude applications of DPC for ultra-high spatial resolution imaging, where the emerging wave field from the focusing optic tends to be significantly more complicated.",Quantitative x-ray phase imaging at the nanoscale by multilayer Laue lenses,10.1038/srep01307
3,17431,"In this work, we propose a highly robust and generic approach based on a Fourier-shift fitting process and demonstrate quantitative phase imaging of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode by multilayer Laue lenses (MLLs).",Quantitative x-ray phase imaging at the nanoscale by multilayer Laue lenses,10.1038/srep01307
4,17431,The high sensitivity of the phase to structural and compositional variations makes our technique extremely powerful in correlating the electrode performance with its buried nanoscale interfacial structures that may be invisible to the absorption and fluorescence contrasts.,Quantitative x-ray phase imaging at the nanoscale by multilayer Laue lenses,10.1038/srep01307
