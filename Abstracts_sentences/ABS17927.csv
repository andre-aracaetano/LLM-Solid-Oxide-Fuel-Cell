2,17927,"Here, we report the homogenous exsolution of Pd NPs with an average size of 100 nm in compressive strained La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.9Pd0.1O3-delta (LSFPd) thin films.",Electrical stability during redox cycles promoted by Pd exsolution in LSFPd thin films,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.01.101
3,17927,We systematically explored the electrical resistivity and the redox stability of LSFPd thin films upon exsolution of NPs.,Electrical stability during redox cycles promoted by Pd exsolution in LSFPd thin films,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.01.101
4,17927,"Compared to La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta (LSF) thin films, whose electrical response was controlled by oxygen stoichiometry, LSFPd films showed a more stable electrical response in redox cycling with similar resistivity values both in air and hydrogen.",Electrical stability during redox cycles promoted by Pd exsolution in LSFPd thin films,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.01.101
5,17927,The improved stability was attributed to dynamic and exsolution of NPs.,Electrical stability during redox cycles promoted by Pd exsolution in LSFPd thin films,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.01.101
6,17927,"Our study showed that the control of exsolution of NPs can provide a new way to regulate the electrical response of perovskite oxide semiconductors under external stimuli (i.e., atmosphere), which could be beneficial for the rational design of high-performance functional materials for micro solid oxide fuel cells, nano-sensors, and nano-actuators applications.",Electrical stability during redox cycles promoted by Pd exsolution in LSFPd thin films,10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.01.101
