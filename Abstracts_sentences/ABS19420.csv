4,19420,The relative density of YSZ-x electrolytes effectively increases with trace additive of fly ash and can reach over 96-98% (YSZ-0.1 and YSZ-1).,Fly ash to improve density and ionic conductivity of solid oxide cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.103546
5,19420,The thermal expansion coefficients of YSZ-x electrolytes keep mostly unchangeable.,Fly ash to improve density and ionic conductivity of solid oxide cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.103546
6,19420,"The ionic conductivities of YSZ electrolyte can be dramatically improved by trace additive of fly ash (YSZ-0.1) from oxidizing to reducing atmospheres and achieved as high as 0.14 S.cm-1 at 800C. In short, fly ash is successfully used to evaluate dust pollution of solid electrolytes in the process of solid oxide cell industrialization and to improve the performance, which opens doors to design advanced solid oxide cell materials.",Fly ash to improve density and ionic conductivity of solid oxide cell electrolytes,10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.103546
