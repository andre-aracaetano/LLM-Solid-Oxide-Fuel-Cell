1,14769,"In this study the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Cu-CeO2-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was compared to an SOFC with Ni-YSZ anode while operating on H-2, CO, and syngas fuels.","Comparison of the performance of Cu-CeO2-YSZ and Ni-YSZ composite SOFC anodes with H2, CO, and syngas",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.022
2,14769,"Cells with Cu-CeO2-YSZ anodes exhibited similar performance when operating on H-2 or CO fuels, while cells with Ni-YSZ anodes exhibited substantially lower performance when operating on CO compared with H-2.","Comparison of the performance of Cu-CeO2-YSZ and Ni-YSZ composite SOFC anodes with H2, CO, and syngas",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.022
3,14769,Enhancing the catalytic activity of the Cu-CeO2-YSZ anodes by adding Co was shown to produce cells that exhibited higher performance when operating on CO compared to H-2 at 973 K.,"Comparison of the performance of Cu-CeO2-YSZ and Ni-YSZ composite SOFC anodes with H2, CO, and syngas",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.022
4,14769,"The effect of fuel concentration and dilution on cell performance was also investigated and it was found that the kinetics of the oxidation of H-2 are positive order in P-H2, for Cu-CeO2-YSZ anodes and nearly zero order in PH2 for Ni-YSZ anodes.","Comparison of the performance of Cu-CeO2-YSZ and Ni-YSZ composite SOFC anodes with H2, CO, and syngas",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.022
5,14769,The oxidation of CO on Cu-CeO2-YSZ anodes was also found to exhibit positive order in P-CO.,"Comparison of the performance of Cu-CeO2-YSZ and Ni-YSZ composite SOFC anodes with H2, CO, and syngas",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.022
6,14769,It was also demonstrated that dilution of H-2 by H2O had little effect on the kinetics of H-2 oxidation on both the Cu-CeO2-YSZ and Ni-YSZ anodes.,"Comparison of the performance of Cu-CeO2-YSZ and Ni-YSZ composite SOFC anodes with H2, CO, and syngas",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.09.022
