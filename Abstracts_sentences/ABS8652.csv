1,8652,A cobalt-free La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-delta (LSEMo) powders were synthesized by a modified Pechini method and examined as a novel cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) based on proton-conducting electrolyte of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY).,Electrochemical comparison of cobalt-free La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ based cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.133
2,8652,The button cells of Ni-BZCY/BZCY/LSEMo (LSEMo-BZCY) were fabricated and tested from 600 to 700 degrees C with humidified H-2 (similar to 3% H2O) as a fuel and ambient oxygen as an oxidant.,Electrochemical comparison of cobalt-free La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ based cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.133
3,8652,The single cells with LSFMo cathode show the maximum power density of 332 mW cm(-2) and the electrode polarization resistance of 0.59 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C.,Electrochemical comparison of cobalt-free La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ based cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.133
4,8652,While the cells with LSFMo-BZCY composite cathode show much higher maximum power density of 403 mW cm(-2) and much lower polarization resistance of 0.23 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C.,Electrochemical comparison of cobalt-free La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ based cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.133
5,8652,"The dramatic improvement of electrochemical performance is attributed to expand TPB reaction zone beyond the interface, a composite cathode consisting of a proton conductor and a mixed oxygen-ion and electron conductor could lead to a very lower polarization resistance and a higher power density.",Electrochemical comparison of cobalt-free La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Mo0.1O3-δ based cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.10.133
