1,4803,A novel anode consisting of Ni and Sm2O3 with negligible oxygen-ion conductivity was developed for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,High performance Ni-Sm2O3 cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.013
2,4803,"Its triple phase boundary length is pretty small compared with the conventional Ni-samaria doped ceria (SDC) anode, of which SDC is one of the electrolytes having high oxygen-ion conductivity.",High performance Ni-Sm2O3 cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.013
3,4803,"Even so, single cells with Ni-Sm2O3 anodes generated peak power density of 542 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, comparable to, if not higher than those with the Ni-SDC anodes when the same cathodes and electrolytes were applied.",High performance Ni-Sm2O3 cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.013
4,4803,"In addition, Ni-Sm2O3 exhibited lower interfacial polarization resistance than Ni-SDC.",High performance Ni-Sm2O3 cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.013
5,4803,"The high electrochemical performance, which might be related to the high catalytic activity of Sm2O3 and the unique microstructures of the Ni-Sm2O3, suggests a viable alternative to the conventional anodes for SOFCs.",High performance Ni-Sm2O3 cermet anodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.013
