5,19844,"Using central estimates of price parameters, and with some thermal energy storage present in the system, it is shown that the least cost operating strategy for the three technologies is to follow heat and electricity load during winter months, rather than using either heat demand or electricity demand as the only dispatch signal.",Cost-effective operating strategy for residential micro-combined heat and power,10.1016/j.energy.2006.06.001
