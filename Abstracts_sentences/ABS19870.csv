1,19870,"Cerrnet compositions based on Nickel-Copper alloys with gadolinium doped ceria as the ceramic matrix, Ni1-xCuxO (x = 0, 0.4 and 0.8 mol%) with 50 wt% CGO (Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95), are assessed as possible anodes for SOFCs operating in H-2 and biogas fuels.",Nickel-copper based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells running on hydrogen and biogas: Study using ceria-based electrolytes with electronic short-circuiting correction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227041
2,19870,Equivalent circuit modelling is employed to evaluate the total polarisation resistance of cermet anodes with correction of data for electronic short-circuiting that may arise when using Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) electrolytes under reducing conditions.,Nickel-copper based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells running on hydrogen and biogas: Study using ceria-based electrolytes with electronic short-circuiting correction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227041
3,19870,"Data analysis highlights that presence of electronic leakage in CGO electrolyte can lead to severe underestimation of total polarisation resistance in the case of H-2 fuel, with this deviation becoming more serious with increasing temperature.",Nickel-copper based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells running on hydrogen and biogas: Study using ceria-based electrolytes with electronic short-circuiting correction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227041

5,19870,The results underscore that anode characteristics are highly dependent on the effective oxygen partial pressure of working gas atmosphere and that suitable correction of data is imperative before discussion.,Nickel-copper based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells running on hydrogen and biogas: Study using ceria-based electrolytes with electronic short-circuiting correction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227041
6,19870,"Corrected values for polarisation resistance in each fuel reveal the Nickel-Copper alloy cermet with copper content of x = 0.4 to be beneficial under the biogas atmosphere, while, conversely, the pure Ni-cermet is shown to be the peak performing composition in H-2 fuel.",Nickel-copper based anodes for solid oxide fuel cells running on hydrogen and biogas: Study using ceria-based electrolytes with electronic short-circuiting correction,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227041
