2,5027,"Product gas is converted in a micro gas turbine (MGT) in the first system, in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) in the second system and in a combined SOFC-MGT arrangement in the third system.","Thermodynamic performance study of biomass gasification, solid oxide fuel cell and micro gas turbine hybrid systems",10.1016/j.enconman.2010.04.006
3,5027,An electrochemical model of the SOFC has been developed and calibrated against published data from Topsoe Fuel Cells A/S and the Rise National Laboratory.,"Thermodynamic performance study of biomass gasification, solid oxide fuel cell and micro gas turbine hybrid systems",10.1016/j.enconman.2010.04.006
4,5027,"The modelled gasifier is based on an up scaled version (similar to 500 kW(th)) of the demonstrated low tar gasifier, Viking, situated at the Technical University of Denmark.","Thermodynamic performance study of biomass gasification, solid oxide fuel cell and micro gas turbine hybrid systems",10.1016/j.enconman.2010.04.006
5,5027,"The SOFC converts the syngas more efficiently than the MGT, which is reflected by the energetic electrical efficiency of the gasifier and MGT system in opposition to the gasifier and SOFC configuration -eta(el) =","Thermodynamic performance study of biomass gasification, solid oxide fuel cell and micro gas turbine hybrid systems",10.1016/j.enconman.2010.04.006
