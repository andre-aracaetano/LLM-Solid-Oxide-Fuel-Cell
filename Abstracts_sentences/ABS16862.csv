1,16862,"Joining of NiO-YSZ composite with 316 stainless steel was carried out using B-Ni3 brazing filler alloy (Ni-4.5Si-3.2B-0.06C-0.02P, wt-%; melting point, 982-1038 degrees C) and two samples were fabricated.",Interfacial morphologies between NiO-YSZ fuel electrode/316 stainless steel as interconnect material and B-Ni3 brazing alloy in solid oxide fuel cell system: effect of joint loading during brazing,10.1179/000844311X552331
2,16862,"On the one hand, interfacial (chemical) reactions during brazing at the NiO-YSZ/316 stainless steel interconnect were promoted only by addition of an electroless nickel plate to NiO-YSZ composite as a coating with relevant process variables and procedures optimised during the electroless nickel plating.",Interfacial morphologies between NiO-YSZ fuel electrode/316 stainless steel as interconnect material and B-Ni3 brazing alloy in solid oxide fuel cell system: effect of joint loading during brazing,10.1179/000844311X552331
3,16862,"On the other hand, moderate loading was applied during brazing normal to the joint surface where electroless nickel plate was coated previously to improve interfacial sealing of the NiO-YSZ cermet anode/316 stainless steel interconnect structure for use in a solid oxide fuel cell.",Interfacial morphologies between NiO-YSZ fuel electrode/316 stainless steel as interconnect material and B-Ni3 brazing alloy in solid oxide fuel cell system: effect of joint loading during brazing,10.1179/000844311X552331
4,16862,A special fixture for static loading was designed for filler metal alloy strips to be preplaced at the joint surface where static loading was applied perpendicular to it for the promotion of liquid alloy layer formation during brazing.,Interfacial morphologies between NiO-YSZ fuel electrode/316 stainless steel as interconnect material and B-Ni3 brazing alloy in solid oxide fuel cell system: effect of joint loading during brazing,10.1179/000844311X552331
5,16862,Brazing was performed in a cold wall vacuum furnace at 1080 degrees C and post-brazing examination of interfacial morphologies between NiO-YSZ composite and 316 stainless steel was performed using SEM and EDS analyses.,Interfacial morphologies between NiO-YSZ fuel electrode/316 stainless steel as interconnect material and B-Ni3 brazing alloy in solid oxide fuel cell system: effect of joint loading during brazing,10.1179/000844311X552331
6,16862,The results indicate that B-Ni3 brazing filler alloy was fused fully during brazing and continuous interfacial layer formation and joint integrity were significantly affected by applied static loading during brazing.,Interfacial morphologies between NiO-YSZ fuel electrode/316 stainless steel as interconnect material and B-Ni3 brazing alloy in solid oxide fuel cell system: effect of joint loading during brazing,10.1179/000844311X552331
