5,12261,Methanol conversions up to 72% and H-2 productivities as high as 0.46 mol/(h g(cat)) were obtained on the Pd/CS catalyst.,Investigation of Sm2O3-CeO2-supported palladium catalysts for the reforming of methanol:: The role of the support,10.1016/j.apcata.2005.07.022
6,12261,"Moreover, low H-2 productivity (0.09 mol/(h g(cat))) was found on the Pd/CeO2 catalyst, while Pd/Sm2O3 appeared to be inactive.",Investigation of Sm2O3-CeO2-supported palladium catalysts for the reforming of methanol:: The role of the support,10.1016/j.apcata.2005.07.022
7,12261,This behaviour can be partly assigned to the higher dispersion and the more favourable distribution of Pd particles observed in the Pd/CS catalyst.,Investigation of Sm2O3-CeO2-supported palladium catalysts for the reforming of methanol:: The role of the support,10.1016/j.apcata.2005.07.022
8,12261,A strong association of Pd and samarium oxide and an enrichment in both components at the external surface of the Pd/CS catalyst grains was found by means of TPR and XPS.,Investigation of Sm2O3-CeO2-supported palladium catalysts for the reforming of methanol:: The role of the support,10.1016/j.apcata.2005.07.022
9,12261,This could be explained by the partial dissolution of Sm2O3 in the acid medium used during catalyst preparation leading to the re-precipitation of a Pd/Sm-containing phase.,Investigation of Sm2O3-CeO2-supported palladium catalysts for the reforming of methanol:: The role of the support,10.1016/j.apcata.2005.07.022
