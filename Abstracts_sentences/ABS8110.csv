1,8110,Sr2MgMoO6-delta (SMM) is one of promising anode materials for direct internal reforming solid oxide fuel cells as its excellent performance has been demonstrated.,Chemical compatibility of Sr2MgMoO6-δ with representative electrolyte materials and interlayer materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.17231
2,8110,"However, it is necessary to be chemically compatible with the electrolyte material to realize the original performance.",Chemical compatibility of Sr2MgMoO6-δ with representative electrolyte materials and interlayer materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.17231
3,8110,"In this study, we investigate chemical compatibility between SMM and typical electrolyte materials (8% mol Y2O3-92%mol ZrO2; YSZ, 10% mol Sc2O3-1% mol CeO2-89% mol ZrO2; ScSZ, La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta; LSGM) and anode interlayer materials (Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta; GDC, Ce0.8La0.2O2-delta; LDC) under conditions for preparing SMM electrode and operation.",Chemical compatibility of Sr2MgMoO6-δ with representative electrolyte materials and interlayer materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.17231
4,8110,SMM formed a reaction layer with all of the typical electrolyte materials studied.,Chemical compatibility of Sr2MgMoO6-δ with representative electrolyte materials and interlayer materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.17231
5,8110,"LDC was the only material for the interlayer that maintains chemical compatibility with SMM, though it forms the reaction layer with YSZ and ScSZ.",Chemical compatibility of Sr2MgMoO6-δ with representative electrolyte materials and interlayer materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.17231
6,8110,"From these results, this study clarifies that LSGM and LDC should be used as electrolyte and interlayer, respectively, when SMM is used as the anode.",Chemical compatibility of Sr2MgMoO6-δ with representative electrolyte materials and interlayer materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.17231
