1,8279,La0.7Sr0.3Ga0.7Mg0.1Fe0.2O3-delta (LSGMF73712) has been proposed as a new substitute for solid electrolyte in SOFC (solid oxide fuel cells).,Combustion synthesis of doped LaGaO3 perovskite oxide with Fe,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.05.030
2,8279,"It has several merits, such as lower operating temperature of SOFC, high transport number of oxide ion and higher electronic conductivity.",Combustion synthesis of doped LaGaO3 perovskite oxide with Fe,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.05.030
3,8279,"In this study, the doped-lanthanum gallium with Fe was produced by combustion synthesis, and the effect of particle sizes on sintering behaviors of La(Sr)Ga(Mg)FeO3-delta samples by spark plasma sintering (SPS) was analyzed by comparing with the traditional solid-state reaction method.",Combustion synthesis of doped LaGaO3 perovskite oxide with Fe,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.05.030
4,8279,"In the experiments of the combustion synthesis, lanthanum oxide, strontium carbonate, metallic gallium, pure iron, metallic magnesium and sodium perchlorate were mixed uniformly and were ignited at one end of the sample under the argon atmosphere to complete the combustion process without any additional energy.",Combustion synthesis of doped LaGaO3 perovskite oxide with Fe,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.05.030
5,8279,"Not only could this method shorten the processing time, but also it could minimize the sintering temperature in the production.",Combustion synthesis of doped LaGaO3 perovskite oxide with Fe,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.05.030
6,8279,"As a result, the product showed definite peaks of lanthanum gallium in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the product could be sintered at a lower temperature 1473 K by SPS method, in comparison to a conventional solid-state reaction method.",Combustion synthesis of doped LaGaO3 perovskite oxide with Fe,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.05.030
7,8279,"Moreover, the sintering temperature of the products could further decrease in a lower temperature 1273 K after ball-mill treatment.",Combustion synthesis of doped LaGaO3 perovskite oxide with Fe,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.05.030
