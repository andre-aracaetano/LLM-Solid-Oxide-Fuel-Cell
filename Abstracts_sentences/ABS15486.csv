2,15486,"Further, it is necessary to make natural gas processing operation a cost-competitive, clean, and efficient energy source, and less dependent on the grid.",Comparative techno-economic assessment of integrated PV-SOFC and PV-Battery hybrid system for natural gas processing plants,10.1016/j.energy.2021.119923
3,15486,A comparative investigation based on two case studies is pre-sented in this paper for a natural gas processing plant; an integration of Photovoltaic panels with Battery Energy Storage System (PV-BESS) and an integration of Photovoltaic panels with Solid Oxide Fuel cell (PV-SOFC) technologies.,Comparative techno-economic assessment of integrated PV-SOFC and PV-Battery hybrid system for natural gas processing plants,10.1016/j.energy.2021.119923
4,15486,The aim is to be more independent from the grid for efficient operations and to reduce the emissions by introducing renewable energy in gas processing operation plant.,Comparative techno-economic assessment of integrated PV-SOFC and PV-Battery hybrid system for natural gas processing plants,10.1016/j.energy.2021.119923
5,15486,A techno-economic analysis is performed for both cases considering a PV capacity of 33.5 MW.,Comparative techno-economic assessment of integrated PV-SOFC and PV-Battery hybrid system for natural gas processing plants,10.1016/j.energy.2021.119923
6,15486,"The outcome of this study indicates that for 25 years of operation, the Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for PV-BESS is found to be 0.16 US$/kWh, and for PV-SOFC is 0.11 US$/kWh, which makes the PV-SOFC option more economical and feasible than PV-BESS.",Comparative techno-economic assessment of integrated PV-SOFC and PV-Battery hybrid system for natural gas processing plants,10.1016/j.energy.2021.119923
7,15486,"Besides, in the projected scenario where invest-ment cost is expected to reduce, PV-SOFC's IRR is 3% and has a positive NPV of 5 Million USD$ for an internal rate of 4%.",Comparative techno-economic assessment of integrated PV-SOFC and PV-Battery hybrid system for natural gas processing plants,10.1016/j.energy.2021.119923
8,15486,"Furthermore, the LCOE for PV-SOFC in this scenario is around 0.04 USD$ per kWh, which is still less than the LCOE of PV-BESS and less than the tariff set by the Qatari electric authority for bulk industries.",Comparative techno-economic assessment of integrated PV-SOFC and PV-Battery hybrid system for natural gas processing plants,10.1016/j.energy.2021.119923
