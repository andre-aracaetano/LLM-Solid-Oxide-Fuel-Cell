1,19138,This work concerns the activities of the European project BLAZE that aims to integrate a pilot-scale gasifier unit with a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC).,Synergic Effects of Bed Materials and Catalytic Filter Candle for the Conversion of Tar during Biomass Steam Gasification,10.3390/en16020595
2,19138,"The objective is to identify the optimal operating conditions for a gasifier and hot gas cleaning and conditioning unit to produce H-2-rich syngas with contaminants levels within the limits for the safe operation of the SOFC (750 mg/Nm(3) and 75 mg/Nm(3) for toluene and naphthalene, respectively).",Synergic Effects of Bed Materials and Catalytic Filter Candle for the Conversion of Tar during Biomass Steam Gasification,10.3390/en16020595
3,19138,"Experimental tests were carried out on a bench-scale gasification plant with a catalytic filter candle placed in the freeboard, to study the influence of temperature (1032 up to 1137 K), bed materials (olivine or olivine/dolomite 80/20%), and a nickel-based catalyst.",Synergic Effects of Bed Materials and Catalytic Filter Candle for the Conversion of Tar during Biomass Steam Gasification,10.3390/en16020595
4,19138,"The tests with a ceramic filter candle filled with catalyst and the mixture of olivine and dolomite in the bed gave the best results in terms of gas composition and gas yield, but the tar content was still higher than the limits for the SOFC.",Synergic Effects of Bed Materials and Catalytic Filter Candle for the Conversion of Tar during Biomass Steam Gasification,10.3390/en16020595
5,19138,To increase the residence time of the gas in the catalytic bed a new metallic filter candle was tested.,Synergic Effects of Bed Materials and Catalytic Filter Candle for the Conversion of Tar during Biomass Steam Gasification,10.3390/en16020595
6,19138,"This candle, with almost the same external volume, allowed doubling the amount of catalyst used.",Synergic Effects of Bed Materials and Catalytic Filter Candle for the Conversion of Tar during Biomass Steam Gasification,10.3390/en16020595
7,19138,"Under these conditions, the content of toluene and naphthalene was reduced below 150 and 50 mg/Nm(3), respectively.",Synergic Effects of Bed Materials and Catalytic Filter Candle for the Conversion of Tar during Biomass Steam Gasification,10.3390/en16020595
