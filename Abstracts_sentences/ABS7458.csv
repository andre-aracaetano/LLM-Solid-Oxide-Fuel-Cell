1,7458,Protective coatings for porous alloys for high temperature use are relatively new materials.,Influence of yttria surface modification on high temperature corrosion of porous Ni22Cr alloy,10.1111/ijac.12840
2,7458,Their main drawback is high temperature corrosion.,Influence of yttria surface modification on high temperature corrosion of porous Ni22Cr alloy,10.1111/ijac.12840
3,7458,In this work protective coatings based the on Y-precursor infiltrated into the sintered Ni22Cr alloys are studied at 700 degrees C. Effects of the amount of the protective phase on the resulting corrosion properties are evaluated in air and humidified hydrogen.,Influence of yttria surface modification on high temperature corrosion of porous Ni22Cr alloy,10.1111/ijac.12840
4,7458,"Weight gain of the samples, their open porosities and microstructures are analyzed and compared.",Influence of yttria surface modification on high temperature corrosion of porous Ni22Cr alloy,10.1111/ijac.12840
5,7458,"Results show, that by the addition of even a minor amount of the Y-precursor corrosion rates can be decreased by a factor of 50.",Influence of yttria surface modification on high temperature corrosion of porous Ni22Cr alloy,10.1111/ijac.12840
