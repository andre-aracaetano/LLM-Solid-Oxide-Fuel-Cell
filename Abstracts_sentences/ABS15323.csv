1,15323,"To achieve high performance and carbon-deposition resistance, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a nickel-10 wt% iron alloy support, a 10 wt% gadolinium doped cerium oxide electrolyte (GDC), a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-GDC (LSCF-GDC) cathode, and a Ni-GDC anode with (modified anode cell, MAC) or without (conventional anode cell, CAC) NiMn2O4 modification are prepared and evaluated with H2 and CH 4 fuels.",High performance and carbon-deposition resistance metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a nickel-manganese spinel modified anode,10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100473
2,15323,"During the cell fabrication, the GDC in the anode of MAC is doped by Mn and Fe through reaction with NiMn2O4 and Fe diffusion from the support with increased electrical conductivity and catalytic activity; and the Ni granules in the anode is decorated with fine Mn0 particles, which increases their porosity and resistance to agglomeration and carbon deposition.",High performance and carbon-deposition resistance metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a nickel-manganese spinel modified anode,10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100473
3,15323,"As a result, MAC demonstrates higher performance and durability than CAC, with a maximum power density of 1278 and 1208 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C with H-2 and CH4 as the fuel, respectively, in contrast to 998 and 895 mW cm(-2) for CAC.",High performance and carbon-deposition resistance metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a nickel-manganese spinel modified anode,10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100473
4,15323,"And the cell voltage of MAC fueled by CH4 is maintained on the level of 0.66 V for up to 100 hat 650 degrees C without carbon deposition in the anode, while that of CAC decreases continuously with significant carbon formation.",High performance and carbon-deposition resistance metal-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a nickel-manganese spinel modified anode,10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100473
