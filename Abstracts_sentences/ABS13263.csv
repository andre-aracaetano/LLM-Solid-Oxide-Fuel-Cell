1,13263,"The performance degradation of composite cathodes of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta and Gd-doped ceria (LSCF-GDC), prepared by impregnating the porous GDC scaffold with a nitrate solution containing La, Sr, Co and Fe in desired composition, is investigated at 750 degrees C and open circuit in air for 500 h. The performance of the impregnated LSCF-GDC composite cathodes deteriorates after testing at 750 degrees C for 500 h; the electrode polarization resistance (R-p) increases from 0.38 to 0.83 Omega cm(2), and the electrode ohmic resistance (R-o) increases from 1.79 to 2.14 Omega cm(2).",A stability study of impregnated LSCF-GDC composite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.05.021
