5,4744,"The PrOx-coated LSM-YSZ electrode exhibits an 89% decrease in polarization resistance at 650 degrees C (compared to an untreated electrode), maintaining a tenfold reduction after approximate to 400 h. Transmission line model analysis using impedance spectra confirms how PrOx coating improved the oxygen reduction reaction activity.",Revitalizing Oxygen Reduction Reactivity of Composite Oxide Electrodes via Electrochemically Deposited PrOx Nanocatalysts,10.1002/adma.202307286
