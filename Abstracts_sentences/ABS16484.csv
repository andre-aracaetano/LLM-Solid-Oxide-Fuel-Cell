1,16484,The polarization resistance (R-p) of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes is inversely proportional to the square root of Po-2 or R-p infinity Po-2(-1/2).,Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
2,16484,This Po-2 dependence has usually been explained as being due to the slow diffusion of oxygen adatoms.,Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
3,16484,"In the transient-state analysis approach, the diffusion limitation hypothesis predicts that the rate of the polarization relaxation characterized by the time constant (t(0)) of the decay curves is independent of Po-2.",Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
4,16484,This prediction is also applicable to the relationship between the impedance spectroscopic behavior characterized by the mathematically equivalent omega(max),Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
5,16484,"(=1/t(0)) and Po-2, where omega(max) is the frequency at the top of a corresponding semicircle in the Cole-Cole plots.",Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
6,16484,"In fact, however, t(0) decreases and omega(max) increases with increasing Po-2.",Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
7,16484,"This study attempted to resolve this disagreement based on an inhomogeneous electrode model, which assumed that the electrode is inhomogeneous in terms of the local polarization resistance and therefore the polarization is locally inhomogeneous.",Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
8,16484,"The inhomogeneous electrode model attributed the polarization relaxation to the interfacial current, which passes through the interfacial short circuits formed between the differently polarized local areas.",Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
9,16484,"As Po-2 increased, the potential difference between the local areas became greater.",Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
10,16484,"Thus, the polarization relaxed in a shorter time, resulting in a smaller t(0) value.",Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
11,16484,The experimental observation that t(0) is more dependent on Po-2 as the electrode becomes more inhomogeneous provided a strong argument in favor of the inhomogeneous electrode model.,Polarization Relaxation Originating from Inhomogeneous Polarizations in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cathodes,10.1149/1.3545001
