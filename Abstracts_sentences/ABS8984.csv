1,8984,This work investigates the use of engine-integrated catalytic partial oxidation (CPOx) reactors and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to reduce fuel burn in vehicles with large electrical loads like sensor-laden un-manned air vehicles.,Engine-integrated solid oxide fuel cells for efficient electrical power generation on aircraft,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.108
2,8984,"Thermodynamic models of SOFCs, CPOx reactors, and three gas turbine (GT) engine types (turbojet, combined exhaust turbofan, separate exhaust turbofan) are developed and checked against relevant data and source material.",Engine-integrated solid oxide fuel cells for efficient electrical power generation on aircraft,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.108
3,8984,Fuel efficiency is increased by 4% and 8% in the 50 kW and 90 kW separate exhaust turbofan systems respectively at only modest cost in specific power (8% and 13% reductions respectively).,Engine-integrated solid oxide fuel cells for efficient electrical power generation on aircraft,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.108
4,8984,Similar results are achieved in other engine types.,Engine-integrated solid oxide fuel cells for efficient electrical power generation on aircraft,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.108
5,8984,An additional benefit of hybridization is the ability to provide more electric power (factors of 3 or more in some cases) than generator-based systems before encountering turbine inlet temperature limits.,Engine-integrated solid oxide fuel cells for efficient electrical power generation on aircraft,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.108
6,8984,"A sensitivity analysis shows that the most important parameters affecting the system's performance are operating voltage, percent fuel oxidation, and SOFC assembly air flows.",Engine-integrated solid oxide fuel cells for efficient electrical power generation on aircraft,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.108
7,8984,"Taken together, this study shows that it is possible to create a GT-SOFC hybrid where the GT mitigates balance of plant losses and the SOFC raises overall system efficiency.",Engine-integrated solid oxide fuel cells for efficient electrical power generation on aircraft,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.108
8,8984,The result is a synergistic system with better overall performance than stand-alone components.,Engine-integrated solid oxide fuel cells for efficient electrical power generation on aircraft,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.108
