1,1816,Porous ceramic fiber glass matrix composites with porosities of 19-24% were prepared with mixtures of a glass and short alumino-silicate ceramic fibers for the sealing of solid oxide fuel cells.,Porous ceramic fiber glass matrix composites for solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1016/j.colsurfa.2006.10.001
2,1816,The sealing performance was evaluated by measuring leak rates at the seal operation temperature of 650 degrees C and by investigating adherence at seal-metal interfaces after the seal test.,Porous ceramic fiber glass matrix composites for solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1016/j.colsurfa.2006.10.001
3,1816,Composite seals prepared with 55 vol% glass in the mixture showed a leak rate of similar to 105 sccm/cm and did not adhere to the metal tube.,Porous ceramic fiber glass matrix composites for solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1016/j.colsurfa.2006.10.001
4,1816,Leak rate could be reduced to similar to 0.003 sccm/cm when using composite seals prepared with 65 vol% glass.,Porous ceramic fiber glass matrix composites for solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1016/j.colsurfa.2006.10.001
5,1816,The maximum size of the pores present at the seal interface was estimated from the standard leak rate by assuming a single leak hole.,Porous ceramic fiber glass matrix composites for solid oxide fuel cell seals,10.1016/j.colsurfa.2006.10.001
