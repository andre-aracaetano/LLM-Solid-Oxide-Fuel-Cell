3,11897,"With an insufficient amount of pore former (35 vol.%), the as-sprayed coating surface has a higher surface roughness (R-a = 12-13 mu m).",Plasma-sprayed 3.9YSZ porous coatings with mille-feuille structure and high composite porosity for SOFC applications,10.1016/j.surfcoat.2013.04.019
4,11897,"When a sufficient amount of pore former (50 vol.%) is used, the as-sprayed coating surface roughness (R-a) is 10-11 mu m.
