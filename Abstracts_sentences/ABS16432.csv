1,16432,"Biogas as a renewable energy resource can be broadly recognised as a carbon-neutral fuel which reduces anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, mitigates global warming, and diversifies energy supply.","Advances, challenges, and perspectives of biogas cleaning, upgrading, and utilisation",10.1016/j.fuel.2021.123085
2,16432,"However, the biogas share in the global renewable energy supply chain and technology deployment and maturity are not commensurate with the potential.","Advances, challenges, and perspectives of biogas cleaning, upgrading, and utilisation",10.1016/j.fuel.2021.123085
3,16432,"The first half of this study critically reviews state of the art developments in biogas cleaning and upgrading technologies by considering their present status, current challenges, and barriers associated with their future development.","Advances, challenges, and perspectives of biogas cleaning, upgrading, and utilisation",10.1016/j.fuel.2021.123085
4,16432,"The second part of this paper aims to address critical gaps in con-verting biogas to biomethane, proposing required pre-treatment steps for different technologies.","Advances, challenges, and perspectives of biogas cleaning, upgrading, and utilisation",10.1016/j.fuel.2021.123085
5,16432,The third part focuses on current policies concerning the strict regulations implemented for flaring consent applications.,"Advances, challenges, and perspectives of biogas cleaning, upgrading, and utilisation",10.1016/j.fuel.2021.123085
6,16432,"In this section, biogas upgrading technologies were compared by estimating the global warming potential (GWP) resulting from waste gases (WG).","Advances, challenges, and perspectives of biogas cleaning, upgrading, and utilisation",10.1016/j.fuel.2021.123085
7,16432,"It was observed that due to high methane losses, WGs from membrane tech-nologies have the highest GWP, but with flaring have the lowest GWP.","Advances, challenges, and perspectives of biogas cleaning, upgrading, and utilisation",10.1016/j.fuel.2021.123085
8,16432,"In the last part of this review, the recent applications of biogas in cogeneration (CHP), tri-generation (CCHP), quad-generation systems, heat, and vehicles are discussed.","Advances, challenges, and perspectives of biogas cleaning, upgrading, and utilisation",10.1016/j.fuel.2021.123085
9,16432,"The use of biogas by different technologies, and their resulting efficiencies were analysed in CHP applications, including microturbines, micro humid air turbine (mHAT), solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and hybrid systems of SOFC-microturbines.","Advances, challenges, and perspectives of biogas cleaning, upgrading, and utilisation",10.1016/j.fuel.2021.123085
