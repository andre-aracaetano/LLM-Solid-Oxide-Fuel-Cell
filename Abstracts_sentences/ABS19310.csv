2,19310,"This paper reports on a series of wetting experiments for determination of the interfacial properties of pure Ag and Ag + CuO brazes in contact with the oxides MgO, MgAl2O4, Al2O3 and the mixture MgO + MgAl2O4, as well as with ferritic steel at 1273 K.",Interfacial properties of (Ag plus CuO) brazes used as sealing materials in SOFC stacks,10.1007/s10853-013-7706-x
3,19310,The long-term stability of the ceramic/Ag + CuO/steel joints after exposure for longer periods of time (1000 h) at 1073 K is also assessed.,Interfacial properties of (Ag plus CuO) brazes used as sealing materials in SOFC stacks,10.1007/s10853-013-7706-x
4,19310,The influence on joining of CuO additions in the noble metal was investigated following two different routes.,Interfacial properties of (Ag plus CuO) brazes used as sealing materials in SOFC stacks,10.1007/s10853-013-7706-x
5,19310,"The first one involved melting of Ag + 4wt% CuO brazes on the surface of solid substrates (ceramic, steel), and the second one involved melting of pure Ag on the substrates coated with a thin CuOx layer.",Interfacial properties of (Ag plus CuO) brazes used as sealing materials in SOFC stacks,10.1007/s10853-013-7706-x
6,19310,No differences in the values of the measured contact angles were observed.,Interfacial properties of (Ag plus CuO) brazes used as sealing materials in SOFC stacks,10.1007/s10853-013-7706-x
7,19310,"Furthermore, it was found that the reactions taking place at the interface braze/steel at the initial stage of brazing is extended in the case of Ag + 4 wt% CuO during the long-term exposure at envisaged operating temperature limiting the stability of the joint.",Interfacial properties of (Ag plus CuO) brazes used as sealing materials in SOFC stacks,10.1007/s10853-013-7706-x
