1,15804,The impact of silicon on the long-term stability of the intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell cathode material La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) was investigated during 2400 h at 700 degrees C.,Long-term degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ IT-SOFC cathodes due to silicon poisoning,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.005
2,15804,The area-specific resistance (ASR) of symmetric cells of LSCF on Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95-delta (GDC) was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in ambient air without and with Si contamination of the electrodes.,Long-term degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ IT-SOFC cathodes due to silicon poisoning,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.005

4,15804,"During 1060 h without Si contamination, an increase in the cathode ASR by a factor of 4.5 was observed, which may be attributed to a decrease in the surface oxygen exchange coefficient of LSCF due to changes in the surface elemental composition.",Long-term degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ IT-SOFC cathodes due to silicon poisoning,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.005
5,15804,"Subsequently, 10 nm thick silicon layers were sputtered onto the LSCF electrodes.",Long-term degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ IT-SOFC cathodes due to silicon poisoning,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.005
6,15804,This contamination resulted in a strong increase in the ASR by a factor of 5.9 during additional 1340 h at 700 degrees C. Post-test analyses by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the degradation of the cathode is caused by the phase decomposition of LSCF within an approximately 50 nm thick surface region.,Long-term degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ IT-SOFC cathodes due to silicon poisoning,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.005

8,15804,"In agreement with the changes in the shape of the impedance spectra, it is assumed that this impurity layer leads to limitations in the gas diffusion towards the electrode and/or oxygen adsorption on the surface of the electrode.",Long-term degradation of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ IT-SOFC cathodes due to silicon poisoning,10.1016/j.ssi.2016.01.005
