1,1952,"In this paper, we demonstrate the successful incorporation of sulfate and borate into SrFeO3-delta, and characterise the effect on the structure and conductivity, with a view to possible utilisation as a cathode material in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells.",Investigation into the Effect of Sulfate and Borate Incorporation on the Structure and Properties of SrFeO3-δ,10.3390/cryst7060169
2,1952,The incorporation of low levels of sulfate/borate is sufficient to cause a change from a tetragonal to a cubic cell.,Investigation into the Effect of Sulfate and Borate Incorporation on the Structure and Properties of SrFeO3-δ,10.3390/cryst7060169
3,1952,"Moreover, whereas heat treatment of undoped SrFeO3-delta under N-2 leads to a transformation to brownmillerite Sr2Fe2O5 with oxygen vacancy ordering, the sulfate/borate-doped samples remain cubic under the same conditions.",Investigation into the Effect of Sulfate and Borate Incorporation on the Structure and Properties of SrFeO3-δ,10.3390/cryst7060169
4,1952,"Thus, sulfate/borate doping appears to be successful in introducing oxide ion vacancy disorder in this system.",Investigation into the Effect of Sulfate and Borate Incorporation on the Structure and Properties of SrFeO3-δ,10.3390/cryst7060169
