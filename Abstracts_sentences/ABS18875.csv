1,18875,Metal supported cells as developed according to the DLR SOFC concept by applying plasma deposition technologies were investigated for use as solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOEC) for high temperature steam electrolysis.,High temperature water electrolysis using metal supported solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOEC),10.1007/s10800-008-9672-6
2,18875,"Cells consisting of a porous ferritic steel support, a diffusion barrier layer, a Ni/YSZ hydrogen electrode, a YSZ electrolyte and a LSCF oxygen electrode were electrochemically characterised by means of i-V characteristics and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements including a long-term test over 2000 h.",High temperature water electrolysis using metal supported solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOEC),10.1007/s10800-008-9672-6
3,18875,The cell voltage during electrolysis operation at a current density of -1.0 A cm(-2) was 1.28 V at an operating temperature of 850 A degrees C and 1.4 V at 800 A degrees C. A long-term test run over 2000 h with a steam content of 43% at 800 A degrees C and a current density of -0.3 A cm(-2) showed a degradation rate of 3.2% per 1000 h.,High temperature water electrolysis using metal supported solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOEC),10.1007/s10800-008-9672-6
4,18875,The impedance spectra revealed a significantly enhanced polarisation resistance during electrolysis operation compared to fuel cell operation which was mainly attributed to the hydrogen electrode.,High temperature water electrolysis using metal supported solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOEC),10.1007/s10800-008-9672-6
