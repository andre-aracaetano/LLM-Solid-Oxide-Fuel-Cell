1,9447,"Ruddlesden-Popper LaxSr2-xMnO4-delta materials are interesting symmetric solid oxide fuel cell electrodes due to their good redox stability, mixed ionic and electronic conducting behavior, and thermal expansion that matches well with common electrolytes.",Incommensurate Modulations and Perovskite Growth in La x Sr2-x MnO4-δ Affecting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Conductivity,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03199
2,9447,"In reducing environments-as at a solid oxide fuel cell anode-the x = 0.5 member, i.e., La0.5Sr1.5MnO4-delta, has a much higher total conductivity than compounds with a different La/Sr ratio, although all those compositions have the same K2NiF4-type I4/mmm structure.",Incommensurate Modulations and Perovskite Growth in La x Sr2-x MnO4-δ Affecting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Conductivity,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03199
3,9447,The origin of this conductivity difference is not yet known in the literature.,Incommensurate Modulations and Perovskite Growth in La x Sr2-x MnO4-δ Affecting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Conductivity,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03199
4,9447,"Now, a combination of in situ and ex situ 3D electron diffraction, high-resolution imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy has uncovered clear differences between x = 0.25 and x = 0.5 in the pristine structure, as well as in the transformations upon high-temperature reduction.",Incommensurate Modulations and Perovskite Growth in La x Sr2-x MnO4-δ Affecting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Conductivity,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03199
5,9447,"In La0.5Sr1.5MnO4-delta, Ruddlesden-Popper n = 2 layer defects and an amorphous surface layer are present but not in La0.25Sr1.75MnO4-delta.",Incommensurate Modulations and Perovskite Growth in La x Sr2-x MnO4-δ Affecting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Conductivity,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03199
6,9447,"After annealing at 700 degree celsius in 5% H-2/Ar, La0.25Sr1.75MnO4-delta transforms to a tetragonal 2D incommensurately modulated structure with modulation vectors (q)(1) = 0.2848(1)center dot ( (a)* + (b)* ) and (q)(2) = 0.2848(1)center dot ( (a)* - (b)* ), whereas La(0.5)Sr(1.5)MnO(4-delta )only partially transforms to an orthorhombic 1D incommensurately modulated structure, with (q)= 0.318(2)center dot ( (c)* ).",Incommensurate Modulations and Perovskite Growth in La x Sr2-x MnO4-δ Affecting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Conductivity,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03199
7,9447,"Perovskite domains grow at the crystal edge at 700 degree celsius in 5% H-2 or vacuum due to the higher La concentration on the surface compared to the bulk, which leads to a different thermodynamic equilibrium.",Incommensurate Modulations and Perovskite Growth in La x Sr2-x MnO4-δ Affecting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Conductivity,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03199
8,9447,"Since it is known that a lower degree of oxygen vacancy ordering and a higher amount of perovskite blocks enhance oxygen mobility, those differences in defect structure and structural transformation upon reduction might all contribute to the higher conductivity of La(0.5)Sr(1.5)MnO4-delta in solid oxide fuel cell anode conditions compared to other La/Sr ratios.",Incommensurate Modulations and Perovskite Growth in La x Sr2-x MnO4-δ Affecting Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Conductivity,10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c03199
