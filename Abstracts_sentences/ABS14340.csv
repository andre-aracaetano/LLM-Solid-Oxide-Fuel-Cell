2,14340,The introduction of Mo as a substitution for Co in SrCoO3-delta leads to a change from a hexagonal to a tetragonal perovskite structure at room temperature.,A New Family of Mo-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskites for Application in Reversible Solid State Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/cm300255r
3,14340,The electrical conductivity is largely enhanced by the introduction of Mo at intermediate temperature due to the stabilization of the 3D-perovskite decreases the total conductivity probably due to partial disruption of the electronic pathway.,A New Family of Mo-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskites for Application in Reversible Solid State Electrochemical Cells,10.1021/cm300255r
