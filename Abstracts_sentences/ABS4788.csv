3,4788,This treatment reduces the computational time and cost by avoiding a full three-dimensional simulation while maintaining the ability to solve the flow and pressure fields in the streamwise and spanwise directions.,Numerical simulation of intermediate-temperature direct-internal-reforming planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.energy.2010.03.058
4,4788,"In this model, quasi-three-dimensional multicomponent gas flow fields, the temperature field, and the electric potential/current fields were simultaneously solved.",Numerical simulation of intermediate-temperature direct-internal-reforming planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.energy.2010.03.058
5,4788,"The steam-reforming reaction using methane, the water-gas shift reaction, and the electrochemical reactions of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were taken into account.",Numerical simulation of intermediate-temperature direct-internal-reforming planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.energy.2010.03.058
6,4788,It was found that the endothermic steam-reforming reaction led to a reduction in the local temperature near the inlet and limited the electrochemical reaction rates therein.,Numerical simulation of intermediate-temperature direct-internal-reforming planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.energy.2010.03.058
7,4788,Computational results indicated that the local temperature and current density distributions can be controlled by tuning the pre-reforming rate.,Numerical simulation of intermediate-temperature direct-internal-reforming planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.energy.2010.03.058
8,4788,It was also found that a small amount of heat loss from the sidewall can cause significant nonuniformity in the flow and thermal fields in the spanwise direction.,Numerical simulation of intermediate-temperature direct-internal-reforming planar solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.energy.2010.03.058
