1,11925,"Nano-sized (50 nm) lanthanum strontium manganite (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, LSM) particles are deposited on yttria-stablized zirconia (8YSZ) by synthesizing LSM particles in situ in an YSZ-dispersed solution.",Synthesis and evaluation of nano-size lanthanum strontium manganite-yttria-stablized zirconia composite powders as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.069
2,11925,"As the LSM content is decreased from 80 to 25 wt.%, 50 wt.% powder shows the best microstructure and phase connectivity.",Synthesis and evaluation of nano-size lanthanum strontium manganite-yttria-stablized zirconia composite powders as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.069
3,11925,"This composite, when used as a cathode in a button cell, also has the highest power density of 791 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and the lowest values of the cathode polarization resistance and high-frequency arc (0.315 and 0.120 Omega cm(2), respectively).",Synthesis and evaluation of nano-size lanthanum strontium manganite-yttria-stablized zirconia composite powders as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.069
4,11925,"Initially, the low-frequency arc shows a rapid decrease as the LSM content is reduced from 80 to 60 wt.%.",Synthesis and evaluation of nano-size lanthanum strontium manganite-yttria-stablized zirconia composite powders as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.069
5,11925,"After this, an abrupt drop at 50 wt.% LSM content is followed by a slow decrease in the low-frequency arc with further decrease in the LSM content.",Synthesis and evaluation of nano-size lanthanum strontium manganite-yttria-stablized zirconia composite powders as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.069
6,11925,The results suggest that the high-frequency arc is related to charge transfer and the low-frequency arc to the site density of the triple-phase boundary (TPB).,Synthesis and evaluation of nano-size lanthanum strontium manganite-yttria-stablized zirconia composite powders as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.069
