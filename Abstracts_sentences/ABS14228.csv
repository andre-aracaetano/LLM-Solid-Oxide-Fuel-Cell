1,14228,"To prevent Cr poisoning of the cathode and to retain high conductivity during solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operation, Cu or La doped Co-Mn coatings on a metallic interconnect is deposited and followed by oxidation at 750 degrees C. Microstructure and composition of coatings after preparation and oxidation is analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",Oxidation Characteristics and Electrical Properties of Doped Mn-Co Spinel Reaction Layer for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Metal Interconnects,10.3390/coatings8010042
