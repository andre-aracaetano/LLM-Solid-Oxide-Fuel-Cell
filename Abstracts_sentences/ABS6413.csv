3,6413,"The reactively plasma sprayed deposits displayed large amounts of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 with relatively small amounts of SrO, MnO, and very little carbon.",Development of a cathode layer (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) in a solid oxide fuel cell using a reactive plasma spray,10.1007/BF03027352
4,6413,The degree of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 increased with decreasing feeding rate of the feedstock at 30 kW. A smooth surface and homogeneous pore distribution with pore size of less than 1 mm were obtained at low pressure (0.33 bar).,Development of a cathode layer (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) in a solid oxide fuel cell using a reactive plasma spray,10.1007/BF03027352
