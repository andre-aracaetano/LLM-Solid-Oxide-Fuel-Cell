2,11513,"In particular, interdiffusion at the interface between the cathode and the electrolyte during long-term operation leads to the formation of insulating phases, significantly reducing the cell performance.",A hydrogel-assisted GDC chemical diffusion barrier for durable solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d1ta00507c
3,11513,"In this study, a simple wet chemical coating method was employed to fabricate a thin, dense Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (GDC) diffusion barrier layer between the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8-O3-delta (LSCF) cathode and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte with a gelatin hydrogel-based precursor solution.",A hydrogel-assisted GDC chemical diffusion barrier for durable solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d1ta00507c
4,11513,The fabrication of thin dense film GDC using a simple spin coating method was enabled by the interfacial self-assembly of organic/inorganic composites between the precursor and hydrogel.,A hydrogel-assisted GDC chemical diffusion barrier for durable solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d1ta00507c
5,11513,"The anode-supported single cell with a hydrogel-assisted GDC chemical diffusion barrier layer showed improved electrochemical performance due to fast ionic conduction via short and highly percolated diffusion pathways, maintaining the initial performance after the accelerated heat treatment at 900 degrees C for 100 h by preventing the cation interdiffusion at the interface.",A hydrogel-assisted GDC chemical diffusion barrier for durable solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/d1ta00507c
