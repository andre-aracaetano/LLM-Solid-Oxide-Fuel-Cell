1,11859,"Strontium doped samarium cobaltite (Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta, SSC)-samarium doped ceria (Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta, SDC) composite cathodes were fabricated using the electrostatic slurry spray deposition method for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Optimization of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ composite cathodes fabricated by electrostatic slurry spray deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.070
2,11859,"To optimize the performance of the full cell containing the fabricated composite cathode, the effects of sintering temperature, composite ratio between SSC and SDC components, and film thickness of the composite cathode have been investigated through SEM, EDS and EIS analysis.",Optimization of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ composite cathodes fabricated by electrostatic slurry spray deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.070
3,11859,"As per the results, the best electrochemical performance was obtained from the SSC-SDC composite cathode sintered at 1000 degrees C in the weight ratio of 60:40 and with 20 pm in thickness.",Optimization of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ composite cathodes fabricated by electrostatic slurry spray deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.070
4,11859,The cathode sintered at 1000 degrees C showed better performance than the cell sintered at 900 degrees C due to the well-developed connectivity between the SSC and the SDC particles.,Optimization of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ composite cathodes fabricated by electrostatic slurry spray deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.070
5,11859,"Also, the 60SSC-40SDC composite cathode showed an excellent percolating property and the lowest polarization resistance was obtained from the composite cathode with 20 mu m in thickness due to its well developed microstructure in terms of gas diffusion and TPB area.",Optimization of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ composite cathodes fabricated by electrostatic slurry spray deposition,10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.12.070
