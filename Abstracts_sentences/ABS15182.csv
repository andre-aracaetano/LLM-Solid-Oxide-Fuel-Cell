1,15182,The La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Zr0.92Y0.16O2-delta (LSM-YSZ) composite is the most widely used oxygen electrode for solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs).,Electrochemical performance and stability of SrTi0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3-δ infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Zr0.92Y0.16O2-δ oxygen electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.044
2,15182,"However, operating temperatures > 700 degrees C are required for good performance since oxygen reactions are limitied to three-phase boundaries (TPBs) because of poor ionic conductivity of LSM.",Electrochemical performance and stability of SrTi0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3-δ infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Zr0.92Y0.16O2-δ oxygen electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.044
3,15182,"Furthermore, LSM-YSZ electrodes typically delaminate during electrolysis operation leading to cell degradation.",Electrochemical performance and stability of SrTi0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3-δ infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Zr0.92Y0.16O2-δ oxygen electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.044
4,15182,One strategy to improve SOCs with LSM-YSZ electrodes is to infiltrate a mixed ionically and electronically conducting (MIEC) material that promotes oxygen exchange.,Electrochemical performance and stability of SrTi0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3-δ infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Zr0.92Y0.16O2-δ oxygen electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.044
5,15182,"However, infiltrated materials have a nano-scale structure that may not be stable under SOC operating temperatures.",Electrochemical performance and stability of SrTi0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3-δ infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Zr0.92Y0.16O2-δ oxygen electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.044
6,15182,"Here, we report results on the infiltration of SrTi0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3-delta(STFC), a recently reported high performance MIEC, into LSM-YSZ to improve its electrochemical performance and stability at intermediate temperatures.",Electrochemical performance and stability of SrTi0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3-δ infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Zr0.92Y0.16O2-δ oxygen electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.044
7,15182,"The infiltrated STFC enhances LSM-YSZ and cell performance, typically yielding a decrease in electrode polarization resistance by a factor > 3 times, resulting in an increase in fuel cell maximum power density and electrolysis current density (at 1.3 V) by a factor > 2 times.",Electrochemical performance and stability of SrTi0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3-δ infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Zr0.92Y0.16O2-δ oxygen electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.044
8,15182,"Perhaps more significantly, the infiltrated electrodes show good performance stability, with suppression of electrode delamination during electrolysis and no evidence of coarsening or segregation induced degradation.",Electrochemical performance and stability of SrTi0.3Fe0.6Co0.1O3-δ infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-Zr0.92Y0.16O2-δ oxygen electrodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.04.044
