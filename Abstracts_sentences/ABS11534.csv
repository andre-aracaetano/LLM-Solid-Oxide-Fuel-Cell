1,11534,"The reaction kinetics and mechanisms between 8 mol % yttriastabilized zirconia (YSZ) and 30 mol% Sr-doped lanthanum manganite (La0.65Sr0.30MnO3, LSM) with A-site deficiency for the application of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were investigated.",Reaction kinetics and mechanisms between La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 and 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2004.01110.x
2,11534,The LSM/YSZ green tapes were cofired from 1200 to 1400 degreesC for 1 to 48 h and then annealed at 1000 degreesC for up to 1000 h.,Reaction kinetics and mechanisms between La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 and 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2004.01110.x
3,11534,"The results showed that the diffusion of manganese cations first caused the amorphization of YSZ, and then the formation of small La2Zr2O7 (LZ) or SrZrO3 (SZ) crystals if treated for a longer time at 1400 degreesC. The ambipolar diffusion of the Mn-O pair, transported through the migration of oxygen vacancy, plays an important role in the formation of secondary phases.",Reaction kinetics and mechanisms between La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 and 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2004.01110.x
4,11534,"The diffusion of LSM to YSZ and substitution of Mn for Zr both result in the enhanced concentration of oxygen vacancy, leading to the formation of a void-free zone (VFZ).",Reaction kinetics and mechanisms between La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 and 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2004.01110.x
5,11534,"No additional reaction products in annealed LSM/YSZ specimens, treated at 1000 degreesC for 1000 h, were detected.",Reaction kinetics and mechanisms between La0.65Sr0.3MnO3 and 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2004.01110.x
