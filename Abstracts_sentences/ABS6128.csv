1,6128,The differences in the destruction mode of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) as a result of small and large amounts of oxidation were investigated.,Destruction Modes of Anode-Supported SOFC Caused by Degrees of Electrochemical Oxidation in Redox Cycle,10.1149/1.3328453
2,6128,The cells were oxidized by O(2-) ions and rereduced by H(2) gas (redox cycle).,Destruction Modes of Anode-Supported SOFC Caused by Degrees of Electrochemical Oxidation in Redox Cycle,10.1149/1.3328453
3,6128,"When 0.6% of Ni in the anode was oxidized, its microstructure near the electrolyte changed.",Destruction Modes of Anode-Supported SOFC Caused by Degrees of Electrochemical Oxidation in Redox Cycle,10.1149/1.3328453
4,6128,"Although this microstructural change in the anode by early redox cycles did not cause performance degradation, minor damage accumulated as the redox cycles increased.",Destruction Modes of Anode-Supported SOFC Caused by Degrees of Electrochemical Oxidation in Redox Cycle,10.1149/1.3328453
5,6128,"An increase in the microcracks in the anode led to partial delamination of the electrolyte, which finally resulted in a crack in the electrolyte.",Destruction Modes of Anode-Supported SOFC Caused by Degrees of Electrochemical Oxidation in Redox Cycle,10.1149/1.3328453
6,6128,"In contrast, when 31% of Ni in the anode was oxidized, a crack in the electrolyte was suddenly caused by two redox cycles.",Destruction Modes of Anode-Supported SOFC Caused by Degrees of Electrochemical Oxidation in Redox Cycle,10.1149/1.3328453
7,6128,"Because the electrolyte did not delaminate by a few redox cycles, the anode strain caused the electrolyte to crack, as reported by many researchers.",Destruction Modes of Anode-Supported SOFC Caused by Degrees of Electrochemical Oxidation in Redox Cycle,10.1149/1.3328453
