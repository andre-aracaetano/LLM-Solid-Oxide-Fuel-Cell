1,16605,"The performance of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) made from an yttria stabilized zirconia solid electrolyte with a 25 wt % Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC)-containing Ni anode and a 15 wt % MnO2-containing La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode was found to be significantly enhanced by the deposition of Mn, Ga, CI; Ce, and Lu oxide layers on the YSZ surface.",Improvement of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell and evaluation of new cell designs,10.1149/1.1393359
2,16605,"Ln particular, the deposition of the Mn oxide layer increased the maximum power density from 161 to 213 mW cm(-2) in a mixture of methane and air having a volume ratio of methane to oxygen of 1/1 at a flow rate of 300 mt min(-1) (methane 52 Int min(-1), oxygen 52 mL min(-1), nitrogen 196 mt min(-1)), and at an operating temperature of 950 degrees C.",Improvement of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell and evaluation of new cell designs,10.1149/1.1393359
3,16605,This effect was the result of the promoted anodic and cathodic reactions.,Improvement of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell and evaluation of new cell designs,10.1149/1.1393359
4,16605,Two types of cell designs were examined for the single-chamber SOFC; the two electrodes were deposited on opposite surfaces (A-type cell) and on the same face (B-type cell) of the solid electrolyte.,Improvement of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell and evaluation of new cell designs,10.1149/1.1393359
5,16605,The A-type cell showed an increasing power density with decreasing thickness of the solid electrolyte.,Improvement of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell and evaluation of new cell designs,10.1149/1.1393359
6,16605,The maximum power density was 256 mW cm(-2) at a solid electrolyte thickness of 0.3 mn.,Improvement of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell and evaluation of new cell designs,10.1149/1.1393359
7,16605,The B-type cell showed an increased power density for a decreased gap between the two electrodes.,Improvement of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell and evaluation of new cell designs,10.1149/1.1393359
8,16605,The maxi mum power density was 143 mW cm(-2) for a gap of 0.5 mm between the two electrodes.,Improvement of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell and evaluation of new cell designs,10.1149/1.1393359
9,16605,"In addition, the long-term stability of the single-chamber SOFC was also studied and found to have a direct relationship with the carbon deposition on the GDC-containing Ni electrode.",Improvement of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell and evaluation of new cell designs,10.1149/1.1393359
