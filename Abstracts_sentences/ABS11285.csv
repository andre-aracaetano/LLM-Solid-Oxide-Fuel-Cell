1,11285,The mechanism of MgO inhibiting phase precipitation and phase transformation of BaAl2Si2O8 in MgO-BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic is systematically investigated and analyzed.,Molecular dynamics simulations to structure-properties relationship of MgO-BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.122078
2,11285,"The molecular dynamics simulation results show that the addition of MgO makes the transformation of [BO3] to [BO4], bridge oxygen to non-bridge oxygen, and Qn distribution of [SiO4] tetrahedrons from Q3 to Q1, which is confirmed by infrared and Raman spectroscopy analysis of melt-quenched glass.",Molecular dynamics simulations to structure-properties relationship of MgO-BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.122078
3,11285,"Consequently, the precipitation process of the BaAl2Si2O8 phase is inhibited by the silicate structure transformation from metasilicate (SiO3)2-to pyrosilicate (Si2O7)6-to protosilicate (SiO4)4-, resulting in the BaAl2Si2O8 phase is gradually replaced with MgSiO3, Mg2SiO4, BaMgSiO4, Ba2MgSi2O7 and BaCa2Mg(SiO4)2 phase with increment of the MgO in the MBCASB glass.",Molecular dynamics simulations to structure-properties relationship of MgO-BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.122078
4,11285,It means that the Mg ions are more competitive reacting with silicate structure to form the new crystalline phase than Al and Ba ions.,Molecular dynamics simulations to structure-properties relationship of MgO-BaO-CaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glass-ceramic for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.122078
