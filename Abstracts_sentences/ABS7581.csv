1,7581,"In order to decrease the operating temperature of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) from about 1000 degrees C to around 700 degrees C, the thickness of commonly used electrolytes such as Yttria Stabilised Zirconia (YSZ) must be decreased for about one order of magnitude in the range 1-10 mu m. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of reactive magnetron sputtering for deposition of about 1 mu-thick YSZ films dedicated to SOFC.",Microstructure-electrical properties relationship of YSZ thin films reactively sputter-deposited at different pressures,10.1007/BF02430393
2,7581,The coatings are synthesised by sputtering a metallic Zr-16 at.%Y target in the presence of a reactive argon-oxygen discharge.,Microstructure-electrical properties relationship of YSZ thin films reactively sputter-deposited at different pressures,10.1007/BF02430393
3,7581,The deposition stage is controlled by Optical Transmission Interferometry (OTI) in order to guarantee the film transparency and its thickness.,Microstructure-electrical properties relationship of YSZ thin films reactively sputter-deposited at different pressures,10.1007/BF02430393
4,7581,"The influence of the deposition pressure on the chemical, structural and morphological properties of the coatings is studied in order to establish relationships with their ionic conductivity, determined by impedance spectroscopy.",Microstructure-electrical properties relationship of YSZ thin films reactively sputter-deposited at different pressures,10.1007/BF02430393
