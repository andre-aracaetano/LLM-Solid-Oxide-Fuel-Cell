1,3994,The effects of intermediate nickel layer on seal strength and chemical compatibility of seal glass and interconnect materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were investigated.,Effect of intermediate nickel layer on seal strength and chemical compatibility of glass and ferritic stainless steel in oxidizing environment for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.10.023
2,3994,Two types of samples (metal/glass/metal sandwiches and glass coated metals) were prepared with the sheet of AISI 430 (nickel plated and uncoated) and slurry of compliant silicate sealing glass (SCN-1).,Effect of intermediate nickel layer on seal strength and chemical compatibility of glass and ferritic stainless steel in oxidizing environment for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.10.023
3,3994,The joined and coated samples were heated at 850 degrees C for different time durations (0.5-100 h).,Effect of intermediate nickel layer on seal strength and chemical compatibility of glass and ferritic stainless steel in oxidizing environment for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.10.023
4,3994,Tensile and impact tests were performed and SEM micrographs were used to analyze the glass/metal interaction.,Effect of intermediate nickel layer on seal strength and chemical compatibility of glass and ferritic stainless steel in oxidizing environment for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.10.023
5,3994,The results indicate that nickel plated AISI 430 shows higher adhesion strength at short durations of heating due to dendrite development at the interface.,Effect of intermediate nickel layer on seal strength and chemical compatibility of glass and ferritic stainless steel in oxidizing environment for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.10.023
6,3994,"For longer durations, intermediate nickel layer leads to rapid loss of adhesion strength due to extension of unstable austenite zones but prevents the accelerated weakening near the triple-phase boundaries metal/glass/air (TPB) by compensating for absence of protective oxide layer (Cr-Mn oxide).",Effect of intermediate nickel layer on seal strength and chemical compatibility of glass and ferritic stainless steel in oxidizing environment for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.10.023
