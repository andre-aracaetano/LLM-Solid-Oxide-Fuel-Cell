1,6220,A systematic study was initiated of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with Nd2NiO4 cathodes.,Characterization of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells With Nd2NiO4 Cathodes,10.1115/1.3009267
2,6220,"This type of cathode, a mixed conducting K2NiF4-type material, can be considered as a candidate for SOFC applications.",Characterization of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells With Nd2NiO4 Cathodes,10.1115/1.3009267
3,6220,"In this study, the influence of (1) the presence of a Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (CGO) interlayer between the electrolyte and the cathode, (2) sintering conditions, and (3) the grain size of the powder on the performance of SOFCs with Nd2NiO4 cathodes was investigated in more detail.",Characterization of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells With Nd2NiO4 Cathodes,10.1115/1.3009267
4,6220,Results from current density-voltage characteristics and permeation and gas diffusion measurements showed that the electrochemical performance was promising for SOFCs including a CGO interlayer and a Nd2NiO4 cathode (prepared with a powder with a d(50) of 0.5 A/cm(2) or 0.8 mu m) sintered at 1100 degrees C or higher; current density at 800 degrees C and 700 mV between 1.2 and 1.3 A/cm(2).,Characterization of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells With Nd2NiO4 Cathodes,10.1115/1.3009267
5,6220,The microstructure of the cathode was such that no gas diffusion problems occurred.,Characterization of Anode-Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells With Nd2NiO4 Cathodes,10.1115/1.3009267
