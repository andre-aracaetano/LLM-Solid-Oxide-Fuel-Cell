1,18011,There would be significant advantages to having anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that were capable of directly utilizing hydrocarbon fuels.,Recent progress in SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1039/b702633a
2,18011,"Because conventional Ni-based anodes catalyze the formation of carbon fibers, new anode compositions are required for this application, but most of the materials that have been proposed exhibit either limited thermal stability or poor electrochemical activity.",Recent progress in SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1039/b702633a
3,18011,"In this paper, we will describe two strategies for the development of new anodes with improved performance.",Recent progress in SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1039/b702633a
4,18011,The first strategy involves the use of bimetallic compositions with layered microstructures.,Recent progress in SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1039/b702633a
5,18011,"In the bimetallic anodes, one metal is used for thermal stability while the other provides the required carbon tolerance.",Recent progress in SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1039/b702633a
6,18011,The second strategy involves separating the anode into two layers: a thin functional layer for electrocatalysis and a thicker conduction layer for current collection.,Recent progress in SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1039/b702633a
7,18011,"With this approach, the functional layer can be optimized for catalytic activity and, if it is thin enough, requires minimal conductivity.",Recent progress in SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1039/b702633a
8,18011,Examples are shown for each of these approaches and possible future directions are outlined.,Recent progress in SOFC anodes for direct utilization of hydrocarbons,10.1039/b702633a
