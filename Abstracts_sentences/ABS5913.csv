1,5913,"Micro-solid oxide fuel cells (mu-SOFCs) are fabricated on nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates with a cell structure composed of a 600-nm-thick AAO free-standing membrane embedded on a Si substrate, sputter-deposited Pt electrodes (cathode and anode) and an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD).",High-Performance Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated on Nanoporous Anodic Aluminum Oxide Templates,10.1002/adfm.201002137
2,5913,"Initially, the open circuit voltages (OCVs) of the AAO-supported mu-SOFCs are in the range of 0.05 V to 0.78 V, which is much lower than the ideal value, depending on the average pore size of the AAO template and the thickness of the YSZ electrolyte.",High-Performance Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated on Nanoporous Anodic Aluminum Oxide Templates,10.1002/adfm.201002137
3,5913,Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals the formation of pinholes in the electrolyte layer that originate from the porous nature of the underlying AAO membrane.,High-Performance Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated on Nanoporous Anodic Aluminum Oxide Templates,10.1002/adfm.201002137
4,5913,"In order to clog these pinholes, a 20-nm thick Al2O3 layer is deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on top of the 300-nm thick YSZ layer and another 600-nm thick YSZ layer is deposited after removing the top intermittent Al2O3 layer.",High-Performance Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated on Nanoporous Anodic Aluminum Oxide Templates,10.1002/adfm.201002137
5,5913,"Fuel cell devices fabricated in this way manifest OCVs of 1.02 V, and a maximum power density of 350 mW cm(-2) at 500 degrees C.",High-Performance Micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fabricated on Nanoporous Anodic Aluminum Oxide Templates,10.1002/adfm.201002137
