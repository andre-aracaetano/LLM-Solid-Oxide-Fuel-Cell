1,4222,"Fuel flexibility, which is one of the most important advantages of the solid oxide fuel cell, can be compromised at lower operating temperatures.",Palladium incorporation at the anode of thin-film solid oxide fuel cells and its effect on direct utilization of butane fuel at 600 °C,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.203
2,4222,"Thus in this study, normal butane is selected as the fuel and multiscale-architectured thin-film-based solid oxide fuel cells are operated in direct butane utilization mode at T = 600 degrees C. Palladium (Pd) is chosen as the secondary catalyst to assist the reforming of the butane and is inserted at different positions at the anode.",Palladium incorporation at the anode of thin-film solid oxide fuel cells and its effect on direct utilization of butane fuel at 600 °C,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.203
3,4222,"By combining two different Pd insertion methods, sputtering and infiltration, four different thin-film-based solid oxide fuel cells were prepared: (1) the cell without Pd (Ref-cell); (2) the cell with Pd at the anode functional layer, which was fabricated by alternating sputtered Pd layers with pulsed-laser deposited NiO/yttria-stabilized zirconia layers (Pd-S-cell); (3) the cell with Pd at the anode support, which was fabricated by infiltration (Ref-I-cell); and (4) the cell with Pd at both the anode functional layer and anode support (Pd-S-I-cell).",Palladium incorporation at the anode of thin-film solid oxide fuel cells and its effect on direct utilization of butane fuel at 600 °C,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.203
