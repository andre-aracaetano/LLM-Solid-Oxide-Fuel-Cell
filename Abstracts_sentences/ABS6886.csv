4,6886,"Screen printing was used to apply the Ni-YSZ anode functional layer, 8YSZ electrolyte, 10GDC barrier layer and LSCF cathode.",Near net shape manufacturing of planar anode supported solid oxide fuel cells by using ceramic injection molding and screen printing,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.05.132
5,6886,"An electrochemical test on a 50 x 50 mm(2) cell revealed a maximum power density of 1.25 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. SEM investigations have shown that the injection molded support layer adheres well to the screen printed anode functional layer, and that the anode support layer possesses a homogeneous microstructure.",Near net shape manufacturing of planar anode supported solid oxide fuel cells by using ceramic injection molding and screen printing,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.05.132
