1,6711,A flexible paper-structured catalyst (PSC) that can be applied to the anode of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was examined for its potential to enable direct internal reforming (DIR) operation.,Development of paper-structured catalyst for application to direct internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell fueled by biogas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.134
2,6711,"The catalytic activity of three types of Ni-loaded PSCs: (a) without the dispersion of support oxide particles in the fiber network (PSC-A), (b) with the dispersion of (Mg,Al)O derived from hydrotalcite (PSC-B), and (c) with the dispersion of (Ce,Zr)O2-delta (PSC-C), for dry reforming of CH4 was evaluated at operating temperatures of 650-800 degrees C. Among the PSCs, PSC-C exhibited the highest CH4 conversion with the lowest degradation rate.",Development of paper-structured catalyst for application to direct internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell fueled by biogas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.134
3,6711,The electrochemical performance of an electrolyte-supported cell (ESC) was evaluated under the flow of simulated biogas at 750 degrees C for cases without and with the PSCs on the anode.,Development of paper-structured catalyst for application to direct internal reforming solid oxide fuel cell fueled by biogas,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.134
