2,14702,"The optimized NiO loading in the Ni0-impregnated anode is 40 wt%; and the minimum polarization resistance is 1.40, 0.71 and 0.60 Omega cm(2) at 700, 750 and 800 degrees C, respectively, due to the increased triple phase boundary and conductivity that promote the charge-transfer process of H-2 oxidation reaction.",Improved microstructure and performance of Ni-based anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.060
3,14702,"The conventional Ni-YSZ cermet anode is less sensitive to the current polarization at 200 mA cm(-2); however, its polarization resistance is much higher than those of the impregnated anodes.",Improved microstructure and performance of Ni-based anode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.060
