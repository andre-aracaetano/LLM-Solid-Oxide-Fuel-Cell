1,552,An indirect carbon fuel cell (ICFC) system that couples coal gasification to a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a promising candidate for high efficiency stationary power.,Modeling of indirect carbon fuel cell systems with steam and dry gasification,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.050
2,552,This study couples an equilibrium gasifier model to a detailed 1D MEA model to study the theoretical performance of an ICFC system run on steam or carbon dioxide.,Modeling of indirect carbon fuel cell systems with steam and dry gasification,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.050
3,552,"Results show that the fuel cell in the ICFC system is capable of power densities greater than 1.0 W cm(-2) with H2O recycle, and power densities ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 W cm(-2) with CO2 recycle.",Modeling of indirect carbon fuel cell systems with steam and dry gasification,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.050
4,552,This result indicates that the ICFC system performs better with steam than with CO2 gasification as a result of the faster electro-oxidation kinetics of H-2 relative to CO.,Modeling of indirect carbon fuel cell systems with steam and dry gasification,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.050
5,552,The ICFC system is then shown to reach higher current densities and efficiencies than a thermally decoupled gasifier + fuel cell (G + FC) system because it does not include combustion losses associated with autothermal gasification.,Modeling of indirect carbon fuel cell systems with steam and dry gasification,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.050
6,552,"55-60% efficiency is predicted for the ICFC system coupled to a bottoming cycle, making this technology competitive with other state-of-the-art stationary power candidates.",Modeling of indirect carbon fuel cell systems with steam and dry gasification,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.050
