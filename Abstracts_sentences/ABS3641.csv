1,3641,"For solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to succeed as a next-generation, clean energy conversion device, they must be made to run more efficiently at low temperatures <500 degrees C. To improve electrode kinetics at these lower temperatures, we investigate using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to fabricate mixed electronic-ionic conducting electrodes of (LaxSr1-x)MnO3 (LSM).",Atomic layer deposition of LSM cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.12.100

7,3641,"On fuel cells with LSM as the 95 nm thick, dense cathode, 100 nm thick, dense YSZ as electrolyte, and porous 80 nm thick Pt anode, a peak power density of 0.2 mu W/cm(2) was achieved at 450 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that low oxygen diffusivity in LSM and slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction on LSM were the limiting resistances in the fuel cell, suggesting that LSM is not an optimal low temperature cathode.",Atomic layer deposition of LSM cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.12.100
