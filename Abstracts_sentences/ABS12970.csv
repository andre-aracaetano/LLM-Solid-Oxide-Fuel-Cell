1,12970,"Several low thermal expansion Fe-Co-Ni alloys including HRA 929C, Thermo-Span, EXP 4005 and Three-Phase were evaluated as interconnect for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).",Evaluation of several low thermal expansion Fe-Co-Ni alloys as interconnect for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.026
2,12970,The isothermal oxidation behaviors of the four alloys were determined at 800 degrees C in air corresponding to the SOFC cathode environment.,Evaluation of several low thermal expansion Fe-Co-Ni alloys as interconnect for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.026
3,12970,"The results indicate that the mass gains of HRA 929C and Thermo-Span increased continuously with oxidation time, and were higher than those of EXP 4005 and Three-Phase, both of which exhibited low oxidation rate after the first-week exposure due to the formation of a semi-continuous Al2O3 inner layer.",Evaluation of several low thermal expansion Fe-Co-Ni alloys as interconnect for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.026
4,12970,"Compared to the ferritic alloy Crofer 22 APU, these low thermal expansion alloys exhibited inferior oxidation resistance; however, the area specific resistance (ASR) of the, oxide scales thermally grown on these alloys was lower than that for Crofer 22 APU, as a result of the formation of a highly-conductive, Cr-free surface spinel layer.",Evaluation of several low thermal expansion Fe-Co-Ni alloys as interconnect for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.026
5,12970,The promises and problems of these low thermal expansion alloys were discussed with regard to SOFC interconnect application.,Evaluation of several low thermal expansion Fe-Co-Ni alloys as interconnect for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.08.026
