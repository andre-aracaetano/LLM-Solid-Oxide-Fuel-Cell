1,13086,"Development of chemically stable proton conductors for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) will solve several issues, including cost associated with expensive inter-connectors, and long-term durability.",Chemically Stable Proton Conducting Doped BaCeO3 -No More Fear to SOFC Wastes,10.1038/srep02138
2,13086,"Best known Y-doped BaCeO3 (YBC) proton conductors-based SOFCs suffer from chemical stability under SOFC by-products including CO2 and H2O. Here, for the first time, we report novel perovskite-type Ba(0.5)Sr(0.5)Ce(0.6)Zr(0.2)Gd(0.1)Y(0.1)O(3-delta)d by substituting Sr for Ba and co-substituting Gd +",Chemically Stable Proton Conducting Doped BaCeO3 -No More Fear to SOFC Wastes,10.1038/srep02138
3,13086,"Zr for Ce in YBC that showed excellent chemical stability under SOFC by-products (e. g., CO2 and H2O) and retained a high proton conductivity, key properties which were lacking since the discovery of YBCs.",Chemically Stable Proton Conducting Doped BaCeO3 -No More Fear to SOFC Wastes,10.1038/srep02138
4,13086,In situ and ex- situ powder X-ray diffraction and thermo-gravimetric analysis demonstrate superior structural stability of investigated perovskite under SOFC by-products.,Chemically Stable Proton Conducting Doped BaCeO3 -No More Fear to SOFC Wastes,10.1038/srep02138
5,13086,"The electrical measurements reveal pure proton conductivity, as confirmed by an open circuit potential of 1.15 V for H-2-air cell at 700 degrees C, and merits as electrolyte for H-SOFCs.",Chemically Stable Proton Conducting Doped BaCeO3 -No More Fear to SOFC Wastes,10.1038/srep02138
