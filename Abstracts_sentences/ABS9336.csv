2,9336,Their structures and ionic conductivities were characterized by X-ray diffraction and AC impedance spectroscopy.,Gd3+ and Sm3+ co-doped ceria based electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.elecom.2004.05.017
3,9336,All the electrolytes were found to be ceria based solid solutions of fluorite type structures.,Gd3+ and Sm3+ co-doped ceria based electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.elecom.2004.05.017
4,9336,"However, co-doping effect was observed more apparent for the electrolytes with a = 0.15 than for those with a = 0.2.",Gd3+ and Sm3+ co-doped ceria based electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.elecom.2004.05.017
5,9336,"In comparison to the singly doped ceria, the co-doped ceria Of Ce0.85Gd0.15-ySmyO1.925, wherein 0.05 less than or equal to y less than or equal to 0.1, showed much higher ionic conductivities at 773-973 K. These co-doped ceria are more ideal electrolyte materials of ITSOFCs.",Gd3+ and Sm3+ co-doped ceria based electrolytes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel,10.1016/j.elecom.2004.05.017
