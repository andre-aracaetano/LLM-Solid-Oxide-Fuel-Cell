1,2458,"The coupling of fuel cell technology with wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is within the sustainable development imperative for the integration of energy production purposes and recovery of materials, even if research is still under development in this field.",Biogas Cleaning: Activated Carbon Regeneration for H2S Removal,10.3390/cleantechnol1010004
2,2458,"The anaerobic digestion process can be used for fuel cell feeding, only if trace contaminants are removed continuously.",Biogas Cleaning: Activated Carbon Regeneration for H2S Removal,10.3390/cleantechnol1010004
3,2458,"The most harmful and frequent contaminant is H2S. This article shows the results of H2S adsorption on activated carbon fixed-beds (dry process), since it is one of the best solutions from both the complexity and costs perspectives.",Biogas Cleaning: Activated Carbon Regeneration for H2S Removal,10.3390/cleantechnol1010004
4,2458,"Inside the wide range of commercial activated carbons, a specific commercial carbon has been used in test campaigns, since it is also used in the Societa Metropolitana Acque Torino (SMAT) real plant.",Biogas Cleaning: Activated Carbon Regeneration for H2S Removal,10.3390/cleantechnol1010004
5,2458,"Thermal regeneration of spent carbons was exploited, using different conditions of temperature, treatment time and atmosphere, since it is a better cost-effective and environmentally sound option than immediate carbon disposal after adsorption.",Biogas Cleaning: Activated Carbon Regeneration for H2S Removal,10.3390/cleantechnol1010004
