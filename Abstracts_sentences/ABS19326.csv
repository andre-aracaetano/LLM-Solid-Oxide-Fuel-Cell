1,19326,"The main purpose of this work is to evaluate the different mechanical properties and the different fracture mechanisms activated during the intrumented indentation process of the electrolytes based on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and gadolinia doped ceria (GDC), for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Determination of the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of YSZ and GDC for electrolyte-supported SOFCs by instrumented indentation test,
2,19326,"Both materials, with a thickness of 200 mu m, were shaped by uniaxial pressing at 500 MPa, and sintered at 1400 degrees C. Mechanical properties such as hardness (H) and Young's modulus (E) have been studied at different penetration depths using the Oliver and Pharr equations.",Determination of the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of YSZ and GDC for electrolyte-supported SOFCs by instrumented indentation test,
3,19326,"The different fracture mechanisms activated during the instrumented indentation process have been studied at constant penetration depth of 500 nm, performed with a diamond Berkovich tip indenter.",Determination of the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of YSZ and GDC for electrolyte-supported SOFCs by instrumented indentation test,
4,19326,The residual indentation imprints have been observed with atomic force microscopy (AFM).,Determination of the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of YSZ and GDC for electrolyte-supported SOFCs by instrumented indentation test,
5,19326,"The hardness and Young's modulus for YSZ electrolytes are higher than for GDC materials, due to the different fracture mechanism activated during the indentation process.",Determination of the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of YSZ and GDC for electrolyte-supported SOFCs by instrumented indentation test,
6,19326,"As a result, the electrolytes of YSZ presented trans- and intergranular fracture mechanisms, depending on the place of the residual indentation imprint (in the grain boundary or in the middle of the grain, respectively).",Determination of the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of YSZ and GDC for electrolyte-supported SOFCs by instrumented indentation test,
7,19326,"However, the GDC electrolyte revealed radical cracks at the corners of the residual nanoindentation imprints, thus producing a phenomenon known as chipping.",Determination of the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of YSZ and GDC for electrolyte-supported SOFCs by instrumented indentation test,
