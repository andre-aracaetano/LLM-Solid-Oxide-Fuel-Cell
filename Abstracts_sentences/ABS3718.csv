1,3718,We report the use of a stable isotope oxygen ((18)O) labeling technique for the direct observation of oxygen/oxide ion motion at the cathode/interlayer/electrolyte interfaces in a practical flatten tube solid oxide fuel cells.,Visualization of Oxygen Ionization and Flows in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3489109
2,3718,"The trace of oxygen motion was labeled under a fuel cell reaction (current density of 0.25 A/cm(2) at 650 degrees C), and the (18)O incorporation and diffusion were visualized in a frozen state by secondary-ion mass spectrometry.",Visualization of Oxygen Ionization and Flows in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3489109
3,3718,The active (18)O ionization and incorporation sites were the CeO(2) interlayer between the cathode and the electrolyte.,Visualization of Oxygen Ionization and Flows in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3489109
4,3718,"The higher (18)O concentration through the electrolyte was identified at the bottom of the cell (i.e., higher current density at bottom).",Visualization of Oxygen Ionization and Flows in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3489109
