1,17043,"In the present work, we have explored novel Nd2WO6-type structure Sin(2-x)A(x)M(1-y)B(y)O(6-delta) (A = Ca, Sr; M = Mo, W; B = Ce, Ni) as precursor for the development of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) anodes.","Novel Nd2WO6-type Sm2-xAxM1-yByO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr; M = Mo, W; B = Ce, Ni) mixed conductors",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.06.055
2,17043,The formation of single-phase monoclinic structure was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) for the A- and B-doped Sm2MO6 (SMO).,"Novel Nd2WO6-type Sm2-xAxM1-yByO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr; M = Mo, W; B = Ce, Ni) mixed conductors",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.06.055
3,17043,Samples after AC measurements under wet H-2 up to 850 degrees C changed from Nd2WO6-type structure into Sm2MoO5 due to the reduction of Mo-VI that was confirmed by PXRD and is consistent with literature.,"Novel Nd2WO6-type Sm2-xAxM1-yByO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr; M = Mo, W; B = Ce, Ni) mixed conductors",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.06.055
4,17043,The electrical conductivity was determined using 2-probe AC impedance and DC method and was compared with 4-probe DC method.,"Novel Nd2WO6-type Sm2-xAxM1-yByO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr; M = Mo, W; B = Ce, Ni) mixed conductors",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.06.055
5,17043,The total electrical conductivity obtained from these two different techniques was found to vary within the experimental error over the investigated temperature of 350-650 degrees C. Ionic and electronic conductivity were studied using electron-blocking electrodes technique.,"Novel Nd2WO6-type Sm2-xAxM1-yByO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr; M = Mo, W; B = Ce, Ni) mixed conductors",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.06.055
6,17043,"Among the samples studied, Sm1.8Ca0.2 MoO6-delta exhibits total conductivity of 0.12 S cm(-1) at 550 degrees C in wet H-2 with an activation energy of 0.06 eV. Ca-doped SMO appears to be chemically stable against reaction with YSZ electrolyte at 800 degrees C for 24 h in wet H-2.","Novel Nd2WO6-type Sm2-xAxM1-yByO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr; M = Mo, W; B = Ce, Ni) mixed conductors",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.06.055
7,17043,The ionic transference number (t(i)) of Srn(1.9)Ca(0.1)MoO(6-delta) in wet H-2 at 550 degrees C (pO(2) = 10(-25.5) atm) was found to be about 0.012 after subtraction of electrical lead resistance from the 2-probe AC data and showed predominate electronic conductors.,"Novel Nd2WO6-type Sm2-xAxM1-yByO6-δ (A = Ca, Sr; M = Mo, W; B = Ce, Ni) mixed conductors",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.06.055
