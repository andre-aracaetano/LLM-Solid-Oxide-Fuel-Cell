1,7335,"Strontium-ferrite-based perovskites as cobalt-free cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) have been analysed employing structural, stability and electrochemical studies.","Optimisation of high-performance, cobalt-free SrFe1-xMoxO3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells prepared by spray pyrolysis",10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.121
2,7335,"Neutron diffraction of SrFeO3-delta and SrFe0.9Mo0.1O3-delta prepared by a Pechini method confirmed that SrFeO3-delta undergoes a phase transition from tetragonal to cubic symmetry at 300-400 & DEG;C, whereas Modoping stabilises cubic symmetry in the range RT-90 0 & DEG;C. Spray-pyrolysed electrodes offered significantly lower area-specific resistances of 0.2 and 0.11 omega cm(2) for SrFeO3-delta and SrFe0.9Mo0.1O3-delta at 700 & DEG;C, respectively, in comparison to their analogues synthesised by the Pechini method (0.55 and 0.42 omega cm(2)), and lower grain size, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy.","Optimisation of high-performance, cobalt-free SrFe1-xMoxO3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells prepared by spray pyrolysis",10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.121
3,7335,"Thermal cycling and ageing studies indicated a more robust response for the spray-pyrolysed electrodes, in particular the Mo-doped phase, which achieved a stable electrode-polarisation resistance < 0.1 omega cm(2) for 10 heating/cooling cycles and 100 h of ageing at 700 & DEG;C. Anode-supported single cells with a thin Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta electrolyte produced performances of 0.5 and 0.9 W cm(-2) at 700 and 800 & DEG;C, respectively.","Optimisation of high-performance, cobalt-free SrFe1-xMoxO3-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells prepared by spray pyrolysis",10.1016/j.renene.2021.12.121
