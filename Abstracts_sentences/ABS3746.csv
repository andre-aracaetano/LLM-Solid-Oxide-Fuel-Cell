1,3746,"Electrochemical full cell evaluation of a Versa Power Systems TSC-2 solid oxide fuel cell was conducted in 1 ppmv hydrogen sulfide (H2S) at 750 degrees C with 25%,35% and 50% levels of direct internal reforming (DIR) of methane.",Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the direct internal reforming of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcata.2008.10.055
2,3746,"It is shown that the addition of H2S significantly degrades both the cell voltage as well as the DIR activity of the cell, as evidenced by gas chromatographic analysis of the cell exhaust gas.",Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the direct internal reforming of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcata.2008.10.055

5,3746,"Secondary ion mass spectrometric post-analysis indicated that, while adsorbed sulfur remains on the surface of Ni after recovery for similar to 200 h in H2S-free gas, there remains sufficient active Ni surface area in the anode substrate to continue to catalyze the DIR reactions.",Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the direct internal reforming of methane in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.apcata.2008.10.055
