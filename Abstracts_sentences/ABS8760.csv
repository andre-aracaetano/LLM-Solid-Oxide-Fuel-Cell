4,8760,"This effect was attributed to the creation of additional oxygen vacancies, the suppression of variation in the oxidation states of cobalt and iron, and the suppression of the spin-state transitions of cobalt ions.",Evaluation of A-site cation-deficient (Ba0.5Sr0.5)1-χCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (χ > 0) perovskite as a solid-oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.04.012
5,8760,"The increase in A-site cation deficiency resulted in a steady increase in cathode polarization resistance, because impurities formed at the cathode/electrolyte interface, reducing the electronic conductivity.",Evaluation of A-site cation-deficient (Ba0.5Sr0.5)1-χCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (χ > 0) perovskite as a solid-oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.04.012
6,8760,"A single SOFC equipped with a BS0.97CF cathode exhibited peak power densities of 694 and 893 mWcm(-2) at 600 and 650 degrees C, respectively, and these results were comparable with those obtained with a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta cathode.",Evaluation of A-site cation-deficient (Ba0.5Sr0.5)1-χCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (χ > 0) perovskite as a solid-oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.04.012
