3,18405,"This paper reports a study of the initial 3D microstructure evolution of a SOC analyzed in the pristine state and after 3 and 8 h of annealing at 850 degrees C, in dry hydrogen.",Three dimensional characterization of nickel coarsening in solid oxide cells via ex-situ ptychographic nano-tomography,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.031
4,18405,"The analysis of the evolution of the same location of the electrode shows a substantial change of the nickel and pore network during the first 3 h of treatment, while only negligible changes are observed after 8 h. The nickel coarsening results in loss of connectivity in the nickel network, reduced nickel specific surface area and decreased total triple phase boundary density.",Three dimensional characterization of nickel coarsening in solid oxide cells via ex-situ ptychographic nano-tomography,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.031
5,18405,"For the condition of this experiment, nickel coarsening is shown to be predominantly curvature driven, and changes in the electrode microstructure parameters are discussed in terms of local microstructural evolution.",Three dimensional characterization of nickel coarsening in solid oxide cells via ex-situ ptychographic nano-tomography,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.031
