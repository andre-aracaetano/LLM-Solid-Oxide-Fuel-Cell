2,20265,"Reformate gas, derived from the catalytic partial oxidation or autothermal reforming of heavy fuels such as JP-8, is rich in hydrogen and CO and may also contain up to 500 ppmv H2S. Desulfurization at temperatures in the range of 650-800 degrees C is required before using the fuel gas in solid oxide fuel cells.",Cerium oxide-based sorbents for regenerative hot reformate gas desulfurization,10.1021/ef049664a
