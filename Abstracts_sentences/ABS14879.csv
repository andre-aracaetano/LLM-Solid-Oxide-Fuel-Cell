1,14879,Ability to operate solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) on fuels containing carbon and sulfur with a minimal amount of deactivation is an important technical hurdle.,Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ cermets,10.1016/j.molcata.2007.11.032
2,14879,"For this reason, the influence of H2S upon the activity and stability of Ni-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) cermets was examined for model anode chamber reactions.",Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ cermets,10.1016/j.molcata.2007.11.032
3,14879,"Reactions with H2O (water-gas shift reaction, steam reforming) were more strongly affected by sulfur compared to CO or CH4 oxidation reactions.",Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ cermets,10.1016/j.molcata.2007.11.032
4,14879,"For reactions involving CH4, hydrocarbon decomposition was the dominant reaction pathway at higher temperatures; however, this reaction path was inhibited by sulfur exposure.",Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ cermets,10.1016/j.molcata.2007.11.032
5,14879,Changes in the steam reforming activity of sulfur-treated samples with increasing.,Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ cermets,10.1016/j.molcata.2007.11.032
6,14879,temperature or with high-temperature H-2 treatment suggested sulfur migration to more active sites or surface restructuring.,Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ cermets,10.1016/j.molcata.2007.11.032
7,14879,"Such changes in active sites appear to be accelerated in the presence of H2O. Direct poisoning of YSZ was eliminated since activity differences for the water-gas shift reaction, CH4-H2O reforming, and partial CH4 Oxidation were negligible with and without H2S exposure.",Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ cermets,10.1016/j.molcata.2007.11.032
8,14879,"Reaction results were complemented by X-ray diffraction (XRD), laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) with CO as a probe molecule.",Effect of hydrogen sulfide on the catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ cermets,10.1016/j.molcata.2007.11.032
