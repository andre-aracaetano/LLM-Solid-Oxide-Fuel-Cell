1,8694,A cobalt-free Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3-delta-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (BSF-SDC) composite is employed as a cathode for an anode-supported proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs) using BaZr0.1-Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta (BZCY) as the electrolyte.,A high performance BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based solid oxide fuel cell with a cobalt-free Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ composite cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.084
2,8694,The chemical compatibility between BSF and SDC is evaluated.,A high performance BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based solid oxide fuel cell with a cobalt-free Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ composite cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.084
3,8694,"The XRD results show that BSF is chemically compatible with SDC after co-fired at 1000 degrees C for 6 h. A single cell with a 20-mu m-thick BZCY electrolyte membrane exhibits excellent power densities as high as 792 and 696 mW cm(-2) at 750 and 700 degrees C, respectively.",A high performance BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ-based solid oxide fuel cell with a cobalt-free Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ composite cathode,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.084
