10,17179,"The MKM was constructed at an applied potential of U = 1.5 V with respect to a standard oxygen electrode (SOE) and analyzed at T = 873 K and T = 1073 K. Significant decrease in the H-2 oxidation rates were observed, while CO oxidation rates remained unaffected at the applied potential.","In-silico screening of metal and bimetallic alloy catalysts for SOFC anode at high, intermediate and low temperature operations",10.1016/j.electacta.2018.05.205
