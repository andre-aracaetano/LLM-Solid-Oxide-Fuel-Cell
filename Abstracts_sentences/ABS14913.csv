1,14913,A novel combination of a phase inversion process followed by electrophoretic deposition was used to fabricate anode supported micro-tubular hollow fiber solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Phase Inversion and Electrophoretic Deposition Processes for Fabrication of Micro-Tubular Hollow Fiber SOFCs,10.1149/2.056403jes
2,14913,The phase inversion process was used to produce 240 mu m thick 60 wt% NiO - 40 wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) hollow fiber anode precursors with asymmetric porosity.,Phase Inversion and Electrophoretic Deposition Processes for Fabrication of Micro-Tubular Hollow Fiber SOFCs,10.1149/2.056403jes
3,14913,"Subsequently, electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was used to apply 40 mu m thick, particulate YSZ electrolyte layers onto the un-sintered NiO-YSZ hollow fibers from a YSZ dispersion in ethanol at an applied electric field of ca.",Phase Inversion and Electrophoretic Deposition Processes for Fabrication of Micro-Tubular Hollow Fiber SOFCs,10.1149/2.056403jes

5,14913,The YSZ-coated NiO-YSZ fibers were sintered in a hydrogen atmosphere at 1500 degrees C to produce gastight electrolytes.,Phase Inversion and Electrophoretic Deposition Processes for Fabrication of Micro-Tubular Hollow Fiber SOFCs,10.1149/2.056403jes
6,14913,"Two dispersions of YSZ and lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) particles were then painted consecutively on top of the electrolyte layers, as 'graded' LSM-YSZ vertical bar LSM cathode precursors that were sintered at 1200 degrees C. When fed with H-2 fuel and air, a single such SOFC delivered peak power densities of 0.20, 0.18 and 0.14 W cm(-2) during operation at 800, 750 and 700 degrees C, respectively.",Phase Inversion and Electrophoretic Deposition Processes for Fabrication of Micro-Tubular Hollow Fiber SOFCs,10.1149/2.056403jes
7,14913,"A lumped parameter model, incorporating calculations of the contact, ohmic, activation and concentration polarization losses, is presented and the means are proposed by which certain potential losses may be obviated.",Phase Inversion and Electrophoretic Deposition Processes for Fabrication of Micro-Tubular Hollow Fiber SOFCs,10.1149/2.056403jes
