1,13094,Power generation characteristics and internal reforming characteristics of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a thin scandia-alumina-stabilized zirconia (SASZ) electrolyte and a lanthanum nickel oxide (LNF) cathode were investigated under the condition of low steam/methane ratios or steam/carbon ratios (S/C).,Direct internal reforming characteristics of SOFC with a thin SASZ electrolyte and a LNF cathode,10.1149/1.1646151
2,13094,Exhaust gas flow rate of H-2 and CO increased and the rate of CH4 decreased with increasing current density at S/C = 0.5.,Direct internal reforming characteristics of SOFC with a thin SASZ electrolyte and a LNF cathode,10.1149/1.1646151
3,13094,"The ratio of the gas flow rate increase of H-2 to CO was approximately constant (H-2/CO = 2), and no apparent carbon formation on the surface of anode was observed.",Direct internal reforming characteristics of SOFC with a thin SASZ electrolyte and a LNF cathode,10.1149/1.1646151
4,13094,We calculated the exchange current densities from results of anodic overpotential measurements at S/C = 0.5 and 2.0.,Direct internal reforming characteristics of SOFC with a thin SASZ electrolyte and a LNF cathode,10.1149/1.1646151
5,13094,The exchange current density at S/C = 0.5 differed from the exchange current density at S/C = 2.0 which was similar to the exchange current density in case of using H-2 fuel.,Direct internal reforming characteristics of SOFC with a thin SASZ electrolyte and a LNF cathode,10.1149/1.1646151
6,13094,These results suggest that the electrochemical reaction in anode at S/C = 0.5 involves the partial oxidation of CH4.,Direct internal reforming characteristics of SOFC with a thin SASZ electrolyte and a LNF cathode,10.1149/1.1646151
