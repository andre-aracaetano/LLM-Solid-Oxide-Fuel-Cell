8,10427,"The maximum temperature difference and the maximum temperature gradient on the IIR-SOFC anode are 35.1 % and 307 % less than on the DIR-SOFC anode under the operating condition of 800 degrees C, S/C = 2.5 and 0.6 V. Overall, the Ni-foam-based IIR-SOFC stack can homogenize the cell temperature distribution, and reduce the cell carbon deposition and mechanical failure.",Performance study of solid oxide fuel cell with Ni-foam indirect internal reformer: Intrinsic reforming kinetics and temperature uniformity,10.1016/j.cej.2022.141170
