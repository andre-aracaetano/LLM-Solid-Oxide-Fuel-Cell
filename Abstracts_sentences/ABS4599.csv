2,4599,XRD results demonstrate BCNF is in possession of excellent structure stability in cubic phase.,A cubic BaCo0.8Nb0.1Fe0.1O3-δ ceramic cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.09.006
3,4599,Chemical stability test shows it is also adequately stable against CO2 + H2O at intermediate temperature.,A cubic BaCo0.8Nb0.1Fe0.1O3-δ ceramic cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.09.006
4,4599,"The conductivity of BCNF reaches 10-17 S cm(-1) in air from 700 to 900 degrees C. Besides, the electrode polarization is only 0.1 Omega cm(2) in air which is significantly lower that of La0.5Sr0.5MnO3-delta cathode in the same symmetric cell based on BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta electrolyte at 700 degrees C.",A cubic BaCo0.8Nb0.1Fe0.1O3-δ ceramic cathode for solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.09.006
5,4599,The corresponding fuel cell performance with BCNF cathode based on anode-supported BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta electrolyte with H-2 as fuel and air as oxidizer reaches 413 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C.
