1,19545,"The chemical interaction study of AO-SiO2-B2O3-Y2O3 (A = Ba, Sr) (BaY, SrY) glass with high-temperature electrolyte yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ 8 mol%) is reported as a function of different heat treatment durations.",Interaction Study of Yttria-Based Glasses with High-Temperature Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1002/fuce.201300111
2,19545,The as-prepared glass with 10 mol% of yttria shows limited amount of crystallization at 800 degrees C. Due to this yttria-based glasses BaY and SrY have been chosen to make diffusion couples with high-temperature electrolyte and interconnect material.,Interaction Study of Yttria-Based Glasses with High-Temperature Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1002/fuce.201300111
3,19545,"These diffusion couples have been heat treated at 850 degrees C, for 100, 200, and 500 h.",Interaction Study of Yttria-Based Glasses with High-Temperature Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1002/fuce.201300111
4,19545,"The heat-treated diffusion couples have been characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).",Interaction Study of Yttria-Based Glasses with High-Temperature Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1002/fuce.201300111
5,19545,Microstructural analysis of diffusion couples shows absence of any undesired oxides and detrimental reaction products at the interface.,Interaction Study of Yttria-Based Glasses with High-Temperature Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1002/fuce.201300111
6,19545,"The glass has shown good bonding characteristics and absence of cracks, pores, or any kind of delamination from YSZ.",Interaction Study of Yttria-Based Glasses with High-Temperature Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1002/fuce.201300111
7,19545,"Apart from this, SrY and BaY glass seals have also shown good adhesion characteristics with Crofer 22 APU, even after 500 h at 850 degrees C.",Interaction Study of Yttria-Based Glasses with High-Temperature Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1002/fuce.201300111
8,19545,The morphology and microstructure of the glass matrix suggest limited amount of devitrification in the glass.,Interaction Study of Yttria-Based Glasses with High-Temperature Electrolyte for SOFC,10.1002/fuce.201300111
