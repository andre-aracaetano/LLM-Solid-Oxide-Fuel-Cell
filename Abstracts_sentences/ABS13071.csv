2,13071,The cell open-circuit voltage (OCV) was independent of air flow rate but increased with increasing H2S flow rate.,Influence of gas flow rate on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cells with MoS2-NiS-Ag anode,10.1149/1.1559062
3,13071,A linear relationship existed between OCV and the logarithm of H2S flow rate.,Influence of gas flow rate on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cells with MoS2-NiS-Ag anode,10.1149/1.1559062
4,13071,"Increasing the flow rate increased the exchange rate of reaction products and H2S feed at the anode catalyst, thereby decreasing the local concentration of reaction products and increasing the local concentration of H2S; hence, OCV increased from the Nernst effect.",Influence of gas flow rate on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cells with MoS2-NiS-Ag anode,10.1149/1.1559062
5,13071,The magnitude of the change in OCV with temperature was consistent with calculated values based on reaction equilibria.,Influence of gas flow rate on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cells with MoS2-NiS-Ag anode,10.1149/1.1559062
6,13071,It was found that increasing either or both air flow rate and H2S flow rate improved current-voltage and power density performance.,Influence of gas flow rate on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cells with MoS2-NiS-Ag anode,10.1149/1.1559062
7,13071,"The results were consistent with improved gas diffusion in the cathode with increasing air flow rate, and with both improved gas diffusion in anode and increased concentration of anodic electroactive species with increasing H2S flow rate.",Influence of gas flow rate on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cells with MoS2-NiS-Ag anode,10.1149/1.1559062
