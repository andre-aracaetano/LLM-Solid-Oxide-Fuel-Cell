2,16162,The sulfur tolerance of the various perovskite-based anodes was examined at 1273 K in a H-2/H2O fuel.,Sulfur tolerant anodes for SOFCs,10.1149/1.1627452
3,16162,The Sr0.6La0.4TiO3/YSZ (50/50 wt %) anode showed no degradation in the presence of up to 5000 ppm of H2S in a hydrogen fuel.,Sulfur tolerant anodes for SOFCs,10.1149/1.1627452
4,16162,This anode was also able to operate for 8 h with 1% H2S as a fuel and showed no degradation when the fuel was switched back to hydrogen.,Sulfur tolerant anodes for SOFCs,10.1149/1.1627452
