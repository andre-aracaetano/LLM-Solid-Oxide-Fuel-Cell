3,11719,BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-delta (BCFZY) has been recently reported to show promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity under SOFCs' operating conditions.,Boosting the Activity of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ Perovskite for Oxygen Reduction Reactions at Low-to-Intermediate Temperatures through Tuning B-Site Cation Deficiency,10.1002/aenm.201902384
4,11719,"Here, it is reported that the activity of BCFZY can be further boosted via introducing a slight B-site cation deficiency into the oxide lattice, and such an improvement is assigned to an increase in oxygen mobility that brings enhancement in both surface exchange and bulk diffusion kinetics.",Boosting the Activity of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ Perovskite for Oxygen Reduction Reactions at Low-to-Intermediate Temperatures through Tuning B-Site Cation Deficiency,10.1002/aenm.201902384
5,11719,"Specifically, materials with the nominal composition of Ba(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)(0.975)O-3-(delta) and Ba(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)(0.95)O-3-(delta) show significantly improved activity for ORR at reduced temperatures with the area specific resistances of 0.011 and 0.024 omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C, as a comparison of 0.042 omega cm(2) for the cation stoichiometric BCFZY.",Boosting the Activity of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ Perovskite for Oxygen Reduction Reactions at Low-to-Intermediate Temperatures through Tuning B-Site Cation Deficiency,10.1002/aenm.201902384
6,11719,"Excessive B-site deficiencies, however, lead to the formation of impurity phases, which cause a block for charge transfer and, consequently, a reduction in electrode performance.",Boosting the Activity of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ Perovskite for Oxygen Reduction Reactions at Low-to-Intermediate Temperatures through Tuning B-Site Cation Deficiency,10.1002/aenm.201902384
7,11719,"Introducing a B-site cation deficiency is a promising way to optimize the activity of perovskite oxides for ORR at reduced temperatures, but the degree of deficiency shall be carefully tuned.",Boosting the Activity of BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ Perovskite for Oxygen Reduction Reactions at Low-to-Intermediate Temperatures through Tuning B-Site Cation Deficiency,10.1002/aenm.201902384
