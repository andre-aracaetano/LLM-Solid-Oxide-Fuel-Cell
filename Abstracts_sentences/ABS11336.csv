1,11336,"Power cells, such as battery cells, solar cells, and fuel cells, are often connected in series and parallel to satisfy a desired amount of power and energy density as well as the terminal voltage.",Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
2,11336,"However, it is allowed to compose an array of power cells only when the individual cell has the identical characteristics among each other.",Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
3,11336,"However, even originally identical cells eventually have different characteristics due to uneven aging as well as manufacturing process variations.",Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
4,11336,Mixture use of nonidentical cells in the same array results in: 1) significant inefficiency of the whole array; 2) accelerated aging of the weak cells; and 3) degrading healthy cells due to overloading.,Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
5,11336,This paper is first to introduce a system-level solution for cell aging management.,Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
6,11336,The proposed method is dynamic reconfiguration to modify cell grouping and array structures to enable independent control of aged cells from healthy cells.,Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
7,11336,"The reconfiguration switch network regroups cells into healthy, aged, and residual array groups, regardless of the physical locations of the aged cells.",Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
8,11336,The proposed network is highly scalable in that the number of switches grows linearly as the number of cells increases.,Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
9,11336,We show practicality of the proposed reconfiguration switch network with a case study of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system.,Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
10,11336,"However, the proposed reconfiguration switch network can be applied to any power cell arrays with an aging effect.",Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
11,11336,We demonstrate significant improvement on the operating hours of an SOFC array.,Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
12,11336,Such improvement is comparable with cell-level independent aging control where every SOFC stack has its own dc-ac inverter.,Aging Management Using a Reconfigurable Switch Network for Arrays of Nonideal Power Cells,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2800700
