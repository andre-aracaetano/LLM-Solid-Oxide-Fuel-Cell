1,1957,"In this research, a combined cycle using a solid oxide fuel cell system, a single-stage H2O-NH3 absorption chiller and a residential hot water HX, is developed for the electricity production, hot water and cooling all at the same time, and it is studied from an exergy, energy, and exergoeconomic standpoint.","Exergy-economic assessment of a hybrid power, cooling and heating generation system based on SOFC",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16164
2,1957,Performance of system under the design condition is analyzed and the mathematical model is simulated.,"Exergy-economic assessment of a hybrid power, cooling and heating generation system based on SOFC",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16164
3,1957,"After analyzing the results in the initial input mode, changing the fuel cell current density effect and fuel utilization factor on the system efficiency is evaluated.","Exergy-economic assessment of a hybrid power, cooling and heating generation system based on SOFC",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16164
4,1957,"The result indicates that total energy is 4.418 kW, the total exergy efficiency is 37.8%.","Exergy-economic assessment of a hybrid power, cooling and heating generation system based on SOFC",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16164
5,1957,"And the overall irreversibility is 1.650 kW. On the other hand, the air HX, fuel cell and water HX are designed as elements that must be given more attention than others from the exergoeconomic perspective, because they have nearly the most amount of price compared to other parts.","Exergy-economic assessment of a hybrid power, cooling and heating generation system based on SOFC",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16164
