1,312,"A novel test system based on a thin-walled extruded tubular yttria-stabilised zirconia reactor has been developed, which can be used to investigate the fuel processing catalysis and surface chemistry occurring at nickel/zirconia anodes in solid oxide fuel cells, as well as the durability and electrochemical performance of the fuel cell, under actual operating conditions.",Development of a novel solid oxide fuel cell test system based on a tubular zirconia reactor,10.1080/10420159908245939
2,312,"In addition to enabling different anode formulations to be evaluated for their catalytic activity, electrical performance and durability, and permitting the surface chemistry to be studied, the system allows simultaneous monitoring of the catalytic activity and surface chemistry, and the cell performance, allowing direct correlation between the fuel cell performance and its reforming characteristics.",Development of a novel solid oxide fuel cell test system based on a tubular zirconia reactor,10.1080/10420159908245939
