1,3052,"La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM)-electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)with Cu-CeO2-LSGM anodes were fabricated, and their performance, while operating on H-2 and C4H10, was characterized.",Characterization of Cu-CeO2 direct hydrocarbon anodes in a solid oxide fuel cell with lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.029
2,3052,"The cells demonstrated the ability to directly operate on both hydrogen and butane fuels between 600 and 700 degreesC. At 700 degreesC, a cell with a 440-mum thick electrolyte had maximum power densities of 220 and 115 mW/cm(2) for H-2 and C4H10 fuels, respectively.",Characterization of Cu-CeO2 direct hydrocarbon anodes in a solid oxide fuel cell with lanthanum gallate electrolyte,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.029
