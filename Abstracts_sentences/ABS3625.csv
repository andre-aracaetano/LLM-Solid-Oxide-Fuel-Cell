1,3625,"Synchrotron-based scanning photoelectron microscopy (SPEM) has opened unique opportunities for exploiting processes occurring at surfaces and interfaces, which control the properties of materials for electrochemical devices, where issues of chemical and morphological complexity at microscopic length scales should be faced and understood.",Spatially Resolved XPS Characterization of Electrochemical Surfaces,10.3390/surfaces2020022
2,3625,"The present article aims to demonstrate the present capabilities of SPEM to explore the surface composition of micro- and nano-structured materials, focusing on cases relevant to electrochemical technologies.",Spatially Resolved XPS Characterization of Electrochemical Surfaces,10.3390/surfaces2020022
3,3625,"We report and discuss a selection of recent results about three different systems, targeting hot topics in the fields of electrochemical energy storage and electrochemical fabrication: (i) an in-depth analysis of Ag-In electrodeposited alloys exhibiting dynamic pattern formation, (ii) the analysis of electrochemical processes at the electrodes of a self-driven solid oxide fuel cell and (iii) an operando characterization of a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell.",Spatially Resolved XPS Characterization of Electrochemical Surfaces,10.3390/surfaces2020022
4,3625,"The last example has been performed at near-ambient pressure conditions using a unique specially designed setup which extends the traditional capabilities of scanning photoemission microscopes in the ultra-high and high-vacuum regimes to operating conditions that are closer to realistic ones, contributing to overcome the so-called pressure gap .",Spatially Resolved XPS Characterization of Electrochemical Surfaces,10.3390/surfaces2020022
