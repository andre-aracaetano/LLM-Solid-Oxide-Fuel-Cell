1,9117,Inert-substrate-supported tubular solid oxide fuel cells with multi-functional layers were fabricated in this work.,Cathode Optimization for an Inert-Substrate-Supported Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3389/fenrg.2018.00087
2,9117,"The tubular single cells consisted of a porous yttria-stabilized zirconia inert-substrate supporting layer, a Ni anode current collecting layer, a Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 anode electrochemical layer, an yttria-stabilized zirconia/Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 bi-layer electrolyte, and a La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta cathode.",Cathode Optimization for an Inert-Substrate-Supported Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3389/fenrg.2018.00087
3,9117,Thickness of the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta cathode layer could be varied from 2.5 to 25.0 mu m by controlling the number of dip-coatings in the single cell fabrication process.,Cathode Optimization for an Inert-Substrate-Supported Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3389/fenrg.2018.00087
4,9117,Electrochemical performance of the tubular single cells was investigated as a function of cathode thickness.,Cathode Optimization for an Inert-Substrate-Supported Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3389/fenrg.2018.00087
5,9117,Area specific resistance and maximum power density of the single cell were significantly affected by the thickness of the cathode.,Cathode Optimization for an Inert-Substrate-Supported Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3389/fenrg.2018.00087
6,9117,Increasing the cathode thickness to 15Km was effective in reducing the sheet resistance of the layer and the area specific resistance of the single cell.,Cathode Optimization for an Inert-Substrate-Supported Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3389/fenrg.2018.00087
7,9117,"Further increasing the cathode thickness induced a higher electrode polarization loss, which originated from insufficient gas diffusion and transport processes.",Cathode Optimization for an Inert-Substrate-Supported Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3389/fenrg.2018.00087
8,9117,"Therefore, the optimum thickness of the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta cathode layer was determined to be 15 mu m. At 800 degrees C, the tubular single cell with the optimum cathode thickness displayed the highest observed maximum power density of 559 mWcm(-2) under the hydrogen/air operation mode.",Cathode Optimization for an Inert-Substrate-Supported Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3389/fenrg.2018.00087
9,9117,"Additionally, the tubular single cell exhibited good thermal cycling stability between 800 and 25 degrees C for five cycles.",Cathode Optimization for an Inert-Substrate-Supported Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.3389/fenrg.2018.00087
