1,4698,The microfabrication of Foturan (R) glass ceramic as a potential substrate material for micro-solid oxide fuel cells (micro-SOFC) was investigated.,Processing of Foturan® glass ceramic substrates for micro-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.04.006
2,4698,Foturan (R) was etched in 10% aqueous hydrofluoric (HF) acid solution at 25 degrees C with a linear rate of 22 +/- 1.7 mu m/min to create structures with an aspect ratio of 1:1 in 500 mu m-thick Foturan (R) substrates for micro-SOFCs.,Processing of Foturan® glass ceramic substrates for micro-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.04.006
3,4698,"The concentration of the HF etchant was found to influence the etching rate, whereas the UV-exposure time creating nuclei in the glass for subsequent crystallization of the amorphous Foturan (R) material had no significant influence on the etching rates.",Processing of Foturan® glass ceramic substrates for micro-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.04.006
4,4698,"The surface roughness of the crystallized Foturan (R) was determined by the crystallite size in the order of 10-15 mu m. Free-standing micro-SOFC membranes consisting of a thin film Pt cathode, an yttria-stabilized-zirconia electrolyte and a Pt anode were released by HF etching of the Foturan (R) substrate.",Processing of Foturan® glass ceramic substrates for micro-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.04.006
5,4698,An open-circuit voltage of 0.57 V and a maximum power density of 209 mW/cm(2) at 550 degrees C were achieved.,Processing of Foturan® glass ceramic substrates for micro-solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.04.006
