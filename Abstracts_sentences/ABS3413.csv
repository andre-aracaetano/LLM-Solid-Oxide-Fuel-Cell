1,3413,"The transient performance of microtubular solid oxide fuel cells was investigated, with promising results.",Transient Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003020
2,3413,"It was found that a single cell can take less than half a second to adjust to load changes, even when the change steps across the majority of the cell's range.",Transient Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003020
3,3413,"In addition, no undershooting of the voltage step was seen in these tests.",Transient Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003020
4,3413,"When steps of equal size were ranged across the current-voltage spectrum, more distortion was seen at the higher voltages.",Transient Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003020
5,3413,Cells with cathodes applied by dip-coating (instead of brush-painting) were then dynamically tested in a similar way.,Transient Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003020
6,3413,"Their transient performance was significantly weaker, with visible undershooting and longer re-adjustment times of 10-15 s.",Transient Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003020
7,3413,This is thought to be due to the difference in the microstructure of the cathode layers made by the different coating methods.,Transient Performance of Micro-Tubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1115/1.4003020
