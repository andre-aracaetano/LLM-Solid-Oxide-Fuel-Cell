1,7897,The electrochemical properties of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) have been assessed for its application as a cathode in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Electrochemical characterization of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes for intermediate-temperature SOFCs,10.1149/1.1799391
2,7897,"van der Pauw dc conductivity, two-electrode impedance, and three-electrode measurements were carried out to investigate the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction at various temperatures, oxygen partial pressures, and polarization values.",Electrochemical characterization of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes for intermediate-temperature SOFCs,10.1149/1.1799391
3,7897,A change in cathode behavior at temperatures around 600degreesC was observed.,Electrochemical characterization of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes for intermediate-temperature SOFCs,10.1149/1.1799391
4,7897,"This is interpreted in terms of LSCF behaving as a mixed ionic electronic conductor at temperatures above around 600degreesC, oxygen reduction being stimulated by the formation of oxygen vacancies with increasing cathode overpotential.",Electrochemical characterization of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes for intermediate-temperature SOFCs,10.1149/1.1799391
5,7897,"However, at temperatures below 600degreesC the contribution of mixed conductivity is low, and cathode behavior can then be interpreted in terms of the classical triple-phase-boundary model.",Electrochemical characterization of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 cathodes for intermediate-temperature SOFCs,10.1149/1.1799391
