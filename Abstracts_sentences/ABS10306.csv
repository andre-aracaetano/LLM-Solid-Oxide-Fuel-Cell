7,10306,"In addition, Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 incorporation further improves the thermal compatibility and cell performance, where the measured thermal expansion coefficients between 30 degrees C and 1000 degrees C decrease from 23.3 x 10(-6) K-1 for SYC10 to 19.0 x 10(-6) K-1 for SYC10-40GDC, and the corresponding ASR5 with La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta electrolyte decrease from 0.080 Omega cm(2) to 0.044 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C. Results suggest that SYC10-40GDC is a desirable cathode material for IT-SOFCs.",Synergistic electron doping and ion conductive phase incorporating of SrCoO3-δ as desirable cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.337
