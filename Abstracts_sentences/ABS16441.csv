7,16441,"Furthermore, the high-temperature oxidation resistance of the YSZ/Crofer 22H brazed joints was evaluated at 800 degrees C in the air over 200 h. Even though an increase in the O content of the interfacial products could be detected, the joint still kept structural integrity and remained at 50 MPa, and 32 MPa in the shear test for oxidation times of 50 h and 100 h separately.",Microstructural evolution and high-temperature oxidation resistance of YSZ/Crofer 22H brazed joints using Ag-based filler for solid-oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.matchar.2023.112888
8,16441,"Ag-riched Delimination was found neighboring Crofer 22H due to a large difference in affinity between different elements (Ag, Cr, Al, Ti, Cu, and Fe) and O, and constantly kept the metallurgical bonding between Corfer 22H and brazing seam even the reaction layer continually diffused toward brazing seam for oxidation, indicating an excellent high-temperature oxidation resistance of this vacuum brazed joint.",Microstructural evolution and high-temperature oxidation resistance of YSZ/Crofer 22H brazed joints using Ag-based filler for solid-oxide fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.matchar.2023.112888
