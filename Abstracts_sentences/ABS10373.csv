3,10373,"The investigation shows that the contact resistance of LSM-Pd is about 20 m Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C when the composite contains 8 wt% Pd, and it could be comparable to pure Pt.",Performance of a novel La(Sr)MnO3-Pd composite current collector for solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.099
4,10373,"The ohmic resistance of a single cell using LSM-Pd composite is about 255 m Omega cm(2) that contains 4 wt% Pd as current collector, this value is close to that of a cell using expensive Pt paste as current collector.",Performance of a novel La(Sr)MnO3-Pd composite current collector for solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.12.099
