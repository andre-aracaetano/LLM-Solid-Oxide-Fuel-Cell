2,16743,"Subsequently the powders are reduced by hydrogen at 500, 700 and 900 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the reduction of NiO to Ni at mentioned temperatures.",Structural changes in NiO-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anode under reducing atmosphere,10.1016/j.matchar.2019.02.004
3,16743,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show higher selectivity reaction of NiO to Ni at elevated temperature in hydrogen stream which may trigger the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+.,Structural changes in NiO-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anode under reducing atmosphere,10.1016/j.matchar.2019.02.004
4,16743,Reduction of oxygen lattice as well as increment of Ce3+ in Ce oxide structure in a reducing atmosphere demonstrate formation of higher oxygen vacancies concentration at lower temperatures.,Structural changes in NiO-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-x anode under reducing atmosphere,10.1016/j.matchar.2019.02.004
