1,7978,"In this paper, we reported the fuel cell performance with La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM)/Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) composite cathode prepared from LSM powders of different particle sizes via the silk-printing technique.",LSM particle size effect on the overall performance of IT-SOFC,10.1016/S1002-0721(12)60213-0
2,7978,It was found that the change in particle size of LSM nanoparticle from 40 to 90 nm resulted in an increase in the maximum power density from 132 to 228 mW/cm(2) at 650 degrees C with H-2 as fuel and O-2 as oxidant.,LSM particle size effect on the overall performance of IT-SOFC,10.1016/S1002-0721(12)60213-0
3,7978,And the polarization resistance of the electrode decreased from 2.547 to 1.034 Omega.cm(2).,LSM particle size effect on the overall performance of IT-SOFC,10.1016/S1002-0721(12)60213-0
4,7978,"Concerning the particle size of electrode materials, a higher activity was anticipated with smaller particles because a large number of TPB or electrode surface sites along with a higher porosity could be developed.",LSM particle size effect on the overall performance of IT-SOFC,10.1016/S1002-0721(12)60213-0
5,7978,"However, this study showed that the electrode prepared with particles of larger diameter had fine and uniform microstructure resulting in higher power density and lower overpotential, where homogeneous distribution of particles and pores was beneficial for increasing the electrochemical active area and the electronic conductivity of the electrodes as well as the gas diffusion for the reactants.",LSM particle size effect on the overall performance of IT-SOFC,10.1016/S1002-0721(12)60213-0
