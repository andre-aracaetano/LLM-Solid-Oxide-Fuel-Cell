1,16583,Microstructure evolution and electrical conductivity relaxation kinetics in highly textured and nanocrystalline dense ceria thin films (similar to 65 nm) are reported in this paper.,Microstructural effects on electrical conductivity relaxation in nanoscale ceria thin films,10.1063/1.3126092
2,16583,Highly textured films were grown on sapphire c-plane substrates by molecular beam synthesis (MBS) with orientation relationship (111)CeO2 parallel to(0001)Al2O3 and [1100]CeO2 parallel to[1210]Al2O3.,Microstructural effects on electrical conductivity relaxation in nanoscale ceria thin films,10.1063/1.3126092
3,16583,No significant structural changes were observed in highly textured films even after extensive annealing at high temperature.,Microstructural effects on electrical conductivity relaxation in nanoscale ceria thin films,10.1063/1.3126092
4,16583,"In contrast to MBS grown films, ceria films grown by electron beam evaporation at room temperature had polycrystalline structure with similar to 10 nm grains, which grew to similar to 30 nm upon annealing at 1173 K. Grain growth kinetics was self-limiting and the out-of-plane orientation was found to be substrate dependent.",Microstructural effects on electrical conductivity relaxation in nanoscale ceria thin films,10.1063/1.3126092
5,16583,"From conductivity relaxation measurements, oxygen exchange rate in highly textured thin films was found to be much slower than that in polycrystalline films.",Microstructural effects on electrical conductivity relaxation in nanoscale ceria thin films,10.1063/1.3126092
6,16583,The response time for highly textured films to changes in P(O-2) from 1.07x10(-12) to 5.43x10(-10),Microstructural effects on electrical conductivity relaxation in nanoscale ceria thin films,10.1063/1.3126092
7,16583,"Pa at 1148 K was 0.65 s, whereas that for polycrystalline films was 0.13 s under identical conditions.",Microstructural effects on electrical conductivity relaxation in nanoscale ceria thin films,10.1063/1.3126092
8,16583,"From temperature dependent experiments, activation energy for relaxation time was found to be similar, suggesting similar rate-limiting mechanisms in polycrystalline and highly textured films.",Microstructural effects on electrical conductivity relaxation in nanoscale ceria thin films,10.1063/1.3126092
9,16583,The results highlight the importance of near-surface defects in controlling kinetics of oxygen incorporation into nanostructured oxides.,Microstructural effects on electrical conductivity relaxation in nanoscale ceria thin films,10.1063/1.3126092
10,16583,"In a broader context, the results maybe of relevance to designing catalytic surfaces in solid state ionic devices such as fuel cells.",Microstructural effects on electrical conductivity relaxation in nanoscale ceria thin films,10.1063/1.3126092
