1,2079,"A cobalt-free material, LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3- (LNF), was applied as a potential cathode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using chemically stable BaZr0.8Y0.2O3- (BZY20) electrolyte for the first time.",LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3- as a Promising Cathode for Stable Proton-conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700224
2,2079,"LNF was synthesized, and this material showed a good compatibility with BZY20 at high temperatures.",LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3- as a Promising Cathode for Stable Proton-conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700224
3,2079,"The anode supported BZY20 cell with the LNF cathode was fabricated and tested, which showed a decent cell performance of 217, 107, and 46 mW cm(-2) at 700, 650, and 600 degrees C, respectively.",LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3- as a Promising Cathode for Stable Proton-conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700224
4,2079,This fuel cell performance was significantly higher than that for the cells using cobalt-free cathode and BaZrO3-based electrolyte in literature reports.,LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3- as a Promising Cathode for Stable Proton-conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700224
5,2079,"Furthermore, the polarization resistance of the LNF cathode was restricted to 0.15 cm(2) at 700 degrees C, which was quite small and even can be compared with that for some cobalt-containing cathodes for BaZrO3-based cells.",LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3- as a Promising Cathode for Stable Proton-conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700224
6,2079,"These experimental results indicate LNF could be an alternative and promising cathode for proton-conducting cells with BaZrO3-based ceramic electrolyte, providing an alternative route for choosing and designing their cathode materials.",LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3- as a Promising Cathode for Stable Proton-conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201700224
