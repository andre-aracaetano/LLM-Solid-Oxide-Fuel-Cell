1,17073,"According to the electrode theory widely accepted, the polarization resistance (R-p) of SOFC oxygen electrodes should be independent of the electrolyte resistivity (rho).",Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4
2,17073,"This is a natural consequence from the usual theory, since it assumes that R-p is only determined by the interaction between the electrode and gas phase, However, it has been recently found that R-p increases with rho.",Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4
3,17073,This observation suggests that the R-p-determining factor should involve an electrolyte factor.,Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4
4,17073,This paper is an attempt to explain the R-p vs. rho relationship as being due to the locally variable polarization resistance of the electrode.,Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4

7,17073,"By taking the effect of r(i) into account, it was predicted that R-p increases with increasing r(i).",Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4
8,17073,The validity of the theory was tested by checking whether or not the r(i) increases with increasing rho.,Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4
9,17073,The r(i) was measured by extrapolating the resistance of the electrolyte vs. sample length to zero length.,Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4

11,17073,"To obtain experimental evidence for the locally variable polarization, we measured the decay curves as a function of pO(2).",Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4
12,17073,The slope of the decay curve increases with increasing pO(2) suggesting that there is a local difference of polarization which drives an interfacial ionic current through the short-circuit pathway.,Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4
13,17073,"We also tested this mechanism by an artificial nonuniform electrode which had a substructure consisting of two electrode elements, Ag and Au pastes electrodes.",Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4
14,17073,"A polarization difference between the two electrode elements was found to increase with increasing rho of the electrolyte, as expected from the local current mechanism.",Influence of the local variation of the polarization resistance on SOFC cathodes,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00119-4
