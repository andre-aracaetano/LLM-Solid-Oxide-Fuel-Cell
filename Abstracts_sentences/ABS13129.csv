1,13129,Gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) are well-known electrolyte materials in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Modeling of complex interfaces: Gadolinium-doped ceria in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.14858
2,13129,"Although they can be used independently, it is common to find them in combination in SOFCs, where they are used as protective layers against the formation of secondary phases or electron conduction blockers.",Modeling of complex interfaces: Gadolinium-doped ceria in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.14858
3,13129,"Despite their different optimum operating temperatures, it appears that oxygen conduction is not affected by their interface.",Modeling of complex interfaces: Gadolinium-doped ceria in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.14858
4,13129,"However, the intrinsic mechanisms of oxygen diffusion at these interfaces still remain unclear.",Modeling of complex interfaces: Gadolinium-doped ceria in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.14858
5,13129,"One of the main difficulties when modeling the contact between different materials, or indeed different particles of the same material, is caused by the structural complexity of these systems.",Modeling of complex interfaces: Gadolinium-doped ceria in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.14858
6,13129,"If we wish to evaluate the properties of the materials, we first need to obtain a model that includes the main features of the GDC/YSZ interface, such as large-scale defects or cation interdiffusion in the contiguous phase.",Modeling of complex interfaces: Gadolinium-doped ceria in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.14858
7,13129,"Since the generation of such a mixed system is complicated, we show here how the amorphization and recrystallization strategy can help us to obtain realistic systems.",Modeling of complex interfaces: Gadolinium-doped ceria in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.14858
8,13129,"In this, the first of our papers on the structure and properties of layered GDC/YSZ materials, we discuss the structural features of the grain boundary between GDC and YSZ obtained by molecular dynamics simulations.",Modeling of complex interfaces: Gadolinium-doped ceria in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia,10.1111/jace.14858
