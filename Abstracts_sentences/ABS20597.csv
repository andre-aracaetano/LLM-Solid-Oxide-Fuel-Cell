6,20597,"In addition, it can be found the trends of grain and grain boundary activation energies of Ce1-x(Sm0.5Nd0.5)(x)O-delta are both consistent with those of Ce1-xNdxO delta, but different from those of Ce1-xSmxO delta, which can be explained as: the local ordering of oxygen vacancies maybe occurs more easily in Nd-doped ceria than in Sm-doped ceria: the segregation amount of Sm3+ is more than that of Nd3+ to the grain boundaries in ceria co-doped with Sm3+ and Nd3+, which is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).",Electrical properties of ceria Co-doped with Sm3+ and Nd3+,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.09.001
