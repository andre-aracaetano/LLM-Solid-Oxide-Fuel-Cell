1,15908,"A dynamic solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) model was integrated with other system components (i.e., reformer anodic off-gas burner anodic ejector) to build a system model that can simulate the time response of the anode side of an integrated 250 kW pressurized SOFC hybrid system.",Time characterization of the anodic loop of a pressurized solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1115/1.2772638
2,15908,"After model description and data on previous validation work, this paper describes the results obtained for the dynamic analysis of the anodic loop, taking into account two different conditions for the fuel flow input: in the first case (I), the fuel flow follows with no delay the value provided by the control system, while in the second case (H), the flow is delayed by a volume between the regulating valve and the anode ejector this being a more realistic case.",Time characterization of the anodic loop of a pressurized solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1115/1.2772638
3,15908,The step analysis was used to obtain information about the time scales of the investigated phenomena: such characteristic times were successfully correlated to the results of the subsequent frequency analysis.,Time characterization of the anodic loop of a pressurized solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1115/1.2772638
4,15908,This is expected to provide useful indications for designing robust anodic loop controllers.,Time characterization of the anodic loop of a pressurized solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1115/1.2772638
5,15908,"In the frequency analysis, most phase values remained in the 0-180 deg range, thus showing the expected delay-dominated behavior in the anodic loop response to the input variations in the fuel and current.",Time characterization of the anodic loop of a pressurized solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1115/1.2772638
6,15908,"In Case I, a threshold frequency of 5 Hz for the pressure and steam to carbon ratio and a threshold frequency of 31 Hz for the anodic flow were obtained.",Time characterization of the anodic loop of a pressurized solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1115/1.2772638
7,15908,"In the more realistic Case II, natural gas pipe delay dominates, and a threshold frequency of 1.2 Hz was identified, after which property oscillations start to decrease toward null values.",Time characterization of the anodic loop of a pressurized solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1115/1.2772638
