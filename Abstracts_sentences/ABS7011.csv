1,7011,A novel hybrid compressive mica seal was developed that showed a reduction of leak rate by about 4300 times (compared to simple mica seals) at 800 degreesC. The hybrid compressive mica seal is composed of 2 compliant glass layers and a mica layer.,Ultra-low leak rate of hybrid compressive mica seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00356-7

4,7011,The normalized leak rate for this seal at 800 degreesC was only 1.55 x 10(-4) sccm/cm at a stress of 100 psi and a pressure gradient of 2 psi.,Ultra-low leak rate of hybrid compressive mica seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00356-7
5,7011,"Seals based on the other commercial micas (Muscovite and Phlogopite mica papers), also exhibited superior leak rates (similar to0.011 sccm/cm) compared to simple mica seals without the compliant glass layer (about 6-9 sccm/cm).",Ultra-low leak rate of hybrid compressive mica seals for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00356-7
