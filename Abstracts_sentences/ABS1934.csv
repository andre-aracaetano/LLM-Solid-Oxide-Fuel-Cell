2,1934,"Using a narrowly focused beam from the Advanced Photon Source, such chromium oxide deposits were unequivocally identified in the active region of the cathode by X-ray diffraction, suggesting that the triple phase boundaries were partially blocked.",The Effect of Chromium Oxyhydroxide on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3266930
3,1934,"Under fuel cell operating conditions, the reaction has an equilibrium potential of about 0.9 V and the rate of chromium oxide deposition is therefore dependent on the operating potential of the cell.",The Effect of Chromium Oxyhydroxide on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/1.3266930
