1,5869,"In this paper, we propose an empirical formula for i(0,TPB), the exchange current density per unit triple phase boundary (TPB) length, for porous lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs); the evaluation of i(0,TPB) is of crucial importance in numerical simulations of electrodes based on reconstructed microstructures obtained by a dual beam focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and tomography techniques.",Exchange current model for (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3 (LSM) porous cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.076
2,5869,"To derive a widely applicable empirical formula for i(0,TPB), electrochemical measurements of porous LSM cathodes are conducted under various oxygen partial pressures (0.05-0.25 atm) and temperatures (800-950 degrees C).",Exchange current model for (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3 (LSM) porous cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.076
3,5869,"By comparing the derived formula with that derived from a thin and dense patterned LSM electrode used in previous studies, it is found that at an air temperature of 800 degrees C, imTs derived from a porous LSM cathode is approximately 40% smaller than that for the patterned electrode.",Exchange current model for (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3 (LSM) porous cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.076
4,5869,This can be attributed to the fact that the electrochemical reaction in thin and dense electrodes can occur not only at the TPBs but also at the LSM surface owing to the non-negligible ionic conductivity of LSM.,Exchange current model for (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3 (LSM) porous cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.076
5,5869,The derived formula is also applied to a three-dimensional numerical simulation to confirm its validity.,Exchange current model for (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3 (LSM) porous cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.076
