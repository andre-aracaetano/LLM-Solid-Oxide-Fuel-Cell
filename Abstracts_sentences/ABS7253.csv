1,7253,"Cathodic materials Sm2-xSrNiO4 (0.5 <= x <= 1.0) for an IT-SOFC (intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell) were prepared by the glycine-nitrate process and characterized by XRD, SEM, ac impedance spectroscopy and dc polarization measurements.",Preparation and electrochemical properties of a SM2-xSrxNiO4 cathode for an IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.02.018
2,7253,"The results showed that no reaction occurred between the Sm2-xSrxNiO4 electrode and the Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.9 (CGO) electrolyte at 1100 degrees C, and the electrode formed good contact with the electrolyte after sintering at 1000 degrees C for 2 h. The electrochemical properties of these cathode materials were studied using impedance spectroscopy at various temperatures and oxygen partial pressures.",Preparation and electrochemical properties of a SM2-xSrxNiO4 cathode for an IT-SOFC,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.02.018
