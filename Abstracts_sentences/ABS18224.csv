1,18224,A creep test was performed on yttria-doped ceria (YDC) which was investigated as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).,Oxygen partial pressure dependence of creep on yttria-doped ceria ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.005
2,18224,"The test was performed using a four-point bending method and with testing conditions including a constant load under a temperature range of 1050-1125 degreesC, an applied stress of 20-50 MPa, and an oxygen partial pressure of P(02)=0.21-10(-15.2) atm.",Oxygen partial pressure dependence of creep on yttria-doped ceria ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.005
3,18224,"The results showed that the creep rate increased with decreasing P(O-2), and showed a peak at P(O-2)= 10(-13.6) atm.",Oxygen partial pressure dependence of creep on yttria-doped ceria ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.005
4,18224,The activation energy for creep was increased from 264 to 333 kJ/mol with decreasing P(O-2) from 0.21 to 10(-14.5) atm.,Oxygen partial pressure dependence of creep on yttria-doped ceria ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.005
5,18224,These values were much higher than the reported activation energy of oxygen anion diffusion in ceria.,Oxygen partial pressure dependence of creep on yttria-doped ceria ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.005
6,18224,"Thus, it could be suggested that the creep mechanism is controlled by cation diffusion.",Oxygen partial pressure dependence of creep on yttria-doped ceria ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.005
7,18224,The creep mechanism changed from Nabarro-Herring creep to grain boundary sliding in a reducing atmosphere when the P(O-2) was lower than 10(-14.5) atm.,Oxygen partial pressure dependence of creep on yttria-doped ceria ceramics,10.1016/j.ssi.2004.09.005
