1,4453,This research reports the fabrication of a metal supported fuel cell based on the well-known proton conducting electrolyte (PCE) BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) material.,Development of proton conducting fuel cells using nickel metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226763
2,4453,The impact of the addition of YSZ on the anode microstructure is also described.,Development of proton conducting fuel cells using nickel metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226763
3,4453,"This solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) consists of Ni:yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) support (with different weight ratios of Ni:YSZ), Ni-BZCYYb anode functional layer (AFL), BZCYYb electrolyte and LSCF-BZCYYb cathode.",Development of proton conducting fuel cells using nickel metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226763
4,4453,"The results show that addition of only 10 wt% YSZ to the support improves the microstructure of the cell by preventing severe Ni grain growth inside the support, and providing more accessible triple phase boundaries (TPBs) at the contact surface of the support/AFL and better distribution of the fuel gas to the accessible TPBs.",Development of proton conducting fuel cells using nickel metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226763
5,4453,"As a result of microstructural improvement, polarization resistance of the cells with 10 wt% YSZ decreases compared with the cell having pure Ni metal.",Development of proton conducting fuel cells using nickel metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226763
6,4453,The cell containing YSZ in the support shows 67 h of stable operation under potentiostatic SOFC condition without any degradation.,Development of proton conducting fuel cells using nickel metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226763
7,4453,The current metal supported tubular fuel cell shows promising electrochemical and microstructural features which has the possibility to replace the conventional (Ni-PCE) or even Ni-YSZ anode supports.,Development of proton conducting fuel cells using nickel metal support,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226763
