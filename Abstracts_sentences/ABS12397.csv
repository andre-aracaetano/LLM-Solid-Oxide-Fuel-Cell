1,12397,The chemical diffusion coefficient (D-chem) of epitaxial LSC thin films was measured by a newly designed conductivity relaxation method.,Enhanced oxygen diffusion in epitaxial lanthanum-strontium-cobaltite thin film cathodes for micro solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2ee21647g
2,12397,"D-chem of epitaxial thin films was found to be higher than that of bulk LSC by up to two orders of magnitude, and was found to be enhanced further as the film became thinner.",Enhanced oxygen diffusion in epitaxial lanthanum-strontium-cobaltite thin film cathodes for micro solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c2ee21647g
