4,21145,"The aim of this work was to investigate the possibility of preparing Sr-doped lanthanum manganite with the chemical formula La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 by coprecipitation procedure, and to analyse the observed phase separation.",Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
5,21145,"The material was prepared by coprecipitation procedure in which sources of metal cations (La3+, Sr2+, Mn2+) were dissolved in 0.5 M HNO3.",Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
6,21145,"The nitrate solution was added dropwise in 10 wt% NH4HCO3 solution, both solutions being heated to 65 degrees C. To achieve coprecipitation of all present metal cations, the pH value was maintained at 8 by the addition of aqueous ammonia.",Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
7,21145,The obtained precipitate was filtered and dried to obtain the precursor powder.,Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
8,21145,"One part of the prepared powder was calcined at 1200 degrees C/2 h (sample CL_Sr0.5_p), while the other part was pressed into a tablet and sintered in the same conditions (sample CL_Sr0.5_tab).",Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
9,21145,"Even though FTIR and PXRD analyses of the sample CL_Sr0.5_p (Figs. 1A-C) showed the formation of the pure phase, light and dark spots were observed during the SEM analysis of the tablet (CL_Sr0.5_tab) fracture surface (Fig. 2).",Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
10,21145,These spots were analysed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).,Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
11,21145,"EDS analysis (Table 1) showed that the light spots were SrMnO3 phase, while the dark spots were La0.76Sr0.24MnO3 phase.",Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
12,21145,The tablet was then ground and FTIR and PXRD analyses were conducted.,Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
13,21145,"The obtained FTIR results (Figs. 1A and 1B) showed some bands characteristic for the SrMnO3 phase, and low-intensity maxima originating from the SrMnO3 phase were observed on the diffractogram (Fig. 1C) of CL_Sr0.5_tab sample, confirming the existence of separated phase.",Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
14,21145,"This was additionally investigated by the Rietveld refinement analysis (Table 1), and it was determined that Sr concentration was 0.24 instead of the targeted 0.5.",Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
15,21145,"Therefore, the La0.76Sr0.24MnO3 phase was formed, while the rest of added strontium during the synthesis crystallised in the SrMnO3 phase.",Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
16,21145,"Since successful preparation of La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 by hydrothermal synthesis was reported by multiple authors, it can be concluded that the coprecipitation procedure is not suitable for high concentration doping of LaMnO3 due to the separation of Sr into the secondary phase, especially when in tablet form.",Phase Separation in La0.5Sr0.5MnO3 System,10.15255/KUI.2022.016
