3,15754,The electrical conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the synthesized LCN64 and its chemical compatibility with SUS 430 were also characterized.,LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3-δ as cathode contact material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.052
4,15754,The results indicate that 1:4 is a proper ratio of PVA to metal nitrates for process control and safety management; and calcination of the precursor at temperatures above 650 degrees C leads to formation of single perovskite phase LCN64.,LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3-δ as cathode contact material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.052
5,15754,"The conductivity of fully sintered LCN64 is above 1150 S cm(-1) in the temperature range between 100 degrees C and 800 degrees C, which is higher than those of conventional contact materials La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSM) and LaNiyFe1-yO3 (LNF).",LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3-δ as cathode contact material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.052
6,15754,"The average TEC is 17.22 x 10(-6) K-1 at temperatures below 900 degrees C, which is higher than those of the metallic interconnect and cell components.",LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3-δ as cathode contact material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.052
