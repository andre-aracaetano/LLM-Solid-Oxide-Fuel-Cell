1,1849,"Sc-doped Sr2Fe1.5MO0.5O6-delta (SFMSc) was successfully synthesized by partially substituting Mo in Sr2Fe1.5MO0.5O6-delta (SFM) with Sc, resulting in a higher proton diffusion rate in the resultant SFMSc sample.",Tailoring Sr2Fe1.5MO0.5O6-δ with Sc as a new single-phase cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40843-021-1935-5
2,1849,"Theoretical calculations showed that doping Sc into SFM lowered the oxygen vacancy formation energy, reduced the energy barrier for proton migration in the oxide, and increased the catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction.",Tailoring Sr2Fe1.5MO0.5O6-δ with Sc as a new single-phase cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40843-021-1935-5
3,1849,"Next, a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell (H-SOFC) with a single-phase SFMSc cathode demonstrated significantly higher cell performance than that of cell based on an Sc-free SFM cathode, achieving 1258 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C.",Tailoring Sr2Fe1.5MO0.5O6-δ with Sc as a new single-phase cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40843-021-1935-5
4,1849,The performance also outperformed that of many other H-SOFCs based on single-phase cobalt-free cathodes.,Tailoring Sr2Fe1.5MO0.5O6-δ with Sc as a new single-phase cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40843-021-1935-5
5,1849,"Furthermore, no trade-off between fuel cell performance and material stability was observed.",Tailoring Sr2Fe1.5MO0.5O6-δ with Sc as a new single-phase cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40843-021-1935-5
6,1849,The SFMSc material demonstrated good stability in both the CO2-containing atmosphere and the fuel cell application.,Tailoring Sr2Fe1.5MO0.5O6-δ with Sc as a new single-phase cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40843-021-1935-5
7,1849,The combination of high performance and outstanding stability suggests that SFMSc is an excellent cathode material for H-SOFCs.,Tailoring Sr2Fe1.5MO0.5O6-δ with Sc as a new single-phase cathode for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s40843-021-1935-5
