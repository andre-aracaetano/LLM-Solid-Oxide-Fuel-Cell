1,14466,"Bismuth oxide exhibits extraordinary ionic conductivity and high surface exchange ability, but the low melting temperature and instability in reducing environment limits its wide application in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Significant Promotion Effect of Bi2O3 on the Activity and Stability of Directly Assembled Lanthanum Manganite Based Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1581713jes
2,14466,"Herein, we incorporate yttria-stabilized bismuth oxide (YSB) as a promoter to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of directly assembled La0.76Sr0.19Mn0.95Pt0.05O3+delta (LSMPt) cathodes on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte.",Significant Promotion Effect of Bi2O3 on the Activity and Stability of Directly Assembled Lanthanum Manganite Based Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1581713jes
3,14466,"The presence of YSB enhances the electrocatalytic activity of LSMPt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with significantly reduced activation energy of 127 kJ mol(-1) for ORR, as compared to 171 kJ mol(-1) for the reaction on pristine LSMPt cathode.",Significant Promotion Effect of Bi2O3 on the Activity and Stability of Directly Assembled Lanthanum Manganite Based Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1581713jes
4,14466,"An anode-supported YSZ film cell with the directly assembled LSMPt-YSB electrode exhibits a peak power density of 1.36 and 0.35 W cm(-2) at 750 and 600 degrees C, respectively and is stable with no degradation during the operation for over 200 h. Synchrotron near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) reveal that the excellent performance and stability is owing to in situ formation of ionic conducting Mn-Bi containing particles or phase at the electrode/electrolyte interface under the influence of electrochemical polarization.",Significant Promotion Effect of Bi2O3 on the Activity and Stability of Directly Assembled Lanthanum Manganite Based Cathodes of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1149/2.1581713jes
