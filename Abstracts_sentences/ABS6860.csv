1,6860,"A solid oxide fuel cell was designed to be operated with pure hydrocarbons, without additive or carrier gas, in order to bring technological simplifications, cost reductions and to extend the fuel flexibility limits.",Direct methane solid oxide fuel cell working by gradual internal steam reforming: Analysis of operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.122
2,6860,"The cell was built-up from a conventional cell (LSM/YSZ/Ni-YSZ), to which was added a Ir-CeO(2) catalyst layer at the anode side and an original current collecting system.",Direct methane solid oxide fuel cell working by gradual internal steam reforming: Analysis of operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.122
3,6860,The cell was first operated with steam in gradual internal reforming (GIR) conditions (R = [H(2)O]/[CH(4)] < 1) With carrier gas at the anode.,Direct methane solid oxide fuel cell working by gradual internal steam reforming: Analysis of operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.122

5,6860,The cell was finally operated with pure dry methane at 900 degrees C at 0.6 V yielding current density of about 0.1 A cm(-2) at max power for 120 h. Small but abrupt deterioration of the performances was observed.,Direct methane solid oxide fuel cell working by gradual internal steam reforming: Analysis of operation,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.122
