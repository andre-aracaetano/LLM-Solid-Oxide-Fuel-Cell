1,10592,Gas leakage often occurs in planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks due to small pressure differentials (2-3 psi) between the process flows and external pressure.,Pressurized testing of a planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.058
2,10592,"This gas leakage can initiate localized burning and degradation mechanisms, which result in lower stack efficiency, reduced stack lifetime, and higher overall cost.",Pressurized testing of a planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.058
3,10592,A more durable planar SOFC design that can accommodate higher operating pressure would contribute to higher efficiency and more versatile SOFC system integrations.,Pressurized testing of a planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.058
4,10592,"This manuscript examines the performance of a 60-cell, planar SOFC stack up to 45 psia.",Pressurized testing of a planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.058
5,10592,SOFC stacks can be successfully operated at elevated pressure by containment in a pressure vessel and equalization of the vessel pressure to the process pressure (i.e. anode and cathode gas flows).,Pressurized testing of a planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.058
6,10592,"SOFC stacks display pressure-dependent voltage in accordance with theory, suggesting that an absolute efficiency gain of 2-3% by operating at 45 psia versus ambient pressure (15 psia) is achievable.",Pressurized testing of a planar solid oxide fuel cell stack,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.08.058
