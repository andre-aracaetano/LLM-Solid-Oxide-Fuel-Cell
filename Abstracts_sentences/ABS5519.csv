1,5519,"Anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a trilayered yttria-doped bismuth oxide (YDB), strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM) and lanthanum-doped ceria (LDC) composite electrolyte film are developed.","A novel design of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with Y2O3-doped Bi2O3, LaGaO3 and La-doped CeO2 trilayer electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.039
2,5519,The cell with a YDB (18 mu m)/LSGM (19 mu m)/LDC (13 mu m) composite electrolyte film (designated as cell-A) shows the open-circuit voltages (OCVs) slightly higher than that of a cell with an LSGM (31 mu m)/LDC (17 mu m) electrolyte film (designated as cell-B) in the operating temperature range of 500-700 degrees C.,"A novel design of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with Y2O3-doped Bi2O3, LaGaO3 and La-doped CeO2 trilayer electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.039
3,5519,The cell-A using Ag-YDB composition as cathode exhibits lower polarization resistance and ohmic resistance than those of a cell-B at 700 degrees C.,"A novel design of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with Y2O3-doped Bi2O3, LaGaO3 and La-doped CeO2 trilayer electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.039
4,5519,"The results show that the introduction of YDB to an anode-supported SOFC with a LSGM/LDC composite electrolyte film can effectively block electronic transport through the cell and thus increased the OCVs, and can help the cell to achieve higher power output.","A novel design of anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with Y2O3-doped Bi2O3, LaGaO3 and La-doped CeO2 trilayer electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.039
