1,11635,"In order to enhance the catalytic activity of the cathode for oxygen reduction and thus to increase the electrochemical performance of planar anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells, Pd, Ag, or Pt was added to the cathode.",The influence of noble-metal-containing cathodes on the electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.046
2,11635,"Four routes were used to add these noble metals: infiltration of the cathode with a Pd solution, deposition of Pt on the electrolyte surface, mixing of La0.65Sr0.30MnO3 (LSM) and YSZ cathode powders with different metal precursors (Pt and Pd black, Pd on activated carbon, Ag powder, Ag2O, Ag acetate, Ag citrate, Ag2CO3, colloidal Ag, AgNO3), and synthesis of LSM powder with the addition of AgNO3.",The influence of noble-metal-containing cathodes on the electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.046
3,11635,"Between 750 and 900 degreesC no electrocatalytic effect occurred with respect to the presence of Pt, either added by deposition on the electrolyte or by mixing with cathode powders.",The influence of noble-metal-containing cathodes on the electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.046
