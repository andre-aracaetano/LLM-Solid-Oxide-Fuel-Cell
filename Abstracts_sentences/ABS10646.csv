2,10646,"This research applies the design of electrode support (anode support) to substitute the original electrolyte support, Yttria-stabilized zirconia, so that the electrolyte membrane could form a membrane to reduce ohmic resistance and increase power density.",Characteristic simulation with various anode support thicknesses of membrane electrode assembly in SOFC,10.1007/s10008-011-1328-5
3,10646,This study further discusses the effects of various flow fields (counterflow and co-flow) on internal mass transfer and SOFC performance.,Characteristic simulation with various anode support thicknesses of membrane electrode assembly in SOFC,10.1007/s10008-011-1328-5
4,10646,"The findings show that the cell performance of SOFC with co-flow is better than counterpart with counterflow under anode support thickness 1,000 mu m. Regarding the analyses of porosity effect with the porosity 0.7 and tortuosity 4.5, the power density reaches the maximum that could enhance the cell performance.",Characteristic simulation with various anode support thicknesses of membrane electrode assembly in SOFC,10.1007/s10008-011-1328-5
