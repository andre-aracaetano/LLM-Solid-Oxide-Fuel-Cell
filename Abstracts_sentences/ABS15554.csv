1,15554,"Strontium doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) powders were synthesized by three different routes: azeotropic distillation, sol-gel and solid state reaction respectively.",Preparation and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode for SOFCs fabricated using azeotropic distillation method,
2,15554,"The LSM samples, made by azeotropic distillation and sol-gel methods were prepared by firing at 1000 degrees C for 6 h, and the LSM sample, made by solid state reaction method was produced by sintering at 1400 degrees C for 18 h.",Preparation and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode for SOFCs fabricated using azeotropic distillation method,
3,15554,"The samples were characterized by XRD, TEC, SEM, EIS and polarization performance analysis.",Preparation and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode for SOFCs fabricated using azeotropic distillation method,
4,15554,"The results show that all the samples made by different methods have pure orthorhombic LSM phase, however exhibit different micro structure and electrochemical characterization, which relates to the different synthesis methods.",Preparation and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode for SOFCs fabricated using azeotropic distillation method,
5,15554,The solid state reaction method produces the samples with larger particle size compared with azeotropic distillation and sol-gel methods.,Preparation and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode for SOFCs fabricated using azeotropic distillation method,
6,15554,The powders made by azeotropic distillation method have less agglomerated particles compared with that made by sol-gel method because the precursor in the former is dispersed in n-butanol before sintering.,Preparation and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode for SOFCs fabricated using azeotropic distillation method,
7,15554,The polarization current density of powder made by azeotropic distillation method was twice of that made by sol-gel method and four times of that made by solid state reaction method.,Preparation and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode for SOFCs fabricated using azeotropic distillation method,
8,15554,"The values of polarization resistance (R-p) are 0.35 Omega center dot cm(2) for the cathode synthesized by azeotropic distillation route, which is much lower than sol-gel (1.5 Omega center dot cm(2)) and solid state reaction (2.3 Omega center dot cm(2)) at 800 degrees C.",Preparation and characterization of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ cathode for SOFCs fabricated using azeotropic distillation method,
