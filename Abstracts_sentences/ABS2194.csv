1,2194,Dry reforming of methane (CH4 + CO2 = 2CO + 2H(2)) is a very interesting approach both to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the increasing worldwide fossil-based methane consumption as well as to cut emission greenhouse gas of CO2.,Enhanced stability of a direct-methane and carbon dioxide protonic ceramic fuel cell with a PrCrO3 based reforming layer,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.05.057
2,2194,Utilizing the produced syngas as fuel directly in protonic ceramic fuel cell can further kill two birds with one stone: obtain power output and high purity CO.,Enhanced stability of a direct-methane and carbon dioxide protonic ceramic fuel cell with a PrCrO3 based reforming layer,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.05.057
3,2194,"However, the drawback of the coking deposition limits the process of the above strategy.",Enhanced stability of a direct-methane and carbon dioxide protonic ceramic fuel cell with a PrCrO3 based reforming layer,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.05.057
4,2194,"Here, we synthesis a Ni-based catalyst with high conversion rates (similar to 88% for CO2 and similar to 89% for CH4) and excellent stability (>160 h at 700 degrees C) proceeded by Ce doping, and further employ it as reforming layer on solid oxide fuel cell.",Enhanced stability of a direct-methane and carbon dioxide protonic ceramic fuel cell with a PrCrO3 based reforming layer,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.05.057
5,2194,"The results demonstrate that the Ce substitution plays an important role for homogenous Ni nanoparticles exsolution, benefiting for the coking resistance of the catalyst then the stability of the cell using CH4 and CO2 as fuel directly.",Enhanced stability of a direct-methane and carbon dioxide protonic ceramic fuel cell with a PrCrO3 based reforming layer,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.05.057
