1,3403,"Performance of a Pt based anode solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) fed with a gas mixture containing H-2, CO and CH4 (molar ratio 1: 1: 1) produced by external ethanol decomposition was studied, Experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range 660-800 degreesC and anode potential vs. air -0.78 to -0.23 V It was shown that at low temperature (660 degreesC) the outlet gas contained the products of complete oxidation of the gas mixture, while high temperature (800 degreesC) facilitated synthesis gas production.",Performance of a SOFC fed by ethanol reforming products,10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00361-2
