1,3316,"To reduce the fabrication cost and avoid unfavorable reactions between components of solid oxide fuel cells, it is necessary to improve the sinterability of the electrolyte materials, especially doped ceria for intermediate-temperature operation.","High-performance, ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells fabricated at low temperatures",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.04.130
2,3316,"Here we report a unique process for fabrication of single cells at a co-sintering temperature as low as 1150 degrees C using highly active SDC powders derived from a glycine-nitrate process, demonstrating higher cell performance than those co-sintered at higher temperatures while maintaining adequate long-term stability.","High-performance, ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells fabricated at low temperatures",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.04.130
3,3316,"In particular, it is found that the electrode polarization at high current densities is significantly suppressed when operated at 650 degrees C. (C) 2013","High-performance, ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells fabricated at low temperatures",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.04.130
