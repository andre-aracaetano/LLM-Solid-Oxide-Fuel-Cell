4,13011,"Model results show that electrolyte internal stress can be significantly reduced (from 367 MPa to 135 MPa, when the oxidation degree is 60%), and the electrolyte can remain intact even when the oxidation degree reaches about 70%, if the anode was re-oxidized uniformly.",Effect of inhomogeneous re-oxidation on Ni-based SOFC oxidation resistance,10.1142/S0217979216502003
