4,18768,"It has been confirmed that the introduction of an A-site deficiency effectively improves the concentration of oxygen vacancies, which promotes the surface exchange of oxygen and accelerates the oxygen reduction reaction.",A-Site Deficiency Ba0.9La0.1Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite as Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Electrode for High-Temperature H2O Electrolysis,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02739
5,18768,"In addition, after introducing the deficiency, the polarization impedance (R-p) of the BL95CFN oxygen electrode decreased from 0.162 to 0.087 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Furthermore, under a 50% H2O atmosphere at 800 degrees C, the current density of BL95CFN reached 1.860 A cm(-2) when the voltage reached 1.75 V, much higher than that of BL100CFN (1.428 A cm(-2)).",A-Site Deficiency Ba0.9La0.1Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite as Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Electrode for High-Temperature H2O Electrolysis,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02739
6,18768,"Moreover, the A-site deficient BL95CFN demonstrated excellent performance in both short- and long-term stability, making it a promising candidate for application as a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) oxygen electrode material.",A-Site Deficiency Ba0.9La0.1Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-δ Perovskite as Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Electrode for High-Temperature H2O Electrolysis,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c02739
