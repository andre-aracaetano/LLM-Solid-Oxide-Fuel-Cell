6,14297,"However the formation of oxygen vacancies has no contribution to electrical conductivity, the compensation mechanism is dominated by the electrical compensation, i.e. the take place a transition of Cr3+ --> Cr4+ rather than that of ionic compensation, i.e. the formation of oxygen vacancies.",Electrical conduction behaviors of isovalent and acceptor dopants on B site of (La0.8Ca0.2)CrO3-δ perovskites,10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.02.028
