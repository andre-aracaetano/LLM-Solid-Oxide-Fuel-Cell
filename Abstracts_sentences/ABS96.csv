1,96,Microreactors are composed of channels with a dimension of 1-1000 mum in width and depth.,Simulation of membrane microreactor for fuel cell with methane feed,10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00236-0
2,96,"Three types of membrane microreactors for production of electric power by fuel cells with methane feed, i.e. (1) Pd membrane microreactor (Pd-MMR) followed by polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), (2) oxide-ion conducting solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and (3) proton conducting solid oxide fuel cell (H+-SOFC) were simulated and compared.",Simulation of membrane microreactor for fuel cell with methane feed,10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00236-0
3,96,The Pd-MMR followed by PEFC was the most effective system for electric power generation compared with the other two types of SOFC although the system was rather complex.,Simulation of membrane microreactor for fuel cell with methane feed,10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00236-0
4,96,"However, the performances were dependent on the permeation properties of membranes (Pd, YSZ, perovskite) as well as kinetics of catalysts.",Simulation of membrane microreactor for fuel cell with methane feed,10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00236-0
