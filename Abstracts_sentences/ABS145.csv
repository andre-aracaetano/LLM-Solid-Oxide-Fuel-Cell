2,145,"The obtained LMO can be used for both anode and cathode in a three-layer fuel cell, but displays low electro-catalytic activity and power output.",A commercial lithium battery LiMn-oxide for fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.matlet.2014.04.011
3,145,"Using a nanocomposite approach we have significantly improved the cell performance from tens mW cm(-2) up to 210 mW cm(-2), which is technically useful for low temperature (bellow 600 degrees C) ceramic fuel cells.",A commercial lithium battery LiMn-oxide for fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.matlet.2014.04.011
4,145,We also constructed single-layer fuel cell using the LMO/SDC-metal oxide composite and achieved even better performances than those for conventional anode-electrolyte-cathode three-layer fuel cells.,A commercial lithium battery LiMn-oxide for fuel cell applications,10.1016/j.matlet.2014.04.011
