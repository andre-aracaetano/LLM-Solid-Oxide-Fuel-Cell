3,19283,The effects of CuO content and brazing temperature on the interfacial microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints were studied in detail.,Reactive air brazing of 3YSZ ceramic to aluminized Crofer22H stainless steel using Ag-CuO fillers,10.1111/ijac.14035
4,19283,The results indicated that maintaining a continuous Al2O3 layer was the prerequisite for achieving a reliable joint.,Reactive air brazing of 3YSZ ceramic to aluminized Crofer22H stainless steel using Ag-CuO fillers,10.1111/ijac.14035
5,19283,"And the interfacial reaction gradually became intense with the increase of CuO content, and the continuity of the Al2O3 layer was disrupted as it was increased to 6 mol%.",Reactive air brazing of 3YSZ ceramic to aluminized Crofer22H stainless steel using Ag-CuO fillers,10.1111/ijac.14035
