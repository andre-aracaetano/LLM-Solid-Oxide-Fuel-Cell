3,10702,Durability experiments were carried out at 800 degrees C up to 1000 h with various water vapor containing-air fed to the cathode side.,Influence of water vapor on long-term performance and accelerated degradation of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.014
4,10702,Both types of cathode materials were basically stable under typical water vapor concentrations in the ambient air.,Influence of water vapor on long-term performance and accelerated degradation of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.014
5,10702,"Degradations could be accelerated at much higher water vapor concentrations, which could be associated with the decomposition of the cathode materials.",Influence of water vapor on long-term performance and accelerated degradation of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.014
6,10702,"Temperature dependence of this degradation was analyzed between 700 degrees C and 900 degrees C under 10 vol% water vapor concentration, which showed that the effect of water vapor depends strongly on the temperature and led to a severe degradation at 700 degrees C within a short time period for both cathode materials.",Influence of water vapor on long-term performance and accelerated degradation of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.014
