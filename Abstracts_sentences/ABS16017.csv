1,16017,Infiltration of electrocatalyst precursor solutions into previously sintered porous ionic conductor scaffolds has been used recently as an alternative method to the conventional co-sintering route to fabricate electrocatalyst-ionic conductor composites for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode applications.,Electrochemical performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite SOFC cathodes fabricated by electrocatalyst and/or electrocatalyst-ionic conductor infiltration,10.1007/s10971-019-05073-5
2,16017,"However, the aqueous nitrate solutions generally used to perform the infiltration process results in electrocatalyst precipitates that are disconnected from each other, yielding poor electrode performance.",Electrochemical performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite SOFC cathodes fabricated by electrocatalyst and/or electrocatalyst-ionic conductor infiltration,10.1007/s10971-019-05073-5
3,16017,"In this work, polymeric electrocatalyst (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-LSCF) precursors that produce interconnected thin films upon heat treatment were used to infiltrate porous ionic conductor Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (GDC) scaffolds to overcome these issues.",Electrochemical performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite SOFC cathodes fabricated by electrocatalyst and/or electrocatalyst-ionic conductor infiltration,10.1007/s10971-019-05073-5
4,16017,"In addition, for the first time in the literature, a mixture of LSCF and GDC polymeric precursors, which would yield LSCF-GDC nanocomposite coatings on the grains of the porous GDC scaffold were used as the infiltration solution.",Electrochemical performance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ composite SOFC cathodes fabricated by electrocatalyst and/or electrocatalyst-ionic conductor infiltration,10.1007/s10971-019-05073-5
