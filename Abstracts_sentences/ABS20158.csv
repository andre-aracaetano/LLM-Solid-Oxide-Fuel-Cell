5,20158,"Concerning the cell components, a cermet made of nickel and an electrolyte material, Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) is used as anode and two cathode materials, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and Pr2NiO4+delta (PNO), are evaluated.",Anode supported single chamber solid oxide fuel cells operating in exhaust gases of thermal engine,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.061
6,20158,"The prepared cells are investigated in the various gas mixtures for temperatures ranging from 450 degrees C to 600 degrees C. Ni-CGO/CGO/LSCF-CGO cell has delivered a maximum power density of 15 mW cm(-2) at 500 degrees C with R = HC/O-2 = 0.21, while lower power densities are obtained for the other ratios, R = 0.44 and R = 0.67.",Anode supported single chamber solid oxide fuel cells operating in exhaust gases of thermal engine,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.061
