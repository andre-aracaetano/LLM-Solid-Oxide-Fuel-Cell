1,12204,Composite cathodes with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF6428) and samarium-doped ceria carbonate (SDCC) were developed and investigated for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications at low operating temperatures.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-SDC carbonate composite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2013.05.071
2,12204,"The LSCF-SDCC (50 wt% LSCF:50 wt% SDCC) composite cathode powders were mixed by the ball-milling technique followed by calcination at 700, 750, 800, and 850 degrees C for 2 h. To fabricate single SOFCs using LSCF-SDCC as the cathode, SDCC as the electrolyte, and NiO-SDCC as the anode, a single-step pressing and co-firing process was employed.",La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-SDC carbonate composite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2013.05.071
3,12204,The electrolyte-supported button cells were tested between 475 and 550 degrees C,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-SDC carbonate composite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2013.05.071
4,12204,The composite cathode exhibited well-matched TEC values with the SDCC electrolyte.,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-SDC carbonate composite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2013.05.071
5,12204,Calcination at lower temperatures (700 and 750 degrees C) produced powders with surface areas of 10 m(2) g(-1)-11 m(2) g(-1).,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-SDC carbonate composite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2013.05.071
6,12204,"Using LSCF-SDCC powders sintered at 700 and 750 C to fabricate button cells resulted in power densities of 117.9 and 120.4 mW cm(-2), respectively, at an operation temperature of 550 C with the latter cathode yielding the lowest R-p value.",La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ-SDC carbonate composite cathodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.matchemphys.2013.05.071
