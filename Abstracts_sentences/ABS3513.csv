2,3513,At Forschungszentrum Julich system technology is under development aiming at a 20kW demonstration plant.,Operation Experience with a 20kW SOFC System,10.1002/fuce.201300184
3,3513,An important challenge is to realize a compact and efficient system.,Operation Experience with a 20kW SOFC System,10.1002/fuce.201300184
4,3513,"To achieve this, Julich has invented an Integrated Module, which incorporates all hot parts of the system.",Operation Experience with a 20kW SOFC System,10.1002/fuce.201300184
5,3513,After a few years of development four stacks with a nominal power of 5kW were assembled and characterized with proper quality.,Operation Experience with a 20kW SOFC System,10.1002/fuce.201300184
6,3513,After integrating them into the system operation was started and 21.3kW gross power were achieved.,Operation Experience with a 20kW SOFC System,10.1002/fuce.201300184
7,3513,Because of a leakage in the periphery the test had to be interrupted after 550h of operation under load.,Operation Experience with a 20kW SOFC System,10.1002/fuce.201300184
8,3513,"Because repair would have taken too long, the test was continued with two modules of 5kW power each.",Operation Experience with a 20kW SOFC System,10.1002/fuce.201300184
