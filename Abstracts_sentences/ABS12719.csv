2,12719,Green Zr0.8Sc0.2O2 - delta (ScSZ) electrolyte micro-tubes with a thickness of 300 mu m were successfully prepared by extrusion at room temperature.,Fabrication of electrolyte supported micro-tubular SOFCs using extrusion and dip-coating,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.12.056
3,12719,"After firing at 1400 degrees C, the bare electrolyte micro-tube with a thickness of 210 mu m, a diameter of 3.8 mm, and a length of 40 mm reached a relative density of 96.84% and a flexural strength of 202 MPa.",Fabrication of electrolyte supported micro-tubular SOFCs using extrusion and dip-coating,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.12.056
4,12719,"To achieve a better sintering shrinkage match, the electrolyte micro-tubes were pre-sintered at 1100 degrees C, coated with NiO/ScSZ (60 vol.%:40 vol.%) in the inner surface of the microtubes by dip-coating method, and then co-fired at 1400 degrees C. After co-sintering, the interface of the porous anode layer and the dense electrolyte layer demonstrated good adhesion and mechanical integrity.",Fabrication of electrolyte supported micro-tubular SOFCs using extrusion and dip-coating,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.12.056
5,12719,"Subsequently, a La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 - delta (LSM)/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 - delta (GDC) (80 vol.%:20 vol.%) cathode layer was coated on the outer surface of the micro-tubes by dip-coating method and post-sintered at 1100 degrees C. The thicknesses of the anode and cathode layers read approximately 28 and 34 mu m respectively.",Fabrication of electrolyte supported micro-tubular SOFCs using extrusion and dip-coating,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.12.056
6,12719,"After thermal cycling between 30 degrees C and 800 C under 97% N-2-3%H-2 on the anode and air on the cathode, the micro T-SOFCs showed no delamination and retained good adhesion based on the SEM results.",Fabrication of electrolyte supported micro-tubular SOFCs using extrusion and dip-coating,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.12.056
7,12719,"The maximum power densities (MPD) of the single cell read 0.26 and 0.23 W cm(-2) respectively at 920 and 900 degrees C, and the open circuit voltage (OCV) reported the same 1.08 V.
