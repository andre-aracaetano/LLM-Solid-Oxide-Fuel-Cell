1,15841,"In this research, nanofiber-structuredPr(0.4)Sr(0.6)Co(0,2)Fe(0.7)Nb(0.1)O(3-delta)-(PSCFN) electrode scaffolds were impregnated with Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (GDC) nanoparticles to prepare PSCFN-GDC nanofiber-structured composite electrodes, which could function well as a novel electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells (SSOFCs).","Nanofiber-structured Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0,2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 symmetrical composite electrode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.135
2,15841,"The polarization resistances of PSCFN-GDC (1:0.56) composite electrodes as cathode and anode were 0.044 and 0.309 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, respectively, indicating that the composite electrodes demonstrated excellent electrochemical performances for both oxygen reductions and fuel oxidation reactions.","Nanofiber-structured Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0,2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 symmetrical composite electrode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.135
3,15841,La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM) electrolyte-supported single cells with the PSCFN-GDC symmetrical composite electrodes showed excellent long-term stability in wet H-2 (97% H-2-3% H2O) and wet CH4 (97% CH4-3% H2O) for 100 h with constant current density at 800 degrees C. A conversion electrode method was applied by interchanging the atmosphere of cathode and anode to solve the problem of PSCFN-GDC symmetrical single cell's carbon deposition in wet CH4.,"Nanofiber-structured Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0,2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 symmetrical composite electrode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.135
4,15841,"After working three cycles for 384 h, carbon deposition was not found in the symmetrical electrode scaffold.","Nanofiber-structured Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0,2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 symmetrical composite electrode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.135
5,15841,"Taken together, the results described above demonstrated that the PSCFN-GDC composite material acted as a promising symmetrical electrode for SSOFCs, and the conversion electrode method would make for a good application to process carbon deposition generated by hydrocarbon fuels.","Nanofiber-structured Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0,2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-δ-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 symmetrical composite electrode for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.135
