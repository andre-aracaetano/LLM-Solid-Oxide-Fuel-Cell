5,18739,"According to in-situ high temperature XRD and XPS results, the PdO phase is stable at temperature below 700 degrees C, and decomposed to Pd metal at 700-800 degrees C during heating process.",Effects of impregnating palladium on catalytic performance of LSCF-GDC composite cathodes for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.02.142
6,18739,"Combination XRD with TG-DSC analysis confirms that some Pd changes into Pd0 phase at 837 degrees C. Correspondingly, the phase composition changed little and the coexistence of Pd and tiny PdO is stable in the cooling process from 850 to 25 degrees C.
