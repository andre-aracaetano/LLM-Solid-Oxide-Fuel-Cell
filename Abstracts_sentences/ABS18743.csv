1,18743,"Ceria-samaria compositions were prepared by freeze-drying, yielding very homogeneous and fluorite single phase powders at temperatures as low as 375 degrees C. These powders were used to obtain dense ceramics by sintering at 1600 degrees C for 10 h. The mixed transport properties of these materials were characterized by impedance spectroscopy and the Hebb-Wagner ion-blocking method, at temperatures in the range 700-950 degrees C.",Mixed transport properties of Ce1-xSmxO2-x/2 system under fuel cell operating conditions,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.055
