3,16294,Subsequent annealing of combustion products in the air atmosphere at temperatures in the range of 500-1000 degrees C yielded preceramic powders based on chemically and phase-pure BaCeO3.,"Hydrazine-nitrate combustion synthesis of BaCeO3 preceramic powders: structure, morphology and thermophysical properties",10.1007/s10971-021-05717-5
4,16294,"Characterization of the as-received powders was performed by X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), simultaneous thermal analysis (DTA-TGA) and adsorption-structural analysis (N-2, 77 K).","Hydrazine-nitrate combustion synthesis of BaCeO3 preceramic powders: structure, morphology and thermophysical properties",10.1007/s10971-021-05717-5
5,16294,"Thermophysical properties of the sample annealed at 1000 degrees C were investigated using laser flash analysis (LFA) in the temperature interval of 1000 degrees C. As a result of a comprehensive study, the sequence of chemical and phase transformations that lead to the formation of barium cerate with a rhombic structure (Pnma, a = 6.2145 angstrom, b = 8.7776 angstrom, c = 6.2337 angstrom) during the thermal processing of combustion products was investigated.","Hydrazine-nitrate combustion synthesis of BaCeO3 preceramic powders: structure, morphology and thermophysical properties",10.1007/s10971-021-05717-5
6,16294,It was established that the average size of the obtained nanocrystals is 38 +/- 3 nm and that they form micron-sized agglomerates with a specific surface area of the powder of 4.8 m(2)/g.,"Hydrazine-nitrate combustion synthesis of BaCeO3 preceramic powders: structure, morphology and thermophysical properties",10.1007/s10971-021-05717-5
