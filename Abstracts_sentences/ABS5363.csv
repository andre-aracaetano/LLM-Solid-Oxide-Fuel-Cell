1,5363,A lower operating temperature below 600 A degrees C of the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is a key determinant of device performance.,Tailoring the microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-α cathode material: the role of dispersing agent,10.1007/s10971-016-4102-4
2,5363,"With this in mind, the roles of dispersing agents were investigated for synthesizing a cathode material made of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-alpha (LSCF) for application in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Tailoring the microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-α cathode material: the role of dispersing agent,10.1007/s10971-016-4102-4
3,5363,"In the present study, LSCF was synthesized following a sol-gel method with the aid of an activated carbon and ethylene glycol as dispersing agents.",Tailoring the microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-α cathode material: the role of dispersing agent,10.1007/s10971-016-4102-4
4,5363,X-ray diffractometer measurements indicate that a single perovskite phase of LSCF started to develop at the temperature of 500 A degrees C and completely formed at 700 A degrees C. Scanning electron microscope analysis confirmed that a well dispersed LSCF powders were successfully synthesized achieving a surface area of 12.05 m(2) g(-1) as corroborated by the BET surface area analysis.,Tailoring the microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-α cathode material: the role of dispersing agent,10.1007/s10971-016-4102-4
5,5363,This finding shows significant improvements of modifying the structural properties of cathode material and could be used to fabricate the next generation of SOFCs.,Tailoring the microstructure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-α cathode material: the role of dispersing agent,10.1007/s10971-016-4102-4
