1,19542,This study demonstrates a simple and economically viable approach to fabricate porous alumina ceramics shaped with low-priced natural organic pore-forming agents (PFAs) from rice husk (RH) and sugarcane bagasse (SCB) of various weight contents using the powder metallurgy method.,"Effect of agro-waste pore formers on the microstructure, hardness, and tensile properties of porous alumina ceramics",10.1111/ijac.12874
2,19542,Experimental findings revealed that the total porosity (44-67vol%) and average pore size (70-178m) maintained a linear relationship with rising PFA inclusion.,"Effect of agro-waste pore formers on the microstructure, hardness, and tensile properties of porous alumina ceramics",10.1111/ijac.12874
3,19542,"Using the diametral compression test, the mechanical response of porous alumina samples was evaluated as a function of porosity and pore geometry.","Effect of agro-waste pore formers on the microstructure, hardness, and tensile properties of porous alumina ceramics",10.1111/ijac.12874
4,19542,"From the overall mechanical strength characterization, the susceptivity of strength on porosity became well marked as the agro-waste shaped porous ceramics exhibited hardness, tensile strength, and elastic modulus of 529.1-26HV, 20.4-1.5MPa and 1662-57MPa, respectively.","Effect of agro-waste pore formers on the microstructure, hardness, and tensile properties of porous alumina ceramics",10.1111/ijac.12874
