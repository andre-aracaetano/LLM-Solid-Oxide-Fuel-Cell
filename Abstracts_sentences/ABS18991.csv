4,18991,"The as-synthesized powders exhibited high sintering activity, the Ce0.8La0.2-xYxO1.9 series electrolytes which have higher relative densities over 96% could be obtained after sintered at 1400 degrees C for 4 h. Ce0.8La0.15Y0.05O1.9 electrolyte sintered at 1400 degrees C for 4 h exhibited higher oxide ionic conductivity (sigma(800 degrees C)=0.057 S/cm), lower electrical activation energy (E-a=0.87 eV) and moderate thermal expansion coefficient (TEC=15.5x10(-6) K-1, temperature range 25-800 degrees C).",Preparation and characterization of Ce0.8La0.2-xYxO1.9 as electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/S1002-0721(14)60198-8
