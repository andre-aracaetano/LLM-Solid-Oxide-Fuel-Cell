2,6749,"The interface between this ceramic sealant and the anode-supported electrolyte, e.g., 8 mole% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ), remains intact after sixty thermal cycles from 800 degrees C to room temperature.","Development of ceramic sealant for solid oxide fuel cell application: Self-healing property, mechanical stability and thermal stability",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.022
3,6749,An in situ observation verifies that the micro-indentation on the surface of this material can be healed when heating from room temperature to 920 degrees C at a heating rate of 40 degrees C min(-1).,"Development of ceramic sealant for solid oxide fuel cell application: Self-healing property, mechanical stability and thermal stability",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.022
4,6749,"In addition, the weight loss of CaB2O4, held at 850 degrees C in air for 28 days, decreases from 3.26 +/- 0.73 for sealed species to 0.81 +/- 0.04 mg cm(-2) for fully crystallized species; meanwhile, the weight loss of CaB2O4, held at 850 degrees C in wet forming gas (30 vol% water vapor) for 28 days, decreases from 14.80 +/- 1.83 for sealed species to 6.36 +/- 0.64 mg cm(-2) for fully crystallized species.","Development of ceramic sealant for solid oxide fuel cell application: Self-healing property, mechanical stability and thermal stability",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.022
5,6749,"Combining with the good mechanical stability and thermal-stability, this self-healing ceramic sealant provides promising solution for the sealing challenge of planar SOFCs.","Development of ceramic sealant for solid oxide fuel cell application: Self-healing property, mechanical stability and thermal stability",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.022
