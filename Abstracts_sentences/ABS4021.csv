1,4021,This paper presents preliminary simulation results from the performance analysis of the integrated systems of calcium oxide (CaO)-carbon dioxide (CO2) capture unit and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC).,Simulation of solid oxide fuel cell systems integrated with sequential CaO-CO2 capture unit,10.1016/j.cej.2008.11.040
2,4021,The CO2 was extracted for further sequestration in the CaO-CO2 capture unit.,Simulation of solid oxide fuel cell systems integrated with sequential CaO-CO2 capture unit,10.1016/j.cej.2008.11.040
3,4021,"Three configurations of the integrated systems (CaO-Before-SOFC: CBS, CaO-After-SOFC: CAS and CaO-After-Burner: CAB) were considered.",Simulation of solid oxide fuel cell systems integrated with sequential CaO-CO2 capture unit,10.1016/j.cej.2008.11.040
4,4021,It was found that the CO2 capture efficiency (E-c) is dependent on CaO fresh feed rate (F-0) and CaO recycle rate (F-R).,Simulation of solid oxide fuel cell systems integrated with sequential CaO-CO2 capture unit,10.1016/j.cej.2008.11.040
5,4021,The improvement of SOFC performance was only realized for the CBS system.,Simulation of solid oxide fuel cell systems integrated with sequential CaO-CO2 capture unit,10.1016/j.cej.2008.11.040
6,4021,The SOFC performance increases with increasing CO2 E-c. The preliminary economic analysis was carried out considering total additional cost per mole of CO2 captured.,Simulation of solid oxide fuel cell systems integrated with sequential CaO-CO2 capture unit,10.1016/j.cej.2008.11.040
7,4021,"At a low percentage of CO2 capture (<42.5%), the CBS system is the most suitable configuration while the CAS system becomes an attractive choice at higher values.",Simulation of solid oxide fuel cell systems integrated with sequential CaO-CO2 capture unit,10.1016/j.cej.2008.11.040
8,4021,"However, only the CAB system could be possible at a very high range of CO2 capture (>94%).",Simulation of solid oxide fuel cell systems integrated with sequential CaO-CO2 capture unit,10.1016/j.cej.2008.11.040
