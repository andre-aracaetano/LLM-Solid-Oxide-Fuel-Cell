1,6792,"A process for nitric oxides (NOx, NO plus NO2) removal by solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) can easily reduce NOx in the flue gases to zero and also generate an electrical current.","Electrochemical NOx Reduction with Power Generation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Cu-Added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode",10.1149/1.3294705
2,6792,An yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte-supported SOFC unit cell was constructed with Ni-gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) as the anode and Cu-added La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta-GDC composite as the cathode.,"Electrochemical NOx Reduction with Power Generation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Cu-Added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode",10.1149/1.3294705
3,6792,"DeNO(x) tests were carried out at a fixed voltage of 0.55 V and 800 degrees C. As the inlet NOx concentration decreases, the NOx conversion increases.","Electrochemical NOx Reduction with Power Generation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Cu-Added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode",10.1149/1.3294705
4,6792,The generated current density increases with increasing NO concentration from 150 to 5000 ppm.,"Electrochemical NOx Reduction with Power Generation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Cu-Added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode",10.1149/1.3294705
5,6792,"Increasing O-2 concentration from 4 to 8% increases the NO conversion due to increased current density, which increases the oxygen transfer rate.","Electrochemical NOx Reduction with Power Generation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Cu-Added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode",10.1149/1.3294705
6,6792,"Adding CO2 can increase the NO conversion, and also due to increased current density.","Electrochemical NOx Reduction with Power Generation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Cu-Added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode",10.1149/1.3294705
7,6792,"As the O-2 concentration increases from 2 to 8% and the CO2 concentration increases from 5 to 15%, the generated current density increases.","Electrochemical NOx Reduction with Power Generation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Cu-Added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode",10.1149/1.3294705
8,6792,Adding H2O can decrease both the current density and the NO conversion.,"Electrochemical NOx Reduction with Power Generation in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Cu-Added (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O2-x Cathode",10.1149/1.3294705
