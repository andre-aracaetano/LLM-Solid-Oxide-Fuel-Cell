1,18452,This study focuses on the solid oxide fuel (SOFC) cogeneration system for commercial buildings.,Installation Effects of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cogeneration for Commercial Buildings,10.3775/jie.98.149
2,18452,SOFCs are considered to be suitable for buildings with low thermal demand because of the high generation efficiency.,Installation Effects of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cogeneration for Commercial Buildings,10.3775/jie.98.149
3,18452,"The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of SOFC installation into various commercial buildings from energy saving and economic aspects using optimization minimizing, the system cost.",Installation Effects of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cogeneration for Commercial Buildings,10.3775/jie.98.149
4,18452,Primary energy reduction rate was used as the indicator of the energy saving performance.,Installation Effects of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cogeneration for Commercial Buildings,10.3775/jie.98.149
5,18452,The results showed that SOFCs are effective to reduce primary energy consumption for all the buildings analyzed in this study.,Installation Effects of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cogeneration for Commercial Buildings,10.3775/jie.98.149
6,18452,"Based on the analysis of the optimal installation, it is suggested that SOFCs economically perform better for the buildings such as hospitals, hotels and restaurants with hot water demand than for offices without hot water demand.",Installation Effects of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cogeneration for Commercial Buildings,10.3775/jie.98.149
7,18452,"Restaurants operating for 21 hours are expected to be a promising candidate of SOFC, which can accept the cost of SOFC as high as 1.05 million yen per kilowatt.",Installation Effects of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cogeneration for Commercial Buildings,10.3775/jie.98.149
8,18452,"Furthermore, sensitivity analysis on the effects of SOFC installation based on renewable energy levy showed that installation of SOFCs would be promoted strongly for buildings with high electricity demand.",Installation Effects of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Cogeneration for Commercial Buildings,10.3775/jie.98.149
