1,8219,SrCoO3-delta outperforms as cathode material in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) when the three-dimensional (3C-type) perovskite structure is stabilized by the inclusion of highly-charged transition-metal ions at the octahedral positions.,Nb5+-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskites as Potential Cathodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ma9070579
2,8219,"In a previous work we studied the Nb incorporation at the Co positions in the SrCo1-xNbxO3-delta system, in which the stabilization of a tetragonal P4/mmm perovskite superstructure was described for the x = 0.05 composition.",Nb5+-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskites as Potential Cathodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ma9070579
3,8219,"In the present study we extend this investigation to the x = 0.10-0.15 range, also observing the formation of the tetragonal P4/mmm structure instead of the unwanted hexagonal phase corresponding to the 2H polytype.",Nb5+-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskites as Potential Cathodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ma9070579
4,8219,"We also investigated the effect of Nb5+ doping on the thermal, electrical, and electrochemical properties of SrCo1-xNbxO3-delta (x = 0.1 and 0.15) perovskite oxides performing as cathodes in SOFC.",Nb5+-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskites as Potential Cathodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ma9070579
5,8219,"In comparison with the undoped hexagonal SrCoO3-delta phase, the resulting compounds present high thermal stability and an increase of the electrical conductivity.",Nb5+-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskites as Potential Cathodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ma9070579
6,8219,"The single-cell tests for these compositions (x = 0.10 and 0.15) with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta (LSGM) as electrolyte and SrMo0.8Fe0.2CoO3-delta as anode gave maximum power densities of 693 and 550 mW.cm(-2) at 850 degrees C respectively, using pure H-2 as fuel and air as oxidant.",Nb5+-Doped SrCoO3-δ Perovskites as Potential Cathodes for Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.3390/ma9070579
