1,10255,"The mechanical, electrical and thermal properties of alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca and Sr)-doped LaCrO3 have been examined as separators in planar-type high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.","Compatibility of alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca, Sr)-doped lanthanum chromites as separators in planar-type high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1023/A:1018565409603
2,10255,"The maximum three-point bending strength at 1000 degrees C in air was measured and found to be 186 MPa for LaCr0.9Mg0.1O3, 36 MPa for La0.9Ca0.1CrO3 and 77 MPa for La0.9Sr0.1CrO3.","Compatibility of alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca, Sr)-doped lanthanum chromites as separators in planar-type high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1023/A:1018565409603
3,10255,"The La0.8Sr0.2CrO3 separator placed in both an oxidizing and a reducing environment at 1000 degrees C showed almost the same electrical conductivities of the H-2 atmosphere, and the conductivity was independent of sample thickness in the range 0.5-3.0 mm.","Compatibility of alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca, Sr)-doped lanthanum chromites as separators in planar-type high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1023/A:1018565409603
4,10255,"For all the doped LaCrO3 perovskites, a difference between the thermal expansion behaviours of air and the H-2 atmosphere was observed.","Compatibility of alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca, Sr)-doped lanthanum chromites as separators in planar-type high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1023/A:1018565409603
5,10255,"In particular, the thermal expansion slope for the first heating cycle under the H-2 atmosphere showed a marked change.","Compatibility of alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca, Sr)-doped lanthanum chromites as separators in planar-type high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1023/A:1018565409603
6,10255,The volume changes were due to the formation of oxygen defects in the perovskite structure.,"Compatibility of alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca, Sr)-doped lanthanum chromites as separators in planar-type high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells",10.1023/A:1018565409603
