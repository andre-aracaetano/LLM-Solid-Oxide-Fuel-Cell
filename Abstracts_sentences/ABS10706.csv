1,10706,The surface of a dense Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) was modified with niobium oxide (Nb(2)O(5)) in order to achieve sulfur tolerance.,Surface modification of Ni-YSZ using niobium oxide for sulfur-tolerant anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2844366
2,10706,"Results suggest that Nb(2)O(5) was reduced to NbO(2) under SOFC operating conditions, which has high electrical conductivity and catalytic activity toward hydrogen oxidation.",Surface modification of Ni-YSZ using niobium oxide for sulfur-tolerant anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2844366
3,10706,The NbO(x)-coated dense Ni-YSZ cermet anode showed sulfur tolerance when exposed to 50 ppm H(2)S at 700 degrees C over 12 h. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis suggest that different phases of niobium sulfides (NbS(x)) were formed on the surfaces of niobium oxides.,Surface modification of Ni-YSZ using niobium oxide for sulfur-tolerant anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2844366
4,10706,"Furthermore, density of state (DOS) analysis of NbO(2), NbS, and NbS(2) indicates that the electronic structure of niobium sulfides are similar to that of NbO(2); they are electrically conductive and catalytically active for hydrogen oxidation in H(2)S containing fuels under the conditions studied.",Surface modification of Ni-YSZ using niobium oxide for sulfur-tolerant anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1149/1.2844366
