1,17365,"In this study the possibility of obtaining an oxygen-electrode supported solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) constituted by La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta-Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (LSM-GDC) porous anode, GDC dense electrolyte and NiO-GDC porous cathode in a single thermal step (included the formation of the perovskitic anodic phase) was investigated.",Single step anode-supported solid oxide electrolyzer cell,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.08.031
2,17365,The cell was produced depositing the electrolyte and anode layers directly on a green tape containing a mixture of precursors of the perovskitic phase and GDC.,Single step anode-supported solid oxide electrolyzer cell,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.08.031
3,17365,The porosity of the supporting anode was obtained exploiting the decomposition of the LSM precursors during a single thermal treatment that assures the perovskitic phase formation and the consolidation of the oxygen-electrode supported cell with the desired porous/dense/porous architecture.,Single step anode-supported solid oxide electrolyzer cell,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.08.031
4,17365,The possibility of obtaining the same planar configuration using GDC as barrier layer and YSZ as electrolyte has been evaluated.,Single step anode-supported solid oxide electrolyzer cell,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.08.031
5,17365,This approach allows the production in just one thermal treatment of a perfectly planar 5 x 5 cm(2) complete SOEC with suitable microstructure.,Single step anode-supported solid oxide electrolyzer cell,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.08.031
