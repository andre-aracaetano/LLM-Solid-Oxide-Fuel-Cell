3,7470,"Steam reforming of methane is an endothermic process and can produce 3 mol of H-2 and 1 mol of CO from 1 mol of methane, and thus the electrical efficiency of SOFC is high at the same O/C ratio and equivalent fuel utilization, whereas the thermal efficiency is low.","Effects of methane processing strategy on fuel composition, electrical and thermal efficiency of solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.128
4,7470,"On the contrary, partial oxidation of methane is an exothermal process and only produces 2 mol of H-2 and 1 mol of CO from 1 mol of methane, and thus the electrical efficiency of SOFC is low at the same O/C ratio and equivalent fuel utilization, whereas the thermal efficiency is high.","Effects of methane processing strategy on fuel composition, electrical and thermal efficiency of solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.128
5,7470,"When the O/C ratio is 1.5, the electrical efficiency of SOFC is 55.3% for steam reforming of methane, while 32.7% for partial oxidation of methane.","Effects of methane processing strategy on fuel composition, electrical and thermal efficiency of solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.128
6,7470,High electrical efficiency of SOFC can be achieved and carbon deposition can be depressed by selecting suitable O/C ratio from methane pretreatment according to the accurate calculation and analysis of effects of different methane processing strategies on the electrical efficiency and thermal efficiency of SOFC.,"Effects of methane processing strategy on fuel composition, electrical and thermal efficiency of solid oxide fuel cell",10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.128
