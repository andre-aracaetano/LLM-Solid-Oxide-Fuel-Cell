1,2007,"Flame-assisted fuel cell (FFC) studies have been limited to lower fuel-rich equivalence ratios (similar to 1-1.7, due to the upper flammability limit and sooting limit) where only small concentrations of H-2 and CO can be generated in the exhaust.",Microcombustion for micro-tubular flame-assisted fuel cell power and heat cogeneration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.043
2,2007,"In this work, a non-catalytic microcombustion based FFC is proposed for direct use of hydrocarbons for power generation.",Microcombustion for micro-tubular flame-assisted fuel cell power and heat cogeneration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.043
3,2007,The potential for high FFC performance (450 mW cm(-2) power density and 50% fuel utilization) in propane/air microcombustion exhaust is demonstrated.,Microcombustion for micro-tubular flame-assisted fuel cell power and heat cogeneration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.043
4,2007,The micro flow reactor is investigated as a fuel reformer for equivalence ratios from 1 to 5.5.,Microcombustion for micro-tubular flame-assisted fuel cell power and heat cogeneration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.043
5,2007,One significant result is that soot formation in the micro flow reactor is not observed at equivalence ratios from 1 to 5.5 and maximum wall temperatures ranging from 750 to 900 degrees C. Soot formation is observed at higher wall temperatures of 950 degrees C and 1000 degrees C and equivalence ratios above 2.5.,Microcombustion for micro-tubular flame-assisted fuel cell power and heat cogeneration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.043
6,2007,H-2 and CO concentrations in the exhaust are found to have a strong temperature dependence that varies with the maximum wall temperature and the local flame temperature.,Microcombustion for micro-tubular flame-assisted fuel cell power and heat cogeneration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.043
