1,18969,Proton-conducting reversible solid oxide cells (P-ReSOCs) are receiving increasing attention because they have potential to efficiently operate at intermediate temperatures to reduce cost and prolong operational life.,Highly Conductive and Durable Nb(Ta)-Doped Proton Conductors for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsenergylett.2c01544
2,18969,Here we report our findings in the rational design of a new series of donor- and acceptor-codoped proton conductors through careful manipulation of defect chemistry.,Highly Conductive and Durable Nb(Ta)-Doped Proton Conductors for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsenergylett.2c01544
3,18969,"Specifically, BaNb(Ta)(0.05)Ce0.7Yb0.25O3-delta exhibits high ionic conductivity (0.012 S cm(-1)) while maintaining exceptional stability when exposed to Ar with 30% H2O at 500 degrees C for 500 h. In contrast, the resistance of BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta increases continuously with time under the same condition due to reaction with H2O, as rationalized using density functional theory (DFT)-based computations.",Highly Conductive and Durable Nb(Ta)-Doped Proton Conductors for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsenergylett.2c01544
4,18969,"In addition, single cells based on BaNb0.05Ce0.7Yb0.25O3-delta achieve a high peak power density of 1.12 W cm(-2) in the fuel cell mode and a high current density of 2.24 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V in the electrolysis mode at 600 degrees C. Overall, this work provides new insights for the development of highly conductive and stable proton conductors for P-ReSOCs.",Highly Conductive and Durable Nb(Ta)-Doped Proton Conductors for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,10.1021/acsenergylett.2c01544
