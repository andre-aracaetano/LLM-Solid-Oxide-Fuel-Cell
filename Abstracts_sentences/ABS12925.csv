2,12925,"However, high-vacuum requirements have limited X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of electrochemical cells to ex situ investigations.",Measuring fundamental properties in operating solid oxide electrochemical cells by using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,10.1038/nmat2851
3,12925,"Using a combination of ambient-pressure XPS and CeO2-x/YSZ/Pt single-chamber cells, we carry out in situ spectroscopy to probe oxidation states of all exposed surfaces in operational SOCs at 750 degrees C in 1 mbar reactant gases H-2 and H2O. Kinetic energy shifts of core-level photoelectron spectra provide a direct measure of the local surface potentials and a basis for calculating local overpotentials across exposed interfaces.",Measuring fundamental properties in operating solid oxide electrochemical cells by using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,10.1038/nmat2851
4,12925,The mixed ionic/electronic conducting CeO2-x electrodes undergo Ce3+/Ce4+ oxidation-reduction changes with applied bias.,Measuring fundamental properties in operating solid oxide electrochemical cells by using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,10.1038/nmat2851
5,12925,The simultaneous measurements of local surface Ce oxidation states and electric potentials reveal the active ceria regions during H-2 electro-oxidation and H2O electrolysis.,Measuring fundamental properties in operating solid oxide electrochemical cells by using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,10.1038/nmat2851
6,12925,The active regions extend similar to 150 mu m from the current collectors and are not limited by the three-phase-boundary interfaces associated with other SOC materials.,Measuring fundamental properties in operating solid oxide electrochemical cells by using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,10.1038/nmat2851
7,12925,The persistence of the Ce3+/Ce4+ shifts in the similar to 150 mu m active region suggests that the surface reaction kinetics and lateral electron transport on the thin ceria electrodes are co-limiting processes.,Measuring fundamental properties in operating solid oxide electrochemical cells by using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,10.1038/nmat2851
