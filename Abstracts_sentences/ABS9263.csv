1,9263,"Various glass-ceramics were prepared based on the BaO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 system with the addition of La2O3, ZrO2, or NiO in an attempt to develop a suitable sealant for planar solid-oxide fuel cells operating at 800degreesC. To estimate the applicability of these glasses as suitable sealants, their thermal and chemical stabilities as well as the crystallization behavior and bonding characteristics of their parent glasses were investigated.",Suitable glass-ceramic sealant for planar solid-oxide fuel cells,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2004.00254.x
