1,17013,Yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) has been extensively studied as an electrolyte material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) but its performance in heterogeneous catalysis is also the object of a growing number of publications.,Remarkable Enhancement of O2 Activation on Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia Surface in a Dual Catalyst Bed,10.1002/anie.201403921
2,17013,"In both applications, oxygen activation on the YSZ surface remains the step that hinders utilization at moderate temperature.",Remarkable Enhancement of O2 Activation on Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia Surface in a Dual Catalyst Bed,10.1002/anie.201403921
3,17013,"It was demonstrated by oxygen isotope exchange that a dual catalyst bed system consisting of two successive LaMnO3 and YSZ beds without intimate contact drastically enhances oxygen activation on the YSZ surface at 698K. It can be concluded that LaMnO3 activates the triplet ground-state of molecular oxygen into a low-lying singlet state, thereby facilitating the activation of the O-2 molecule on the YSZ oxygen vacancy sites.",Remarkable Enhancement of O2 Activation on Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia Surface in a Dual Catalyst Bed,10.1002/anie.201403921
4,17013,This phenomenon is shown to improve the catalytic activity of the LaMnO3-Pd/YSZ system for the partial oxidation of methane.,Remarkable Enhancement of O2 Activation on Yttrium-Stabilized Zirconia Surface in a Dual Catalyst Bed,10.1002/anie.201403921
