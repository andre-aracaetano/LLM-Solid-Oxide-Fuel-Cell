5,14118,"Single test-cells consisting of samarium oxide doped ceria (SDC) as an electrolyte, Ni-SDC cermet as an anode and La2-xPrxNiO4 as a cathode, were fabricated for measurements of cell performance at 500-700 degrees C. Current interruption measurements revealed that the overpotential losses mainly decreased with increasing Pr content.",Properties of La2-xPrxNiO4 cathode for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.2109/jcersj2.119.246
