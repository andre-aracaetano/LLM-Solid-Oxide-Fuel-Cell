1,19888,The long-range average and short-range local structures in the Tm-2(Ti2-xTmx)O7-x/2 (x = 0.00-0.67) series were studied using a combination of diffraction and spectroscopic techniques.,Effect of Long- and Short-Range Disorder on the Oxygen Ionic Conductivity of Tm2(Ti2-xTmx)O7-x/2 Stuffed Pyrochlores,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03363
2,19888,"The long-range average structure, established from synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data, shows the development of multiphase regions from x = 0.134 and the formation of antisite cation disorder from x = 0.402.",Effect of Long- and Short-Range Disorder on the Oxygen Ionic Conductivity of Tm2(Ti2-xTmx)O7-x/2 Stuffed Pyrochlores,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03363
3,19888,"The crystal field splitting of the Ti4+ ions, as derived from the Ti L-3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, decreases gradually from 2.17 to 1.92 eV with increasing Tm3+ content (x), reflecting the increase in coordination number from 6 to predominantly 7.",Effect of Long- and Short-Range Disorder on the Oxygen Ionic Conductivity of Tm2(Ti2-xTmx)O7-x/2 Stuffed Pyrochlores,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c03363
