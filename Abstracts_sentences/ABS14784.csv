1,14784,A material consisting of (La1-xYx)(0.7)Sr0.3MnO3 was synthesized and evaluated to enhance the thermal expansion compatibility with an electrolyte material of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) compared with the standard system La0.7Sr0.3MnO3.,"Yttrium-substituted (La, Y, Sr) MnO3 as a SOFC cathode material",10.2109/jcersj.110.618
2,14784,"In addition, its crystal structure, chemical stability, electrical conductivity and electrode performance were examined.","Yttrium-substituted (La, Y, Sr) MnO3 as a SOFC cathode material",10.2109/jcersj.110.618
3,14784,"For the substitution range x = 0.0-0.2 in the (La1-xYx)(0.7)Sr0.3MnO3 system, a single perovskite phase was observed.","Yttrium-substituted (La, Y, Sr) MnO3 as a SOFC cathode material",10.2109/jcersj.110.618
4,14784,"The mixture of (La1-xYx)(0.7)Sr0.3MnO3 (x=0.0-0.6) and YSZ, which was fired at 1400degreesC after mixing, did not contain the reaction products, such as La2Zr2O7, Y4Zr3O12, and SrZrO3.","Yttrium-substituted (La, Y, Sr) MnO3 as a SOFC cathode material",10.2109/jcersj.110.618
5,14784,"The average thermal expansion coefficients between 50degreesC and 1000degreesC at x=0.0 and x= 0.2 were 12.2 x 10(-6) K-1 and 11.5 x 10(-6) K-1, respectively.","Yttrium-substituted (La, Y, Sr) MnO3 as a SOFC cathode material",10.2109/jcersj.110.618
6,14784,"The electrical conductivity of the phases with x= 0.0 and 0.2, at 1000degreesC in air, were 172 and 217 S.cm(-1), respectively.","Yttrium-substituted (La, Y, Sr) MnO3 as a SOFC cathode material",10.2109/jcersj.110.618
7,14784,The electrode performance of (La0.8Y0.2)(0.7)Sr0.3MnO3 was almost equal to that of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 at 1000degreesC. Substitution of Y at the content of x = 0.2 proved to be effective in obtaining higher expansion compatibility and electrical conductivity than the standard system without any degradation of the other properties.,"Yttrium-substituted (La, Y, Sr) MnO3 as a SOFC cathode material",10.2109/jcersj.110.618
