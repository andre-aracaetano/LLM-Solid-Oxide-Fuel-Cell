1,18199,This work investigates the behaviour of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) fed by two different fuel mixtures that simulate biogases coming from anaerobic digestion.,Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
2,18199,The fuel mixtures are namely bio-methane and bio-hydrogen.,Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
3,18199,"The first composition is the conventional one, where a biological process of fermentation is carried out to produce a gas that contains a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide with traces of H(2)S and other organic sulphur compounds.",Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
4,18199,"The second mixture is representative of a biogas produced through a novel routine: a particular pre-treatment of the bacteria inoculum (generally clostridia bacteria) is performed in order to inhibit the methanogenic step in the fermentation process, such that bio-hydrogen is produced as the only effluent of the digester (a mixture of H(2)/CO(2), with no traces of methane).",Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
5,18199,"Both bio-methane and bio-hydrogen have been directly fed to SOFC planar cells; in particular, an anode supported cell (ASC) with nickel and 8 mol% yttrium-stabilised zirconia (Ni-YSZ), and an electrolyte supported cell (ESC) with a 3YSZ (3 mol% yttrium-stabilised zirconia) electrolyte and a thin Ni-GDC (Ni/Gd-doped ceria) anode have been tested.",Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
6,18199,The bio-methane resulted in carbon deposition in both cells without the addition of any oxidant to promote methane conversion in H(2) and CO.,Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
7,18199,"The addition of addition of air, steam and CO(2) as oxidants was successfully tested to produce a direct internal reforming of methane onto the anode surface.",Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
8,18199,"For each selected bio-CH(4)/oxidant mixture, a stable behaviour of the cell voltage under load conditions of 0.5 A cm(-2) for the ASC and 0.3 A cm(-2) for the ESC were observed for at least 50 h at 800 degrees C.",Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
9,18199,The oxidant addition was demonstrated to be effective in preventing carbon-deposition and converting the methane into H(2) and CO.,Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
10,18199,The bio-hydrogen was tested and found not to need an oxidant.,Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
11,18199,Degradation did not occur in a temperature range of 700-850 degrees C.,Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146

13,18199,An energy model of a complete SOFC system running on reformed bio-methane and on bio-hydrogen in its original composition has been developed.,Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
14,18199,"The results reveal that the best performances are obtained with the steam-reformed methane, where a DC electrical efficiency of over 41% is achieved.",Experimental investigation of direct internal reforming of biogas in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.146
