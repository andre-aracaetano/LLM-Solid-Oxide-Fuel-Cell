1,15477,"Novel strategies based on spray-pyrolysis deposition are proposed to increase the triple-phase boundary (TPB) of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) cathodes in contact with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte: (i) nanocrystalline LSM films deposited on as-prepared YSZ surface; (ii) the addition of poly(methyl methacrylate) microspheres as pore formers to further increase the porosity of the film cathodes; and (iii) the deposition of LSM by spray pyrolysis on backbones of Zr0.84Y0.16O1.92 (YSZ), Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO), and Bi1.5Y0.5O3-delta (BYO) previously fixed onto the YSZ.",Novel Microstructural Strategies To Enhance the Electrochemical Performance of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ Cathodes,10.1021/acsami.5b00255
2,15477,"This last method is an alternative to the classical infiltration process with several advantages for large-scale manufacturing of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), including easier industrial implementation, shorter preparation time, and low cost.",Novel Microstructural Strategies To Enhance the Electrochemical Performance of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ Cathodes,10.1021/acsami.5b00255

4,15477,"Very low values of area specific resistance are obtained, ranging from 1.4 Omega.cm(2) for LSM films deposited on as-prepared YSZ surface to 0.06 Omega-cm(2) for LSM deposited onto BYO backbone at a measured temperature of 650 degrees C. These electrodes exhibit high performance even after annealing at 950 degrees C, making them potentially suitable for applications in SOFCs at intermediate temperatures.",Novel Microstructural Strategies To Enhance the Electrochemical Performance of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-δ Cathodes,10.1021/acsami.5b00255
