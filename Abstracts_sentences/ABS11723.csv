3,11723,"Electrochemical test results reveal that compared with the bare LSCF, polarization resistance of LSCF cathode decorated with LNO particles reduces by 41%-50%, and its stability is improved, where its polarization resistance increases by 50.42% after annealing at 750 degrees C for about 125 h while that of bare one increases by 76.89%.",Impact of Surface Modification on the Performance and Stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode,
4,11723,"Evidenced by X-ray powder diffraction, La2SrOx phase appears in LNO-LSCF after 100 h annealing, which is one of the possible reasons for enhanced stability.",Impact of Surface Modification on the Performance and Stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode,
5,11723,"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows that after annealing for 100 h, the surface Sr content decreases by 3.66% compared to that before annealing, whereas that of the bare one increases by 26.95%, indicating that LNO modification can effectively suppress Sr surface segregation of LSCF.",Impact of Surface Modification on the Performance and Stability of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ Cathode,
