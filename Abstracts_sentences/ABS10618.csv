3,10618,"The calcination temperature strongly affected the reduction behavior; the TPR profile of the sample calcined at 1723 K shows a high temperature reduction peak that was not found in the TPR profile of the sample calcined at 1473 K. Such a difference in the TPR profiles can be attributed to the presence of distinct states of NiO species, which are due to the difference of interactions between NiO and YSZ.",Investigation of the interaction between NiO and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) in the NiO/YSZ composite by temperature-programmed reduction technique,10.1016/S0926-860X(02)00634-8
