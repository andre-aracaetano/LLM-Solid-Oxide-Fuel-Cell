1,17080,"The total cell resistances of three Riso DTU solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were broken down into individual contributions, by the combined use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and complex non-linear least squares fitting (CNLS).",Towards Quantification of Relations Between Electrode Polarisation and Microstructure,10.1149/1.3587113
2,17080,"Information on the number of contributing processes, frequency regions, and thermal behaviour, was obtained from symmetric cell studies of individual electrodes.",Towards Quantification of Relations Between Electrode Polarisation and Microstructure,10.1149/1.3587113
3,17080,The frequency regions dominated by electrode specific processes in the full cells were assessed by systematic changes of temperature and/or partial pressure of reactant gases on both electrodes.,Towards Quantification of Relations Between Electrode Polarisation and Microstructure,10.1149/1.3587113
4,17080,"Based on the combined information, an equivalent circuit consisting of a series resistance (R-s) and five (RQ) elements was found suitable to describe the polarisation resistance of all tested cells.",Towards Quantification of Relations Between Electrode Polarisation and Microstructure,10.1149/1.3587113
