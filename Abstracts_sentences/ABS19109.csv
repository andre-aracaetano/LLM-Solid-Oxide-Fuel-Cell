1,19109,The structural and electronic properties of bulk Pr2NiO4+delta (delta = 0 and 0.031) were analyzed using first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) for application to electrode materials in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Analysis of structural and electronic properties of Pr2NiO4 through first-principles calculations,10.1088/0953-8984/24/40/405504
2,19109,"Two structures of Pr2NiO4 were analyzed: one in space group I4/mmm associated with the high temperature tetragonal (HTT) structure, and the other in Bmab with the low temperature orthorhombic (LTO) structure.",Analysis of structural and electronic properties of Pr2NiO4 through first-principles calculations,10.1088/0953-8984/24/40/405504
3,19109,The main difference between the two structures is the pronounced tilting of the nickelate octahedra found in the Bmab structure.,Analysis of structural and electronic properties of Pr2NiO4 through first-principles calculations,10.1088/0953-8984/24/40/405504
4,19109,"Here, we will show that the difference in the electronic properties between the two structures, i.e. half-metallic for the I4/mmm structure and metallic for the Bmab structure, is attributed to the tilting of the nickelate octahedra.",Analysis of structural and electronic properties of Pr2NiO4 through first-principles calculations,10.1088/0953-8984/24/40/405504
5,19109,"Furthermore, we found that the presence of interstitial O atoms at the Pr2O2 bilayers is responsible for the tilting of the octahedra and thus is a dominant factor in the transition from the I4/mmm structure to the Bmab structure.",Analysis of structural and electronic properties of Pr2NiO4 through first-principles calculations,10.1088/0953-8984/24/40/405504
6,19109,These results would be of great significance to materials design related to the enhancement of O diffusivity in this material.,Analysis of structural and electronic properties of Pr2NiO4 through first-principles calculations,10.1088/0953-8984/24/40/405504
