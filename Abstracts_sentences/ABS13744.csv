2,13744,The two main nanoparticle orientations are found to have their [111] direction parallel to the substrate surface normal and similar to 41.3 degrees tilted from this direction.,Structure and Oxidation Behavior of Nickel Nanoparticles Supported by YSZ(111),10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b11342
3,13744,"The former orientation is described by a cube-on-cube stacking at the oxide-metal interface and the latter by a so-called coherent tilt strain-relieving mechanism, which is hitherto unreported for nanoparticles in literature.",Structure and Oxidation Behavior of Nickel Nanoparticles Supported by YSZ(111),10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b11342
4,13744,"A modified Wulff construction used for the 111-oriented particles results in a value of the adhesion energy ranging from 1.4 to 2.2 Jm(2), whereby the lower end corresponds to more rounded particles and the upper to relatively flat geometries.",Structure and Oxidation Behavior of Nickel Nanoparticles Supported by YSZ(111),10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b11342

7,13744,"Only a. monolayer of metallic nickel of the top (111) facets oxidizes, whereas the side facets seem to react more severely.",Structure and Oxidation Behavior of Nickel Nanoparticles Supported by YSZ(111),10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b11342
8,13744,"An apparent size increase of the remaining metallic Ni core is discussed in relation to a size-dependent oxidation mechanism, whereby smaller nanoparticles react at a faster rate.",Structure and Oxidation Behavior of Nickel Nanoparticles Supported by YSZ(111),10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b11342
9,13744,"We argue that such a preferential oxidation mechanism, which inactivates the smallest and most reactive metal nanoparticles, might play a role for the long-term degradation of solid oxide fuel cells.",Structure and Oxidation Behavior of Nickel Nanoparticles Supported by YSZ(111),10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b11342
