8,1038,It has been revealed that any increase in pre-reforming rate of methane and steam to carbon ratio of the entering fuel will lead to efficiency penalty and more uniform temperature distribution along the cell.,"Modeling, parametric analysis and optimization of an anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell",10.1177/0954406214568823
9,1038,"In addition, the more average current density increases, the less electric efficiency is achieved, and on the other hand, the more temperature difference along the cell is seen.","Modeling, parametric analysis and optimization of an anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cell",10.1177/0954406214568823
