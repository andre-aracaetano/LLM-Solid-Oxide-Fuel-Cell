7,2628,"At an operating temperature of 1073 K and a pressure of 500 kPa, the respective energy and exergy efficiencies of the SOFC-H integrated cycle reach 81.1% and 74.3% compared to 76.7% and 69.9% for the SOFC-O. Under the same operating conditions, the cooling effectiveness of the system with both SOFC types becomes 14.7% based on the lower heating value (LHV) of ammonia.",Energy and exergy analyses of direct ammonia solid oxide fuel cell integrated with gas turbine power cycle,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.03.083
