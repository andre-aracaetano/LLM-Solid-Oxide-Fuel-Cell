1,1209,"A hybrid system based on a micro gas turbine (mu GT) and a high-temperature fuel cell, i.e., molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) or solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), is expected to achieve a much higher efficiency than conventional distributed power generation systems.",Cycle analysis of micro gas turbine-molten carbonate fuel cell hybrid system,10.1299/jsmeb.48.65
2,1209,"In this study, a cycle analysis method and the performance evaluation of a mu GT-MCFC hybrid system, of which the power output is 30 kW, are investigated to clarify its feasibility.",Cycle analysis of micro gas turbine-molten carbonate fuel cell hybrid system,10.1299/jsmeb.48.65
3,1209,We developed a general design strategy in which a low fuel input to a combustor and higher MCFC operating temperature result in a high power generation efficiency.,Cycle analysis of micro gas turbine-molten carbonate fuel cell hybrid system,10.1299/jsmeb.48.65
4,1209,A high recuperator temperature effectiveness and a moderate steam-carbon ratio are the requirements for obtaining a high material strength in a turbine.,Cycle analysis of micro gas turbine-molten carbonate fuel cell hybrid system,10.1299/jsmeb.48.65
5,1209,"In addition, by employing a combustor for complete oxidation of MCFC effluents without additional fuel input, i.e., a catalytic combustor, the power generation efficiency of a mu GT MCFC is achieved at over 60% (LHV).",Cycle analysis of micro gas turbine-molten carbonate fuel cell hybrid system,10.1299/jsmeb.48.65
