1,13216,"Here we report that the nano La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-delta (LCFN) decorated Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) composite oxide, prepared by the solution infiltration method, could function well as a cobalt-free electrode material for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Nano La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-δ decorated porous doped ceria as a novel cobalt-free electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03485f
2,13216,"The structure, morphology, thermal expansion, oxygen reduction reaction activity and catalytic activity for methane oxidation of the as-prepared LCFN-infiltrated SDC electrode was investigated systematically.",Nano La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-δ decorated porous doped ceria as a novel cobalt-free electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03485f
3,13216,"Under a reducing atmosphere, the partial segregation of metallic nickel from the LCFN perovskite lattice was demonstrated by SEM and STEM-EDX, and the XRD results suggested that the perovskite structure of LCFN still survived.",Nano La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-δ decorated porous doped ceria as a novel cobalt-free electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03485f
4,13216,"Consequently, the good anode performance was expected due to the high catalytic activity of LCFN for methane oxidation and the excellent electrocatalytic activity of nano nickel for the methane reforming and electro-oxidation of hydrogen.",Nano La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-δ decorated porous doped ceria as a novel cobalt-free electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03485f
5,13216,"In an air atmosphere, an area specific resistance as low as 0.12 Omega cm(2) was achieved at 600 degrees C.",Nano La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-δ decorated porous doped ceria as a novel cobalt-free electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03485f
6,13216,"The SDC electrolyte supported symmetrical SOFC with the LCFN-infiltrated SDC electrode was then fabricated and tested, which delivered attractive peak power densities of 510 and 350 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, operating on hydrogen and CH4-O-2 fuels, respectively.",Nano La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-δ decorated porous doped ceria as a novel cobalt-free electrode for symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c4ta03485f
