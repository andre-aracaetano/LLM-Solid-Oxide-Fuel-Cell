2,17721,"In this study, the oxygen diffusivity in A-site-deficient (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3 +/- (LSM-20) was measured as a function of temperature (600 degrees C, 700 degrees C, and 800 degrees C) and oxygen partial pressure (0.03atm, 0.16atm, and 0.30atm).",Measurement of Bulk Oxygen Diffusivity in (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3±δ,10.1007/s11837-018-3099-2
3,17721,Tracer (O-18) concentration profiles were measured in single-crystal epitaxial thin films of LSM-20 by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS).,Measurement of Bulk Oxygen Diffusivity in (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3±δ,10.1007/s11837-018-3099-2
