1,10947,A number of ternary transition metal sulfides with general composition AB(2)S(4) (where A and B are different transition metal atoms) have been prepared and investigated as potential anode catalysts for use in H2S powered solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Synthesis and characterization of new ternary transition metal sulfide anodes for H2S-powered solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.04.055
2,10947,"For the initial screening, polarization resistance of the materials was measured in a two electrode symmetrical cell at 700-850 degrees C. Vanadium-based materials showed the lowest polarization resistance, and so were chosen for subsequent full cell tests using the configuration [H2S, AV(2)S(4)/YSZ/Pt, air] (where A = Ni, Cr, Mo).",Synthesis and characterization of new ternary transition metal sulfide anodes for H2S-powered solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.04.055
