3,12132,"Thus, it is necessary to improve the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of cathode.",Sc and Ta-doped SrCoO3-δ perovskite as a high-performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107491
4,12132,The SrCoO3-delta perovskite with a cubic phase is identified as a potential cathode material for SOFCs due to its high oxygen permeability and reasonable electrical conductivity.,Sc and Ta-doped SrCoO3-δ perovskite as a high-performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107491
5,12132,"However, it readily decomposes into the orthorhombic structured brownmillerite Sr2Co2O5 or hexagonal Sr6Co5O15 during high-temperature sintering resulting in the loss of a significant amount of lattice oxygen.",Sc and Ta-doped SrCoO3-δ perovskite as a high-performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107491
6,12132,"Herein, we partially replace Co with Sc and Ta at SrCoO3-delta to stabilize its cubic perovskite structure and restrain the lattice oxygen loss, thus improving the oxygen-ionic conductivity, and the structural and chemical stability.",Sc and Ta-doped SrCoO3-δ perovskite as a high-performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107491
7,12132,"The synthesized SrSc0.175Ta0.025Co0.8O3.delta (SSTC) cathode achieves a remarkably high ORR performance and an area-specific resistance obtained in this study reaches as low as 0.233, 0.033, and 0.004 Omega cm(2) at 500, 600, and 700 degrees C, respectively.",Sc and Ta-doped SrCoO3-δ perovskite as a high-performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107491
8,12132,The new Sc and Ta-doped SrCoO3-delta perovskite cathode even present a better ORR activity than the previously reported Sc and Nb-doped SrCoO3-delta cathode.,Sc and Ta-doped SrCoO3-δ perovskite as a high-performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107491
9,12132,"The reason for the improved performance by Ta doping is possible that Ta-O bond is stronger than Nb-O bond and the electronegativity of Ta5+ is lower than that of Nb5+, resulting in a lower valence state of cobalt and a higher oxygen vacancies concentration.",Sc and Ta-doped SrCoO3-δ perovskite as a high-performance cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.107491
