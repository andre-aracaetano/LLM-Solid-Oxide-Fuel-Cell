2,17219,"In this paper we demonstrate, however, that silicon doping into Ba2In2O5 leads to a significant enhancement in the oxide ion conductivity.",Silicon Doping in Ba2In2O5: Example of a Beneficial Effect of Silicon Incorporation on Oxide Ion/Proton Conductivity,10.1021/cm102072v
3,17219,"The results indicate that silicon is incorporated into the structure leading to a conversion from an ordered brownmillerite-type structure to a disordered perovskite-type, with the oxygen vacancy disordering leading to the conductivity enhancement.",Silicon Doping in Ba2In2O5: Example of a Beneficial Effect of Silicon Incorporation on Oxide Ion/Proton Conductivity,10.1021/cm102072v
4,17219,"In wet atmospheres, the conductivity is further enhanced through a protonic contribution, leading to conductivities (2.4 x 10(-3) Scm(-1) at 400 degrees C) comparable to the best perovskite proton conductors.",Silicon Doping in Ba2In2O5: Example of a Beneficial Effect of Silicon Incorporation on Oxide Ion/Proton Conductivity,10.1021/cm102072v
5,17219,"Thus, the results show that silicon can be incorporated into the perovskite structure, suggesting further studies in this area are warranted, particularly related to electrode materials.",Silicon Doping in Ba2In2O5: Example of a Beneficial Effect of Silicon Incorporation on Oxide Ion/Proton Conductivity,10.1021/cm102072v
