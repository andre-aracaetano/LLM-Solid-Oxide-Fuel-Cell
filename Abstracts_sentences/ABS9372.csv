1,9372,Three-dimensional microstructure of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell electrodes with dual-phase backbone is simulated numerically.,A numerical study of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell electrode with dual-phase backbone,10.1002/er.4129
2,9372,This work employs LSM (lanthanum strontium manganite) infiltrated LSM yttria-stabilized zirconia composite electrodes as an example.,A numerical study of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell electrode with dual-phase backbone,10.1002/er.4129
3,9372,"Important geometric properties, including percolation probability of LSM, total and percolated three-phase boundary (TPB) lengths, and total and percolated surface areas of LSM, are calculated under various LSM nanoparticle loadings.",A numerical study of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell electrode with dual-phase backbone,10.1002/er.4129
4,9372,"One important finding is that compared with pure yttria-stabilized zirconia backbone, dual-phase backbone results in lower TPB length and has little impact on the surface area of LSM particles.",A numerical study of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell electrode with dual-phase backbone,10.1002/er.4129
5,9372,"Therefore, the addition of LSM backbone may be ineffective, even negative in promoting the electrode performance, however, can significantly reduce the LSM infiltration threshold loading to form a percolating network.",A numerical study of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell electrode with dual-phase backbone,10.1002/er.4129
6,9372,The trade-off between decreasing infiltration cycle and increasing TPB length demands an optimized content of LSM in backbone.,A numerical study of infiltrated solid oxide fuel cell electrode with dual-phase backbone,10.1002/er.4129
