3,19439,"Due to their similar temperature-expansion coefficients, Ni-SDC cermet was used as the anode while Pt was used as the cathode.",MODELLING OF OPERATING PARAMETERS IN AN SOFC TESTING SYSTEM,
4,19439,The aim of this work was to study the materials' responses under operating conditions in the testing set-up.,MODELLING OF OPERATING PARAMETERS IN AN SOFC TESTING SYSTEM,
5,19439,"The temperature gradients generated within the SOFC testing may cause high stresses in the materials, which eventually lead to a delamination of a layered structure.",MODELLING OF OPERATING PARAMETERS IN AN SOFC TESTING SYSTEM,
6,19439,"Since an accurate temperature control in several points of the multilayer SOFC system is rather difficult or even impossible to achieve, a model of mass and energy balances was written and subsequently solved with the method of finite elements in two dimensions.",MODELLING OF OPERATING PARAMETERS IN AN SOFC TESTING SYSTEM,
7,19439,"The results of the mathematical modelling during the warm-up, steady-state or cool-down periods were used to profile the temperatures within the testing SOFC set-up and to predict the dimensional changes of individual layers in the SOFC multilayer structure.",MODELLING OF OPERATING PARAMETERS IN AN SOFC TESTING SYSTEM,
8,19439,The influence of the temperature gradients was also studied experimentally.,MODELLING OF OPERATING PARAMETERS IN AN SOFC TESTING SYSTEM,
9,19439,"Based on the modelling results, an optimization of the operating conditions was proposed in order to reduce the thermal stresses built in the materials.",MODELLING OF OPERATING PARAMETERS IN AN SOFC TESTING SYSTEM,
