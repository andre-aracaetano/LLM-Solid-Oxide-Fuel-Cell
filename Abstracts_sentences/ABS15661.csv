1,15661,The effects of palladium (Pd) on Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta coated Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-delta (SDC/SYT) anodes were investigated for H-2 and CH4 fuels.,Pd catalyzed Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2.δ anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.021
2,15661,The electrochemical oxidations of both H-2 and CH4 were accelerated by Pd impregnation.,Pd catalyzed Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2.δ anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.021
3,15661,"Moreover, Pd in the SDC/SYT (Pd-SDC/SYT) anode improved the cell performance by a factor of approximately 2 for H-2 and 1.5 for CH4.",Pd catalyzed Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2.δ anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.021
4,15661,"The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the wet CH4 fuel increased with increasing temperature for both the SDC/SYT anode cell and Pd-SDC/SYT anode cell, which differs from that of the H-2 fuel.",Pd catalyzed Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2.δ anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.021
5,15661,"Notably, the OCV values of the Pd-SDC/SYT anode cell using wet CH4 were much higher than those using wet H-2.",Pd catalyzed Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2.δ anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.021
6,15661,"We observed differing potentials for the reformed gases after the out-of-cell catalyst experiment, and the CH4 fuel with the Pd-SDC catalyst layer agreed well with the OCVs of the Pd-SDC/SYT anode cell with directly introduced wet CH4 fuel.",Pd catalyzed Sr0.92Y0.08TiO3-δ/Sm0.2Ce0.8O2.δ anodes in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.01.021
7,15661,These results indicate the OCVs were higher than the theoretical values based on electrochemical hydrogen oxidation at increased temperatures in the Pd-SDC/SYT anode cell because of the lower water partial pressure caused by the increased steam reformation activity of Pd.
