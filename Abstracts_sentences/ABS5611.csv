1,5611,"Bi2O3-based composite cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells are generally sintered at a low temperature of 750-800 degrees C, but the detailed information regarding the generation of electrode/electrolyte interface and its effect on the polarization performance are scarcely known.",Accelerating effect of polarization on electrode/electrolyte interface generation and electrocatalytic performance of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 decorated Sm0.95CoO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228281
2,5611,"Here we assemble nanostructured 10-40 wt% Er0.4Bi1.6O3 decorated Sm0.95CoO3-delta (ESB-SmC) composite cathodes on 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte without sintering at high temperatures and the best performance is obtained on 20 wt% ESB decorated SmC, achieving a peak power density of 1.66 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C. We adopt a stepwise annealing approach under open circuit and polarization conditions, so as to in situ evaluate the extent of electrode/electrolyte interface generation.",Accelerating effect of polarization on electrode/electrolyte interface generation and electrocatalytic performance of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 decorated Sm0.95CoO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228281
3,5611,"The results show that under open circuit conditions, the electrode/electrolyte interface of 20 wt% ESB decorated SmC electrode can be generated by annealing at 750 degrees C and higher, but the polarization remarkably accelerates the interface generation at lower temperatures of 600-700 degrees C.",Accelerating effect of polarization on electrode/electrolyte interface generation and electrocatalytic performance of Er0.4Bi1.6O3 decorated Sm0.95CoO3-δ cathodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228281
