3,8976,"Utilizing co-doping of high valence niobium with low valence nickel, we developed a cathode material La0.8Sr0.2Fe0.8Ni0.15Nb0.05O3-delta that allowed representing adequate conductivity of 214 S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C, decent thermal compatibility with thermal expansion coefficient being 12 x 10(-6) K-1, superior electrochemical properties manifested by area-specific resistance of 0.06 Omega cm(2) and peak power density of 760 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C, and excellent discharge durability of over 480 h at a current density of 460 mA cm(-2) under 750 degrees C. This significantly enhanced performance originates from a proper regulation of the electronic structure rendered by synergistic effects induced by the co-doping of the high valence niobium with low valence nickel into the B sites of the ferrite perovskite.",Valence regulation of ferrite perovskite for high performance cobalt-free cathode of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1002/er.8583
