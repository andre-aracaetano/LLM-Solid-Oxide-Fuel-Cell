1,1559,beta-Al2O3 has been proven as a fast ionic conductor in solid batteries due to its unique structure.,Enhanced Proton Transport of β-Al2O3 Modified by LiAlO2 as a High-Performance Electrolyte for a Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and an Electrolyzer,10.1021/acsami.3c07484
2,1559,"In this work, beta-Al2O3 was further modified by LiAlO2 and employed as the electrolyte material for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers, i.e., proton-conducting ceramic fuel cells and electrolysis cells, named as PCFC and PCEC, respectively.",Enhanced Proton Transport of β-Al2O3 Modified by LiAlO2 as a High-Performance Electrolyte for a Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and an Electrolyzer,10.1021/acsami.3c07484
3,1559,"At 550 degrees C, thanks to this superior electrolyte with a remarkable conductivity of 0.161 S center dot cm(-1), the PCFC reached a high power density up to 1029 mW center dot cm(-2), and the PCEC demonstrated a significant current density of 1.49 A center dot cm(-2) at a low operation voltage of 2.0 V. It has been found that the introduction of the LiAlO2 phase into beta-Al2O3 reduces the total impedance, while it increases the oxygen vacancy concentration and thus promotes the proton transport process with the reduced activation energy.",Enhanced Proton Transport of β-Al2O3 Modified by LiAlO2 as a High-Performance Electrolyte for a Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and an Electrolyzer,10.1021/acsami.3c07484
4,1559,This work provides a new approach for exploring two-dimensional materials with high-ionic conductivity that can be applied for solid oxide fuel cells and water electrolyzers and more wider power-to-X devices such as electrosynthesis for green ammonia production.,Enhanced Proton Transport of β-Al2O3 Modified by LiAlO2 as a High-Performance Electrolyte for a Low-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell and an Electrolyzer,10.1021/acsami.3c07484
