2,18069,"Moreover, possible reaction mechanisms for one cathode should be different when operating in oxygen ion conducting SOFCs (O-SOFC) and in proton conducting SOFCs (P-SOFCs), and therefore, they lead to different reaction rates.",A first-principles study on divergent reactions of using a Sr3Fe2O7 cathode in both oxygen ion conducting and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ra04059a

5,18069,"Compared with La0.5Sr0.5Co0.25Fe0.75O3 (LSCF), the low formation energies of oxygen vacancies and low migration energy barriers for oxygen ions in SFO make oxygen conduction more preferable which is essential for cathode reactions in O-SOFCs.",A first-principles study on divergent reactions of using a Sr3Fe2O7 cathode in both oxygen ion conducting and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ra04059a
6,18069,"Nevertheless, a large energy barrier (2.28 eV) is predicted for oxygen dissociation reaction over the SFO (001) surface, while there is a zero barrier over the LSCF (001) surface.",A first-principles study on divergent reactions of using a Sr3Fe2O7 cathode in both oxygen ion conducting and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ra04059a
7,18069,"This result clearly indicates that SFO shows a weaker activity toward the oxygen reduction, which may be due to the low surface energies and the specific R-P structure.",A first-principles study on divergent reactions of using a Sr3Fe2O7 cathode in both oxygen ion conducting and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ra04059a
8,18069,"Interestingly, in P-SOFCs, the presence of protons on the SFO (001) surface can largely depress the energy barriers to around 1.46-1.58 eV.",A first-principles study on divergent reactions of using a Sr3Fe2O7 cathode in both oxygen ion conducting and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ra04059a
9,18069,"Moreover, surface protons benefit the oxygen adsorption and dissociation over the SFO (001) surface.",A first-principles study on divergent reactions of using a Sr3Fe2O7 cathode in both oxygen ion conducting and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ra04059a
10,18069,This result together with the extremely low formation energies and migration energy barriers for protons seem to suggest that SFO could work more effectively in P-SOFCs than in O-SOFCs.,A first-principles study on divergent reactions of using a Sr3Fe2O7 cathode in both oxygen ion conducting and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ra04059a
11,18069,"It's also suggested that too many protons at the SFO surface will lead to high energy barriers for the water formation process, and thus that over-ranging steam concentrations in the testing atmosphere may have a negative effect on cell performances.",A first-principles study on divergent reactions of using a Sr3Fe2O7 cathode in both oxygen ion conducting and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ra04059a
12,18069,Our study firstly and clearly presents the different energy barriers for one cathode performing in both O- and P-SOFCs according to their different working mechanisms.,A first-principles study on divergent reactions of using a Sr3Fe2O7 cathode in both oxygen ion conducting and proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c8ra04059a
