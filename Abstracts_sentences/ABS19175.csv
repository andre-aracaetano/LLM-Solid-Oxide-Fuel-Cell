3,19175,"In this study, to prepare ceramic La0.6Sr0.4Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-delta (LSTF) pastes, EC was mixed with an organic solvent, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, and LSTF powder.",Rheological analysis of ceramic pastes with ethyl cellulose for screen-printing,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.032
4,19175,"The effects of EC and LSTF particle contents were investigated on the rheological properties of the pastes, using shear, stress, frequency-dependence, and a 3-step recovery tests.",Rheological analysis of ceramic pastes with ethyl cellulose for screen-printing,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.032
5,19175,"The recovery ratio of the pastes in the 3-step tests was found to depend strongly on their EC and LSTF particle contents, decreasing at higher contents due to the formation of a strong network.",Rheological analysis of ceramic pastes with ethyl cellulose for screen-printing,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.032
6,19175,"We also investigated the microstructure and surfaces of thick films fabricated through screen-printing, and confirmed that pastes with a low recovery ratio and high viscosity afford smooth surface profiles.",Rheological analysis of ceramic pastes with ethyl cellulose for screen-printing,10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.01.032
