1,3019,"Chromium poisoning as a result of Cr evaporation from the metallic components and the subsequent deposition on the cathode (i.e., air) side is one of the most critical degradation mechanisms in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks.",Degradation Analysis of Long-Term Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks with Respect to Chromium Poisoning in La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2c11
2,3019,"Recently, the LSC cathode (i.e., La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta ) exhibited more promising results in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes than the LSCF (i.e., La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta ) due to its higher ionic conductivity, despite a relatively high thermal expansion coefficient (TEC).",Degradation Analysis of Long-Term Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks with Respect to Chromium Poisoning in La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2c11
3,3019,"Furthermore, it has been reported that the oxygen surface exchange kinetics and Sr stability/activity in LSC may imply higher resistance against Cr poisoning in comparison to LSCF.",Degradation Analysis of Long-Term Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks with Respect to Chromium Poisoning in La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2c11
4,3019,"For these reasons, long-term stack operation with both LSCF and LSC cathodes was performed for two different stack designs.",Degradation Analysis of Long-Term Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks with Respect to Chromium Poisoning in La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2c11
5,3019,The degradation behavior of the stacks with respect to Cr poisoning was analyzed with the support of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and post-mortem analysis.,Degradation Analysis of Long-Term Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks with Respect to Chromium Poisoning in La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Cathodes,10.1149/1945-7111/ac2c11
