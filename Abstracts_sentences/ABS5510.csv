1,5510,Dy- and Tb-doped CeO2-Ni cermets for highly active solid-oxide fuel-cell (SOFC) anodes were fabricated by a one-pot electrodeposition process.,"Dy- and Tb-doped CeO2-Ni cermets for solid oxide fuel cell anodes: electrochemical fabrication, structural characterization, and electrocatalytic performance",10.1007/s10008-018-4064-2
2,5510,"Undoped, singly-doped, and co-doped powders were synthesized in an X-ray amorphous state, heat treated in air, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at different crystallization stages.","Dy- and Tb-doped CeO2-Ni cermets for solid oxide fuel cell anodes: electrochemical fabrication, structural characterization, and electrocatalytic performance",10.1007/s10008-018-4064-2
3,5510,"In particular, in situ TEM analyses were carried out during heating in an oxygen atmosphere, in order to follow the evolution of structure and morphology and to understand the role of the dopants.","Dy- and Tb-doped CeO2-Ni cermets for solid oxide fuel cell anodes: electrochemical fabrication, structural characterization, and electrocatalytic performance",10.1007/s10008-018-4064-2
4,5510,The key structural effect of dopants was the inhibition of grain coarsening during heat treatment.,"Dy- and Tb-doped CeO2-Ni cermets for solid oxide fuel cell anodes: electrochemical fabrication, structural characterization, and electrocatalytic performance",10.1007/s10008-018-4064-2
5,5510,"Functional tests were carried out with micro-single chamber SOFCs, fed with a CH4/O-2 mixture, the anodes of which were prepared with the CeO2-Ni powders synthesized in this study.","Dy- and Tb-doped CeO2-Ni cermets for solid oxide fuel cell anodes: electrochemical fabrication, structural characterization, and electrocatalytic performance",10.1007/s10008-018-4064-2
6,5510,"A correlation was established between the electrocatalytic performance and the morphology of the anodic material, pinpointing that the finer and more homogeneous nanocrystalline structure of the doped powders results in better-defined and more active catalytic sites, thus improving the performance of the cell.","Dy- and Tb-doped CeO2-Ni cermets for solid oxide fuel cell anodes: electrochemical fabrication, structural characterization, and electrocatalytic performance",10.1007/s10008-018-4064-2
