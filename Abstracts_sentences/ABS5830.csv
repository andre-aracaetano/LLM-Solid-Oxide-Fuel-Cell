4,5830,"The maximum power densities are: 665, 504, 344, 214, and 118 mW cm(-2) at 700, 650, 600, 550, and 500 degrees C, respectively.",High performance proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with a stable Sm0.5Sr0.5Co3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ composite cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.100
5,5830,"Moreover, the SSC-SDC cathode shows an essentially stable performance for 25 h at 600 degrees C with a constant Output voltage of 0.5 V. This excellent performance implies that SSC-SDC, which is a typical cathode material for SOFCs based on oxide ionic conductor, is also a promising alternative cathode for H-SOFCs.",High performance proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells with a stable Sm0.5Sr0.5Co3-δ-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-δ composite cathode,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.100
