2,10017,"A cathode layer, consisting of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3 and 10 wt % SDC, is subsequently screen printed on the electrolyte to form a single cell, which is tested at temperatures from 400 to 600 degreesC. When humidified (3% H2O) hydrogen or methane is used as fuel and stationary air as oxidant, the maximum power densities are 188 (or 78) and 397 (or 304) mW/cm(2) at 500 and 600 degreesC, respectively.",Reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells fabricated by screen printing,10.1149/1.1361158
3,10017,"Impedance analysis indicates that the performances of the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) below 550 degreesC are determined primarily by the interfacial resistance, implying that the development of catalytically active electrode materials is critical to the successful development of high-performance SOFCs to be operated at temperatures below 600 degreesC.
