1,11878,"Sr surface segregation (SSS) in perovskite materials is a main factor causing efficiency degradation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC's), and therefore can affect the La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-delta perovskite, which is known as a compatible anode and cathode in a reversible and symmetric SOFC.",Perovskite La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ Catalysis Raises the Bar: Preventing Unwanted Near-Surface Sr Segregation and SrCO3 Precipitation,10.1002/adts.202100173
2,11878,"As a result of segregation, the atomic rearrangements in the near-surface environment are likely to generate additional phases to the original one such as strontium carbonate (SrCO3) at high CO2 pressure.",Perovskite La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ Catalysis Raises the Bar: Preventing Unwanted Near-Surface Sr Segregation and SrCO3 Precipitation,10.1002/adts.202100173
3,11878,"In the current work, first principal calculations are carried out for modeling the initial formation of SrCO3 after Sr segregation in LSFCr with CO2 presence.",Perovskite La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ Catalysis Raises the Bar: Preventing Unwanted Near-Surface Sr Segregation and SrCO3 Precipitation,10.1002/adts.202100173
4,11878,"It is found that the tendency of CO2 to participate in SrCO3 phase formation is a competing reaction to its reduction to CO on the LSFCr material, and O vacancies are needed not only to improve CO2 reduction but also to block the competing reaction of SrCO3 adsorption.",Perovskite La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ Catalysis Raises the Bar: Preventing Unwanted Near-Surface Sr Segregation and SrCO3 Precipitation,10.1002/adts.202100173
5,11878,"Therefore, LSFCr successfully raises the bar of CO2 reduction catalytic efficiency by preventing unwanted Sr segregation at high concentrations of surface oxygen vacancies.",Perovskite La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-δ Catalysis Raises the Bar: Preventing Unwanted Near-Surface Sr Segregation and SrCO3 Precipitation,10.1002/adts.202100173
