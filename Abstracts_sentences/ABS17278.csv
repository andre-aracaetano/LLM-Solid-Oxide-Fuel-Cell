1,17278,Doped lanthanum chromites are investigated as ceramic interconnect materials to be used in high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Complex precursors for doped lanthanum chromite synthesis,10.1023/A:1013297430679
2,17278,"This paper deals with the preparation of LaCr1-xMxO3 (M = Ni, Cu, x = 0 - 0.2) from complex precursors isolated in the La(No-3)(3)-Cr(NO3)(3)-M(NO3)(2)-urea system.",Complex precursors for doped lanthanum chromite synthesis,10.1023/A:1013297430679
3,17278,"The isolated complex precursors were characterized by atomic absorption spectrometry, electronic, and FT-IR spectra, as well as, by thermal analysis.",Complex precursors for doped lanthanum chromite synthesis,10.1023/A:1013297430679
4,17278,"Doped lanthanum chromites, LaCr1-xMxO3 (M = Ni, Cu) were prepared by calcining of corresponding urea-based precursors at 1000-1200degreesC for 2 h. Doped mixed-oxide samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron-microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX), electrical conductivity, as well as magnetic measurements.",Complex precursors for doped lanthanum chromite synthesis,10.1023/A:1013297430679
