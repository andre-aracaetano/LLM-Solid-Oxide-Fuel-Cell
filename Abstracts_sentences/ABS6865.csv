3,6865,The results show that nano-sized BaCe0.8Sm0.1Gd0.1O3-delta powders with single orthorhombic perovskite structure were prepared by this process successfully.,Synthesis of BaCe0.8Sm0.1Gd0.1O3-δ electrolyte by a sol-combustion method,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.04.084
4,6865,"The powders showed high sinterability, and a relative of 95.2% of the theoretical density was obtained at a sintering temperature of 1400 degrees C. Electrochemistry measurements showed that the BaCe0.8Sm0.1Gd0.1O3-delta ceramics had relatively high oxygen ionic conductivity in low-temperature range.",Synthesis of BaCe0.8Sm0.1Gd0.1O3-δ electrolyte by a sol-combustion method,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.04.084
