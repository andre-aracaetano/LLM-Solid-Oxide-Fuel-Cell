2,10758,"This study investigates the effect of lead oxide (PbO), which is usually present in Ag paste, on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the typical electrocatalysts, lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) and lanthanum strontium ferrite (LSF), for intermediate-temperature SOFCs.",PbO effect on the oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.245
3,10758,The chemical oxygen surface exchange coefficients are greatly increased by the deposition of PbO particles on the LSCF and LSF bar surfaces as demonstrated by the electrical conductivity relaxation technique.,PbO effect on the oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.245
4,10758,"For example, at 800 degrees C, the deposition of 0.074 mg cm(-2) PbO particles increases the coefficients from 4.68 x 10(-5) to 7.2 x 10(-4) cm s(-1) and from 2.62 x 10(-5) to 1.60 x 10(-4) cm s(-1) for LSCF and LSF, respectively.",PbO effect on the oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.245
5,10758,"Furthermore, the infiltration of PbO into porous LSCF and LSF electrodes significantly improves the ORR as determined with AC impedance spectroscopy using symmetrical cells comprising of samaria-doped ceria as the electrolyte.",PbO effect on the oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.245
6,10758,"When 5.88 and 5.67 wt % PbO is infiltrated into the porous backbone of LSCF and LSF electrodes, at 650 degrees C, the area specific interfacial polarization resistance (ASR) is reduced from 0.26 to 0.14 U cm(2) and from 1.34 to 0.37 U cm(2), respectively.",PbO effect on the oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.245
7,10758,The distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis suggests that PbO efficiently accelerate the charge transfer and oxygen incorporation processes.,PbO effect on the oxygen reduction reaction in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.245
