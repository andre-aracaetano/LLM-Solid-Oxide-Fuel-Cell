7,21100,"A noticeable distortion of CoO6 octahedra is observed for x = 0.05 and 0.1, exhibiting a charge-ordering with a mixed oxidation state of Co3+/(4+) at Co1 sites and Co3+ at Co2 positions: the Jahn-Teller Co3+ in an intermediate-spin configuration is responsible for the octahedral distortion.",Evolution of cobalt spin states and magnetic coupling along the SrCo1-xSbxO3-δ system: correlation with the crystal structure,10.1039/c1cp20849g
8,21100,"Increasing Sb contents promotes a higher average oxidation state of cobalt, from a valence of 3.2+ for x = 0.05 to 3.4+ for x = 0.2, inducing a decrease of the oxygen vacancies and favouring a random distribution over a Pm (3) over barm cubic symmetry.",Evolution of cobalt spin states and magnetic coupling along the SrCo1-xSbxO3-δ system: correlation with the crystal structure,10.1039/c1cp20849g
