1,9605,Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems are the most advanced power generation system with the highest thermal efficiency.,Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
2,9605,"The current trend of research on the SOFC systems is focused on multikilowatt scale systems, which require either internal reforming within the stack or a compact external reformer.",Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
3,9605,"Even if the internal reforming within the SOFC stack allows compact system configuration, it causes significant and complicated temperature gradients within the stack, due to endothermic reforming reactions and exothermic electrochemical reactions.",Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
4,9605,"As an alternative solution to the internal reforming, an external compact heat exchange reformer (CHER) is investigated in this work.",Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
5,9605,"The CHER is based on a typical plate-fin counterflow or coflow heat exchanger platform, and it can save space without causing large thermal stress and degradation to the SOFC stack (i.e., eventually reducing the overall system cost).",Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
6,9605,"In this work, a previously developed transient dynamic model of the CHER is validated by experiments.",Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
7,9605,"An experimental apparatus, which comprises the CHER, air heater, gas heater, steam generator, several mass flow controllers, and controller cabinet, was designed to investigate steady state reforming performance of the CHER for various hot air inlet temperatures (thermal energy source) and steam to carbon ratios (SCRs).",Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
8,9605,The transient thermal dynamics of the CHER was also measured and compared with simulations when the CHER is used as a heat exchanger with inert gas.,Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
9,9605,"The measured transient dynamics of CHER matches very well with simulations, validating the heat transfer model within the CHER.",Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
10,9605,The measured molar fractions of reformate gases at steady state also agree well with the simulations validating the used reaction kinetics.,Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
11,9605,"The transient CHER model can be easily integrated into a total integrated SOFC system, and the model can be also used for optimal design of similar CHERs and provides a guideline to select optimal operating conditions of the CHERs and the integrated SOFC system.",Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Model of Compact Heat Exchange Reformer for High-Temperature Fuel Cell Systems,10.1115/1.4025524
