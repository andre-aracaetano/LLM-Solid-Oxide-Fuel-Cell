1,10315,Anode-supported planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) were successfully fabricated by a single step co-firing process.,Polarization measurements on single-step co-fired solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.003
2,10315,"The cells comprised of a Ni + yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode, a YSZ or scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) electrolyte, a (La0.85Ca0.15)(0.97)MnO3 (LCM) + YSZ cathode active layer, and an LCM cathode current collector layer.",Polarization measurements on single-step co-fired solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.003
3,10315,"The fabrication process involved tape casting of the anode, screen printing of the electrolyte and the cathode, and single step co-firing of the green-state cells in the temperature range of 1300-1330 degrees C for 2 h. Cells were tested in the temperature range of 700-800 degrees C with humidified hydrogen as fuel and air as oxidant.",Polarization measurements on single-step co-fired solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.003
4,10315,"Cell test results and polarization modeling showed that the polarization losses were dominated by the ohmic loss associated with the electrodes and the activation polarization of the cathode, and that the ohmic loss due to the ionic resistance of the electrolyte and the activation polarization of the anode were relatively insignificant.",Polarization measurements on single-step co-fired solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.003
5,10315,Ohmic resistance associated with the electrode was lowered by improving the electrical contact between the electrode and the current collector.,Polarization measurements on single-step co-fired solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.003
6,10315,Activation polarization of the cathode was reduced by the improvement of the microstructure of the cathode active layer and lowering the cell sintering temperature.,Polarization measurements on single-step co-fired solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.003
7,10315,The cell performance was further improved by increasing the porosity in the anode.,Polarization measurements on single-step co-fired solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.003
8,10315,"As a result, the maximum power density of 1.5 W cm(-2) was achieved at 800 degrees C with humidified hydrogen and air.",Polarization measurements on single-step co-fired solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.003
