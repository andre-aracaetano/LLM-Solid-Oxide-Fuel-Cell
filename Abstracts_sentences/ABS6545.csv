2,6545,The two cathode materials (LiMn2O4 and nanofibers of LiMn2O4) and the anode material (graphene/polyaniline/carbon-nanotube) were synthesized by a wet chemical method which includes sol-gel and chemical polymerization techniques.,"To Study the Effect of LiMn2O4, Nanofibers of LiMn2O4, and Graphene/Polyaniline/Carbon Nanotube as Electrode Materials in the Fuel Cell",10.14447/jnmes.v23i1.a01
3,6545,"The prepared materials were characterized by SEM, XRD FTIR, and cyclic voltammetry.","To Study the Effect of LiMn2O4, Nanofibers of LiMn2O4, and Graphene/Polyaniline/Carbon Nanotube as Electrode Materials in the Fuel Cell",10.14447/jnmes.v23i1.a01
4,6545,"The characterization results show that LiMn2O4 exhibits a porous and hollow structure, which improves the utilization of the active mass area, and allows the dual conduction of Li+ and electrons, which effectively relieves the structural strain and volume change The cyclic voltammetry results record that LiMn2O4 and nanofibers of LiMn2O4 as a cathode material enhanced the cycling performance and possess excellent stability.","To Study the Effect of LiMn2O4, Nanofibers of LiMn2O4, and Graphene/Polyaniline/Carbon Nanotube as Electrode Materials in the Fuel Cell",10.14447/jnmes.v23i1.a01
5,6545,"Further, the conductivity of each sample was measured using the DC four-probe method, and the highest conductivity was observed for the LiMn2O4 nanofibers 1.43 SCm-1 at 650 degrees C.","To Study the Effect of LiMn2O4, Nanofibers of LiMn2O4, and Graphene/Polyaniline/Carbon Nanotube as Electrode Materials in the Fuel Cell",10.14447/jnmes.v23i1.a01
