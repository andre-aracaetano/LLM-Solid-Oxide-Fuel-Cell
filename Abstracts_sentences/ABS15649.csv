3,15649,Results show that the process of a CO2/CH4 redox SOC is exactly a combination of the cathode process of a CO2-SOEC and the anode process of a CH4-SOFC.,Simultaneous Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide and Partial Oxidation of Methane in a Solid Oxide Cell with Silver-Based Cathode and Nickel-Based Anode,10.1149/1945-7111/ac554d
4,15649,"With the same CO and syngas obtained, a CO2/CH4 redox SOC consumes less energy because it avoids oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of a CO2-SOEC and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of a CH4-SOFC.",Simultaneous Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide and Partial Oxidation of Methane in a Solid Oxide Cell with Silver-Based Cathode and Nickel-Based Anode,10.1149/1945-7111/ac554d
5,15649,"At 500 mA cm(-2), the overall resistance of an electrolyte-supported CO2/CH4 redox SOC is only half of that for separately reducing CO2 in an SOEC and oxidizing CH4 in an SOFC.",Simultaneous Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide and Partial Oxidation of Methane in a Solid Oxide Cell with Silver-Based Cathode and Nickel-Based Anode,10.1149/1945-7111/ac554d

7,15649,An anode-supported CO2/CH4 redox SOC is operated stably for 110 h at 1 A cm(-2) under an applied voltage of similar to 0.9 V. Sufficient current density may prevent high performance Ni-based anode from coking.,Simultaneous Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide and Partial Oxidation of Methane in a Solid Oxide Cell with Silver-Based Cathode and Nickel-Based Anode,10.1149/1945-7111/ac554d
