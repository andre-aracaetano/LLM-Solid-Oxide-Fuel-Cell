1,17226,"The effect of iron substitution in perovskite-type (La0.9Sr0.1)(0.98)Cr0.9-xFexMg0.1O3-delta (x = 0-0.3) is evaluated with emphasis on the properties relevant for solid oxide fuel cell anode application including the phase stability, oxygen nonstoichiometry, mixed ionic-electronic transport, thermochemical expansion and electrochemical activity.","Mixed conductivity, thermochemical expansion and electrochemical activity of Fe-substituted (La,Sr)(Cr,Mg)O3-δ for solid oxide fuel cell anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.129
2,17226,"Thermogravimetric analysis, Mossbauer spectroscopy and electrical measurements in combination with X-ray diffraction confirm the stability of perovskite phase for x = 0.3 down to p(O-2) as low as 10(-19) atm at 1223 K. Mossbauer spectroscopy results indicate also that iron cations substitute in 3+ oxidation state in both oxidized and reduced material.","Mixed conductivity, thermochemical expansion and electrochemical activity of Fe-substituted (La,Sr)(Cr,Mg)O3-δ for solid oxide fuel cell anodes",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.129
