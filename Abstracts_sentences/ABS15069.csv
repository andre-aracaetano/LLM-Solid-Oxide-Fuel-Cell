1,15069,"The structural properties of polycrystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been studied using FT-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).","Structural and compositional characterization of yttria-stabilized zirconia: Evidence of surface-stabilized, low-valence metal species",10.1021/ac048600u
2,15069,"Yttria content was varied between 8 and 15% (by mole fraction) to determine compositional effects on YSZ phonon structure, lattice parameter, and oxidation state.","Structural and compositional characterization of yttria-stabilized zirconia: Evidence of surface-stabilized, low-valence metal species",10.1021/ac048600u
3,15069,The dominant feature in the low-frequency Raman spectrum correlates quite closely with the material's sole (cubic) lattice parameter.,"Structural and compositional characterization of yttria-stabilized zirconia: Evidence of surface-stabilized, low-valence metal species",10.1021/ac048600u
4,15069,XPS measurements of typical YSZ samples show only a single species of both Y and Zr.,"Structural and compositional characterization of yttria-stabilized zirconia: Evidence of surface-stabilized, low-valence metal species",10.1021/ac048600u
5,15069,"After exposing YSZ to a reducing environment (H-2) at elevated temperatures (1000 degrees C), however, the XPS spectra of YSZ show new features at lower binding energy for both Y and Zr.","Structural and compositional characterization of yttria-stabilized zirconia: Evidence of surface-stabilized, low-valence metal species",10.1021/ac048600u
6,15069,Angle-resolved XPS measurements suggest that these reduced forms of Y and Zr exist only within the first few molecular layers of the sample.,"Structural and compositional characterization of yttria-stabilized zirconia: Evidence of surface-stabilized, low-valence metal species",10.1021/ac048600u
7,15069,"This treatment does not effect the XRD pattern, nor does it change the low-frequency phonon structure observed in the Raman spectrum, although the Raman spectrum does experience similar to 50% reduction in overall signal intensity.","Structural and compositional characterization of yttria-stabilized zirconia: Evidence of surface-stabilized, low-valence metal species",10.1021/ac048600u
8,15069,These disparities are reconciled with each other based on differences in each technique's sampling depth.,"Structural and compositional characterization of yttria-stabilized zirconia: Evidence of surface-stabilized, low-valence metal species",10.1021/ac048600u
9,15069,The impact that surface-reduced YSZ may have on the chemistry occurring within solid oxide fuel cells is discussed briefly.,"Structural and compositional characterization of yttria-stabilized zirconia: Evidence of surface-stabilized, low-valence metal species",10.1021/ac048600u
