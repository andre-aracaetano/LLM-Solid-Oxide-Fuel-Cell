1,11536,"Various lanthanum-strontium ferromanganites (La1-xSrx)(Mn1-yFey)O3 +/- delta (LSMF) with x = 0.2, 0.5 and 0.7 and y = 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 were prepared by a glycine-nitrate combustion route and conditioned into two different oxygenation states which are likely to be encountered in cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC).",An X-ray powder diffraction study of lanthanum- strontium ferromanganites,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00985-7
2,11536,Crystal symmetries for both the low and the fully oxygenated states were determined by X-ray diffractometry.,An X-ray powder diffraction study of lanthanum- strontium ferromanganites,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00985-7
3,11536,"Most perovskite compositions crystallized in either cubic or rhombohedral symmetry with the exception of La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.2Fe0.8O3 +/- delta, where a transition from rhombohedral to cubic occurred in going from the full to the low oxygenation state.",An X-ray powder diffraction study of lanthanum- strontium ferromanganites,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00985-7
4,11536,"In addition, two strontium-poor compositions, La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 +/- delta and La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.8O3 +/- delta, remained diphasic and consisted of a combination of both the rhombohedral and the orthorhombic phases.",An X-ray powder diffraction study of lanthanum- strontium ferromanganites,10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00985-7
