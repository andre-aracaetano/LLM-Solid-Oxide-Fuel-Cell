2,8341,"Several international developments are discussed, especially small portable applications, which demand fast start and multiple cycles.",Progress in Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02350.x
3,8341,Extrusion is the main method for making microtubular SOFCs because improved structure and properties can result from better mixing of the component particles and coextrusion can integrate several cell components in one process step.,Progress in Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02350.x
4,8341,"When the tubes are < 3 mm in diameter, it is shown that the power density and thermal shock resistance are much increased, with start-up in a few seconds rather than hours for planar designs, as demonstrated in a single-cell hand-held system running on butane.",Progress in Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02350.x
5,8341,"The problems of cycling, both thermal and redox, are then considered in detail.",Progress in Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02350.x
6,8341,Thermal cycling degradation follows a fatigue curve whereas redox damage is linear with the number of cycles.,Progress in Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1111/j.1744-7402.2008.02350.x
