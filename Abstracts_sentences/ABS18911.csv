3,18911,It is found that the substitutional Mn atom prefers to diffuse along the 1 1 1 crystal direction with activation energy of about 0.40 eV.,Mn diffusion in the ferritic Fe-25 %Cr Alloy: A First-principles study,10.1016/j.mseb.2022.116042
4,18911,"The interstitial Mn atom diffuses across the crystal between two tetrahedral interstitials with activation energy of about 1.37 eV. Under the working temperature of SOFCs at 600 degrees C-800 degrees C, the magnitude of diffusion coefficients mainly varies from 10-1510-10 m2/s which is qualitatively consistent with the experimental result that diffusion rate following the order of DMn > DCr.",Mn diffusion in the ferritic Fe-25 %Cr Alloy: A First-principles study,10.1016/j.mseb.2022.116042
