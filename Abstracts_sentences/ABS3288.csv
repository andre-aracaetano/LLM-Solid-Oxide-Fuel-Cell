1,3288,This paper presents the evaluation of the performance of a 100 W Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) stack with CO rich fuels as anode gas.,Characterization of a 100 W SOFC stack fed by carbon monoxide rich fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.060
2,3288,The study aims at measuring the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) and the Area Specific Resistance (ASR) when the amount of CO in the anode flow varies from 0 to 40% in volume.,Characterization of a 100 W SOFC stack fed by carbon monoxide rich fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.060
3,3288,"At the same time, the FCTestQA procedures were applied and evaluated as methodology for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell testing.",Characterization of a 100 W SOFC stack fed by carbon monoxide rich fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.060
4,3288,The theoretical OCV was measured considering both H-2 and CO oxidation and the water gas shift reaction.,Characterization of a 100 W SOFC stack fed by carbon monoxide rich fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.060
5,3288,"The OCV values, as a function of CO concentration, resulted closely related to theoretical ones and the ASR value, calculated for different mixtures of fuel, did not change with anode gas composition and it seemed to be a function of the temperature and the degradation of the materials only.",Characterization of a 100 W SOFC stack fed by carbon monoxide rich fuels,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.060
