1,7700,"Pd, Ru, and Cu secondary catalysts were incorporated into the nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia nanostructured-anode functional layer (nano-AFL) of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) by a combination of pulsed-laser-deposition and sputtering.",Effect of secondary metal catalysts on butane internal steam reforming operation of thin-film solid oxide fuel cells at 500-600 째C,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118349
2,7700,"The activity of these catalysts for direct internal steam reforming (DISR) of n-butane at the SOFC unit cell level were investigated at low temperatures (500-600 degrees C) by comparing the electrochemical performance among the Ref-cell (the cell without catalyst at the nano-AFL) and Pd-, Ru-, and Cu-cell (the cells with Pd-, Ru- and Cu- incorporated at the nano-AFL).",Effect of secondary metal catalysts on butane internal steam reforming operation of thin-film solid oxide fuel cells at 500-600 째C,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118349
3,7700,"The steam-to-carbon ratio (SCR) and the operating temperature were varied and the effect on DISR of n-butane in the Ref-, Pd-, Ru-, and Cu-cell were systematically studied.",Effect of secondary metal catalysts on butane internal steam reforming operation of thin-film solid oxide fuel cells at 500-600 째C,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118349
4,7700,"Secondary catalyst incorporation appears to enhance the electrochemical reaction and thermochemical reactions, such as steam reforming and water-gas-shift reactions, which results in the cell performance improvement at all tested conditions in comparison with that of the Ref-cell.",Effect of secondary metal catalysts on butane internal steam reforming operation of thin-film solid oxide fuel cells at 500-600 째C,10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118349
