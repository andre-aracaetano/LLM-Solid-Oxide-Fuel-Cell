1,1890,La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe08O3 (LSCF) and LSCF-Ce0.8Gd0.2O3 (GDC) composite cathodes on YSZ electrolytes were studied for potential applications in low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,"Electrochemical performance of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O3 composite cathodes",
2,1890,Impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed in oxygen partial pressures ranging from 10(-3) to 1 atm over a temperature range from 500 to 750degreesC.,"Electrochemical performance of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O3 composite cathodes",
3,1890,"The LSCF electrodes yielded low-current interfacial resistance values that were a factor of 10 lower than for (La,Sr)MnO3 cathodes.","Electrochemical performance of (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-(Ce,Gd)O3 composite cathodes",
4,1890,"The addition of 50 vol.% GDC to LSCF resulted in an additional factor of approximate to 10 decrease in the polarization resistance, Polarization resistance values for the LSCF-GDC cathodes were as low as 0.01 Omega cm(2) at 750degreesC and 0.33 Omega cm(2) at 600degreesC.
