1,4216,Linear thermal expansion and electrical conductivity of titanium substituted LaCrO3 have been studied as ceramic interconnect materials in high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells.,Influence of Ti substitution on the thermal expansion and electrical conductive properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.112.167
2,4216,The transition temperature from orthorhombic to rhombohedral symmetry has a tendency to increase with decreasing Ti content in the perovskites.,Influence of Ti substitution on the thermal expansion and electrical conductive properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.112.167
3,4216,"At Ti content greater than or equal to0.2, the phase transition was not observed in the temperature range from room temperature to 1273 K. Average linear thermal expansion coefficient of the Ti substituted perovskites increased with increasing Ti content and approaches that of 8 mol%Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 electrolyte.",Influence of Ti substitution on the thermal expansion and electrical conductive properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.112.167
4,4216,Electrical conductivity of the lanthanum chromites decreased with increasing Ti content.,Influence of Ti substitution on the thermal expansion and electrical conductive properties of LaCrO3,10.2109/jcersj.112.167
