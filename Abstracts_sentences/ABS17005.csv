1,17005,Mixed conducting samaria-doped ceria (SDC) anodes with a small amount of Ni nanoparticles (8 vol.%) exhibited a higher performance in SOFC operated at 700-900 degrees C than that of Ni-SDC cermet.,Microstructural analyses of ceria-based anode with highly dispersed Ni electrocatalysts for medium-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.73.128
2,17005,Microstructural analyses of Ni-dispersed SDC showed that nanometer-sized Ni catalysts enhanced the anodic reaction rate by increasing the active reaction sites and lowering the electronic resistance in the anode effectively.,Microstructural analyses of ceria-based anode with highly dispersed Ni electrocatalysts for medium-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.73.128
