1,16916,In this work we report proof-of-concept of a novel redox flow battery consisting of a solid oxide electrochemical cell (SOEC) integrated with a redox-cycle unit.,A novel solid oxide redox flow battery for grid energy storage,10.1039/c1ee02489b
2,16916,The charge/discharge characteristics were explicitly observed by operating between fuel cell and electrolysis modes of the SOEC along with in-battery generation and storage of H-2 realized by an in situ closed-loop reversible steam-metal reaction in the redox-cycle unit.,A novel solid oxide redox flow battery for grid energy storage,10.1039/c1ee02489b
3,16916,"With Fe/FeO as the redox materials, the new storage battery can produce an energy capacity of 348 Wh/kg-Fe and round-trip efficiency of 91.5% over twenty stable charge/discharge cycles.",A novel solid oxide redox flow battery for grid energy storage,10.1039/c1ee02489b
4,16916,"This excellent performance combined with robustness, environmental friendliness and sustainability promise the new battery to be a transformational energy storage device for grid application.",A novel solid oxide redox flow battery for grid energy storage,10.1039/c1ee02489b
