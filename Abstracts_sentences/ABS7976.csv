1,7976,This paper presents H2S and CH4 tolerance of Co or Ni infiltration into porous nanofiber-based La0.4Sr0.6TiO3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (LST-GDC) on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte disks.,Evaluation of sulfur poisoning and carbon deposition on Co-infiltrated SOFCs La0.4Sr0.6TiO3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite,10.20964/2020.03.29
2,7976,"Over long-term stability tests performed on the nanofiber-based LST-GDC-Ni and LST-GDC-Co composite anodes in 512 ppm H2S-H-2 (i.e. 512 ppm H2S in H-2 atmosphere), the electrochemical performance and the porosity of the LST-GDC-Ni composite anode evolve to reduce significantly.",Evaluation of sulfur poisoning and carbon deposition on Co-infiltrated SOFCs La0.4Sr0.6TiO3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite,10.20964/2020.03.29
3,7976,"Whereas, the LST-GDC-Co composite anodes exhibit a strong resistance to sulfur poisoning and then when exposed to humidified CH4, show a good electrochemical performance, and the polarization resistance (R-p) of 2.96 Omega cm(2) and the maximum power density (P-max) of 53.7 mW cm(-2) are achieved at 800 degrees C.",Evaluation of sulfur poisoning and carbon deposition on Co-infiltrated SOFCs La0.4Sr0.6TiO3-Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 Composite,10.20964/2020.03.29
