1,13914,Strontium doped lanthanum cobalt ferrite (LSCF) is a widely applied electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operated at intermediate temperatures.,Mechanism for the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δby strontium carbonate,10.1039/c6cp06204k
2,13914,Sr surface segregation in long-term operation has been reported to have contradicting effects that either degrade or improve the reaction.,Mechanism for the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δby strontium carbonate,10.1039/c6cp06204k
3,13914,"Thus, it is critical to understand the mechanism of surface Sr compounds on ORR kinetics.",Mechanism for the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δby strontium carbonate,10.1039/c6cp06204k
4,13914,This work aims to verify the effect and propose the mechanism by decorating SrCO3 nanoparticles using the infiltration method.,Mechanism for the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δby strontium carbonate,10.1039/c6cp06204k
5,13914,Electrochemical conductivity relaxation measurements show that SrCO3 particles improve the chemical oxygen surface exchange coefficient by up to a factor of 100.,Mechanism for the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δby strontium carbonate,10.1039/c6cp06204k
6,13914,"The electrochemical performance is significantly improved by the infiltration of SrCO3, which is comparable to those obtained by typical electrocatalysts including precious metals such as Pd and Rh. Distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis shows that the performance enhancement is strongly related to the improved kinetics of charge transfer and oxygen incorporation processes.",Mechanism for the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δby strontium carbonate,10.1039/c6cp06204k
7,13914,"Density functional theory calculations show that the surface SrCO3 reduces the O-2 dissociation energy barrier from 1.01 eV to 0.33 eV, thus enhancing the ORR kinetics, possibly through changing the charge density distribution at the LSCF-SrCO3 interface.",Mechanism for the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δby strontium carbonate,10.1039/c6cp06204k
