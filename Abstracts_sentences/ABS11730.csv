1,11730,"As a first step towards mechanistic studies of fuel cell electrodes with both well-defined and functionally representative structural features, two-dimensional anti-dot metal films with tunable features are prepared.","Polymer sphere lithography for solid oxide fuel cells: a route to functional, well-defined electrode structures",10.1039/b920973e
2,11730,"The fabrication employs a facile, sacrificial templating method, known as polymer sphere lithography, and the resulting metal films are fully connected, yet fully porous.","Polymer sphere lithography for solid oxide fuel cells: a route to functional, well-defined electrode structures",10.1039/b920973e
3,11730,"Using initial bead sizes in the range of 500 nm to 3.2 mu m and oxygen plasma etching to remove from 1/4 to 3/4 of the original bead diameter, computed triple phase boundary densities in the porous films of 2,000 to 43,500 cm cm(-2) are achieved.","Polymer sphere lithography for solid oxide fuel cells: a route to functional, well-defined electrode structures",10.1039/b920973e
4,11730,"Image analysis shows the computed (theoretical) and experimental structural features to be in good agreement, demonstrating sufficient perfection in the films for electrochemical studies.","Polymer sphere lithography for solid oxide fuel cells: a route to functional, well-defined electrode structures",10.1039/b920973e
5,11730,"Furthermore, thermal stability under hydrogen of thermally evaporated Ni films is excellent, with negligible change in triple phase boundary length as required for quantitative electrochemical measurements.","Polymer sphere lithography for solid oxide fuel cells: a route to functional, well-defined electrode structures",10.1039/b920973e
6,11730,"Ultimately, these two-dimensional metallic networks may also serve as the platform for future fabrication of three-dimensional electrodes with truly optimized structural features.","Polymer sphere lithography for solid oxide fuel cells: a route to functional, well-defined electrode structures",10.1039/b920973e
