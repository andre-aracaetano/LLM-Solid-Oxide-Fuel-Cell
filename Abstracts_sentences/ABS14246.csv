1,14246,Long-term performance degradation of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode as a function of gadolinium doped ceria (GDC) interlayer thickness has been studied under accelerated operating conditions.,Effect of GDC interlayer thickness on durability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.085
2,14246,"For this purpose, SOFC half-cells with GDC interlayer thicknesses of 2.4, 3.4 and 6.0 mu m were fabricated and tested for 1000 h at 900 degrees C under constant current density of 1 A/cm(2).",Effect of GDC interlayer thickness on durability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.085
3,14246,"The half-cells consisted of lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF)/GDC composite cathode, GDC interlayer, scandia-ceria stabilized zirconia electrolyte and platinum anode as a counter electrode.",Effect of GDC interlayer thickness on durability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.085
4,14246,Area specific resistance (ASR) of the half-cells was continuously measured over time.,Effect of GDC interlayer thickness on durability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.085
5,14246,"Higher increase in ASR was observed for the half-cells with GDC interlayer thickness of 2.4 and 6.0 mu m, which is attributed to higher strontium (Sr) diffusion towards electrolyte and to cathode/GDC interface delamination coupled with small Sr diffusion, respectively.",Effect of GDC interlayer thickness on durability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.085
6,14246,"However, half-cell with GDC interlayer thickness of 3.4 mu m showed smaller degradation rate due to highly dense GDC interlayer which had less interfacial resistance and suppressed Sr diffusion towards electrolyte.",Effect of GDC interlayer thickness on durability of solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.085
