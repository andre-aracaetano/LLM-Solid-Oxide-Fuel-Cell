3,6344,"As a wavy electrolyte has a larger reaction surface area than a flat electrolyte, a higher energy density could be obtained.",Development of multilayer imprint process for solid oxide fuel cells,10.7567/JJAP.56.06GL04
4,6344,Our proposed process is named micro-powder imprint (mu PI) with a multilayer imprint process that is useful for fabricating a microscale pattern on a ceramic sheet such as an SOFC electrolyte layer.,Development of multilayer imprint process for solid oxide fuel cells,10.7567/JJAP.56.06GL04
5,6344,"mu PI is based on nanoimprint lithography; therefore, it also exhibits the same advantages of high resolution and mass productivity.",Development of multilayer imprint process for solid oxide fuel cells,10.7567/JJAP.56.06GL04
