1,3472,The SrCo0.9Ta0.1O3-delta (SCT) perovskite-type oxide is synthesized by the conventional solid state reaction method and examined as an alternative cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).,Evaluation and optimization of SrCo0.9Ta0.1O3-δ perovskite as cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cap.2012.01.012
2,3472,The electrical conductivity of SCT sample reaches 250-152 S cm(-1) in the temperature range 600-800 degrees C. SCT exhibits good chemical compatibility with the intermediate-temperature electrolyte material Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC).,Evaluation and optimization of SrCo0.9Ta0.1O3-δ perovskite as cathode for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.cap.2012.01.012
