1,7575,"A comprehensive micromodel considering all forms of polarization in the cathode of the solid oxide fuel cell was developed which governs the complex interdependency among the transport phenomena, electrochemical processes (charge-transfer and surface diffusion), and the microstructure of the electrode and their combined effect on the cathode overpotential under different operating conditions.",Cathode micromodel of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1630036
2,7575,"To make the model more generalized, we consider possible oxygen reduction mechanisms, reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface, grain interior and grain boundary effects on the total resistance, both ordinary diffusion and Knudsen diffusion, active three-phase boundary length as a function of ionic/electronic particle size ratio and volume fraction, the exchange current density as a function of gases concentration, etc.",Cathode micromodel of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1630036
3,7575,"Incorporated with reliable experimental data, the model can be used as a tool to design a high performance cathodes.",Cathode micromodel of solid oxide fuel cell,10.1149/1.1630036
