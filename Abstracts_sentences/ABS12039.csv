1,12039,Incorporatinga dense GDC (Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95) barrierlayer is an effective strategy to avoid harmfulreactions between the LSCF (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-& delta;) cathode andthe YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrolyte.,"High-Performance (Ce, Zr)O2-Free Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with an Active-Sintered Cathode Interface and a Low-Temperature Densified Micron-Scale Barrier Layer",10.1021/acsami.3c08019
2,12039,"In this study, amicron-scale and dense GDC barrier layer is obtained by the combinationof spin coating, low-temperature sintering, and hydrothermal-assisteddensification.","High-Performance (Ce, Zr)O2-Free Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with an Active-Sintered Cathode Interface and a Low-Temperature Densified Micron-Scale Barrier Layer",10.1021/acsami.3c08019
3,12039,"The cell exhibits decent output performance, with apeak power density of 1.07 W/cm(2) at 780 & DEG;C. The ohmicand polarization resistances are significantly decreased by & SIM;44and & SIM;36% than the cell with the screen-printed GDC barrierlayer, respectively.","High-Performance (Ce, Zr)O2-Free Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with an Active-Sintered Cathode Interface and a Low-Temperature Densified Micron-Scale Barrier Layer",10.1021/acsami.3c08019
4,12039,"Due to the low sintering temperature of the GDCbarrier layer at 1200 & DEG;C, there is nearly no generation of (Ce,Zr)O-2 at the interface of GDC/YSZ.","High-Performance (Ce, Zr)O2-Free Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with an Active-Sintered Cathode Interface and a Low-Temperature Densified Micron-Scale Barrier Layer",10.1021/acsami.3c08019
5,12039,"The thin and dense GDCbarrier layer effectively shortens the oxygen-ion conduction pathway,as well as hinders Sr migration from the cathode, highlighting itsremarkable potential for industrial applications.","High-Performance (Ce, Zr)O2-Free Solid Oxide Fuel Cell with an Active-Sintered Cathode Interface and a Low-Temperature Densified Micron-Scale Barrier Layer",10.1021/acsami.3c08019
