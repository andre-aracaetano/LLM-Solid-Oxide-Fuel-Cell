1,9181,"Barium zirconate is an oxidic material having perovskite structure that exhibits high chemical stability in both oxidizing and reducing environments, such as in the presence of water and carbon dioxide, its conductivity has led to consider it as a electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cell finding good results, with the limitation of operating at temperatures above 800 degrees","Synthesis, characterization and electric evaluation of barium zirconate doped with trivalent lanthanides",10.3989/cyv.92014
2,9181,"C. Several researchers have proposed that it is possible to improve their electrical conductivity by changes in chemical composition, particularly for doping with trivalent cations that replace the zirconium in B site of perovskite.","Synthesis, characterization and electric evaluation of barium zirconate doped with trivalent lanthanides",10.3989/cyv.92014
3,9181,"In this study, barium zirconate was synthetized by the amorphous citrate method to examine the possibility of obtaining in more favorable conditions than those made by the conventional method of synthesis (ceramic method or solid state reaction) conditions are synthesized.","Synthesis, characterization and electric evaluation of barium zirconate doped with trivalent lanthanides",10.3989/cyv.92014
4,9181,"Barium zirconate doped with europium, gadolinium, holmium, lanthanum, neodymium and praseodymium was prepared, the present phase identification was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the electrical properties were examined by impedance spectroscopy (IS) at temperatures between 480 and 680 degrees C in order to evaluate its potential use as a fuel cell electrolyte in solid oxide.","Synthesis, characterization and electric evaluation of barium zirconate doped with trivalent lanthanides",10.3989/cyv.92014
5,9181,"The contributions of this research has focused on the synthesis method, in the production of ceramic powders of barium zirconate at temperatures lower than those required by the ceramic method, in obtaining chemical, structural, morphological and electrical information of material synthesized.","Synthesis, characterization and electric evaluation of barium zirconate doped with trivalent lanthanides",10.3989/cyv.92014
6,9181,"The desired phase synthesis conditions set found, also, a significant increase is seen in the solid conductivity of doped lanthanum, holmium and europium zirconate of barium in relation to the material without doping.","Synthesis, characterization and electric evaluation of barium zirconate doped with trivalent lanthanides",10.3989/cyv.92014
