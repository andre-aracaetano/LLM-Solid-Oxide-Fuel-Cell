1,15155,"In order to facilitate valid solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) temperature control scheme, a nonlinear identification method of SOFC temperature dynamic behaviors is proposed using an autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) model, whose nonlinear function is described by a least-squares support vector regression (LSSVR) method with radial basis kernel function (RBF).",Study on Nonlinear Identification SOFC Temperature Model Based on Particle Swarm Optimization-Least-Squares Support Vector Regression,10.1115/1.4036805

7,15155,"Furthermore, the simulation speed of NARX model is much faster than the mechanism model because NARX model avoids the internal complex computation process.",Study on Nonlinear Identification SOFC Temperature Model Based on Particle Swarm Optimization-Least-Squares Support Vector Regression,10.1115/1.4036805
8,15155,"The training time of the NARX model with large size data is about 1.2 s. For a 20,000 s simulation, the predicting time of the NARX model is about 0.2 s, while the mechanism model is about 36 s. In consideration of its high computational speed and accuracy, NARX model is a powerful candidate for valid multivariable model predictive control (MPC) schemes.",Study on Nonlinear Identification SOFC Temperature Model Based on Particle Swarm Optimization-Least-Squares Support Vector Regression,10.1115/1.4036805
