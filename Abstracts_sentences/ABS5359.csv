1,5359,"In order to enhance the oxidation resistance and electrical properties of interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), three Co-Ni alloy coatings with varying contents of Fe doping were prepared onto SUS 430 substrate using electroplating method and oxidized in air at 800 degrees C for 1000 h. The experimental results demonstrated that the alloy coating significantly enhanced both the oxidation resistance and electrical properties of the interconnect substrate.",Effect of Fe doped Co-Ni protective coatings on the oxidation behavior and electrical properties of SOFC alloy interconnect materials,10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.04.020
