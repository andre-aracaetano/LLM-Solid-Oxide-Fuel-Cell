1,14179,"BaCe0.7Ti0.1Y0.2O3-delta (BCTY) and BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta (BCY) were synthesized by solid-state reaction method at 1300 degrees C for 24 h. It was found that BCY powders decomposed into BaCO3 and CeO2 after exposure in 94% N-2 + 3% CO2 + 3% H2O at 700 degrees C for 10 h, indicating the instability of BCY in the presence Of CO2 and H2O. On the contrary, BCTY powders remained unchanged under the same conditions, showing the improved chemical stability against CO2 and H2O. Thermal expansion test revealed that BCFY and BCY showed similar thermal expansion behavior from room temperature to 1000 degrees C.",Stable BaCe0.7Ti0.1Y0.2O3-δ proton conductor for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.01.011
