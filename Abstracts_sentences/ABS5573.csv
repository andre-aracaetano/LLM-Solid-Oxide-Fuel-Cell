1,5573,This paper reports on the electrochemical performance of an SOFC cathode for potential use in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) using the oxygen non-stoichiometric misfit-layered cobaltite Ca3Co4O9+delta or composites of Ca3Co4O9+delta with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO/Ca3Co4O9+delta).,Enhanced electrochemical performance of the solid oxide fuel cell cathode using Ca3Co4O9+δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.110
2,5573,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that symmetric cells with an electrode of pure Ca3Co4O9+delta exhibit a cathode polarization resistance (R-p) of 12.4 Omega cm(2), at 600 degrees C in air.",Enhanced electrochemical performance of the solid oxide fuel cell cathode using Ca3Co4O9+δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.110
3,5573,"Strikingly, R-p of the composite CGO/Ca3Co4O9+delta with 50 vol.% CGO was reduced by a factor of 19 (i.e. R-p = 0.64 Omega cm(2)), the lowest value reported so far for the Ca3Co4O9 family of compounds.",Enhanced electrochemical performance of the solid oxide fuel cell cathode using Ca3Co4O9+δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.110
4,5573,"These findings together with the reported thermal expansion coefficient, good compatibility with CGO and chemical durability of this material suggest that it is a promising candidate cathode for IT-SOFCs.",Enhanced electrochemical performance of the solid oxide fuel cell cathode using Ca3Co4O9+δ,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.08.110
