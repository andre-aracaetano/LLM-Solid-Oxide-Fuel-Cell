2,6824,"The materials for the components of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are no exception, and hence understanding of the interplay between lattice defects and the mechanical properties of components is important to ensure the mechanical stability of SOFCs.",In Situ Evaluation of the Influence of Interstitial Oxygen on the Elastic Modulus of La2NiO4,10.3390/met11121889
3,6824,"Herein, we performed an in situ evaluation of the temperature and P(O-2) dependence of the elastic moduli of La2NiO4 (LN214), a candidate for the cathode material of SOFCs, using the resonance method to understand the influence of interstitial oxygen on its elastic properties.",In Situ Evaluation of the Influence of Interstitial Oxygen on the Elastic Modulus of La2NiO4,10.3390/met11121889
4,6824,"Above 873 K, both the Young's and shear moduli of LN214 slightly decreased with increasing P(O-2), suggesting that these elastic moduli are correlated with interstitial oxygen concentration and decreased with increasing interstitial oxygen.",In Situ Evaluation of the Influence of Interstitial Oxygen on the Elastic Modulus of La2NiO4,10.3390/met11121889
5,6824,"We analyzed the influence of interstitial oxygen on the Young's modulus of LN214, based on numerically obtained lattice energy.",In Situ Evaluation of the Influence of Interstitial Oxygen on the Elastic Modulus of La2NiO4,10.3390/met11121889
6,6824,"The P(O-2) dependence of the Young's modulus of LN214 was found to be essentially explained by variation in the c-lattice constant, which was triggered by variation in interstitial oxygen concentration.",In Situ Evaluation of the Influence of Interstitial Oxygen on the Elastic Modulus of La2NiO4,10.3390/met11121889
7,6824,"These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between lattice defects and mechanical properties, and to the improvement of the mechanical stability of SOFCs.",In Situ Evaluation of the Influence of Interstitial Oxygen on the Elastic Modulus of La2NiO4,10.3390/met11121889
