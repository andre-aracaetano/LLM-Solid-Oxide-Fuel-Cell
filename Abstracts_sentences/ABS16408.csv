1,16408,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) cathode often suffers from the poisoning effect of the contaminants commonly encountered in air such as CO2.,An improved oxygen reduction reaction activity and CO2-tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ achieved by a surface modification with barium cobaltite coatings,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230573
2,16408,"Here we report an effective approach to enhancing the activity and CO2 tolerance of the state-of-the-art La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode enabled by a coating of BaCoO3-8 (BCO), as verified by the electrochemical testings, Raman analyses, and density functional theory calculations.",An improved oxygen reduction reaction activity and CO2-tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ achieved by a surface modification with barium cobaltite coatings,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230573
3,16408,"When surface modified with a thin-film BCO coating, LSCF displays a much enhanced ORR activity and an improved durability against CO2.",An improved oxygen reduction reaction activity and CO2-tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ achieved by a surface modification with barium cobaltite coatings,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230573
4,16408,"For example, anode supported SOFCs with the LSCF cathode coated with BCO coatings show a remarkable peak power density (P-max) of 0.41 Wcm(-2) and a significantly reduced degradation rate in current density of similar to 0.08%h(-1) at 0.8 V and 700 degrees C for a period of 300 hs when humidified H-2 (with 3 vol%H2O) was used as fuel and air with 8 vol% CO2 as oxidant.",An improved oxygen reduction reaction activity and CO2-tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ achieved by a surface modification with barium cobaltite coatings,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230573
5,16408,The demonstrated performance is improved when compared with those of the cells with a blank LSCF electrode (a P-max of similar to 0.36 Wcm(-2) and a degradation rate of similar to 0.15%h(-1)) under the same conditions.,An improved oxygen reduction reaction activity and CO2-tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ achieved by a surface modification with barium cobaltite coatings,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230573
6,16408,The adsorption energy calculations suggests that BCO coating makes CO2 adsorption much weaker than LSCF (-0.54 eV versus-1.07 eV).,An improved oxygen reduction reaction activity and CO2-tolerance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ achieved by a surface modification with barium cobaltite coatings,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230573
