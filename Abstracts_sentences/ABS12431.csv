1,12431,"NiO/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode substrates were fabricated at two compaction pressures of 200 and 1000 MPa, the particle size distributions of NiO and YSZ were investigated with powders treated under different conditions using a laser scattering technique (Mastersizer 2000, Malvern Instruments) and the effect of compaction pressure on the performance of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes was investigated by studying the effect of compaction pressure on compaction density, sintered density, sintering shrinkage behavior, electronic and ionic conductivities.",Experimental study on effect of compaction pressure on performance of SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.072
2,12431,"The results of investigation indicated that the SOFC with the anode compacted at a higher pressure exhibited a superior output performance, for example, a single cell with hydrogen as fuel and oxygen as oxidant exhibited excellent maximum power densities of 2.77 and 0.90 W cm(-2) at 800 and 650 degrees C, respectively, which suggested the development of an intermediate temperature SOFC through optimization of anode fabrication parameters.",Experimental study on effect of compaction pressure on performance of SOFC anodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.01.072
