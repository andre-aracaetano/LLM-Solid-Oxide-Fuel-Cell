3,1170,"To examine the validity of the LTE assumption, a thermal model has been developed to evaluate the local thermal non-equilibrium effect of SOFC electrodes with various fuels, considering methane internal reforming and ammonia thermal cracking in the anode.",Local Non-Equilibrium Thermal Effects in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Various Fuels,10.1002/ente.201200014
4,1170,"Although the local thermal non-equilibrium effect for ammonia-fed SOFCs was more pronounced than that for hydrogen-fed SOFCs, the local thermal equilibrium assumption can be safely adopted for SOFC modeling for a wide range of operating/structural parameters and for various fuels, such as hydrogen, ammonia, and methane.",Local Non-Equilibrium Thermal Effects in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells with Various Fuels,10.1002/ente.201200014
