4,16091,"An oxidation test on as-received Crofer 22 APU steel was carried out in a controlled atmosphere (0.01 Pa) in an in-situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) stage at 950 degrees C. Normal XRD showed no indication of oxidation, while GIXRD revealed the formation of two-layer oxides: Top layer spinel MnCr2O4 and fine-grained inner layer Cr2O3, which was confirmed and quantified by GD-OES depth profiling.",Understanding early-stage oxidation mechanism of Crofer 22 APU solid oxide fuel cell steel interconnect using glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction,10.1016/j.tsf.2023.140043
