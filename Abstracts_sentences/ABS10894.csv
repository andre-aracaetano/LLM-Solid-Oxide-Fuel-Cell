1,10894,Today heavy fuel oil is still produced and plays an important role in providing required energy worldwide.,"High efficient-low emission power production from low BTU gas extracted from heavy fuel oil gasification, introduction of IGCC-SOFC process",10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.023
2,10894,"However, there could be environmental problems associated with burning these used fuel oils.","High efficient-low emission power production from low BTU gas extracted from heavy fuel oil gasification, introduction of IGCC-SOFC process",10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.023
3,10894,"Because of physical characteristics of heavy fuel oil (high viscosity and density), it is not possible to utilize directly in high efficient power plants same as combined cycle (Gas turbine-steam cycle).","High efficient-low emission power production from low BTU gas extracted from heavy fuel oil gasification, introduction of IGCC-SOFC process",10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.023
4,10894,Partial oxidation (Gasification) process is introduced as a solution to reduce the emission production in the power generation cycle from heavy fuel oil.,"High efficient-low emission power production from low BTU gas extracted from heavy fuel oil gasification, introduction of IGCC-SOFC process",10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.023
5,10894,"In this process, the heavy fuel oil is converted into syngas (mainly consist of CO and H-2).","High efficient-low emission power production from low BTU gas extracted from heavy fuel oil gasification, introduction of IGCC-SOFC process",10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.023
6,10894,The chemical energy content of syngas can be converted into the electrical energy with high efficiency and low emission production through high efficient cycle like combined cycle or Solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine.,"High efficient-low emission power production from low BTU gas extracted from heavy fuel oil gasification, introduction of IGCC-SOFC process",10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.023
7,10894,"Thermodynamic simulations, environmental and economic assessments of Solid oxide fuel cell-Gas turbine power cycle are performed to investigate the feasibility of introduced system.","High efficient-low emission power production from low BTU gas extracted from heavy fuel oil gasification, introduction of IGCC-SOFC process",10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.023
8,10894,Results show that the suggested system is not feasible in the current heavy oil price (900 US$ per Ton).,"High efficient-low emission power production from low BTU gas extracted from heavy fuel oil gasification, introduction of IGCC-SOFC process",10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.023
9,10894,The increment in cost of electrical energy in the market (more than 0.2 US$ per kWh) can improve the system feasibility.,"High efficient-low emission power production from low BTU gas extracted from heavy fuel oil gasification, introduction of IGCC-SOFC process",10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.023
10,10894,The change in governmental subsidy trend from raw fuel and electrical energy into emission decrement and high efficient technology can improve such system feasibility.,"High efficient-low emission power production from low BTU gas extracted from heavy fuel oil gasification, introduction of IGCC-SOFC process",10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.023
