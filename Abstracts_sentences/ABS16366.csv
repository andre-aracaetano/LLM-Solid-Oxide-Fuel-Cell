1,16366,"Here, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermo-gravimetric analysis experiments show that the pre-infiltration of Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) nano-particles reduces the average size of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x (LSCF) produced from the subsequent infiltration of precursor nitrate solutions containing the surfactant Triton X-100 or the chelating agent citric acid.",Nano-ceria pre-infiltration improves La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x infiltrated Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathode performance,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.080
2,16366,"In contrast, GDC pre-infiltration has no effect on the average size of LSCF particles produced from precursor solutions containing only lanthanum, strontium, cobalt, and iron nitrate.",Nano-ceria pre-infiltration improves La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x infiltrated Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathode performance,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.080
3,16366,"Consistent with the observed particle size trends, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show that GDC pre-infiltration improves the performance of Triton X-100 Derived (TXD) LSCF-GDC cathodes and Citric Acid Derived (CAD) LSCF-GDC cathodes, but has no effect on the performance of Pure Nitrate Derived (PND) LSCF-GDC cathodes.",Nano-ceria pre-infiltration improves La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x infiltrated Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathode performance,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.080
4,16366,"In particular, TXD LSCF-GDC cathodes with more than similar to 5 vol% of GDC pre-infiltration display average LSCF particle sizes of 21 nm and open-circuit polarization resistance values of 0.10 Omega cm(2) at 540 degrees C, compared to 48 nm and 640 degrees C without GDC pre-infiltration.",Nano-ceria pre-infiltration improves La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x infiltrated Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathode performance,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.080
5,16366,Results suggest that this 100 degrees C reduction in cathode operating temperature is caused solely by LSCF particle size reductions.,Nano-ceria pre-infiltration improves La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x infiltrated Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathode performance,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.080
6,16366,7.4 vol% GDC pre-infiltrated TXD LSCF-GDC cathodes also display lower 540 degrees C degradation rates than conventionally infiltrated PND LSCF-GDC cathodes.,Nano-ceria pre-infiltration improves La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x infiltrated Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathode performance,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.080
