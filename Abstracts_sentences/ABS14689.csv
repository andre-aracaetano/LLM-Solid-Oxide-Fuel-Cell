3,14689,The results show that ultrafine-grained SDC20 has a remarkable enhancement in the total conductivity of about one order of magnitude greater than that of conventional microcrystalline SDC20 mainly due to the predominance of increased grain boundary conduction with decreasing grain size.,Interfacial effects on electrical conductivity in ultrafine-grained Sm0.2Ce0.8O2_δ electrolytes fabricated by a two-step sintering process,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.151
4,14689,Concentration cell measurements under different partial pressure of oxygen (Po-2) prove that the enhanced grain-boundary conductivity of ultrafine-grained SDC20 is mainly attributed to purely ionic charge carriers but not electronic contribution.,Interfacial effects on electrical conductivity in ultrafine-grained Sm0.2Ce0.8O2_δ electrolytes fabricated by a two-step sintering process,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.151
