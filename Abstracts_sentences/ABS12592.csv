2,12592,"However, the sintering temperature of commercial YSZ powders is usually above 1500 degrees C.",Low-temperature sintering and microstructure evolution of Bi2O3-doped YSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.039
3,12592,"In this work, powders with variable amounts (from 1 mol% to 12 mol%) of bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) were separately added to commercially available yttria partially stabilized zirconia (3YSZ) powders as sintering additives, in order to lower the sintering temperature of the latter.",Low-temperature sintering and microstructure evolution of Bi2O3-doped YSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.039
4,12592,"After the addition, the powder mixtures were dry-pressed and sintered at different temperatures between 850 degrees C and 1200 degrees C.",Low-temperature sintering and microstructure evolution of Bi2O3-doped YSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.039
5,12592,"Then, the relative densities, phases and microstructures of the sintered ceramic specimens were analyzed.",Low-temperature sintering and microstructure evolution of Bi2O3-doped YSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.039
6,12592,"The results indicated that the addition of Bi2O3 enhanced the sintering activity of 3YSZ, resulting in a 3YSZ material with an extremely low sintering temperature.",Low-temperature sintering and microstructure evolution of Bi2O3-doped YSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.039
7,12592,"When the amount of Bi2O3 exceeded 7 mol%, the ceramic specimens were densified up to 96.3% by a pressureless conventional sintering process at 850 degrees C for only 1.5 h. Furthermore, Bi2O3 can affect the degree of crystallinity of different phases, such as the tetragonal phase and monoclinic phase in 3YSZ powder.",Low-temperature sintering and microstructure evolution of Bi2O3-doped YSZ,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.10.039
