1,12995,"The characteristics of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes, prepared by infiltration of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta (LSF) into porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) scaffolds, were evaluated by studying the effect of p(O-2) and of Al2O3 overlayers deposited by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) on impedance spectra at 873 and 973 K.",An Investigation of Oxygen Reduction Kinetics in LSF Electrodes,10.1149/2.011303jes
2,12995,"The electrode resistance of LSF-YSZ composites calcined at 1123 K was dominated by high-frequency processes that show a relatively weak p(O-2) dependence of -0.2 at 973 K. Composites calcined to 1373 K exhibited additional, low-frequency features in their impedance spectra that were more strongly dependent on p(O-2),",An Investigation of Oxygen Reduction Kinetics in LSF Electrodes,10.1149/2.011303jes

4,12995,These low-frequency processes are due to O-2 adsorption limitations caused by the lower surface area of the LSF phase.,An Investigation of Oxygen Reduction Kinetics in LSF Electrodes,10.1149/2.011303jes

6,12995,The ALD overlayers were disrupted by heating to 1073 K and electrode polarization at 873 K.,An Investigation of Oxygen Reduction Kinetics in LSF Electrodes,10.1149/2.011303jes
