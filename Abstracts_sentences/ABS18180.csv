3,18180,"The main purpose of this work was to evaluate some precipitation parameters, the densification behaviour of powder compacts, and the electrical resistivity of sintered ceramics.","Synthesis, sintering and impedance spectroscopy of 8 mol% yttria-doped ceria solid electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.073
4,18180,Results on thermal analyses show that the decomposition of the precipitated gel is almost complete at 400 degreesC. The specific surface area of calcined powders decreases for increasing precipitation temperature.,"Synthesis, sintering and impedance spectroscopy of 8 mol% yttria-doped ceria solid electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.073
5,18180,"For powders precipitated at room temperature, the BET surface area is also found to be dependent on the gel storage time before calcination.","Synthesis, sintering and impedance spectroscopy of 8 mol% yttria-doped ceria solid electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.073
6,18180,"The densification of powder compacts increases sharply for sintering temperatures higher than 1400 degreesC. However, a few minutes at 1500 degreesC is sufficient for the compacts to attain a high densification.","Synthesis, sintering and impedance spectroscopy of 8 mol% yttria-doped ceria solid electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.073
7,18180,"Impedance spectroscopy experiments reveal that the ionic resistivity is not dependent on most of the synthesis parameters, although the grain size play a key role in the intergranular component of the resistivity.","Synthesis, sintering and impedance spectroscopy of 8 mol% yttria-doped ceria solid electrolyte",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.073
