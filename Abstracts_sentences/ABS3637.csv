1,3637,A Ni/Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cell with a (La0.60Sr0.40)(0.95)Co0.20Fe0.80O3-delta cathode is tested both in fuel cell and electrolysis modes.,Electrochemical Study of the Versatility of a Solid Cell Working both as Fuel Cell and Electrolysis Modes,10.1002/fuce.201900066
2,3637,"In fuel cell mode under dry air and wet H-2, the cell is operated between the open circuit voltage (OCV) and 0.4 V and reaches 330 mW cm(-2) at 850 degrees C for 157 mL min(-1) H-2 supply.",Electrochemical Study of the Versatility of a Solid Cell Working both as Fuel Cell and Electrolysis Modes,10.1002/fuce.201900066
3,3637,"The influence of temperature and air or hydrogen flow rate is studied, and impedance measurements show that below 0.8 V the electrolyte becomes the more resistive part of the cell.",Electrochemical Study of the Versatility of a Solid Cell Working both as Fuel Cell and Electrolysis Modes,10.1002/fuce.201900066
4,3637,"Nevertheless, fuel utilization yields are higher under oxygen or hydrogen depletion.",Electrochemical Study of the Versatility of a Solid Cell Working both as Fuel Cell and Electrolysis Modes,10.1002/fuce.201900066
5,3637,"If it is possible at 750 degrees C to work at low voltage during several hours in the entire voltage range, the voltage decrease must be limited at 850 degrees C.",Electrochemical Study of the Versatility of a Solid Cell Working both as Fuel Cell and Electrolysis Modes,10.1002/fuce.201900066
