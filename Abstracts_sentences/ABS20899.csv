1,20899,"For the first time, proton conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb) and La2Ce2O7 (LCO) are combined to create an interface active and steam-tolerant electrolyte for high-performance proton-conducting solid oxide electrolysis cells.","Synergistic Coupling of Proton Conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ and La2Ce2O7 to Create Chemical Stable, Interface Active Electrolyte for Steam Electrolysis Cells",10.1021/acsami.9b00303
2,20899,LCO shows good chemical compatibility with BZCYYb.,"Synergistic Coupling of Proton Conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ and La2Ce2O7 to Create Chemical Stable, Interface Active Electrolyte for Steam Electrolysis Cells",10.1021/acsami.9b00303
3,20899,The readily fabricated LCO/BZCYYb bilayer electrolyte can be densified at a temperature of as low as 1300 degrees C versus similar to 1600 degrees C for the benchmark steam-stable BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta electrolyte.,"Synergistic Coupling of Proton Conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ and La2Ce2O7 to Create Chemical Stable, Interface Active Electrolyte for Steam Electrolysis Cells",10.1021/acsami.9b00303
4,20899,"With Pr2NiO4+delta as the anode and Ni as the cathode catalyst, this bilayer electrolyte cell yields a current density of 975 and 300 mA/cm(2) under a 1.3 V applied potential at 700 and 600 degrees C, respectively.","Synergistic Coupling of Proton Conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ and La2Ce2O7 to Create Chemical Stable, Interface Active Electrolyte for Steam Electrolysis Cells",10.1021/acsami.9b00303
5,20899,This performance is among the best of all H-SOECs equipped with a chemically stable electrolyte so far.,"Synergistic Coupling of Proton Conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ and La2Ce2O7 to Create Chemical Stable, Interface Active Electrolyte for Steam Electrolysis Cells",10.1021/acsami.9b00303
6,20899,"A BZCYYb layer in the bilayer electrolyte promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode side, resulting in a 108% improvement over the cell without this layer.","Synergistic Coupling of Proton Conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ and La2Ce2O7 to Create Chemical Stable, Interface Active Electrolyte for Steam Electrolysis Cells",10.1021/acsami.9b00303
7,20899,"The LCO layer, on the other hand, effectively protects this functional BZCYYb layer from the high concentration of steam in a practical SOEC operation condition.","Synergistic Coupling of Proton Conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ and La2Ce2O7 to Create Chemical Stable, Interface Active Electrolyte for Steam Electrolysis Cells",10.1021/acsami.9b00303
8,20899,The cell without the LCO layer shows degradation in terms of an increased electrolyzing potential from 1.07 to 1.29 V during a constant 400 mA/cm(2) operation at 700 degrees C.,"Synergistic Coupling of Proton Conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ and La2Ce2O7 to Create Chemical Stable, Interface Active Electrolyte for Steam Electrolysis Cells",10.1021/acsami.9b00303
9,20899,"In contrast, the bilayer electrolyte cell maintains the same electrolyzing potential of 1.13 V under the same conduction for a 102 h operation.","Synergistic Coupling of Proton Conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ and La2Ce2O7 to Create Chemical Stable, Interface Active Electrolyte for Steam Electrolysis Cells",10.1021/acsami.9b00303
10,20899,These findings demonstrate that this synergic bilayer electrolyte design is a vital strategy to overcome the dilemma between performance and stability faced by the current benchmark Zr- or Ce-rich Ba(CeZr)O3-delta electrolysis cells to achieve excellent performance and stability at the same time.,"Synergistic Coupling of Proton Conductors BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-δ and La2Ce2O7 to Create Chemical Stable, Interface Active Electrolyte for Steam Electrolysis Cells",10.1021/acsami.9b00303
