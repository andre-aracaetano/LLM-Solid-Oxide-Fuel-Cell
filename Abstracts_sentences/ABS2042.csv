1,2042,Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) and gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) were synthesized via a glycine-nitrate process (GNP).,Fabrication and characterization of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-Gadolinia-doped ceria cathode for an anode-supported solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.057
2,2042,"A cubic perovskite of BSCF was observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at a calcination temperature above 950 degrees C. An anode-supported solid-oxide fuel cell was constructed from the porous NiO+YSZ as the anode substrate, the yittria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte, and the porous BSCF-GDC layer as the cathode with a GDC barrier layer.",Fabrication and characterization of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-Gadolinia-doped ceria cathode for an anode-supported solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.057
3,2042,"For the performance test, the maximum power density was 191.3 mW cm(-2) at a temperature of 750 degrees C with H-2 fuel and air at flow rates of 335 and 670 sccm, respectively.",Fabrication and characterization of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-Gadolinia-doped ceria cathode for an anode-supported solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.057
4,2042,"According to the AC-impedance data, the charge-transfer resistances of the electrodes were 0.10 and 1.59 Omega cm(2), and the oxygen-reduction and oxygen-ion diffusion resistances were 0.69 and 0.98 Omega cm(2) at 750 and 600 degrees C, respectively.",Fabrication and characterization of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-Gadolinia-doped ceria cathode for an anode-supported solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.057
5,2042,SEM microstructural characterization indicated that the fuel cell as fabricated exhibited good compatibility between cathode and electrolyte layers.,Fabrication and characterization of a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ-Gadolinia-doped ceria cathode for an anode-supported solid-oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.057
