3,13315,"The single cell working between H-2 and static air showed good stability (over 50 h), high open circuit voltages (above 1.0 V) as well as high peak power densities (749-264 mW cm(-2)) from 600 to 500 degrees C. Detailed analyses of current research demonstrated that the thin perovskite film mainly possessed the oxygen ion conductivity under reducing atmosphere, while the proton conductivity was severely suppressed, showing the high flexibility in ionic conductivity of perovskite oxide.",Direct evidence of high oxygen ion conduction of perovskite-type ceramic membrane under hydrogen atmosphere in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.044
4,13315,"This work also implies that the oxygen ion and proton conduction may be in high correlation with each other, which provides important information to unveil the nature of the ionic conduction of perovskite-type oxides.",Direct evidence of high oxygen ion conduction of perovskite-type ceramic membrane under hydrogen atmosphere in solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.09.044
