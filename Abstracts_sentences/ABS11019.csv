6,11019,"Volatile distillates are relatively easily reformed, eliminating soot and most naphthalene in the exhaust, converting 88 mole% of carbon in the distillate into CO, 7% into CH4, and 5% into CO.",Reforming diesel-fuel distillates with membrane reactors,10.1002/apj.367
7,11019,"Approximately 75 mole% of the hydrogen is converted into H-2, 13% into CH4, and the remainder into H2O.
