3,16937,"An n-type semiconductor with electron charge carriers will be conducive to the electric conductivity, sigma, under fuel conditions, but the research on n-type oxide electrodes is limited mostly to perovskite-type titanate that requires very high temperature and low oxygen partial pressure to provide a decent sigma.",Transparent conductive oxide type materials as the anode of solid oxide fuel cells at a reduced temperature,10.1039/d2ta06915f
4,16937,"Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) with a superior sigma even at room temperature are widely explored for electronic devices, but they have never been studied as an alternative oxide anode of an SOFC at a reduced temperature.",Transparent conductive oxide type materials as the anode of solid oxide fuel cells at a reduced temperature,10.1039/d2ta06915f
5,16937,"An n-type TCO type material ZnGa2O4 (ZGO) that could be reduced at a temperature below 700 degrees C was used as the anode for the oxidation of H-2 and hydrocarbon (ethanol and propane) at <= 650 degrees C. ZGO provided a high sigma of 1.5 and 0.33 S cm(-1) at 700 degrees C and 600 degrees C, respectively, and the cell with a ZGO anode and Sc0.18Ce0.01Zr0.81O2-delta electrolyte showed a high redox stability.",Transparent conductive oxide type materials as the anode of solid oxide fuel cells at a reduced temperature,10.1039/d2ta06915f
6,16937,"The performance of the cell with a ZGO/GDC (Gd2O3 doped ceria) anode could be enhanced by the infiltration of 1% Ni, imparting a peak power of 574 mW cm(-2) at 650 degrees C and a stable cell performance of 300 mW cm(-2) at 600 degrees C for 300 hours.",Transparent conductive oxide type materials as the anode of solid oxide fuel cells at a reduced temperature,10.1039/d2ta06915f
