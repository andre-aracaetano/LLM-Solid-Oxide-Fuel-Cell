1,17257,Microstructural evolution in a CeO2-Gd2O3 system at atomic and nanoscale levels with increasing Gd concentration has been comprehensively investigated by transmission electron microscopy.,Microstructural Evolution in a CeO2-Gd2O3 System,10.1017/S1431927611012396
2,17257,"When the Gd concentration was increased from 10 to 80 at.%, the phase transformation from ceria with fluorite structure to solid solution with C-type structure was not a sudden change but an evolution in the sequence of clusters, domains, and precipitates with C-type structure in the fluorite-structured matrix.",Microstructural Evolution in a CeO2-Gd2O3 System,10.1017/S1431927611012396
3,17257,"Moreover, the ordering of aggregated Gd cations and oxygen vacancies in these microstructural inhomogeneities developed continuously with increasing Gd concentration.",Microstructural Evolution in a CeO2-Gd2O3 System,10.1017/S1431927611012396
4,17257,This microstructural evolution can be further described based on the development of defect clusters containing Gd cations and oxygen vacancies.,Microstructural Evolution in a CeO2-Gd2O3 System,10.1017/S1431927611012396
