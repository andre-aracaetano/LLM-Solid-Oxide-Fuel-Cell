1,6743,This study investigates a reversible solid oxide fuel cell system coupled with an external waste heat source for use of electrical energy storage.,Waste heat utilization in reversible solid oxide fuel cell systems for electrical energy storage: Fuel recirculation design and feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.est.2020.101434
2,6743,Steam from waste-fueled boilers is used as an external heat source over temperatures ranging from 150 degrees C to slightly over 550 degrees C. We considered three fuel recirculation configurations that represent the different temperatures of recirculated fuel.,Waste heat utilization in reversible solid oxide fuel cell systems for electrical energy storage: Fuel recirculation design and feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.est.2020.101434
3,6743,"We also investigated the effect of different devices, including a recycle blower and ejector.",Waste heat utilization in reversible solid oxide fuel cell systems for electrical energy storage: Fuel recirculation design and feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.est.2020.101434
4,6743,"Our results showed that fuel recirculation increases the overall round-trip efficiency up to 6.0% points when waste steam is at 500 degrees C. However, recirculation at the highest temperature did not lead to the highest efficiency improvement in the ejector systems.",Waste heat utilization in reversible solid oxide fuel cell systems for electrical energy storage: Fuel recirculation design and feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.est.2020.101434
5,6743,"Instead, the warm-ejector configuration, our intermediate temperature case, resulted in the highest efficiency.",Waste heat utilization in reversible solid oxide fuel cell systems for electrical energy storage: Fuel recirculation design and feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.est.2020.101434
6,6743,"Furthermore, the warm-ejector configuration showed efficiencies close to those of the blower system at a wide range of operating current densities.",Waste heat utilization in reversible solid oxide fuel cell systems for electrical energy storage: Fuel recirculation design and feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.est.2020.101434
7,6743,We also determined a range of external heat source temperatures that is favorable or workable for specific ejector system configurations so that the fuel recirculation configuration could be designed accordingly to achieve best performance.,Waste heat utilization in reversible solid oxide fuel cell systems for electrical energy storage: Fuel recirculation design and feasibility analysis,10.1016/j.est.2020.101434
