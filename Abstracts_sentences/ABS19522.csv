4,19522,"The cells are operated at 800 degrees C for about 1000 h. The cell with SCZ-8 addition to the CCM displays quite stable operation (3.9%/1000 h degradation), whereas the other additives lead to somewhat higher degradation rate.",Mechanical and electrochemical performance of composite cathode contact materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.130
