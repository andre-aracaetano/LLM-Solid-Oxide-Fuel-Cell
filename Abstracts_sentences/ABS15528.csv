Analysis of cell voltage loss during short-term H2S poisoning showed that SOFC performance loss was generally larger at higher current loads.,Electrochemical evaluation of sulfur poisoning in a methane-fuelled solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of current density and sulfur concentration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.08.125
3,15528,Separating the effect of H2S on catalytic reforming and electrochemical activity by evaluating the relevant area specific resistances and charge transfer processes based on impedance spectroscopy revealed that the poisoning of electrochemical activity was not dependent on current density.,Electrochemical evaluation of sulfur poisoning in a methane-fuelled solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of current density and sulfur concentration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.08.125
4,15528,Two major anode processes were significantly affected by the presence of H2S in the fuel; the lower frequency mass transfer/fuel reforming processes and higher frequency charge transfer/triple phase boundary (TPB) processes.,Electrochemical evaluation of sulfur poisoning in a methane-fuelled solid oxide fuel cell: Effect of current density and sulfur concentration,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.08.125
