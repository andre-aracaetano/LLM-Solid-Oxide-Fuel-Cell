1,20436,Protonic solid oxide steam electrolysis cells (P-SOECs) based on BaZrxCe0.8-xYb0.1Y0.1O3-delta proton conductors are promising to produce green hydrogen from renewable energy at intermediate temperatures.,The effect of an anode functional layer on the steam electrolysis performances of protonic solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta02848k
2,20436,"Herein, we demonstrate that the electrolysis performances of a cell with a high-Zr-content electrolyte, BaZr0.6Ce0.2Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb6211), can be significantly improved by using a La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (LSC) thin film (similar to 90 nm) as an anode functional layer (AFL).",The effect of an anode functional layer on the steam electrolysis performances of protonic solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta02848k
3,20436,Electrochemical measurements indicated that LSC-AFL significantly reduced the barrier height for the electrochemical proton incorporation reaction at the gas-electrolyte-electrode triple-phase boundary.,The effect of an anode functional layer on the steam electrolysis performances of protonic solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta02848k
4,20436,"Hence, both the ohmic and polarization resistances of the BZCYYb6211 cell decreased from 0.52 and 0.98 omega cm(2) to 0.26 and 0.57 omega cm(2), respectively, with the LSC-AFL at 600 degrees C.",The effect of an anode functional layer on the steam electrolysis performances of protonic solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta02848k
5,20436,"In addition, the BZCYYb6211 cell achieved a high electrolysis current of 1.22 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V with a Faraday efficiency of approximately 80%, which was equivalent to that (1.13 A cm(-2)) of the cell with a state-of-the-art electrolyte BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta (BZCYYb1711).",The effect of an anode functional layer on the steam electrolysis performances of protonic solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta02848k
6,20436,BZCYYb6211 with LSC-AFL showed good durability at 500 degrees C under high steam conditions with an applied current of 1 A cm(-2) for 100 h. These results revealed that the introduction of an AFL is an effective method to obtain P-SOECs with excellent performances and durability.,The effect of an anode functional layer on the steam electrolysis performances of protonic solid oxide cells,10.1039/d1ta02848k
