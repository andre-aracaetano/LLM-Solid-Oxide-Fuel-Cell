1,5218,Utilization of 500-nm-diameter polystyrene (PS) nanospheres as pore former in a screen printing process to tailor the porous structure of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode for improving the performance of protonic solid oxide fuel cells is reported.,Production of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode with graded porosity for improving proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.270
2,5218,The effects of PS nanosphere amount on cathode microstructure and cell performance are investigated.,Production of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode with graded porosity for improving proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.270
3,5218,"It is found that PS nanospheres can undergo a self-organized distribution in the screen-printed LSCF cathode due to the large difference in density between PS and LSCF, resulting in a porosity gradient in the cathode structure.",Production of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode with graded porosity for improving proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.270
4,5218,The fuel cell with a 15 wt% PS-tailored cathode exhibits a much higher power density compared to that without tailoring by PS.,Production of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode with graded porosity for improving proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.270
5,5218,"The enhanced cell performance can be ascribed to the graded porosity in the cathode structure, which significantly reduces the ohmic and polarization resistances.",Production of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode with graded porosity for improving proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.270
6,5218,It seems that such a graded-porosity cathode structure not only facilitates the generation and migration of O-ad(-) from catalytic sites to triple phase boundaries (TPBs) but also promotes transfer of protons from the electrolyte to the TPBs.,Production of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode with graded porosity for improving proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.270
