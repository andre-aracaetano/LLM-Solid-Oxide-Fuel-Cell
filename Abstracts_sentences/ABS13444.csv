2,13444,"This study focused on the conversion of biogas into hydrogen-rich gas, which is a high-quality fuel energy source.",MICROWAVE-MATRIX CAVITY REFORMER FOR BIOGAS APPLICATIONS,10.30638/eemj.2024.063
3,13444,"To achieve this, a new type of microwave -matrix cavity reformer (MMCR) was suggested, and parametric studies were performed to demonstrate the possibility of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack applications.",MICROWAVE-MATRIX CAVITY REFORMER FOR BIOGAS APPLICATIONS,10.30638/eemj.2024.063
4,13444,"Based on the performance of the reforming characteristics for each variable, the optimal operating conditions of the MMCR were obtained as follows: when the air ratio was 0.4, the reformed gas recirculation rate was 100%, the water feed rate was 20 mL/min, and the CH 4 conversion, CO 2 conversion, and H 2 selectivity were 64.0%, 54.7%, and 62.5%, respectively.",MICROWAVE-MATRIX CAVITY REFORMER FOR BIOGAS APPLICATIONS,10.30638/eemj.2024.063
5,13444,"Particularly, the CO/H 2 ratio was 0.67, which is a good condition without incurring carbon deposition.",MICROWAVE-MATRIX CAVITY REFORMER FOR BIOGAS APPLICATIONS,10.30638/eemj.2024.063
6,13444,This novel MMCR is expected to be a biogas reformer for application in SOFC stacks as a residential power generator.,MICROWAVE-MATRIX CAVITY REFORMER FOR BIOGAS APPLICATIONS,10.30638/eemj.2024.063
