1,2032,The effect of endothermic internal steam reformation of methane and exothermic fuel cell reaction on the temperature of a planar-type anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell was experimentally investigated as a function of current density and fuel utilization.,Experimental Study of Internal Reforming on Large-area Anode Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400070
2,2032,We fabricated a large-area (22 x 33 cm(2)) cell and compared temperature profiles along the cell using 30 thermocouples inserted through the cathode end plate at 750 degrees C under various conditions (Uf similar to 50% at 0.4 Acm(-2);,Experimental Study of Internal Reforming on Large-area Anode Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400070
3,2032,Uf similar to 70% at 0.4 Acm(-2); Uf similar to 50% at 0.2 Acm(-2)) with hydrogen fuel and methane-steam internal reforming.,Experimental Study of Internal Reforming on Large-area Anode Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400070
4,2032,"The endothermic effect due to internal reforming mainly occurs at the gas inlet region, so this process is not very effective to cool down the hot spot created by the exothermic fuel cell reaction.",Experimental Study of Internal Reforming on Large-area Anode Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400070
5,2032,This eventually results in a larger temperature difference on the cell.,Experimental Study of Internal Reforming on Large-area Anode Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400070
6,2032,The most moderate condition with regards to thermal gradient on the cell corresponds to high fuel utilization (Uf similar to 70%) and low current density (similar to 0.2 A cm(-2)).,Experimental Study of Internal Reforming on Large-area Anode Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400070
7,2032,"The electrochemical performance was also measured, and it was found that the current-voltage characteristics are comparable for the cell operated under hydrogen fuel and internal steam reforming of methane because of lower polarization resistance with high partial pressure of water vapor.",Experimental Study of Internal Reforming on Large-area Anode Supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/fuce.201400070
