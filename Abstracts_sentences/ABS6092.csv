1,6092,"In this work, the use of fuel cells for valorizing agricultural-derived biogas in Switzerland is studied.",Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
2,6092,The Swiss agricultural case is characterized by farms with small numbers of animals (20 cows) and high feed-in tariffs (FIT) for biogas-derived electricity (0.49 CHF/kWh(el)).,Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
3,6092,"Thus, small-scale biogas installations are reviewed and the possibility to couple them with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and photovoltaic (PV) panels is analyzed.",Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
4,6092,"To date, less than 5% of the Swiss agricultural biogas potential is used.",Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
5,6092,It is possible to increase this value significantly up to 86% through the deployment of 2 kW(el) engines.,Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
6,6092,The small size of the Swiss farm requires biogas installations in the kW-range.,Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
7,6092,"Small-scale biogas facilities are not profitable yet: the main challenge is to bring down the lifetime cost of the fuel cells to 11,000 CHF/kW(el) (considering a lifetime of ten years) and to reduce the investment cost (IC) of small-scale biogas facilities to around 9500 CHF/kW(ch).",Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
8,6092,"In the kW-range, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have higher electrical conversion efficiencies than internal combustion engines (ICEs).",Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
9,6092,"It is shown that SOFCs become competitive over combustion engines if the investment cost of the former decreases below 13,000 CHF/kW(el) for a lifetime of 11 years.",Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
10,6092,"Combining the biogas facility with a PV-battery system, which covers the digester's electricity needs, is found to be beneficial.",Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
11,6092,"A considerable reduction in the feed-in tariffs would make small- to medium-scale biogas installations unprofitable, at current cost.",Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
12,6092,"In order to reach a break-even under these conditions, the investment cost of the biogas plant needs to drop below 4000 CHF/kW(ch), whereas the investment cost of the SOFC needs to drop below 3400 CHF/kW(el).",Cost Requirements for a Small-Scale SOFC Fed From Agricultural-Derived Biogas,10.1115/1.4035891
