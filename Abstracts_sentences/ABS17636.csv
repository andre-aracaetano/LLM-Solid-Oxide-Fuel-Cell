1,17636,"In order to study the grain boundary's (GB's) blocking effect in lanthanum silicate electrolyte, high density Al-doped apatite-type lanthanum silicate was synthesized and characterized by impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy.",Microanalysis of a Grain Boundary's Blocking Effect in Lanthanum Silicate Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/am401195e
2,17636,Microstructural characterization indicated that the GB's blocking effect was an intrinsic effect.,Microanalysis of a Grain Boundary's Blocking Effect in Lanthanum Silicate Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/am401195e
3,17636,Further microanalysis shows that the GB region is rich in La and poor in Si in comparing with the grain interior (GI).,Microanalysis of a Grain Boundary's Blocking Effect in Lanthanum Silicate Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/am401195e
4,17636,"Our discussion suggested that the chemical variation from GI to GB, on the one hand, could degrade the GB region's conductivity; on the other hand, it introduced a strong space-charge effect at GBs.",Microanalysis of a Grain Boundary's Blocking Effect in Lanthanum Silicate Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/am401195e
5,17636,The latter was believed to play a dominant role in the GB's blocking effect.,Microanalysis of a Grain Boundary's Blocking Effect in Lanthanum Silicate Electrolyte for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/am401195e
