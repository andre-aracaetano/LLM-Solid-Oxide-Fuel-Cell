4,8130,A thermal aging at 800 degrees C in H-2-7 vol% H2O for 100 h or 1000 h enhances both shear and tensile joint strengths at room temperature but degrades them at 800 degrees C in the same reducing environment Non-aged specimens show a comparable joint strength and fracture mode when tested in humidified hydrogen and in air under a given loading mode and testing temperature.,Joint strength of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect in a reducing environment,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.126
5,8130,"The shear strength at 800 degrees C for joint specimens after a 1000-h thermal aging at 800 degrees C in air or humidified hydrogen is reduced by a similar extent of 19%, compared to the counterpart of non-aged joint specimens tested in the same oxidizing or reducing environment.",Joint strength of a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant with metallic interconnect in a reducing environment,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.126
