1,6343,Rare-earth-doped CeO2 have been found to enhance the ionic conductivity of ceria-based electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) because trivalent rare-earth cations can spontaneously induce oxygen vacancies.,Effects of rare-earth doping on the ionic conduction of CeO2 in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.149
2,6343,"Experimentally, it has been shown that the rare-earth elements La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, and Er are likely candidates for electrolyte doping.",Effects of rare-earth doping on the ionic conduction of CeO2 in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.11.149
