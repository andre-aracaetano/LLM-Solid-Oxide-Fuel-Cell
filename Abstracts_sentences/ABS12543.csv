2,12543,The particle size and agglomeration of the starting powders were found to affect both the microstructure and electrochemical performance of the Ni-ScSZ cermet anodes.,Effect of microstructure on the electrochemical performance of Ni-ScSZ anodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.096
3,12543,"The lowest polarization resistance, 0.690 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C, was measured for the Ni-ScSZ anode prepared with fine NiO powder (similar to 0.5 mu m grain size).",Effect of microstructure on the electrochemical performance of Ni-ScSZ anodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.096
4,12543,This was attributed to the increase in the number of reaction sites afforded by the small grains and well-dispersed Ni and ScSZ phases.,Effect of microstructure on the electrochemical performance of Ni-ScSZ anodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.096
5,12543,"The effect of the anode sintering temperature was also found to affect the anode microstructure, adhesion with the electrolyte, and consequently anode polarization resistance.",Effect of microstructure on the electrochemical performance of Ni-ScSZ anodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.096
6,12543,The lowest polarization resistance was observed for the anode sintered at 1400 degrees C and this was 3-5 times lower than the corresponding values for anodes sintered at lower temperatures.,Effect of microstructure on the electrochemical performance of Ni-ScSZ anodes,10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.04.096
