1,10873,Samarium doped ceria (SDC) thin films were deposited by e-beam evaporation Of Sm0.15Ce0.85O1.95 nanopowder.,FORMATION OF SAMARIUM DOPED CERIA THIN FILMS,10.3952/lithjphys.49111
2,10873,The influence of electron gun power and temperature of substrate (optical quartz and Alloy Fe-Ni-Cr) on film crystallite size and texture were studied.,FORMATION OF SAMARIUM DOPED CERIA THIN FILMS,10.3952/lithjphys.49111
3,10873,The formed SDC thin films were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).,FORMATION OF SAMARIUM DOPED CERIA THIN FILMS,10.3952/lithjphys.49111
4,10873,It was determined that electron gun power (in range from 0.12 to 0.78 kW) has influence on crystallite size (increased from 5 to 19.2 nm) which increases as the gun power increases.,FORMATION OF SAMARIUM DOPED CERIA THIN FILMS,10.3952/lithjphys.49111
5,10873,The crystallite size increases from 12 to 47 nm by increasing substrate temperature from 100 to 600 degrees C.,FORMATION OF SAMARIUM DOPED CERIA THIN FILMS,10.3952/lithjphys.49111
6,10873,The texture of formed SDC thin films is not influenced by e-beam gun power and substrate temperature.,FORMATION OF SAMARIUM DOPED CERIA THIN FILMS,10.3952/lithjphys.49111
7,10873,The thermal treatment shows that deposited SDC thin films are stable and the crystallite size and texture are not changing during the heating and cooling.,FORMATION OF SAMARIUM DOPED CERIA THIN FILMS,10.3952/lithjphys.49111
