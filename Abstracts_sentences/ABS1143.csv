6,1143,"Unlike pure YSZ, a dense LST-YSZ composite with 60-wt% LST exhibited an electronic conductivity of 7.6 S/cm at 700 degrees C after reduction in H-2 at 1000 degrees C, making the composite layer attractive for current collection in anode-supported cells.",A support layer for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.ceramint.2006.03.012
