5,11514,The results of the thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction indicated that a single-phase fluorite structure formed at the relatively low calcination temperature of 600 degrees C for 3 h. The two-probe ac impedance spectroscopy was used to study the total ionic conductivity of doped and co-doped ceria ceramics at 800 degrees C.,Characterization of Sm and Nd Co-Doped Ceria-Based Electrolyte Materials,10.12693/APhysPolA.129.524
