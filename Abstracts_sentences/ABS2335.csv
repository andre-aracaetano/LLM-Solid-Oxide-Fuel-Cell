1,2335,"Much attention is focused in the fuel cell community on the development of reliable stack technology, bur to successfully exploit fuel cells, they must form part of integrated power generation systems.",A fuel cell balance of plant test facility,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02791-2
2,2335,"No universal test facilities exist to evaluate SOFC stacks and comparatively little research has been undertaken concerning the issues of the rest of the system, or balance of plant (BOP).",A fuel cell balance of plant test facility,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02791-2
3,2335,"EG, in collaboration with Eniricerche, has therefore recently designed and built a test facility to evaluate different configurations of the BOP equipment for a 1-5 kW(e) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack.",A fuel cell balance of plant test facility,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02791-2
4,2335,"Within this BOP project, integrated, dynamic models have been developed.",A fuel cell balance of plant test facility,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02791-2
5,2335,"These have shown that three characteristic response times exist when the stack load is changed and that three independent control loops are required to manage the almost instantaneous change in power output from an SOFC stack, maintain the fuel utilisation and control the stack temperature.",A fuel cell balance of plant test facility,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02791-2
6,2335,"Control strategies and plant simplifications, arising from the dynamic modelling, have also been implemented in the BOP test facility.",A fuel cell balance of plant test facility,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02791-2
7,2335,"An SOFC simulator was designed and integrated into the control system of the test rig to behave as a real SOFC stack, allowing the development of control strategies without the need for a real stack.",A fuel cell balance of plant test facility,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02791-2
8,2335,"A novel combustor has Seen specifically designed, built and demonstrated to be capable of burning the low calorific anode exhaust as from an SOFC using the oxygen depleted cathode stream.",A fuel cell balance of plant test facility,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02791-2
9,2335,"High temperature, low cost, shell and tube heat exchangers have been shown to be suitable for SOFC systems.",A fuel cell balance of plant test facility,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02791-2
10,2335,"Sealing of high temperature anode recirculation fans has, however, been shown to be a major issue and identified as a key area for further investigation.",A fuel cell balance of plant test facility,10.1016/S0378-7753(97)02791-2
