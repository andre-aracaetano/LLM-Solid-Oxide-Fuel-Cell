1,18502,This paper presents a multi-criteria optimization of integrated power systems.,Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
2,18502,"Five power configurations that combines the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), gas turbine cycle (GTC), steam turbine cycle (STC), organic Rankine cycle (ORC), absorption refrigeration cycle (ARC), and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as SOFC-GTC, SOFC-GT-STC, SOFC-GT-ST-ORC, SOFC-GT-ST-OR-ARC, and SOFC-GT-ST-OR-AR-CCS were proposed, modeled, and analyzed.",Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
3,18502,The proposed plants were further subjected to the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) optimization with technical and socio-economic parameters as the decision criteria.,Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
4,18502,"Important results suggest that the power of the proposed systems are within 207-281 MW, while energy and exergy efficiencies are in the range of 42.93-58.13% and 42.49-57.54%, respectively.",Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
5,18502,The exergy destruction rate is within 206-322.9 MW.,Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
6,18502,"Furthermore, SOFC-GT-ST-OR-AR-CCS that integrates all the investigated power cycles, including the carbon capture proposes a CO2 emission factor of 0.029 ton/MWh, as against 0.332-0.401 ton/MWh for the other configurations.",Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
7,18502,"Unit cost of energy (UCOE) for all systems are within $0.059-0.141 per kWh, with the SOFC-GT-ST-OR-AR-CCS having the highest UCOE.",Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
8,18502,The cost of CO2 avoidance of $110 per ton of CO2 suggests the minimum carbon tax that will make SOFC-GT-ST-OR-AR-CCS economically competitive with the best configuration that is without carbon capture.,Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
9,18502,"Also, the carbon capture integrated power system has the least efficiency of 42.93% because a portion (73.5 MW) of the power generation was used in the carbon capture process.",Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
10,18502,"Nonetheless, the TOPSIS results suggest that at 0.7312, the SOFC-GT-ST-OR-AR-CCS is closest to the ideal solution, when compared to the other configurations which fall within 0.2238-0.7312.",Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
11,18502,It is suggested that policies in Nigeria should promote (i) the integration of CCS technology in power generation; (ii) the retrofitting of simple cycle power plants with medium- and low-grade thermal power technologies; and (iii) dual-fuel power plants (natural gas and biomass) to harness the benefit of carbon neutrality in biomass and good energy density in natural gas.,Multi-criteria optimisation of integrated power systems for low-environmental impact,10.1080/15567036.2022.2064565
