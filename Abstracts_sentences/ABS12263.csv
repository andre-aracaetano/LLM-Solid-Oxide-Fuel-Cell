1,12263,"To achieve chromium tolerance and high performance, a new series of high-entropy perovskites (HEPs) are investigated as cathode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",High-Entropy Perovskite as a High-Performing Chromium-Tolerant Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c03657
2,12263,"Multiple rare- earth, alkaline-earth, and high-order transition metal elements are used for the A-site of this ABO(3) structure.",High-Entropy Perovskite as a High-Performing Chromium-Tolerant Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c03657
3,12263,A pure phase is achieved through the designed combination of different elements in seven out of eight candidates.,High-Entropy Perovskite as a High-Performing Chromium-Tolerant Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c03657
4,12263,"Due to the retaining of alkaline-earth elements Sr and/or Ba, the electrical conductivities of these HEPs are in the order of 100 S/cm at 550-700 degrees C, a value that can practically eliminate the electronic resistance of the porous cathode.",High-Entropy Perovskite as a High-Performing Chromium-Tolerant Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c03657
5,12263,Three out of eight candidates show similar or better performance than the (La0.6Sr0.4)(Co0.2Fe0.8)O-3-(delta) (LSCF) benchmark.,High-Entropy Perovskite as a High-Performing Chromium-Tolerant Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c03657
6,12263,It is found that A-site elements can cast a substantial influence on the overall performance even with a change as small as 10% of the total cations.,High-Entropy Perovskite as a High-Performing Chromium-Tolerant Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c03657
7,12263,"It seems that each element has its individual phenomenal activity that can be transferred from one candidate to the other in the general setting of the perovskite structure, leading to the best candidate by using the three most active elements simultaneously at the A-site.",High-Entropy Perovskite as a High-Performing Chromium-Tolerant Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c03657
8,12263,"Excellent Cr tolerance has been observed on the (La0.2Sr0.2Pr0.2Y0.2Ba0.2)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta sample, showing degradation of only 0.25%/kh during a 41 day operation in the presence of Cr, while LSCF increases by 100% within the first day in the same condition.",High-Entropy Perovskite as a High-Performing Chromium-Tolerant Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c03657
9,12263,"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy discovers no Sr segregation as LSCF is found in this HEP; rather, the active element Y takes more A-sites on the outermost layer after long-term operation.",High-Entropy Perovskite as a High-Performing Chromium-Tolerant Cathode for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1021/acsami.2c03657
