1,16097,"Although considered one of the major energy-intensive industries (EIIs), the pulp and paper industry has also the potential for energy production from an industrial waste, black liquor.",Black liquor gasification with calcium looping for carbon-negative pulp and paper industry,10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103436
2,16097,This study proposes black liquor gasification (BLG) coupled with calcium looping (CaL) as a CO2 capture route for the pulp and paper industry.,Black liquor gasification with calcium looping for carbon-negative pulp and paper industry,10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103436
3,16097,"BLG with H-2 production (BLG-CaL-H-2), BLG with gas turbine combined cycle (BLG-CaL-GT) or with solid oxide fuel cell (BLG-CaL-SOFC) were considered.",Black liquor gasification with calcium looping for carbon-negative pulp and paper industry,10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103436
4,16097,"The dependence of carbon capture and storage (CCS) cost on the natural gas, limestone, electricity imported and H-2 sale prices aside the expenditures related with BLG-CaL were evaluated.",Black liquor gasification with calcium looping for carbon-negative pulp and paper industry,10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103436
5,16097,"The CCS route, based on CaL retrofitted to the pulp and paper plant, was found to have a lower cost of CO2 avoided (39.0 (sic)/tCO(2)) when compared with BLG-CaL (48.8-57.1 (sic)/tCO(2)).",Black liquor gasification with calcium looping for carbon-negative pulp and paper industry,10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103436
6,16097,"Between the BLG-CaL scenarios, BLG-CaL-H-2 presented the lowest cost of CO2 avoided (48.8(sic)/tCO(2)) but the highest energy penalty.",Black liquor gasification with calcium looping for carbon-negative pulp and paper industry,10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103436
7,16097,"Based on the thermodynamic performance, it was shown that CaL retrofit and BLG-CaL-SOFC presented the best overall performance, turning the electricity importer reference plant into electricity exporter.",Black liquor gasification with calcium looping for carbon-negative pulp and paper industry,10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103436
8,16097,The economic sensitivity showed that the capital requirement of BLG-CaL has a strong effect on the cost of CO2 avoided for all alternatives.,Black liquor gasification with calcium looping for carbon-negative pulp and paper industry,10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103436
9,16097,The H-2 production is also strongly affected by the H-2 sale price while BLG-CaL-SOFC and BLG-CaL-GT are strongly dependent on natural gas price.,Black liquor gasification with calcium looping for carbon-negative pulp and paper industry,10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103436
