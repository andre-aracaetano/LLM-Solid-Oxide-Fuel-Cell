1,6766,La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) cathode films for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) were formed on a solid electrolyte sheet using the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique.,Formation of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 films as SOFC cathodes by electrophoretic deposition,10.2109/jcersj2.118.1202
2,6766,The EPD process was undertaken in methanol suspensions containing LSM particles with different mean particle sizes.,Formation of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 films as SOFC cathodes by electrophoretic deposition,10.2109/jcersj2.118.1202
3,6766,The zeta potentials of the LSM dispersions in methanol tended to decrease with increased sintering temperature during powder preparation.,Formation of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 films as SOFC cathodes by electrophoretic deposition,10.2109/jcersj2.118.1202
4,6766,"The morphology of the cathodic films was significantly dependent on the mean particle size and the grain sizes in the films after sintering at 1100 degrees C were in the order of LSM600 > LSM1000 > LSM800, with corresponding cathodic performance in the order of LSM800 > LSM1000 >",Formation of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 films as SOFC cathodes by electrophoretic deposition,10.2109/jcersj2.118.1202

6,6766,"The morphology of the LSM 800 films varied with the DC voltage applied during the EPD process (7.5 and 15 V), and a more densely deposited phase with finer pores was achieved with lower applied voltage.",Formation of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 films as SOFC cathodes by electrophoretic deposition,10.2109/jcersj2.118.1202
7,6766,"Increase in applied voltage tended to induce particle growth; therefore, the film applied at low voltage exhibited the highest cathodic performance.",Formation of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 films as SOFC cathodes by electrophoretic deposition,10.2109/jcersj2.118.1202
8,6766,"The cathodic performance was not dependent on the film thickness in the range between 5 and 15 mu m, which implies that the LSM800 film was sufficiently porous to provide a suitable rate of oxygen gas diffusion.",Formation of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 films as SOFC cathodes by electrophoretic deposition,10.2109/jcersj2.118.1202
