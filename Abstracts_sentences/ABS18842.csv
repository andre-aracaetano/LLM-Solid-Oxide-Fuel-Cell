1,18842,Lanthanide-doped thoria is relevant both to nuclear energy and to solid oxide fuel cell technology.,Thermochemistry of Lanthana- and Yttria-Doped Thoria,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04001.x
2,18842,"It is also a simple model system in which oxygen vacancy concentration is directly proportional to doping with no complication from oxidation-reduction reactions, ordered phases, or phase transitions in the tetravalent oxide.",Thermochemistry of Lanthana- and Yttria-Doped Thoria,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04001.x
3,18842,"Despite this relevance, only few thermodynamic data are available for such systems.",Thermochemistry of Lanthana- and Yttria-Doped Thoria,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04001.x
4,18842,"In the present study, LaxTh1-xO2-0.5x (0 < x < 0.50) and YxTh1-xO2-0.5x (0 < x < 0.18) have been synthesized, characterized, and systematically studied for the first time using high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry.",Thermochemistry of Lanthana- and Yttria-Doped Thoria,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04001.x
5,18842,Two competing effects contribute to the energetics: endothermic deviation from ideality related to cation size difference and partial stabilization of the system due to the exothermic formation of defect clusters.,Thermochemistry of Lanthana- and Yttria-Doped Thoria,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04001.x
6,18842,The former can be described by endothermic regular solution interaction parameters of 119.3 +/- 11.4 kJ/mol for the yttria system and 27.8 +/- 4.1 kJ/mol for the lanthana system.,Thermochemistry of Lanthana- and Yttria-Doped Thoria,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04001.x
7,18842,The latter can be described by exothermic vacancy clustering or defect association energies of -116.3 +/- 23.3 kJ/mol for yttria-doped thoria and -98.6 +/- 19.7 kJ/mol for lanthana-doped thoria.,Thermochemistry of Lanthana- and Yttria-Doped Thoria,10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.04001.x
