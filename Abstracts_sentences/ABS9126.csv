1,9126,The main degradation mechanism of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta cathodes is Sr segregation on the surface.,A new (La0.2Nd0.2Gd0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ high-entropy oxide cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116233
2,9126,"In this paper, the high-entropy (La0.2Nd0.2Gd0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta(HE-LSCF) oxide with perovskite-type is designed to improve the cathode stability.",A new (La0.2Nd0.2Gd0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ high-entropy oxide cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116233
3,9126,"The orthorhombic perovskite phase with the space group of Pbnm(62) is obtained when the HE-LSCF oxide precursor powders are calcined at 800 degrees C for 2 h. The orthorhombic perovskite phase is still stable when the HE-LSCF oxide precursor powders are calcined at 1250 degrees C for 2 h. At 700 degrees C,the specific polarization resistance (Rasp) of the pristine HE-LSCF and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathodes is 0.71 omega cm2 and 0.57 omega cm2, respectively.",A new (La0.2Nd0.2Gd0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ high-entropy oxide cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116233
4,9126,The electrode process related to the oxygen dissociation and the interfacial charge transfer involving atomic oxygen is the rate-determining step of the oxygen reduction reaction in HE-LSCF cathodes.,A new (La0.2Nd0.2Gd0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ high-entropy oxide cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116233
5,9126,"After being aged for 200 h at 800 degrees C, Rasp at 700 degrees C of the LSCF and HE-LSCF electrodes increases by 122.8% and 5.6%,respectively.",A new (La0.2Nd0.2Gd0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ high-entropy oxide cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ssi.2023.116233
