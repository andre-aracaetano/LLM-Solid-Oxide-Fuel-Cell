1,6113,This report presents a demonstration and characterization of a nanotubular array of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) made of one-end-closed hollow tube Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia/Pt membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs).,Nanotubular Array Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/nn4042305
2,6113,The tubular MEAs are nominally similar to 5 mu m long and have <500 nm outside diameter with total MEA thickness of nearly 50 nm.,Nanotubular Array Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/nn4042305
3,6113,Open circuit voltages up to 660 mV (vs air) and power densities up to 1.3 mu W cm(-2) were measured at 550 degrees C using H-2 as fuel.,Nanotubular Array Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/nn4042305
4,6113,The paper also introduces a fabrication methodology primarily based on a template process involving atomic layer deposition and electrodeposition for building the nanotubular MEA architecture as an important step toward achieving high surface area ultrathin SOFCs operating in the intermediate to low-temperature regime.,Nanotubular Array Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/nn4042305
5,6113,"A fabricated nanotubular SOFC theoretically attains a 20-fold increase in the effective surface, while projections indicate the possibility of achieving up to 40-fold.",Nanotubular Array Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,10.1021/nn4042305
