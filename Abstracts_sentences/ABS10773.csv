1,10773,This study aims to investigate the fabrication of anode/electrolyte dual-layer hollow fiber (DLHF) with improved electrolyte properties and reduced sintering temperature for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) via a single-step phase inversion-based co-extrusion/co-sintering technique.,Properties and performance evaluation of dual-layer ceramic hollow fiber with modified electrolyte for MT-SOFC,10.1016/j.renene.2018.09.071
2,10773,The sintering properties of cerium gadolinium oxide (CGO) electrolyte were studied by comparing two approaches: i) using mixed particle size electrolyte; and (ii) adding lithium oxide as sintering additive in electrolyte.,Properties and performance evaluation of dual-layer ceramic hollow fiber with modified electrolyte for MT-SOFC,10.1016/j.renene.2018.09.071
3,10773,"When comparing the maximum power density of MT-SOFC namely nickel (Ni)-CGO/CGO (unmodified), Ni-CGO/30%nano-70%micron CGO (first approach) and Ni-CGO/lithium (Li)-CGO (second approach); it was found that the Ni-CGO/30%nano-70%micron CGO cell performed the best.",Properties and performance evaluation of dual-layer ceramic hollow fiber with modified electrolyte for MT-SOFC,10.1016/j.renene.2018.09.071
4,10773,"At 500 degrees C, the cell produced the highest maximum power density, which was 27.5 mWcm(-2) as compared to Ni-CGO/Li-CGO cell (6 mWcm(-2)) and Ni-CGO/CGO cell (20 mWcm(-2)).",Properties and performance evaluation of dual-layer ceramic hollow fiber with modified electrolyte for MT-SOFC,10.1016/j.renene.2018.09.071
5,10773,The high maximum power density was attributed to the porous anode in Ni-CGO/30%nano-70%mic CGO dual layer hollow fiber which provided higher number of active reaction sites.,Properties and performance evaluation of dual-layer ceramic hollow fiber with modified electrolyte for MT-SOFC,10.1016/j.renene.2018.09.071
6,10773,"Meanwhile, the dense electrolyte layer possessed pore filling caused by the introduction of 30% nano size CGO particles which reduced the direct flow of gases between the electrodes.",Properties and performance evaluation of dual-layer ceramic hollow fiber with modified electrolyte for MT-SOFC,10.1016/j.renene.2018.09.071
