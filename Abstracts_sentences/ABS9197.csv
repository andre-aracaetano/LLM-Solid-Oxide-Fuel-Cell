1,9197,Air brazing is a new method of joining in which a predominantly metallic joint is formed directly in air without need of an inert cover gas or the use of a surface reactive flux.,Development of High-Temperature Air Braze Filler Metals for Use in Two-Step Joining and Sealing Processes,
2,9197,"Prior work has shown that the resulting bond displays excellent strength, is inherently resistant to oxidation during high-temperature application (T similar to 750 degrees C), and offers long-term hermeticity at high temperatures when employed as a gas- or liquid-tight sealant.",Development of High-Temperature Air Braze Filler Metals for Use in Two-Step Joining and Sealing Processes,
3,9197,"Because of these properties, air brazing is being considered for use in fabricating a variety of high-temperature devices, including planar solid oxide fuel cells (pSOFCs), oxygen and hydrogen gas separators, and boiling water pH sensors.",Development of High-Temperature Air Braze Filler Metals for Use in Two-Step Joining and Sealing Processes,
4,9197,"However, many of these devices require a two-step sealing process.",Development of High-Temperature Air Braze Filler Metals for Use in Two-Step Joining and Sealing Processes,
5,9197,"For example, in pSOFCs, the ceramic electrolyte membrane is first sealed to a metallic frame/separator plate to form a cell or repeat unit.",Development of High-Temperature Air Braze Filler Metals for Use in Two-Step Joining and Sealing Processes,
6,9197,These are then joined together in a second sealing step to build the final pSOFC stack.,Development of High-Temperature Air Braze Filler Metals for Use in Two-Step Joining and Sealing Processes,
7,9197,"In order to preserve the integrity of the membrane-to-frame seals formed during cell fabrication, it is important that the corresponding sealing material does not melt or soften during stack sealing.",Development of High-Temperature Air Braze Filler Metals for Use in Two-Step Joining and Sealing Processes,
8,9197,"The goal of the study presented here was to investigate the addition of palladium as a melt point elevator for a series of silver-copper oxide air braze filler metals and thereby produce a composition that could conceivably be used in the first part of a two-step air brazing process, with a lower melt point binary air braze composition employed in the second.",Development of High-Temperature Air Braze Filler Metals for Use in Two-Step Joining and Sealing Processes,
