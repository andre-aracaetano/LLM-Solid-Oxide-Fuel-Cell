2,5753,"These microstructural alterations, primarily the growth of NiO inclusions at the Ni vertical bar YSZ interface, the resultant orientation relationship between the NiO and YSZ grains, and Ni grain fragmentation on subsequent reduction, provide a straightforward evidence for the so-called oxygen spillover mechanism of the anodic reaction.",Ion transfer in Ni-containing composite anodes of solid oxide fuel cells: A microstructural study,10.1016/j.matlet.2018.01.022
