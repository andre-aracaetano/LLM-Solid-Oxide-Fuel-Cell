1,9774,This work analyses the performance of hybrid power plants based on solid oxide fuel cells integrated with micro-gas turbines (SOFC-MGT).,SOFC-MGT hybrid power plants fuelled by methanol and DME,10.1007/s10800-008-9508-4
2,9774,"Internally and externally reformed SOFC-MGT systems fuelled with methane, methanol, ethanol and DME have been compared.",SOFC-MGT hybrid power plants fuelled by methanol and DME,10.1007/s10800-008-9508-4
3,9774,"The results show that simply replacing methane with methanol, ethanol or DME in internally reformed SOFC-MGT systems slightly reduces efficiency and power output.",SOFC-MGT hybrid power plants fuelled by methanol and DME,10.1007/s10800-008-9508-4
4,9774,"In contrast, using methanol and DME in externally reformed SOFC-MGT hybrid plants can lead to efficiency improvement with respect to internally reformed hybrid plants fuelled by methane, especially for the higher values of the fuel utilization factor (higher than about 70% for methanol and 80% for DME).",SOFC-MGT hybrid power plants fuelled by methanol and DME,10.1007/s10800-008-9508-4
5,9774,"Finally, the main operating parameters of the fuel reforming section (temperature and steam-to-carbon ratio, SCR) must be carefully chosen in order to optimise the hybrid plant performance.",SOFC-MGT hybrid power plants fuelled by methanol and DME,10.1007/s10800-008-9508-4
