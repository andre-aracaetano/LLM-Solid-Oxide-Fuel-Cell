5,10238,These observations support microstructural evolution correlated to SOFC performance.,Three-dimensional microstructural changes in the Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anode during operation,10.1016/j.actamat.2012.02.041
6,10238,"We find that Ni coarsening is driven by particle curvature as indicated by the dihedral angles between the Ni, YSZ and pore phases, and hypothesize that growth occurs primarily by means of diffusion and particle agglomeration constrained by a pinning mechanism related to the YSZ phase.",Three-dimensional microstructural changes in the Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anode during operation,10.1016/j.actamat.2012.02.041
7,10238,The decrease in Ni phase size after extended periods of time may be the result of a second process connected to a mobility-induced decrease in the YSZ phase size or non-uniform curvature resulting in a net decrease in Ni phase size.,Three-dimensional microstructural changes in the Ni-YSZ solid oxide fuel cell anode during operation,10.1016/j.actamat.2012.02.041
