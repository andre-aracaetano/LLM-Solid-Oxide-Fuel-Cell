2,1663,"Syngas, produced by the gasification of coal, is shifted to produce H-2 which in turn fuels stacks of solid oxide fuel cells.",High-Efficiency Power Production from Coal with Carbon Capture,10.1002/aic.12230
3,1663,"Because the fuel cells maintain separate anode and cathode streams, air can be used as the oxygen source without diluting the fuel exhaust with nitrogen.",High-Efficiency Power Production from Coal with Carbon Capture,10.1002/aic.12230
4,1663,This enables recovery of CO2 from the exhaust with a very small energy penalty.,High-Efficiency Power Production from Coal with Carbon Capture,10.1002/aic.12230
5,1663,"As a result, an absorption-based CO2 recovery process is avoided, as well as the production of large quantities of high-purity O-2, allowing a high overall thermal efficiency and essentially eliminating the energy penalty for carbon capture.",High-Efficiency Power Production from Coal with Carbon Capture,10.1002/aic.12230
