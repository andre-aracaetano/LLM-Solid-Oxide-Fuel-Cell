1,20676,Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer several advantages over lower temperature polymeric membrane fuels cells (PMFCs) due to their multiple fuel flexibility and requirement of low purity hydrogen.,Gd3+ and Bi3+ co-substituted cubic zirconia; (Zr1-x-yGdxBiyO2-δ): a novel high κ relaxor dielectric and superior oxide-ion conductor,10.1039/d2ra01867e
2,20676,"In order to decrease the operating temperature of SOFCs and to overcome the high operating cost and materials degradation challenges, the Cubic phase of ZrO2 was stabilized with simultaneous substitution of Bi and Gd and the effect of co-doping on the oxide-ion conductivity of Zr1-x-yBixGdyO2-delta was studied to develop a superior electrolyte separator for SOFCs.",Gd3+ and Bi3+ co-substituted cubic zirconia; (Zr1-x-yGdxBiyO2-δ): a novel high κ relaxor dielectric and superior oxide-ion conductor,10.1039/d2ra01867e
3,20676,"Up to 30% Gd and 20% Bi were simultaneously substituted in the cubic ZrO2 lattice (Zr1-x-yGdxBiyO2-delta, x + y <= 0.4, x <= 0.3 and y <= 0.2) by employing a solution combustion method followed by multiple calcinations at 900 degrees C. Phase purity and composition of the material is confirmed by powder XRD and EDX measurements.",Gd3+ and Bi3+ co-substituted cubic zirconia; (Zr1-x-yGdxBiyO2-δ): a novel high κ relaxor dielectric and superior oxide-ion conductor,10.1039/d2ra01867e

5,20676,"With the incorporation of Bi3+ and Gd3+ ions, the cubic Zr1-x-yBixGdyO2-delta phase showed relaxor type high kappa dielectric behaviour (epsilon' = 9725 at 600 degrees C at applied frequency 20 kHz for Zr0.6Bi0.2Gd0.2O1.8) with approaching 600 degrees C.",Gd3+ and Bi3+ co-substituted cubic zirconia; (Zr1-x-yGdxBiyO2-δ): a novel high κ relaxor dielectric and superior oxide-ion conductor,10.1039/d2ra01867e
6,20676,The high polarizability of the Bi3+ ion coupled with synergistic interaction of Bi and Gd in the host ZrO2 lattice seems to create the more labile oxide ion vacancies that enable superior oxide-ion transport resulting in high oxide ion conductivity (sigma(o) > 10(-2),Gd3+ and Bi3+ co-substituted cubic zirconia; (Zr1-x-yGdxBiyO2-δ): a novel high κ relaxor dielectric and superior oxide-ion conductor,10.1039/d2ra01867e
