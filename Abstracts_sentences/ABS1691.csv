1,1691,"In this study, we introduced tungstate into solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for the first time by using a La/Pr-doped CeO2 (LCP)/K2WO4 composite as the electrolyte, which exhibited remarkably enhanced grain boundary conduction compared to that of single-phase LCP.",Electrochemical properties of LaCePr-oxide/K2WO4 composite electrolyte for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.elecom.2016.12.013
2,1691,The composition dependence of the electrical conductivity was investigated.,Electrochemical properties of LaCePr-oxide/K2WO4 composite electrolyte for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.elecom.2016.12.013
3,1691,"As a result, the composite with 10 wt% K2WO4 was proven to be the optimum ratio, revealing a significantly higher ionic conductivity than LCP, along with a negligible electronic conductivity.",Electrochemical properties of LaCePr-oxide/K2WO4 composite electrolyte for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.elecom.2016.12.013
4,1691,The fuel cell using the LCP/K2WO4 electrolyte displayed an encouraging performance of 500 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C. These findings indicate that the LCP/K2WO4 composite is a promising electrolyte for low-temperature SOFCs.,Electrochemical properties of LaCePr-oxide/K2WO4 composite electrolyte for low-temperature SOFCs,10.1016/j.elecom.2016.12.013
