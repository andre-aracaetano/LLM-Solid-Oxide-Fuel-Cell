1,14822,"A novel Co-free cathode, La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-delta (LSFCr-3), exhibiting the desired combination of high electrical conductivity, physical and chemical stability, and electrocatalytic activity, was systematically investigated for SOFC applications.",Surface and bulk study of strontium-rich chromium ferrite oxide as a robust solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1039/c5ta05815e
2,14822,"Its excellent performance is attributed primarily to the presence of Cr, which was found to be predominant in the 3+ and 4+ oxidation states in the LSFCr-3 bulk, thus likely maintaining a 6-fold coordination with oxygen anions.",Surface and bulk study of strontium-rich chromium ferrite oxide as a robust solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1039/c5ta05815e
3,14822,"This, in turn, causes disorder in the oxygen vacancy sub-lattice, stabilized by the Fe ion-oxygen tetrahedra.",Surface and bulk study of strontium-rich chromium ferrite oxide as a robust solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1039/c5ta05815e
4,14822,"However, on the surface of the LSFCr-3 oxide, Cr is primarily in the 6+ state, together with some Cr3+/Cr4+, even at 700 degrees C. Cr6+ can only be tetrahedrally coordinated by oxygen anions, resulting in a large concentration of oxygen vacancies on the LSFCr-3 surface, with a surface exchange coefficient and oxygen ionic conductivity of ca.",Surface and bulk study of strontium-rich chromium ferrite oxide as a robust solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1039/c5ta05815e

8,14822,"The use of LSFCr-3 as the cathode in a Ni-Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-delta (SDC) anode-supported single solid oxide fuel cell in 3% H2O-H-2/air gave a maximum power density of 0.81 W cm(2) at 750 degrees C, which is superior to that of similar cells in which La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta, a previously well studied material, was used as the cathode.",Surface and bulk study of strontium-rich chromium ferrite oxide as a robust solid oxide fuel cell cathode,10.1039/c5ta05815e
