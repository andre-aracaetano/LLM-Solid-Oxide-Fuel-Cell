3,11464,Results show that Sm1.8Ce0.2CuO4 material is chemically compatible with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 at 1000 degrees C.,Study on Sm1.8Ce0.2CuO4-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.001
4,11464,The composite electrode exhibits optimum microstructure and forms good contact with the electrolyte after sintering at 1000 degrees C for 4 h. The polarization resistance (R-p) reduces to the minimum value of 0.17 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C in air for SCC-CGO06 composite cathode.,Study on Sm1.8Ce0.2CuO4-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.001
5,11464,The relationship between R-p and oxygen partial pressure indicates that the reaction rate-limiting step is the surface diffusion of the dissociative adsorbed oxygen on the composite cathode.,Study on Sm1.8Ce0.2CuO4-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 composite cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.001
