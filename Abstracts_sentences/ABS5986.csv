4,5986,"K-1 in the range from room temperature to 500 degrees C. Significant mismatch begins above 600 degrees C, but the internal stresses this mismatch might cause in the metallic component of the metal/ceramics junctions remain significantly below the yield strength up to the temperatures exceeding the starting temperature of relaxation processes by similar to 180-240 degrees C. The above alloys are phase stable so that no phase transformations are expected at the cell operating temperatures.",Alloys with thermal expansion matching to electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.3139/146.110353

6,5986,"The transfer of chromium from the alloys containing 34% Ni, 30% Co and 6-14% Cr into the La0.6Sr0.4MnO4 cathode material occurs after 400-600 h heating at 900 degrees C. Chromium penetrated to a depth of 20 mu m at most.",Alloys with thermal expansion matching to electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells,10.3139/146.110353
