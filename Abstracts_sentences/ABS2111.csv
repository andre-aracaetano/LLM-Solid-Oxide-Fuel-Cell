2,2111,"Without adding the shift catalyst to Ni-based anode, although stable fuel cell performance is achieved in carbon monoxide fuels, fuel cell experiences catastrophic degradation when adding 1 ppm hydrogen sulphide.",Sulphur tolerant shift reaction catalysts for nickel-based SOFC anode,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.11.009
3,2111,"While the nickel-based anode will still be poisoned by I ppm hydrogen sulphide in carbon monoxide fuels, the addition of catalysts to the anode side of the cell can provide stable performance after the adsorption-desorption equilibrium of sulphur on nickel is established.",Sulphur tolerant shift reaction catalysts for nickel-based SOFC anode,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.11.009
4,2111,The authors believe that this combination of nickel-based anode and sulphur-tolerant shift catalyst could provide higher cell efficiency than using a copper-ceria anode alone for certain fuel mixtures leading to advantages for certain SOFC applications.,Sulphur tolerant shift reaction catalysts for nickel-based SOFC anode,10.1016/j.ssi.2007.11.009
