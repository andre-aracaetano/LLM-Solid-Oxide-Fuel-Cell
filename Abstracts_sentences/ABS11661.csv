2,11661,The reaction between boron-containing sealing glass-ceramics and cathodes thus presents a challenge for the development of SOFC.,Reducing the reaction between boron-containing sealing glass-ceramics and lanthanum-containing cathode: Effect of La2O3,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.11.026
3,11661,"Here we report for the first time that the addition of La2O3 can significantly reduce the boron volatility from sealing glass-ceramics and consequently the formation of LaBO3 in reaction couple between glass and (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O-3 (LSCF) cathode.",Reducing the reaction between boron-containing sealing glass-ceramics and lanthanum-containing cathode: Effect of La2O3,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.11.026
4,11661,"In particular, the boron volatility can be reduced by about 6 times with the addition of 4 mol.%La2O3 (3.7 x 10(-3) vs. 0.6 x 10(-3)%).",Reducing the reaction between boron-containing sealing glass-ceramics and lanthanum-containing cathode: Effect of La2O3,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.11.026

6,11661,"In addition, La2O3 dopant favors the formation of boron-containing phase (La5SiBO13) in glass-ceramics, which dramatically reduces the boron volatility.",Reducing the reaction between boron-containing sealing glass-ceramics and lanthanum-containing cathode: Effect of La2O3,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.11.026
7,11661,The reported results provide an effective approach for solving the sealing challenge.,Reducing the reaction between boron-containing sealing glass-ceramics and lanthanum-containing cathode: Effect of La2O3,10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2015.11.026
