3,6899,"Using a ZnO content over 1 mol%, the sinterability of Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 is significantly improved by reducing the sintering temperature from 1500 to 1350 degrees C and a relative density of above 95% was achieved.",Sinterability and electrical properties of ZnO-doped Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 electrolytes prepared by an EDTA-citrate complexing method,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.08.111
4,6899,"The highest ionic conductivity of 0.0516 S cm(-1) was obtained at 750 degrees C for (YDC)(0.99)(ZnO)(0.01) sintered at 1350 degrees C. Pure YDC sintered at 1500 degrees C, on the other hand, yielded 0.0289 S cm(-1).",Sinterability and electrical properties of ZnO-doped Ce0.8Y0.2O1.9 electrolytes prepared by an EDTA-citrate complexing method,10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.08.111
