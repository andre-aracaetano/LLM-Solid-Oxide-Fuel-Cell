1,7132,The stability of the anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell consisting of Ni-YSZ vertical bar YSZ vertical bar LSM was examined at 800 degrees C: by monitoring the current density at a constant terminal voltage of 0.5 V.,Sudden Deterioration in Performance During Discharge of Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.123
2,7132,"Although stable power generation was possible within initial 60 min, gradual decrease and subsequent sudden drop in current density were observed: a series of this behavior was different from that observed in limiting current density.",Sudden Deterioration in Performance During Discharge of Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.123
3,7132,This behavior is suggested to be one of the degradation factors related with transport of gas species in the pores of the electrode.,Sudden Deterioration in Performance During Discharge of Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.123
4,7132,"In response to performance deterioration, a drastic increase in ohmic loss and impedance was confirmed soon after the discharge operation.",Sudden Deterioration in Performance During Discharge of Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.123
5,7132,"It is noted, however, that the deteriorated performance was reversibly recovered depending on the holding time under the open-circuit condition.",Sudden Deterioration in Performance During Discharge of Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.123
6,7132,"Analogous phenomena occurred with the cell consisted of Ni-YSZ vertical bar YSZ vertical bar Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 vertical bar La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3, indicating that the cause of the sudden deterioration was in the anode side.",Sudden Deterioration in Performance During Discharge of Anode-supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells,10.5796/electrochemistry.77.123
