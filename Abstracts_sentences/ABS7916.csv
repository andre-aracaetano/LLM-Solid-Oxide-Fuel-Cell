1,7916,"This paper analyzes the influence of synthesis conditions on the reducibility and catalytic behavior of Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 mixed oxide synthesized by alpha-amino acid/metallic nitrate combustion processes, through stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric routes.",Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 nanocatalyst: Influence of synthesis conditions in the reducibility and catalytic activity,10.1016/j.catcom.2011.07.029
2,7916,We concluded that the alpha-amino acid selected and the a-amino acid/nitrate molar ratio strongly influence the reducibility and catalytic activity in the total combustion of methane.,Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 nanocatalyst: Influence of synthesis conditions in the reducibility and catalytic activity,10.1016/j.catcom.2011.07.029
3,7916,"Thus, the Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 catalyst synthesized by the stoichiometric route with glycine showed the higher catalytic activity, which, in conjunction with the well-known ionic and electronic conductivities of ceria-based oxides under reducing conditions, positions this solid as an appropriate anode material for methane-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells.",Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 nanocatalyst: Influence of synthesis conditions in the reducibility and catalytic activity,10.1016/j.catcom.2011.07.029
