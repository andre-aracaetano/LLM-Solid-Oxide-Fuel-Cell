4,1951,"Manganese additions to the alloy can reduce the activity of chromium in the oxide, either from solid solution replacement of chromium with manganese (at low levels of manganese) or from the formation of manganese-chromium spinels (at high levels of manganese).",Effect of manganese addition on reactive evaporation of chromium in Ni-Cr alloys,10.1361/105994906X117170
5,1951,This reduction in chromium activity leads to a predicted reduction in chromium evaporation factors as much as 35 at 800 degrees C and 55 at 700 degrees C. Quantifying the effects of manganese additions on chromium evaporation should aid alloy development of metallic interconnects and balance-of-plant alloys.,Effect of manganese addition on reactive evaporation of chromium in Ni-Cr alloys,10.1361/105994906X117170
