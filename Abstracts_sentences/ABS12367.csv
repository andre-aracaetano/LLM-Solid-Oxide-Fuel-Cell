3,12367,"The results show that La2CuO4 nanotubes with an average diameter of 150 nm are obtained after sintering at 700 degrees C for 2 h. The La2CuO4 nanotube forms sufficient connection with each other, and good contact with the electrolyte after sintering at 900 degrees C for 0.5 h. Comparing the results obtained by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), it is clearly observed that the nanotube cathode exhibits superior performance than the powder cathode.",Electrochemical Performance of La2CuO4 Nanotube Materials Prepared via Electrospinning Method,
