1,17263,Three-phase boundary length and gas diffusion characteristics significantly influence the performance of solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) Supporting structure of gradient pores can not only increase the three-phase boundary length but also improve the gas diffusion characteristics which helps reducing the polarization impedance of SOEC and elevating electrolysis performance.,A Support Structure with Gradient Pores Used for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,
2,17263,"8YSZ (8 mol % Yttria stabilised Zirconia power), the mature electrolyte material, and freeze casting process were used to prepare a supporting structure with gradient pores used for solid oxide electrolysis cell(SOEC).",A Support Structure with Gradient Pores Used for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,
3,17263,"Optimized conditions such as solid content, frozen temperature, dispersing agent and binder etc were investigated.",A Support Structure with Gradient Pores Used for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,
4,17263,Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was applied to characterize microstructure of the support plate prepared.,A Support Structure with Gradient Pores Used for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,
5,17263,The results indicate that the solid content is a determinant factor affecting plate intensity and pore size while the microstructure depends on frozen temperature.,A Support Structure with Gradient Pores Used for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell,
