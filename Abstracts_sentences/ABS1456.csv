2,1456,"The adoption of a turbocharger, instead of a micro gas turbine, for the fuel cell stack pressurisation, is an innovative solution that is expected to decrease the capital cost of such systems and to facilitate their penetration into the energy market.",Dynamics and control of a turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.116862
3,1456,"However, not being connected to an electric generator, the turbocharger rotational speed, and thus the air mass flow, cannot be directly controlled as in microturbines.",Dynamics and control of a turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.116862
4,1456,"The control of turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell systems is a novel topic, characterised by many technical challenges that have not been addressed before.",Dynamics and control of a turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.116862
5,1456,"To regulate the stack temperature, a cold bypass valve is included, connecting the compressor outlet to the turbine inlet.",Dynamics and control of a turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.116862
6,1456,A dynamic model of this system was developed in Matlab-Simulink (R) to analyse the response of the turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system to a cold bypass valve opening step change.,Dynamics and control of a turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.116862
7,1456,System information obtained from this analysis was used to design and tune four controllers: a conventional proportional integral controller and three different cascade controllers.,Dynamics and control of a turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.116862
8,1456,"The controller performance was evaluated under two different scenarios, considering quite aggressive power ramps.",Dynamics and control of a turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.116862
9,1456,"The best results were obtained with a cascade controller, where the feedback loop was complemented by a feed-forward contribution based on power demand.",Dynamics and control of a turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.116862
10,1456,"This analysis demonstrated that such a control system effectively tracks the fuel cell maximum temperature target, complying with all the system operative constraints.",Dynamics and control of a turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system,10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.116862
