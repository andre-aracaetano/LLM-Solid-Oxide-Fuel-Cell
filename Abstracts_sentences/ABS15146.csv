1,15146,Quantitative effect and mechanism of Cr on cell performance inside stack are investigated by incorporating Cr in the cathode current-collecting layer (CCCL).,Effect and mechanism of Cr deposition in cathode current collecting layer on cell performance inside stack for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.112
2,15146,The results show that the maximum output power density (MOPD) of the unit cell inside a stack decreases as the Cr content increases beyond 253.81 mu g cm(-2).,Effect and mechanism of Cr deposition in cathode current collecting layer on cell performance inside stack for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.112
3,15146,The MOPD is independent of Cr when its content is less than 253.81 mu g cm(-2) at the original operation stage.,Effect and mechanism of Cr deposition in cathode current collecting layer on cell performance inside stack for planar solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.112
