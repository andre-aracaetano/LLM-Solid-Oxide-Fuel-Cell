1,10935,"A promising perovskite oxide, Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.19Fe0.76Mo0.05O3-sigma (PSCFM), is developed as cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs).",Mo doped Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode material with high catalytic activity for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.08.154
2,10935,"The electrical conductivity of PSCFM reaches 160.2, 212.7 and 236.7 S cm(-1) in air at 800, 700 and 600 degrees C, respectively whereas the polarization resistances are as low as 0.025, 0.06 and 0.221 Omega cm(2) at the corresponding temperatures.",Mo doped Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode material with high catalytic activity for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.08.154
3,10935,"The peak power densities of an electrolyte-supported cell with wet H-2 as the fuel are 0.555 and 0.442W cm(-2) at 800 and 750 degrees C, respectively, and a reasonably stable performance under 0.44 A cm(-2) for over 100 h at 700 degrees C are obtained, indicating that PSCFM is a potential cathode material for IT-SOFCs.",Mo doped Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ cathode material with high catalytic activity for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2014.08.154
