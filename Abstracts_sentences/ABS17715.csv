3,17715,The Arrhenius plots of the ionic conductivity for the stabilized samples were curved.,Temperature dependence of ionic conductivity in (1-x)ZrO2-(x-y)Sc2O3-yYb(2)O(3) electrolyte material,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00435-3
4,17715,The grain boundary resistance for (1 - x)ZrO2-(x - 0.03)Sc2O3-0.03Yb(2)O(3) (x = 0.07-0.15) was separated from the total resistance with the AC impedance method.,Temperature dependence of ionic conductivity in (1-x)ZrO2-(x-y)Sc2O3-yYb(2)O(3) electrolyte material,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00435-3
5,17715,This allowed us to conclude that grain boundary resistance is not the cause of the curvature in the Arrhenius plots for this system.,Temperature dependence of ionic conductivity in (1-x)ZrO2-(x-y)Sc2O3-yYb(2)O(3) electrolyte material,10.1016/S0167-2738(96)00435-3
