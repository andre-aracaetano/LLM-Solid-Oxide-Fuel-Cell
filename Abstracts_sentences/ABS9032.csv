1,9032,The effects of H2S and H2O in the methane feed on carbon deposition in a La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3 (LSBT) anode-based solid oxide fuel cell were investigated in this work under different operating conditions.,Effects of H2S and H2O on carbon deposition over La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3/YSZ perovskite anodes in methane fueled SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.124
2,9032,"Characterization was done using a combination of electrochemical, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements.",Effects of H2S and H2O on carbon deposition over La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3/YSZ perovskite anodes in methane fueled SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.124
3,9032,"As expected, carbon accumulation became more severe with increasing exposure time and operating temperature, but less severe in the presence of a current and/or steam.",Effects of H2S and H2O on carbon deposition over La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3/YSZ perovskite anodes in methane fueled SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.124
4,9032,Addition of 0.5% H2S to the feed increased carbon accumulation and this carbon could not be removed effectively by co-feeding a small amount of steam to the anode.,Effects of H2S and H2O on carbon deposition over La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3/YSZ perovskite anodes in methane fueled SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.124
5,9032,"The resulting carbon was, however, easier to remove with oxygen as compared to that deposited by the H2S-containing dry feed.",Effects of H2S and H2O on carbon deposition over La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3/YSZ perovskite anodes in methane fueled SOFCs,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.124
