3,18838,The lowest polarization resistance for oxygen reduction was found for PrSr3Fe1.5Co1.5O10-delta.,"Study of the n=3 Ruddlesden-Popper phases LnSr3Fe1.5Co1.5O10-δ (Ln = La, Pr, Nd) as oxygen reduction electrodes by impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.ssi.2018.08.020
4,18838,The impedance spectra of the three electrodes reveal the presence of two contributions which has been preliminarily identified based on the dependence of the polarization resistance of these contributions on oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) and temperature.,"Study of the n=3 Ruddlesden-Popper phases LnSr3Fe1.5Co1.5O10-δ (Ln = La, Pr, Nd) as oxygen reduction electrodes by impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.ssi.2018.08.020
5,18838,"For the intermediate frequency contribution, the rate limiting processes would be a mixture of oxygen adsorption plus charge transfer at the electrode surface with oxide ion diffusion whereas the low frequency arc would correspond to the oxygen molecule adsorption and dissociation and oxygen gas diffusion.","Study of the n=3 Ruddlesden-Popper phases LnSr3Fe1.5Co1.5O10-δ (Ln = La, Pr, Nd) as oxygen reduction electrodes by impedance spectroscopy",10.1016/j.ssi.2018.08.020
