1,10396,"The role of nanosized metallic oxides (MxOy) in phase stability, thermal behavior and electrical conductivity of 8 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) has been investigated.",Improved structural stability and electrochemical performance of 8YSZ electrolyte by MxOy doping for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs),10.1016/j.mseb.2017.08.020
2,10396,"8YSZ co-doped with 4 mol% MxOy (YSZ-MxOy) powders have been elaborated by solid state reaction at 1500 degrees C during 12 h. The ionic conductivity of 8YSZ has been improved by adding CeO2, ZnO or their mixture CeO2-ZnO as nanosized stabilizers for ZrO2 matrix in the temperature field from 400 degrees C to 600 degrees C. Finally, the performance evaluation of 200 mu m thick film YSZ-MxOy as electrolyte for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) has been discussed.",Improved structural stability and electrochemical performance of 8YSZ electrolyte by MxOy doping for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs),10.1016/j.mseb.2017.08.020
3,10396,"The open circuit voltage has been 1.03 V and the maximum power density has been 440 mW.cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, in the presence of 3.5 mol% CeO2, 0.5 mol% ZnO and 8 mol% Y2O3 co-doped zirconia.",Improved structural stability and electrochemical performance of 8YSZ electrolyte by MxOy doping for low temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs),10.1016/j.mseb.2017.08.020
