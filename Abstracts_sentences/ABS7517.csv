1,7517,The Fe/Mn-modified Mn-Co spinel oxides (MCO) are coated on SUS430 interconnect to protect against oxidation and chromium diffusion by wet spray followed by nitrate solution impregnation for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) application.,A fluid-flow approach in oxidation evaluation of SUS 430 steels coated by Fe/Mn-modified MnCo2O4 for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.06.221
2,7517,"1000 h oxidation tests at 800 degrees C show that the FeMCO-coated sample have the minimum parabolic rate constant (9.02 x 10-7 mg2cm-4s-1), which is lower than half of the uncoated sample.",A fluid-flow approach in oxidation evaluation of SUS 430 steels coated by Fe/Mn-modified MnCo2O4 for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.06.221
3,7517,"The area-specific resistance (ASR) of the FeMCO-coated sample is 6.41 mUcm2 at 800 degrees C after 1000 h oxidation, which is much lower than the MCO sample (19.38 mU cm2) and the uncoated sample (186.84 mU cm2).",A fluid-flow approach in oxidation evaluation of SUS 430 steels coated by Fe/Mn-modified MnCo2O4 for solid oxide fuel cell application,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.06.221
