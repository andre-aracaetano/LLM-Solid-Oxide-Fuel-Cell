1,5603,"The sluggish reaction kinetics in the cathode usually leads to considerable cathode polarization resistance, hindering the development of proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells (H-SOFCs) operated at intermediate temperatures (400-650 degrees C).",A highly active hybrid catalyst modified (La0.60Sr0.40)0.95Co0.20Fe0.80O3.δ cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.03.058
2,5603,"To address this problem, for the first time, a novel hybrid catalyst consisting of PrNi0.5Mn0.5O3 and PrOx is impregnated in the (La0.60Sr0.40)(0.95)Co0.20Fe0.80O3.delta (LSCF) cathode of H-SOFCs, resulting in significant enhancement of the cathode reaction kinetics.",A highly active hybrid catalyst modified (La0.60Sr0.40)0.95Co0.20Fe0.80O3.δ cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.03.058
3,5603,"Single cells with impregnated LSCF cathode and BaZr0.8Y0.2O3 (BZY) electrolyte yield a maximum power density (MPD) of 0.198 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C, more than doubled of that with blank LSCF cathode (0.083 W cm(-2)).",A highly active hybrid catalyst modified (La0.60Sr0.40)0.95Co0.20Fe0.80O3.δ cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.03.058
4,5603,"ECR and EIS studies reveal that the hybrid catalyst can substantially accelerate the oxygen-ion transfer and oxygen dissociation-absorption processes in the cathode, resulting in significantly lower polarization resistance and higher MPD.",A highly active hybrid catalyst modified (La0.60Sr0.40)0.95Co0.20Fe0.80O3.δ cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.03.058
5,5603,"In addition, the hybrid catalyst possesses good chemical and microstructural stability at 600 degrees C. Consequently, the single cells with impregnated LSCF cathode show excellent durability.",A highly active hybrid catalyst modified (La0.60Sr0.40)0.95Co0.20Fe0.80O3.δ cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.03.058
6,5603,This study shows that the impregnation of this novel hybrid catalyst in the cathode could be a promising approach to improve the performance and stability of H-SOFCs.,A highly active hybrid catalyst modified (La0.60Sr0.40)0.95Co0.20Fe0.80O3.δ cathode for proton conducting solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.03.058
