1,14722,"The application of atomic layer deposition (ALD) on solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes has previously yielded mixed results and has been seen to depend on the ALD species, catalyst chemistry, catalyst morphology, and the conditions for deposition.",ZrO2 atomic layer deposition into Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes: mechanisms of stability enhancement,10.1039/c9ta09214e
2,14722,"Characterized here is the effect of an ALD zirconia coating within an SOFC oxygen electrode: Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3-delta infiltrated into Gd-doped ceria, Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta, scaffolds (SSC-GDC).",ZrO2 atomic layer deposition into Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes: mechanisms of stability enhancement,10.1039/c9ta09214e
3,14722,"Island-like ALD-ZrO2 coatings with approximately monolayer coverage initially yield a higher electrode polarization resistance, R-P, but thereafter the coated electrodes show lower R-P and slower degradation.",ZrO2 atomic layer deposition into Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes: mechanisms of stability enhancement,10.1039/c9ta09214e
4,14722,"For example, after similar to 1000 hour accelerated ageing tests carried out at 750 degrees C, SSC-GDC coated with similar to 0.3 nm of ALD-ZrO2 showed an R-P increase of 18% compared to 30% for uncoated SSC-GDC.",ZrO2 atomic layer deposition into Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes: mechanisms of stability enhancement,10.1039/c9ta09214e

6,14722,"At 750 degrees C, a reaction between the Zr-overlayer and the SSC was observed, producing SrZrO3, Co3O4, and SmCoO3.",ZrO2 atomic layer deposition into Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes: mechanisms of stability enhancement,10.1039/c9ta09214e
7,14722,"The low R-P values achieved suggest that the reactant products were thin enough to be discontinuous and thus not hinder the oxygen surface exchange process, and yet they acted as a barrier to SSC particle coarsening.",ZrO2 atomic layer deposition into Sr0.5Sm0.5CoO3-δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ solid oxide fuel cell cathodes: mechanisms of stability enhancement,10.1039/c9ta09214e
