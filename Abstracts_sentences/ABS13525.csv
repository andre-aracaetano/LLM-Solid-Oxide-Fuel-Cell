2,13525,"At elevated temperatures, the A-site dopant (typically Sr) segregation toward the surface of the perovskite electrode induces the substantially nonstoichiometric surface with the formation of insulating Sr-rich phases by the electrostatic interactions between oxygen vacancies (V-o & BULL;& BULL;) and doped Sr (Sr'(La)), deteriorating the oxygen reduction reaction kinetics.",Tuning the oxygen vacancy concentration in a heterostructured electrode for high chemical and electrochemical stabilities,10.1016/j.cej.2021.134345
3,13525,"Herein, we report the precise tuning of the oxygen vacancy concentration at the perovskite surface in a Gd0.1Ce0.9O2_delta (GDC)/La0.6Sr0.4CoO3_delta (LSC) heterostructured electrode by rearranging the oxygen vacancies near the interface, resulting in an ~15-fold increase in the surface exchange coefficient after long-term operation at 650 C for 100 h. The depth profiles of the charged defects obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the oxygen vacancy concen-tration at the perovskite surface can be controlled by the amount of vacancy acceptable sites in the GDC layer.",Tuning the oxygen vacancy concentration in a heterostructured electrode for high chemical and electrochemical stabilities,10.1016/j.cej.2021.134345
