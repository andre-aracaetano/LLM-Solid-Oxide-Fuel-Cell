1,12908,Gaseous ammonia (NH3) recovered from residual waters may be used as a fuel in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to generate electricity without emission of undesirable oxidised nitrogen species.,Fuelling a solid oxide fuel cell with ammonia recovered from water by vacuum membrane stripping,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131081
2,12908,"NH3 can be directly recovered from water as a gas by vacuum membrane stripping (VMS), which also results in the evaporation of water (H2O), leading to the recovery of NH3-H2O mixtures.",Fuelling a solid oxide fuel cell with ammonia recovered from water by vacuum membrane stripping,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131081
3,12908,"However, in currently available literature, information is lacking on the NH3 concentrations in NH3-H2O mixtures that may be used as a fuel for an oxygen-conducting SOFC (SOFC-O).",Fuelling a solid oxide fuel cell with ammonia recovered from water by vacuum membrane stripping,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131081
4,12908,"In this study, we assessed the effect of feed water temperature and the NH3 feed water concentration on the NH3 concentrations in gaseous VMS permeate.",Fuelling a solid oxide fuel cell with ammonia recovered from water by vacuum membrane stripping,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131081
5,12908,"Besides, we assessed the feasibility to use NH3-H2O mixtures in the concentration range between 5 and 25 wt% for the generation of electricity in an SOFC-O. The results show that increasing the NH3 feed water concentration from 1 to 10 g center dot L-1 increased the NH3 concentration in the gaseous VMS permeate from 1 wt% to up to 11 wt%.",Fuelling a solid oxide fuel cell with ammonia recovered from water by vacuum membrane stripping,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131081
6,12908,"Increasing the feed water temperature from 25 to 35 degrees C also results in an increase in the NH3 concentration in the gaseous permeate, whereas increasing the feed water temperature from 35 degrees C to 55 degrees C leads to dilution of the VMS permeate.",Fuelling a solid oxide fuel cell with ammonia recovered from water by vacuum membrane stripping,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131081
7,12908,"Furthermore, electricity was generated at an electrical efficiency of 43% in an SOFC-O when the NH3 concentration in the NH3-H2O fuel was only 5 wt%.",Fuelling a solid oxide fuel cell with ammonia recovered from water by vacuum membrane stripping,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131081
8,12908,"Hence, according results on the obtained NH3 concentrations in the gaseous VMS permeate and the generation of electricity using dilute NH3-H2O mixtures as a fuel, VMS and SOFC-O can be combined for the generation of electricity from NH3 recovered from water.",Fuelling a solid oxide fuel cell with ammonia recovered from water by vacuum membrane stripping,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131081
9,12908,"Moreover, the electrical energy generation of the SOFCO, which reached values of 9 MJ center dot kg-N-1, was higher than the electrical energy consumption for VMS, for which values of 7 MJ center dot kg-N-1 were calculated.",Fuelling a solid oxide fuel cell with ammonia recovered from water by vacuum membrane stripping,10.1016/j.cej.2021.131081
