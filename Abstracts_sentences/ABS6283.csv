1,6283,"A novel cathode material, La(Ni0.4Fe0.6)O-3 (LNF), is synthesized by a solid-state reaction for applications in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).","La(Ni,Fe)O3 as a cathode material with high tolerance to chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.079
2,6283,"The electrochemical performance of the LNF cathode is investigated for the oxygen reduction reaction at 900 degrees C in the presence of a Fe-Cr alloy interconnect, and compared with (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSM) cathodes.","La(Ni,Fe)O3 as a cathode material with high tolerance to chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.079
3,6283,"Under these conditions, the LNF electrode has a more stable electrochemical activity than that of the LSM electrode.","La(Ni,Fe)O3 as a cathode material with high tolerance to chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.079
4,6283,There is no deposition of chromium species on the electrode surface or at the LNF electrode/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte interface after passage of 200 mA cm(-2) for 20h at 900 degrees C.,"La(Ni,Fe)O3 as a cathode material with high tolerance to chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.079
5,6283,"By contrast, a significant amount of chromium species is preferentially deposited at the LSM/YSZ interface regions for the LSM electrode.","La(Ni,Fe)O3 as a cathode material with high tolerance to chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.079
6,6283,"The results demonstrate that the LNF electrode has high tolerance to chromium poisoning, and is, therefore, promising as a SOFC cathode when using chromia-forming alloy interconnects.","La(Ni,Fe)O3 as a cathode material with high tolerance to chromium poisoning for solid oxide fuel cells",10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.079
