1,5331,"In this paper, thin perovskite layers between cathode material of solid oxide fuel cells and gadolinia-doped ceria buffer layer are investigated.",Investigation of thin perovskite layers between cathode and doped ceria used as buffer layer in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-015-2815-x
2,5331,"Thin layers made of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-delta (LNF), La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF), or SrTi0.65Fe0.35O3-delta (STF) were symmetrically deposited by spin coating method from metallo-organic polymer precursors on a Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-delta (CGO) substrate.",Investigation of thin perovskite layers between cathode and doped ceria used as buffer layer in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-015-2815-x
3,5331,Porous and about 40-mu m-thick LNF cathodes were deposited on both sides of the substrate and sintered at 1100 A degrees C. Different thicknesses of the thin perovskite layer were investigated in order to find the most effective one and to better understand its influence on the cathode/electrolyte interface.,Investigation of thin perovskite layers between cathode and doped ceria used as buffer layer in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-015-2815-x
4,5331,It was found that approximately 150 nm LNF or LSCF layer is sufficient to minimize interface resistance and improve cathode reproducibility.,Investigation of thin perovskite layers between cathode and doped ceria used as buffer layer in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-015-2815-x
5,5331,It was concluded that the thin perovskite layer increases contact area and improves the oxygen ion transport between the cathode and electrolyte without influencing the oxygen reduction reaction mechanism.,Investigation of thin perovskite layers between cathode and doped ceria used as buffer layer in solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/s10008-015-2815-x
