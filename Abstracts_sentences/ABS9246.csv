1,9246,Composites consisting of silver and yttria-stabilized bismuth oxide (YSB) were fabricated and investigated as cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with thin electrolyte films of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).,Intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Y0.25Bi0.75O1.5-Ag cathodes,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.475-479.1157
2,9246,The films were deposited using spin coating with YSZ suspension.,Intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Y0.25Bi0.75O1.5-Ag cathodes,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.475-479.1157
3,9246,"Comparison of YSB-Ag and conventional La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) based cathodes showed that the YSB-Ag composite has better electrochemical performance; Interfacial polarization resistance of YSB-Ag cathode is 0.13 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C. Power density of the single cell with YSB-Ag cathode was about 535 mW/cm(2) at 750 degrees C, while that with LSM-Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 cathode was only 329 mW/cm(2).",Intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells with Y0.25Bi0.75O1.5-Ag cathodes,10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.475-479.1157
