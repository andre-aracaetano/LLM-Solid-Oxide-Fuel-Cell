1,898,"A new, highly active and stable anode catalyst material LaCrO3-VOx-YSZ has been developed for solid oxide fuel cell systems fueled with impure hydrogen.",LaCrO3-VOx-YSZ anode catalyst for solid oxide fuel cell using impure hydrogen,10.1021/jp074672o
2,898,The presence of CO in the anode feed enhanced initial fuel cell performance when compared to the use of CO-free H-2 containing 5000 ppmv H2S. Impedance spectra showed that the anode polarization resistance decreased in the presence of CO.,LaCrO3-VOx-YSZ anode catalyst for solid oxide fuel cell using impure hydrogen,10.1021/jp074672o
3,898,Current density of 450 mA/cm(2) at 0.6 V and maximum power density of 260 mW/cm(2) (at 450 mA/cm(2)) were obtained at 900 degrees C. XRD (X-ray diffraction) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analyses showed that the new catalyst was chemically stable in H2S-rich syngas or hydrogen.,LaCrO3-VOx-YSZ anode catalyst for solid oxide fuel cell using impure hydrogen,10.1021/jp074672o
4,898,"However, when syngas was used, slow carbon deposition compromised the fuel cell performance during long tests at high temperatures.",LaCrO3-VOx-YSZ anode catalyst for solid oxide fuel cell using impure hydrogen,10.1021/jp074672o
