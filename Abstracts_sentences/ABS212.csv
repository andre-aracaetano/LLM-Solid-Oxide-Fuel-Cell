1,212,"Investigation of Non-conventional material for fuel cells, such as oxide-salt-ceramic composites and ceria based or perovskite oxides with different dopants, leads to a much lower fuel cell operating temperature compared to conventional high temperature, similar to 1000 degrees C, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which provides the new possibilities for facilitating SOFC commercialisation.",Non-Conventional Solid State Fuel Cells: Materials & Technology,10.1007/BF02375817
2,212,"This work is essentially an effort to develop new types of solid oxide ion and proton fuel cells (SOFC and SPFC) at fairly low temperatures, < 800 degrees C or intermediate temperature, 400 to 800 degrees C",Non-Conventional Solid State Fuel Cells: Materials & Technology,10.1007/BF02375817
3,212,"The conventional high temperature SOFCs using yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) materials, and low temperature SPFCs (< 200 degrees C) using polymer membrane electrolytes have complex material and system problems from either special high temperature requests or expensive technology and reforming systems.",Non-Conventional Solid State Fuel Cells: Materials & Technology,10.1007/BF02375817
4,212,"This research is intended to provide materials and technology along new routes for so-called non-conventional fuel cell systems, to facilitate solid state fuel cell cmmercialisation.",Non-Conventional Solid State Fuel Cells: Materials & Technology,10.1007/BF02375817
5,212,The fuel cell research on these non-conventional systems is promising.,Non-Conventional Solid State Fuel Cells: Materials & Technology,10.1007/BF02375817
