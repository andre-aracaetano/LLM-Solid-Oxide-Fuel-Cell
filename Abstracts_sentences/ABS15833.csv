1,15833,This paper deals with the experimental analysis of the performance and degradation issues of a Ni-based anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell fed by a methane-free biogas from dark-anaerobic digestion of wastes by pastry and fruit shops.,Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
2,15833,The biogas is produced by means of an innovative process where the biomass is fermented with a pre-treated bacteria inoculum (Clostridia) able to completely inhibit the methanization step during the fermentation process and to produce a H-2/CO2 mixture instead of conventional CH4/CO2 anaerobic digested gas (bio-methane).,Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
3,15833,The proposed biogas production route leads to a biogas composition which avoids the need of introducing a reformer agent into or before the SOFC anode in order to reformate it.,Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
4,15833,"In order to analyse the complete behaviour of a SOFC with the bio-hydrogen fuel, an experimental session with several H-2/CO2 synthetic mixtures was performed on an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with a Ni-based anode.",Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
5,15833,"It was found that side reactions occur with such mixtures in the typical thermodynamic conditions of SOFCs (650-800 degrees C), which have an effect especially at high currents, due to the shift to a mixture consisting of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water.",Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
6,15833,"However, cells operated with acceptable performance and carbon deposits (typical of a traditional hydrocarbon-containing biogas) were avoided after 50 h of cell operation even at 650 degrees C. Experiments were also performed with traditional bio-methane from anaerobic digestion with 60/40 vol% of composition.",Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
7,15833,It was found that the cell performance dropped after few hours of operation due to the formation of carbon deposits.,Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
8,15833,A short-term test with the real as-produced biogas was also successfully performed.,Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
9,15833,"The cell showed an acceptable power output (at 800 degrees C, 0.35 W cm(-2) with biogas, versus 0.55 W cm(-2) with H-2)",Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
10,15833,although a huge quantity of sulphur was present in the feeding fuel (hydrogen sulphide at 103 ppm and mercaptans up to 10 ppm).,Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
11,15833,"Therefore, it was demonstrated the interest relying on a sustainable biomass processing which produces a biogas which can be directly fed to SOFC using traditional anode materials and avoiding the reformer component since the methane-free mixture is already safe for carbon deposition.",Methane-free biogas for direct feeding of solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.108
