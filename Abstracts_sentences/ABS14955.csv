1,14955,Apatite-type lanthanum silicates of general formula La9.33+2x/3(SiO4)(6)O2+x have appeared recently as a new promising class of oxide ion conductors with potential applications as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Diffusion Path and Conduction Mechanism of Oxide Ions in Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicates,10.1021/cm900783j
2,14955,They have been shown to demonstrate relatively high oxide ion conductivity at moderate temperatures as well as at low oxygen partial pressures.,Diffusion Path and Conduction Mechanism of Oxide Ions in Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicates,10.1021/cm900783j
3,14955,"In this paper, the diffusion pathways and the conduction mechanism of oxide ions in these phases are reinvestigated.",Diffusion Path and Conduction Mechanism of Oxide Ions in Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicates,10.1021/cm900783j
4,14955,This is done by means of atomic scale computer modeling techniques with both semiempirical and bond valence methods.,Diffusion Path and Conduction Mechanism of Oxide Ions in Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicates,10.1021/cm900783j
5,14955,Our results support that oxide ion conduction along the c-axis proceeds by an interstitial mechanism.,Diffusion Path and Conduction Mechanism of Oxide Ions in Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicates,10.1021/cm900783j
6,14955,They also support the presence of interstitial sites located within the conduction channel.,Diffusion Path and Conduction Mechanism of Oxide Ions in Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicates,10.1021/cm900783j
7,14955,"However, contrarily to recent research, it is shown that the channel oxide ions are involved in the conduction process by a push-pull type mechanism.",Diffusion Path and Conduction Mechanism of Oxide Ions in Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicates,10.1021/cm900783j
8,14955,This mechanism brings into play a cooperative movement of both two adjacent interstitial oxide ions forming a complex defect and the channel oxide ions.,Diffusion Path and Conduction Mechanism of Oxide Ions in Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicates,10.1021/cm900783j
9,14955,This complex defect is shown to move along the c-axis via a nonlinear pathway different from the conduction path proposed in literature to date.,Diffusion Path and Conduction Mechanism of Oxide Ions in Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicates,10.1021/cm900783j
10,14955,"The calculated migration energy of this mechanism is found to be equal to 0.32 eV, which compares well with activation energy measured along the c-axis for Nd-9.33(SiO4)(6)O-2 single crystals.",Diffusion Path and Conduction Mechanism of Oxide Ions in Apatite-Type Lanthanum Silicates,10.1021/cm900783j
