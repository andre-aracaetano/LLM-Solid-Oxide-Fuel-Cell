1,1205,"A solid state H2S/air electrochemical cell having the configuration of H2S, (MOS2+NiS+Ag)/YSZ/Pt, air has been examined with different H2S flow rates and concentrations at atmospheric pressure and 750-850 degreesC. Performance of the fuel cell was dependent on anode compartment H2S flow rate and concentration.",Effect of H2S flow rate and concentration on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cell,
2,1205,The cell open-circuit voltage increased with increasing H2S flow rate.,Effect of H2S flow rate and concentration on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cell,
3,1205,It was found that increasing both H2S flow rate and H2S concentration improved current-voltage and power density performance.,Effect of H2S flow rate and concentration on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cell,
4,1205,This is resulted from improved gas diffusion in anode and increased concentration of anodic electroactive species.,Effect of H2S flow rate and concentration on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cell,
5,1205,Operation at elevated H2S concentration improved the cell performance at a given gas flow rate.,Effect of H2S flow rate and concentration on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cell,
6,1205,"However, as low as 5% H2S in gas mixture can also be utilized as fuel feed to cells.",Effect of H2S flow rate and concentration on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cell,
7,1205,"Highest current and power densities, 1750 mA.cm(-2) and 200 mW.cm(-2), are obtained with pure H2S flow rate of 50 ml-min(-1) and air flow rate of 100 ml-min(-1) at 850degreesC.",Effect of H2S flow rate and concentration on performance of H2S/air solid oxide fuel cell,
