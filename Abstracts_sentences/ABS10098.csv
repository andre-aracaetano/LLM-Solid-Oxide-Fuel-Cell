1,10098,"Challenged by the surface strontium (Sr) enrichment, long-term stability of the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathode remains to be the most intractable problem hindering its further development and application in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Self-stabilized hybrid cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: A-site deficient perovskite coating as solid solution for strontium diffusion,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135446
2,10098,"To enhance the durability and performance of LSCF-based electrodes, we propose a novel approach by introducing a highly active A-site deficient La(0.9)5CoO(3-delta) (LC95) thin film onto the surface of the porous LSCF scaffold, simultaneously working as the accepter for Sr diffusion and conformal collector for electrons conduction.",Self-stabilized hybrid cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: A-site deficient perovskite coating as solid solution for strontium diffusion,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135446
3,10098,"Besides the inhibiting effect from the dense coating, the A-site deficiencies reserved in coating lattice enable promising stabilization for Sr diffusion and segregation.",Self-stabilized hybrid cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: A-site deficient perovskite coating as solid solution for strontium diffusion,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135446
4,10098,"At 700 ?, the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2-Fe0.8O3-delta@La(0.9)5CoO(3-delta) (LSCF@LC95) hybrid cathode shows a polarization resistance of 0.28 omega cm(2), much lower than that for pristine LSCF cathode (0.36 omega cm(2)).",Self-stabilized hybrid cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: A-site deficient perovskite coating as solid solution for strontium diffusion,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135446
5,10098,"In addition to the higher electrochemical activity, single cell with LSCF@LC95 cathode exhibits remarkable long-term stability without detectable degradation over 120 h.",Self-stabilized hybrid cathode for solid oxide fuel cell: A-site deficient perovskite coating as solid solution for strontium diffusion,10.1016/j.cej.2022.135446
