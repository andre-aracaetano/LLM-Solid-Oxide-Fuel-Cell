2,17882,"Nano-size YSZ raw powder (50 nm) was densified to a relative density of 99.1% at 1400 degreesC, with an applied uniaxial pressure of 23 MPa, and a total of four consecutive sintering cycles at 3 min per cycle.",Preparation yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte by spark-plasma sintering,10.1016/S0921-5093(02)00079-5
3,17882,Impedance spectroscopy was used to elucidate the electrical properties of the YSZ electrolyte.,Preparation yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte by spark-plasma sintering,10.1016/S0921-5093(02)00079-5
4,17882,It was found that SPS could significantly improve the ionic conductivity of the YSZ electrolyte over conventional sintered (using an electrical resistance furnace) samples at similar sintering temperatures.,Preparation yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte by spark-plasma sintering,10.1016/S0921-5093(02)00079-5
5,17882,These phenomena were due to the diverse microstructures obtained by SPS samples as compared to the conventional sintered samples.,Preparation yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte by spark-plasma sintering,10.1016/S0921-5093(02)00079-5
