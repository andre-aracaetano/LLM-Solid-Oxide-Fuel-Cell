2,11402,"Tests with both anode-supported and electrolyte-supported button cells were performed at 700 to 800 degrees C in synthetic coal gas containing 0.5 to 10 ppm phosphorus, which was introduced as phosphine.",Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
3,11402,Two primary modes of degradation were observed.,Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
4,11402,"The most obvious was the formation of a series of bulk nickel phosphide phases, of which Ni(3)P, Ni(5)P(2), Ni(12)P(5) and Ni(2)P were identified.",Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
5,11402,"Phosphorus was essentially completely captured by the anode, forming a sharp boundary between converted and unconverted anode portions.",Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
6,11402,"These products partially coalesced into large grains, which eventually affected electronic percolation through the anode support.",Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
7,11402,"From thermodynamic calculations, formation of the first binary nickel phosphide phase is possible at phosphorus concentrations <1 ppb in coal gas at typical fuel cell operating temperatures.",Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
8,11402,A second mode of degradation is attributed to surface diffusion of phosphorus to the active anode/electrolyte interface to form an adsorption layer.,Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
9,11402,Direct evidence for the presence of such an adsorption layer on nickel was obtained by surface spectroscopies on fracture surfaces.,Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
10,11402,"Further, cell performance losses were observed well before the entire anode was converted to bulk nickel phosphide.",Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
11,11402,"Impedance spectroscopy revealed that these losses were primarily due to growth in electrodic resistance, whereas large ohmic increases were visible when the entire anode was converted to nickel phosphide phases.",Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
12,11402,"The rate of resistance growth for anode-supported cells showed a low dependence on phosphorus concentration, attributed to phosphorus activity control within the anode by bulk nickel phosphide products.",Degradation mechanisms of SOFC anodes in coal gas containing phosphorus,10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.018
