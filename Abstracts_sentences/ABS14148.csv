1,14148,Cobalt-containing perovskite materials have been intensively investigated as bifunctional oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells because of their mixed ionic-electronic conducting nature.,Highly active cobalt-free perovskites with Bi doping as bifunctional oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142051
2,14148,"However, the direct application of these materials to the most widely used zirconia-based electrolytes has been limited because of their thermo-chemical incompatibility.",Highly active cobalt-free perovskites with Bi doping as bifunctional oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142051
3,14148,"Herein, we introduce a cobalt-free manganite-perovskite with significantly improved electrocatalytic activity by doping with Bi which possesses stereochemically active lone pair electrons.",Highly active cobalt-free perovskites with Bi doping as bifunctional oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142051
4,14148,Replacing Bi with Pr in Pr0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta increases the oxygen vacancy concentration and promotes oxygen ion incorpo-ration and charge transfer processes at the electrode.,Highly active cobalt-free perovskites with Bi doping as bifunctional oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142051
5,14148,"Consequently, we apply Pr0.5Bi0.3Sr0.2MnO3-delta, to the interlayer-free yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte-based cells, which exhibits record high performance in the fuel cell (1.91 W center dot cm(-2)) as well as electrolysis (1.90 A center dot cm(-2)) modes at 700 degrees C along with remarkable long-term stability (450 h).",Highly active cobalt-free perovskites with Bi doping as bifunctional oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142051
6,14148,"Thus, our findings demonstrate that Pr0.5Bi0.3Sr0.2MnO3-delta is a highly promising bifunctional catalyst for solid-state energy storage and conversion applications.",Highly active cobalt-free perovskites with Bi doping as bifunctional oxygen electrodes for solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.cej.2023.142051
