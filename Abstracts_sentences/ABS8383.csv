1,8383,A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was developed for the direct utilization of dry glycerol to produce electricity at 800 degrees C. A state-of-art SOFC anode was covered by a thin (<10 mu m) electrocatalyst layer based on a Ni-modified perovskite and ceria.,Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed Directly with Dry Glycerol,10.1002/ente.201700744
2,8383,This electrocatalyst layer worked as an internal integrated fuel processor to convert glycerol in syngas.,Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed Directly with Dry Glycerol,10.1002/ente.201700744
3,8383,A performance of about 850 mW cm(-2) @ 0.6 V was achieved with dry glycerol.,Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed Directly with Dry Glycerol,10.1002/ente.201700744
4,8383,A life time test of 160 hrs showed no relevant occurrence of carbon deposits.,Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed Directly with Dry Glycerol,10.1002/ente.201700744
5,8383,The developed approach can provide a practical route to achieve effective fuel flexibility in SOFCs.,Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Fed Directly with Dry Glycerol,10.1002/ente.201700744
