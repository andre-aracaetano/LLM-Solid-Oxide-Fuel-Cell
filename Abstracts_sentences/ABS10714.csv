1,10714,"This study investigates the ethane conversion in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) reactors, comprising a nanosized Co-Cr2O3 nanocomposite anode catalyst, a proton-conducting BaCe0.8Y0.15Nd0.05O3-delta (BCYN) electrolyte, and a porous Pt cathode, for the purpose of cogenerating value-added ethylene with high selectivity and electrical power.",Co2CrO4 Nanopowders as an Anode Catalyst for Simultaneous Conversion of Ethane to Ethylene and Power in Proton-Conducting Fuel Cell Reactors,10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b11680
2,10714,"The Co-Cr2O3 nanocomposite anode catalyst is achieved by reducing the Co2CrO4 precursor particles of about 5 nm, by a citrate-nitrate combustion method at an elevated temperature, whereas the BCYN dense membrane is obtained by sintering the BYCN precursor powders at 1400 degrees C for 10 h. The protonic SOFC reactor cogenerates a maximum power density of 173 mW.cm(-2) and an ethylene yield of 32% at a selectivity of 91.6% at 700 degrees C. More importantly, no detectable acetylene and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission are formed, suggesting the superior electrocatalytic activity and dehydrogenation activity of the Co-Cr2O3 nanocomposite for the cogeneration of ethylene and electricity.",Co2CrO4 Nanopowders as an Anode Catalyst for Simultaneous Conversion of Ethane to Ethylene and Power in Proton-Conducting Fuel Cell Reactors,10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b11680
