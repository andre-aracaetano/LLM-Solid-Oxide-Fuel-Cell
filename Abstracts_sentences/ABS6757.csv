1,6757,A NiMo-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-delta (NiMo-CZ) catalyst has been developed for gasoline-fed solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Application of a NiMo-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-δ catalyst for solid oxide fuel cells running on gasoline,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226732
2,6757,"To apply the catalyst on a button-type single cell, the NiMo-CZ is deposited on top of conventional Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode as a catalytic internal micro-reforming layer.",Application of a NiMo-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-δ catalyst for solid oxide fuel cells running on gasoline,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226732
3,6757,The NiMo-CZ layer is effective in increasing the gasoline conversion and enhancing the yields of both H-2 and CO at 750 degrees C.,Application of a NiMo-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-δ catalyst for solid oxide fuel cells running on gasoline,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226732
4,6757,"On the other hand, due to the high mechanical stress induced from the constrained sintering with a thicker catalyst layer, only a limited amount of catalyst (similar to 20 mg) could be applied over the conventional button-type cell, which is not beneficial for enhancing overall cell performances.",Application of a NiMo-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-δ catalyst for solid oxide fuel cells running on gasoline,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226732
5,6757,"To overcome this issue, a tubular single cell configuration is adopted that allowed for higher catalyst loadings.",Application of a NiMo-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-δ catalyst for solid oxide fuel cells running on gasoline,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226732
6,6757,"By introducing higher catalyst loadings (similar to 80 mg) in the vacant tubular channel of the single cell, the gasoline conversion, H-2 yield, and CO yield all improve while cell lifetime increases by 42% compared to the performance of the button-type cell.",Application of a NiMo-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-δ catalyst for solid oxide fuel cells running on gasoline,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226732
7,6757,"The results suggest the potential of the NiMo-CZ catalyst for gasoline-fed SOFCs, and it demonstrates the advantage of the tubular single cell configuration for incorporating higher catalyst loadings for internal catalytic fuel reforming.",Application of a NiMo-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2-δ catalyst for solid oxide fuel cells running on gasoline,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226732
