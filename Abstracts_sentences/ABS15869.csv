1,15869,A mathematical model was developed for modelling the performance of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with functionally graded electrodes at the micro-scale level.,Micro-scale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with micro-structurally graded electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.005
2,15869,The model considered all forms of overpotentials and was able to capture the coupled electrochemical reactions and mass transfer involved in the SOFC operation.,Micro-scale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with micro-structurally graded electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.005
3,15869,The model was validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental data from the literature.,Micro-scale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with micro-structurally graded electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.005
4,15869,Additional modelling analyses were conducted to gain better understanding of the SOFC working mechanisms at the micro-scale level and to quantify the performance of micro-structurally graded SOFC.,Micro-scale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with micro-structurally graded electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.005
5,15869,"It was found that micro-structural grading could significantly enhance the gas transport but had negligible effects on the ohmic and activation overpotentials, especially for thick electrodes.",Micro-scale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with micro-structurally graded electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.005
6,15869,"However, for thin electrodes with large particles, too much grading should be avoided as the increased activation overpotentials may result in higher overall overpotentials at a medium or low current density.",Micro-scale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with micro-structurally graded electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.005
7,15869,"Among all the cases tested in the present study, the micro-structurally graded SOFC showed significantly higher power density than conventional SOFC of uniform porosity and particle size.",Micro-scale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with micro-structurally graded electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.005
8,15869,The difference between micro-structurally graded SOFC and conventional SOFC is more pronounced for smaller electrode-electrolyte (EE) interfacial particles.,Micro-scale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with micro-structurally graded electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.005
9,15869,Particle size grading is generally more effective than porosity grading and it can increase the maximum power density by one-fold in comparison with conventional SOFC.,Micro-scale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with micro-structurally graded electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.005
10,15869,The present study reveals the working mechanisms of SOFC at the micro-scale level and demonstrates the promise of the use of micro-structural grading to enhance the SOFC performance.,Micro-scale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells with micro-structurally graded electrodes,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.005
