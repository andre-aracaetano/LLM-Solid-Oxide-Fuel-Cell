4,19416,"On the practical side, two recent advances are discussed, i.e., the electropromotion of thin (40 nm) sputtered catalyst films, with metal dispersion of the order of 20%, and the development of the monolithic electropromoted reactor (MEPR) which is a hybrid between a monolithic catalytic reactor and a flat-plate solid oxide fuel cell and allows for compact design and easy scale-up and scale-down of electropromoted catalytic units.",Electrochemical promotion of catalysis: mechanistic investigations and monolithic electropromoted reactors,10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.015
