1,21008,La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta(LSC) thin film cathodes synthesized by pulsed laser deposition at 450 degrees C (LSC_450 degrees C) and 650 degrees C (LSC_650 degrees C) exhibit different electrochemical performance.,Chemical Heterogeneities on La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin Films-Correlations to Cathode Surface Activity and Stability,10.1021/cm203501u
2,21008,The origin of the differences in the oxygen reduction activity and stability of these cathodes is investigated on the basis of their surface chemistry and their surface atomic and electronic structures.,Chemical Heterogeneities on La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin Films-Correlations to Cathode Surface Activity and Stability,10.1021/cm203501u
3,21008,"Angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and nanoprobe Auger electron spectroscopy are used to identify the surface cation content, chemical bonding environment, and the spatial heterogeneities with nanoscale resolution.",Chemical Heterogeneities on La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin Films-Correlations to Cathode Surface Activity and Stability,10.1021/cm203501u
4,21008,The higher electrochemical activity of LSC_450 degrees C is attributed to the more stoichiometric cation content on the surface and the more uniform lateral and depth distribution of constituent cations.,Chemical Heterogeneities on La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin Films-Correlations to Cathode Surface Activity and Stability,10.1021/cm203501u
5,21008,The poorly crystalline atomic structure of the LSC_450 degrees C was found to prohibit the extensive segregation and phase separation on the surface because of the more favorable elastic and electrostatic interactions of Sr in the bulk.,Chemical Heterogeneities on La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin Films-Correlations to Cathode Surface Activity and Stability,10.1021/cm203501u
6,21008,"Upon annealing in air at 600 degrees C, the surface of the LSC_650 degrees C undergoes a structural change from a Sr-rich LSC state to a SrO/Sr(OH)(2)-rich phase-separated state.",Chemical Heterogeneities on La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin Films-Correlations to Cathode Surface Activity and Stability,10.1021/cm203501u
7,21008,"The partial blockage of the surface with the heterogeneously distributed SrO/Sr(OH)(2)-rich phases, the decrease in oxygen vacancy content, and the deterioration of the electron transfer properties as evidenced from the Co oxidation state near the surface are found responsible for the severe electrochemical deactivation of the LSC_650 degrees C.",Chemical Heterogeneities on La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin Films-Correlations to Cathode Surface Activity and Stability,10.1021/cm203501u
8,21008,"These results are important for advancing our ability to tailor the electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes by understanding the relation of surface chemistry and structure to the oxygen reduction activity and stability, and the dependence of cation segregation on its driving forces including material microstructure.",Chemical Heterogeneities on La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-δ Thin Films-Correlations to Cathode Surface Activity and Stability,10.1021/cm203501u
