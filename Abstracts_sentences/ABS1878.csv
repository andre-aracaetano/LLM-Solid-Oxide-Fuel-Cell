1,1878,"For the determination of trace impurities in ceramic components of solid oxide Fuel cells (SOFCs), some mass spectrometric methods have been applied such as spark source mass spectrometry (SSMS), laser ionization mass spectrometry (LIMS), laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).",Mass spectrometric analysis of ceramic components for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/BF01246179
2,1878,Due to a lack of suitable standard reference materials for quantifying of analytical results on LaxSryMnO3 cathode material a matrix-matched synthetic standard - high purity initial compounds doped with trace elements - was prepared in order to determine the relative sensitivity coefficients in SSMS and LA-ICP-MS.,Mass spectrometric analysis of ceramic components for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/BF01246179
3,1878,Radiofrequency glow discharge mass spectrometry (rf-GDMS) was developed for trace analysis and depth profiling of thick non-conducting layers.,Mass spectrometric analysis of ceramic components for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/BF01246179
4,1878,"Surface analytical techniques, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and sputtered neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS), were used to determine the element distribution on surfaces (homogeneity) and the surface contaminants of SOFC ceramic layers.",Mass spectrometric analysis of ceramic components for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1007/BF01246179
