3,10268,"The predicted effects of location of current collectors, electrode conductivities, cathode thickness and porosity were analysed to minimise the ranges of current density distributions and maximise performance by judicious design.",Modelling effects of current distributions on performance of micro-tubular hollow fibre solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2010.01.080
4,10268,"To decrease the computational load, azimuthal symmetry was assumed to model 50 and 100 mm long reactors in 2-D. With connectors at the same end of the HF-SOFC operating at a cell voltage of 0.5 V and a mean 5 kA m(-2), axial potential drops of ca. 0.14V in the cathode were predicted, comparable to the cathode activation overpotential.",Modelling effects of current distributions on performance of micro-tubular hollow fibre solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2010.01.080
5,10268,Those potential drops caused average current densities to decrease from ca.,Modelling effects of current distributions on performance of micro-tubular hollow fibre solid oxide fuel cells,10.1016/j.electacta.2010.01.080
