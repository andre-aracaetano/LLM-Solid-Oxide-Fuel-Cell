1,3038,The primary objective of this paper is to develop the theoretical underpinnings for a model that predicts the performance of protonic-ceramic fuel cells (PCFC).,Modeling Protonic-Ceramic Fuel Cells with Porous Composite Electrodes in a Button-Cell Configuration,10.1149/2.0591713jes
2,3038,"Such fuel cells have been demonstrated to perform well with hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels in the intermediate temperature range of 400 <= T <= 700 degrees C. Because the electrolyte materials are typically doped perovskite ceramics (e.g., BaZr0.9Y0.1O3-delta, BZY10) that are mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIEC), the model formulation is considerably more complex than is the case for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) that use electrolyte materials such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) that are purely oxygen-ion conductors.",Modeling Protonic-Ceramic Fuel Cells with Porous Composite Electrodes in a Button-Cell Configuration,10.1149/2.0591713jes
3,3038,The model considers transport and chemistry within porous composite electrode structures that are comprised of an electronically conducting phase and an MIEC phase.,Modeling Protonic-Ceramic Fuel Cells with Porous Composite Electrodes in a Button-Cell Configuration,10.1149/2.0591713jes
4,3038,The defect transport within the MIEC phases is represented using a Nernst-Planck formulation.,Modeling Protonic-Ceramic Fuel Cells with Porous Composite Electrodes in a Button-Cell Configuration,10.1149/2.0591713jes
5,3038,"Using a button cell configuration with nominal material properties and cell geometry, the paper exercises a computational model to demonstrate the model and explore a range of operating conditions.",Modeling Protonic-Ceramic Fuel Cells with Porous Composite Electrodes in a Button-Cell Configuration,10.1149/2.0591713jes
