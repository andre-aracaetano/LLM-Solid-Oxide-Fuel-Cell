2,20402,Oxide mixed conductors with the perovskite structure (ABO(3)) and high Co content in the B site have been extensively studied to be used as cathode in SOFC.,Physicochemical properties of non-stoichiometric oxides Mixed conductors: Part II,10.1007/s10973-010-1008-1
3,20402,This is the second part of a review of high temperature properties of two mixed conductors systems.,Physicochemical properties of non-stoichiometric oxides Mixed conductors: Part II,10.1007/s10973-010-1008-1
4,20402,"The first part was focused on the n = 2 Sr3FeMO6+delta (M = Fe, Co, Ni) Rudlesdden Popper phases, while in this paper we discuss the thermodynamic and transport properties of the perovskite solid solution Sr1-x La (x) Fe0.2Co0.8O3-delta (0 <= 0.4) in the temperature range 773",Physicochemical properties of non-stoichiometric oxides Mixed conductors: Part II,10.1007/s10973-010-1008-1

6,20402,"In particular, the interest has been focused on the x = 0 sample, which exhibits large ionic conductivity values (sigma(i) similar to 1 S cm(-1)), but suffers a structural transformation from cubic to orthorhombic symmetry because the ordering of the oxygen vacancies when the oxygen partial pressure decreases.",Physicochemical properties of non-stoichiometric oxides Mixed conductors: Part II,10.1007/s10973-010-1008-1
7,20402,"Measurements of the oxygen chemical potential () as function of oxygen content and temperature, coupled with high temperature X-ray diffraction data, permitted us to broaden the knowledge of the T-delta-p(O-2) phase diagram for the x = 0 sample.",Physicochemical properties of non-stoichiometric oxides Mixed conductors: Part II,10.1007/s10973-010-1008-1
8,20402,"In addition, we have investigated the effects of the La incorporation on the stability range of the cubic phases of the Sr1-x La (x) Fe0.2Co0.8O3-delta solid solution.",Physicochemical properties of non-stoichiometric oxides Mixed conductors: Part II,10.1007/s10973-010-1008-1
