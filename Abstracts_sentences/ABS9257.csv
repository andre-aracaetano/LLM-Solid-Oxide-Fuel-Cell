1,9257,"As a Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode material, Pr2NiO4+$ (PNO) is a critical challenge for SOFC commercialization due to the lack of oxygen va-cancies and insufficient redox reaction (ORR) activity.",Preparation of Pr2NiO4?8-La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-8 as a high-performance cathode material for SOFC by an impregnation method,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.123
2,9257,"In this paper, various concentrations of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-$ (LSC) nanoparticles are coated on the surface of PNO by an impregnation method, and the ORR kinetics of PNO is found to be improved by constructing a composite cathode with heterointerfaces.",Preparation of Pr2NiO4?8-La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-8 as a high-performance cathode material for SOFC by an impregnation method,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.123
3,9257,"The formation of the heterointerface effectively enhances the transfer of interstitial oxygen in the PNO and the oxygen vacancies in LSC, which can promote the conduction of O2- in the cathode and thus improves the ORR activity of the material.",Preparation of Pr2NiO4?8-La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-8 as a high-performance cathode material for SOFC by an impregnation method,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.123
