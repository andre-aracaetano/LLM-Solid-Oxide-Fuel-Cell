1,17180,"Thermal stability of lanthanide (Ln = La, Nd, Gd, Yb) containing glass and glass-ceramics (GCs) was characterized for their application as sealants for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).",Thermal and mechanical stability of lanthanide-containing glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta13196c
2,17180,X-ray diffraction (XRD) in conjunction with the Rietveld-RIR and solid-state NMR techniques was employed to quantify the crystalline and amorphous fractions in the glasses sintered/heat treated at 850 degrees C in air for 1-1000 h. The structure and crystalline phase evolution of Ln containing aluminosilicate glasses depend markedly on the Ln(3+) cation field strength over both short and intermediate length scales.,Thermal and mechanical stability of lanthanide-containing glass-ceramic sealants for solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c3ta13196c
