2,5277,It was found that metal support oxidation and Fe diffusion from the metal support to the anode were the main factors affecting the cell behavior observed.,Performance and Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Metal-Supported Cu-Co-Ni-SDC SOFC Anodes in Methane,10.1002/fuce.201800113
3,5277,"Thus, strategies to prevent diffusion of Fe into the anode were also evaluated.",Performance and Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Metal-Supported Cu-Co-Ni-SDC SOFC Anodes in Methane,10.1002/fuce.201800113
4,5277,"It was found that the best performing method to prevent diffusion of Fe and Cr into the anode in this study consisted of a combination of all three evaluated strategies (i.e., pre-oxidation of metal support prior to cell fabrication, application of a protective LaCrO3 coating to the metal supports prior to anode fabrication, and addition of an SDC interlayer between the metal support and anode coating).",Performance and Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Metal-Supported Cu-Co-Ni-SDC SOFC Anodes in Methane,10.1002/fuce.201800113
5,5277,It was found that the most effective stand-alone method to diminish the diffusion of Fe into the anode was the addition of a SDC interlayer between the anode and the metal support.,Performance and Properties of Suspension Plasma Sprayed Metal-Supported Cu-Co-Ni-SDC SOFC Anodes in Methane,10.1002/fuce.201800113
