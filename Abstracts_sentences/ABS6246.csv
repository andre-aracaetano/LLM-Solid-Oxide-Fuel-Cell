1,6246,A testing method is developed to quantitatively determine the thermo-mechanical cycling life in oxidizing atmosphere for the joint between a solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant and a ferritic stainless steel interconnect.,Mechanical durability of solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant/ steel interconnect joint under thermo-mechanical cycling,10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.041
2,6246,"Thermo-mechanical cycling tests are performed under cyclic shear or tensile loading in conjunction with cyclic temperature variance between 40 degrees C and 800 degrees C. Results reveal thermo-mechanical cycling life under both shear and tensile loadings increases with a decrease in end stress at 800 degrees C, for a certain end stress at 40 degrees",Mechanical durability of solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant/ steel interconnect joint under thermo-mechanical cycling,10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.041
3,6246,"C. Nevertheless, for a certain end stress at 800 degrees C, the tensile thermo-mechanical cycling life increases with a decrease in end stress at 40 degrees C, while the shear thermo-mechanical cycling life is independent of end stress at 40 degrees C. A difference in fracture pattern is also observed between shear and tensile loadings.",Mechanical durability of solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant/ steel interconnect joint under thermo-mechanical cycling,10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.041
4,6246,"For shear loading, fracture mainly takes place along the interface between glass-ceramic sealant and an oxide layer, such as BaCrO4 or Cr2O3.",Mechanical durability of solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant/ steel interconnect joint under thermo-mechanical cycling,10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.041
5,6246,"However, for tensile loading, fracture mainly occurs within the glass-ceramic layer, following crack initiation at the interface of Cr2O3/sealant or Cr2O3/BaCra(4).",Mechanical durability of solid oxide fuel cell glass-ceramic sealant/ steel interconnect joint under thermo-mechanical cycling,10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.041
