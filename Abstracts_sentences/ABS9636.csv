1,9636,"The present work investigates the low-cost steels AISI 441, AISI 430, and AISI 444 against the tailor-made high Cr steel Crofer 22 APU (22.9 wt% Cr) at 800 degrees C in simulated solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode conditions.",11-23% Cr steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications at 800?C- How the coating determines oxidation kinetics,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.326
2,9636,"Furthermore, a low Cr steel, AISI 409 (11.4 wt% Cr) is included in the study.",11-23% Cr steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications at 800?C- How the coating determines oxidation kinetics,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.326
3,9636,"The oxidation, chromium evaporation, and area-specific resistance (ASR) of the uncoated and Ce/Co-coated steels are studied for up to 3000 h. Ce/Co-coated steels showed significant improvement in behaviour compared to their uncoated coun-terparts.",11-23% Cr steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications at 800?C- How the coating determines oxidation kinetics,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.326
4,9636,The oxidation and chromium evaporation behaviour between the uncoated steels varied substantially while the Ce/Co coated steels exhibited highly similar behaviour.,11-23% Cr steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications at 800?C- How the coating determines oxidation kinetics,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.326
5,9636,The area-specific resistance of the coated low-cost steels was on par with Crofer 22 APU.,11-23% Cr steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications at 800?C- How the coating determines oxidation kinetics,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.326
6,9636,"However, 430 formed a continuous silica layer, resulting in a higher ASR after 3000 h. Cross-sections of the uncoated and Ce/Co-coated steels were analysed using a scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.(c) 2022 The Author(s).",11-23% Cr steels for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications at 800?C- How the coating determines oxidation kinetics,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.11.326
