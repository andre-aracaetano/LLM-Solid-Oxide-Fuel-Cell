1,20595,Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) phase materials have been investigated widely as cathode candidates for IT-SOFCs.,New mechanistic insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on Ruddlesden-Popper cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6cp00056h
2,20595,"However, widespread application of R-P phase cathodes demands further improvement in electrode activity whose progress is hindered by the Limited information in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).",New mechanistic insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on Ruddlesden-Popper cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6cp00056h
3,20595,The ORR mechanism for the R-P phase is therefore investigated in this paper using (LaSr)(2)NiO4 as an example.,New mechanistic insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on Ruddlesden-Popper cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6cp00056h
4,20595,"Accurate characterization of the surface oxygen exchange process is realized by developing thin and dense polycrystalline LSNO Layers via a versatile spray-modified pressing method we invented before to avoid perceptible bull( diffusion contribution, surface enrichment and geometry complication.",New mechanistic insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on Ruddlesden-Popper cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6cp00056h
5,20595,"The governing factors of the ORR are identified as oxygen adsorption and incorporation based on the findings in reaction orders from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), stoichiometryrelated chemical capacitance and intrinsic anisotropic properties.",New mechanistic insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on Ruddlesden-Popper cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6cp00056h
6,20595,The incorporation rate is proven to drastically depend on the amount of interstitiaL oxygen (O-i '').,New mechanistic insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on Ruddlesden-Popper cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6cp00056h
7,20595,"Since the unfilled interstitiaL sites (V-i(x)) in the R P phase serve to accommodate the adsorbed oxygen during incorporation, Like vacancies in the perovskite structure (V(sic)), more O-i '' would seem to suppress the kinetics of this process.",New mechanistic insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on Ruddlesden-Popper cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6cp00056h
8,20595,"In regards to this, for the first time, a physical model is proposed to reconcile the discrepancy between the experimental results and intuitive reasoning.",New mechanistic insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on Ruddlesden-Popper cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6cp00056h
9,20595,"Based on supporting evidence, this model illustrates a possibility of how Oi works to regulate the exchange rate, and how the contradiction between V(sic) and O-i '' is harmonized so that the Latter in the R P structure also positively promotes the incorporation rate in the ORR.",New mechanistic insight into the oxygen reduction reaction on Ruddlesden-Popper cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells,10.1039/c6cp00056h
