2,7628,"The chemical composition, lattice structures, morphology, electrical properties, and weight gain of the coatings are characterized.","Ce-doped (Mn,Co)3O4 coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.082
3,7628,"Experimental results show that doping Ce lowers the area-specific resistance of (Mn,Co)3O4 coatings from 6.83 to 2.62 m omega cm2 at 800 degrees C.","Ce-doped (Mn,Co)3O4 coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.082
4,7628,"The electrical conductivity improvement can be attributed to the ion substitution by Ce3+ that turns (Mn,Co)3O4 into (Mn,Co)2CeO4, an N-type semiconductor with a higher electrical carrier density.","Ce-doped (Mn,Co)3O4 coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.082
5,7628,"However, the coatings with heavier doping of Ce exhibit more structural defects due to the lattice parameter reduction and volume shrinkage, which weaken the oxidation resistance of the coatings.","Ce-doped (Mn,Co)3O4 coatings for solid oxide fuel cell interconnect applications",10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.08.082
