6,4937,"The polarization resistance of the GDC10/LSM core-shell nanofibers electrodes is R-P similar to 4.5 omega cm(2) at 650 degrees C. Improvement is accomplished with GDC10/LSCuM_1 and GDC10/LSCuM_2 core-shell nanofibers, with R-P similar to 1.8 omega cm(2) and 1.7 omega cm(2) respectively at 650 degrees C. Post-test SEM characterization is carried out, to ascertain possible degradation and identify the most promising shell perovskite.","Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of Core-Shell Nanofiber Cathodes, with Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (Core) and Cu-Doped La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (Shell), for Application in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells",10.1002/celc.202300101
