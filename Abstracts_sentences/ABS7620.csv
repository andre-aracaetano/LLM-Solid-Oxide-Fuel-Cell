2,7620,A series of depositions were performed to reveal the correlation between process parameters and the microstructures observed as well as the interfacial resistances between electrodes and electrolytes.,Fabrication of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-Sm0.1Ce0.9O2-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells using combustion CVD,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.001
3,7620,It is found that deposition temperature has a significant impact on electrode morphology as well as interfacial resistance.,Fabrication of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-Sm0.1Ce0.9O2-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells using combustion CVD,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.001
4,7620,Deposition temperatures lower than 1000 degreesC resulted in cathodes with very high interfacial resistances while temperatures higher than 1400 degreesC led to over-densification.,Fabrication of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-Sm0.1Ce0.9O2-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells using combustion CVD,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.001
5,7620,"Thus for deposition of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) - Sm0.1Ce0.90O2-delta (SDC) composite cathodes on Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (GDC) electrolyte, the performance is optimized at deposition temperatures between 1200 and 1300 degreesC. Cathodes of 25-40 mum thick can be deposited onto GDC pellets in 5 - 10 min using a 0.05 M precursor solution.",Fabrication of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-Sm0.1Ce0.9O2-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells using combustion CVD,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.001
6,7620,The interfacial polarization resistances between SSC-SDC electrode and YSZ electrolyte were two orders of magnitude higher than those between the electrode and GDC electrolyte.,Fabrication of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ-Sm0.1Ce0.9O2-δ cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells using combustion CVD,10.1016/j.ssi.2003.12.001
