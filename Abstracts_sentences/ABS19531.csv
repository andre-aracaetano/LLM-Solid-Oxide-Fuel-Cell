1,19531,Reversible proton-conducting solid oxide cells (R-PSOCs) have been proposed to address energy storage and conversion challenges.,Highly stable and efficient Pt single-atom catalyst for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121627
2,19531,"However, under harsh operating conditions (550 degrees C similar to 700 degrees C containing CO2 and H2O), the application of single-atom catalysts (SACs) in R-PSOCs is challenging due to the migration/agglomeration of isolated atoms and the lack of universal processing techniques for catalyst loading.",Highly stable and efficient Pt single-atom catalyst for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121627
3,19531,"Here, we firstly report a single-atom customizing strategy to create four-coordinated Pt-O-Ni (4) that selective anchors Pt atoms to the B site in Pr4Ni3O10+delta.",Highly stable and efficient Pt single-atom catalyst for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121627
4,19531,"The resultant SAC is thermally stable, controllable, and highly active for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, withstanding treatment at 700 degrees C for 800 h in air, and its electrochemical performance was improved by almost 100%.",Highly stable and efficient Pt single-atom catalyst for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121627
5,19531,"This work bridges the application gap between SACs and R-PSOCs, are amenable to the large-scale manufacture of stable, efficient, high-loading SACs for industrial applications, which can also be extended to Pd, Ir, Ru, and Fe SACs.",Highly stable and efficient Pt single-atom catalyst for reversible proton-conducting solid oxide cells,10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121627
