1,2456,Hybrid direct coal fuel cells (HDCFCs) have the potential to convert coal into electrical power in a clean and efficient manner.,Coal pretreatment and Ag-infiltrated anode for high-performance hybrid direct coal fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114197
2,2456,"However, the related coal pretreatment method and the anode activity should both be improved, before the HDCFCs could match the performance of other direct coal fuel cells such as those based on solid oxide.",Coal pretreatment and Ag-infiltrated anode for high-performance hybrid direct coal fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114197
3,2456,"In this study, we pyrolysed bituminous coal at 800 degrees C followed by modification with acetic acid, in order to remove organic volatiles and reintroduce surface functional groups, respectively.",Coal pretreatment and Ag-infiltrated anode for high-performance hybrid direct coal fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114197
4,2456,The result was a modified char that was highly pure and with high oxidation activity.,Coal pretreatment and Ag-infiltrated anode for high-performance hybrid direct coal fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114197
5,2456,"Further, the Ni-(Y2O3)(0.08)(ZrO2)(0.92) anode was infiltrated with Ag nanoparticles as an effective catalyst to promote the electro-oxidation of carbon.",Coal pretreatment and Ag-infiltrated anode for high-performance hybrid direct coal fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114197
6,2456,"Under optimised conditions, the HDCFC with Ag-infiltrated anode and modified char as fuel demonstrated a maximum power density (403 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C) that exceeds previous results for coal-based fuels.",Coal pretreatment and Ag-infiltrated anode for high-performance hybrid direct coal fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114197
7,2456,"The cell also showed stable operation for 14 h, with a fuel conversion of 97.22% and Faradic efficiency of 61.06% using 0.4 g modified char.",Coal pretreatment and Ag-infiltrated anode for high-performance hybrid direct coal fuel cell,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114197
