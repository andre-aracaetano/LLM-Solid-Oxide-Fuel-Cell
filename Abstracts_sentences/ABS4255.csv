1,4255,Ways to address the sluggish ORR kinetics of cathodes have become an area of great interest and significance for the deployment of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that operate at lower temperatures.,Comparative Studies of SrCo1-xTaxO3-δ (x=0.05-0.4) Oxides as Cathodes for Low-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/celc.201500157
2,4255,"A series of Sr(Co,Ta)O3-delta oxides with multilevel substitutions of tantalum (Ta5+) ions have been studied as cathodes for SOFCs in terms of their crystal structures, electrochemical properties, and durability.",Comparative Studies of SrCo1-xTaxO3-δ (x=0.05-0.4) Oxides as Cathodes for Low-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/celc.201500157
3,4255,The effects of doping tantalum on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been ex-plored and discussed.,Comparative Studies of SrCo1-xTaxO3-δ (x=0.05-0.4) Oxides as Cathodes for Low-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/celc.201500157
4,4255,"Not only can the crystallite structure of SrCoO3-delta be stabilized by incorporating Ta5+ at elevated temperatures, but the activity towards ORR can also be significantly enhanced by doping relatively small amounts of Ta5+ (<= 20mol%), which is probably due to the improved oxygen surface exchange that arises from the positive effects of Ta5+ dopants on the oxidation states of cobalt ions.",Comparative Studies of SrCo1-xTaxO3-δ (x=0.05-0.4) Oxides as Cathodes for Low-Temperature Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells,10.1002/celc.201500157
