2,6526,This study evaluates the techno-economic performance of SE-SMR in a network of fixed beds and its integration with a solid oxide fuel cell (SE-SMR-SOFC) for power generation.,Techno-economic analysis of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.005
3,6526,The analysis revealed that both proposed systems are characterised by better economic performance than the reference systems.,Techno-economic analysis of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.005
4,6526,"In particular, for SE-SMR the levelised cost of hydrogen is 1.6 (sic).kg(-1) and the cost of CO2 avoided is 29.9 (sic).t(CO2)(-1) (2.4 (sic).kg(-1) and 50 (sic).t(CO2)(-1), respectively, for SMR with CO2 capture) while for SE-SMR-SOFC the levelised cost of electricity is 0.078 (sic).kWh(-1) and the cost of CO2 avoided is 36.9 (sic).t(CO2)(-1) (0.080 (sic).kWh(-1) and 80 (sic).t(CO2)(-1), respectively, for natural gas-fired power plant with carbon capture).",Techno-economic analysis of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.005
5,6526,"The sensitivity analysis showed that the specific cost of fuel and the capital cost of fuel cell mainly affect the economic performance of SE-SMR and SE-SMR-SOFC, respectively.",Techno-economic analysis of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.005
6,6526,The daily revenue of the SE-SMR-SOFC system is higher than that of the natural gas-fired power plant if the difference between the carbon tax and the CO2 transport and storage cost is > 6 (sic).t(CO2)(-1).,Techno-economic analysis of sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming in a fixed bed reactor network integrated with fuel cell,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.005
