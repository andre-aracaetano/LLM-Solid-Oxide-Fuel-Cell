1,8950,Interdiffusion between the yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and the gadolinia doped ceria (CGO) barrier layer is one of the major causes to the increment of ohmic resistance in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).,Interdiffusion between gadolinia doped ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia in solid oxide fuel cells: Experimental investigation and kinetic modeling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227152
2,8950,We present in this work experimental investigations on CGO-YSZ bi-layer electrolyte sintered at 1250 degrees C or 1315 degrees C and element transport as a function of sintering temperature and dwelling time.,Interdiffusion between gadolinia doped ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia in solid oxide fuel cells: Experimental investigation and kinetic modeling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227152
3,8950,"In order to quantitatively simulate the experimental observations, the CALPHAD-type thermodynamic assessment of the CGO-YSZ system is performed by simplifying the system to a CeO2-ZrO2 quasi-binary system, and the kinetic descriptions (atomic mobilities) are constructed based on critical review of literature data.",Interdiffusion between gadolinia doped ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia in solid oxide fuel cells: Experimental investigation and kinetic modeling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227152
4,8950,The CGO-YSZ interdiffusion is then modeled with the DICTRA software and the simulation results are compared with the experimental data under different sintering or long-term operating conditions.,Interdiffusion between gadolinia doped ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia in solid oxide fuel cells: Experimental investigation and kinetic modeling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227152
5,8950,The corresponding ohmic resistance of the bi-layer electrolyte is predicted based on the simulated concentration profile.,Interdiffusion between gadolinia doped ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia in solid oxide fuel cells: Experimental investigation and kinetic modeling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227152
6,8950,"The results implies that the interdiffusion across the CGO-YSZ interface happens mainly during sintering at high temperature, while during long-term operation at relatively lower temperature the impact of interdiffusion on cell degradation is negligible.",Interdiffusion between gadolinia doped ceria and yttria stabilized zirconia in solid oxide fuel cells: Experimental investigation and kinetic modeling,10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227152
