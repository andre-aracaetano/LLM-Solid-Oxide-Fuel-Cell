         "There are four types of fuel cells: Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFC), Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFC), Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC), and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC). The performance of these fuel cells has not been compared. Equations that are able to express the performance of these fuel cells accurately were derived or modified from the latest published performance data. The cell voltages of the four fuel cells were estimated by these equations, resulting in high-temperature fuel cells such as MCFC and SOFC having higher energy conversion efficiencies than low-temperature fuel cells such as PEFC and PAFC. This difference originates from low cathode polarization, overcoming both a decrease of open circuit voltage with increasing temperature and higher Nernst losses for high-temperature fuel cells of approximately 85 mV than those for low-temperature fuel cells due to steam generation in the anode chamber in the high-temperature fuel cells. A generalized relationship between cell voltage and operating temperature was derived, stating that the cell voltage is almost constant between 500 degreesC and 1000 degreesC. A fuel cell which has protons as a migration species in the electrolyte and works between 250 degreesC and 500 degreesC would give a performance comparable with high-temperature fuel cells due to lower Nernst losses than those for high-temperature fuel cells.

This new technology is suitable for producing heat and power for residential, commercial, and industrial customers. The fuel cells produce electricity without combustion and use very few moving parts, typically limited to air blowers, and fuel and/or water pumps. Because of high fuel conversion efficiency; combined heat arid power generation flexibility, friendly siting characteristics, negligible environmental emissions, and lower carbon dioxide emissions, fuel cells are considered at the top of the desirable technologies for a broad spectrum of power generation applications.

         "There are at least four basic fuel cell thermodynamic features: maximum intrinsic thermal efficiency (electrical efficiency), reversible potential, and two new ones-intrinsic cooling requirement and intrinsic exergetic efficiency. A basic electrochemical thermodynamic analysis of fuel cells using MALT reveals that it is probably for thermodynamic reasons that cooling strategies other than excess oxidant, such as water cooling, have generally been adopted for lower temperature fuel cells such as polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) and phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC). One can mathematically demonstrate that for a simple hybrid system, any fuel cell, any operating temperature, and any pressure, the maximum reversible work is equal to the free energy of reaction at the standard state. This study gives information of new opportunity fuels having increasing importance is all future energy scenarios. The results of this analysis show that ammonia and direct methanol give greater maximum intrinsic thermal efficiency than hydrogen oxidation. From these simple studies alone, one would conclude that the great payoff in terms of theoretical efficiency potential for research is direct carbon fuel cell (DCFT), PEFC, and direct oxidation of methane, intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and simple fuel cell turbine hybrids.",

In comparison to the other fuel cells, the MCFC operates with the lowest current densities due to limited zones of effective electrode reactions and low solubilities of oxygen and hydrogen in molten carbonates; also it has a thickest electrodes-electrolyte assembly. In consequence, the applications of MCFC are almost limited to stationary power generators. Although the MCFC stationary power generators have now approached high technological level of precommercialization, in the future they may face a serious contest from SOFC and PEMFC, for which improvement of operational parameters is believed to be achieved easier.

The operating parameters of the previously mentioned fuel cells were compared. The principle of operation of a fuel cell was described. The growing interest in devices using hydrogen as a fuel also results from the development of Power to Gas technology (P2G). Furthermore, the article presents the potential directions of development and use of fuel cells in various fields and sectors of the economy. Fuel cells can be used in transport. The characteristic of motor vehicles fleet by fuel type in usage in the European Union was presented. The technical specification of commercially available passenger cars using fuel cells with proton exchange membrane was presented. The possibility of using fuel cells in public transport (buses, trains) was discussed. The possibilities of operation of fuel cells in combined heat and power systems (CHP) were presented. Usage of fuel cell technology in large cogeneration units and micro systems was considered. One of the presented cogeneration systems is a combination of fuel cells with a gas turbine. Another possibility of using fuel cells is energy storage systems (EES). Interesting way of using fuel cells can also be Power to Power systems, which were briefly characterized.",

A model of the carbon fuel cell is developed, validated, and exercised to explore the interactions between cell geometry, power output, and overall efficiency. The model is built on the Boudouard reaction mechanism and includes experimentally measured kinetic parameters of the electrode and carbon bed reactions. Results indicate that the modeled cell geometry can operate in an optimal regime offering efficiencies near 60% and cell power densities of 100 mW cm(-2). The model further reveals a fundamental tradeoff between efficiency and power output inherent in a carbon fuel cell, suggesting that high cell efficiencies can be obtained at half of peak power output.

As a result, the durability of the fuel cell can also be improved. System analysis and controller design procedure for the proposed technique are given in this paper. Simulation studies have been carried out on FC-battery power generation systems using the dynamic models developed for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC).

The anode-supported SOFC was successfully fabricated and showed an extraordinary fuel cell performance of 584 mW/cm(2) by using a propane flame; far higher than that of the electrolyte-supported SOFC. The total flow rates of premixed propane-air greatly influenced the range of fuel cell operation and fuel cell performance. With the fixed flow rate of propane, the introduction of an air flow exhibited a complex effect on the peak power density and the maximum current density due to the variation of fuel cell temperature and fuel concentration.

In this study biofuels namely methane, ethanol, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia are evaluated exergetically with respect to their performance at system level and in system components like heat exchangers, fuel cell, gas turbine, combustor, compressor, and the stack. Further, the fuel cell losses are investigated in detail with respect to their dependence on operating parameters such as fuel utilization, Nernst voltage, etc. as well as fuel specific parameters like heat effects. It is found that the heat effects play a major role in setting up the flows in the system and hence, power levels attained in individual components. The per pass fuel utilization dictates the efficiency of the fuel cell itself, but the system efficiency is not entirely dependent on fuel cell efficiency alone, but depends on the split between the fuel cell and gas turbine powers which in turn depends highly on the nature of the fuel and its chemistry. Counter intuitively it is found that with recycle, the fuel cell efficiency of methane is less than that of hydrogen but the system efficiency of methane is higher.",

Numerous companies, research institutes, and universities are developing proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-related technologies. A preliminary local supplier chain of fuel cell-related technology has been formed. However, the lifetime is still a key issue for the fuel cell technology. More than 3500 fuel cell range extender electric vehicles were manufactured during 2016 and 2018, and at the beginning of 2019, there have been more than 40 hydrogen refueling stations including both under operation and under construction. It is estimated the number of fuel cell-based electric vehicles will reach 36,000 by the end of 2020; therefore, lack of hydrogen refueling station has become a key restriction for development of the fuel cell vehicle industry.",

By using the same material as anode and cathode of SOFC (symmetric fuel cell), the production of reliable and repeatable cells would be simpler. In this work, La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Nb0.1O3-delta (LSCFN) perovskite has been prepared and evaluated as both cathode and anode material of symmetric fuel cell. The results of symmetric fuel cell show that a maximum peak power density of 500 mW cm(-2) has been achieved and the total electrode polarization resistances of the cell is only 0.22 Omega cm(2) at 850 degrees C which is much lower than that of typical symmetric fuel cell with La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta as electrode material. All of these results indicate that LSCFN can potentially be a promising candidate for the electrode material of symmetric fuel cell. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

         "As an energy conversion and generation device that converts hydrogen energy into electrical energy, the solid oxide fuel cell is one of the most promising fuel cells. However, thermal stability is the major reason for the shortened solid oxide fuel cell lifetime of hybrid electric vehicles usage. In existing solid oxide fuel cell system, the peak temperature occurs in the afterburner, so the thermal safety assessment is very important for solid oxide fuel cell stack. In this paper, afterburner thermal performance of natural gas solid oxide fuel cell system is studied based on computational fluid dynamics simulation. The model is analysed by changing gas temperature, gas flow velocity, gas composition ratio and steam to carbon ratio. The afterburner temperature distribution and its safety characteristics are obtained through model analysis. The simulation and discussion results can guide the thermoelectric safety assessment and controller design of the SOFC system.",

         "Code stability is a matter of concern for three-dimensional (3D) fuel cell models operating both at high current density and at high cell voltage. An idealized mathematical model of a fuel cell should converge for all potentiostatic or galvanostatic boundary conditions ranging from open circuit to closed circuit. Many fail to do so, due to (i) fuel or oxygen starvation causing divergence as local partial pressures and mass fractions of fuel or oxidant fall to near zero and (ii) nonlinearities in the Nernst and Butler-Volmer equations near open-circuit conditions. This paper describes in detail, specific numerical methods used to improve the stability of a previously existing fuel cell performance calculation procedure, at both low and high current densities. Four specific techniques are identified. A straight channel operating as a (i) solid oxide and (ii) polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell is used to illustrate the efficacy of the modifications.",

Herein, a simple design is proposed to improve the performance of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells by introducing a heat bar into the anode carbon compartment. This design is evaluated numerically using a 2D model. After model validation, parametric simulations are conducted to compare the performance of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells with and without the heat bar. The heat bar improves the temperature uniformity of the fuel cell and enhances the local temperature in the carbon compartment. As a result, the Boudouard reaction rate is enhanced by 14% at a voltage of 0.6 V, leading to a performance enhancement of 4.1%. The heat bar significantly reduces the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures in the fuel cell by 40%, leading to improved durability. This design becomes more effective when using a heat bar with a high thermal conductivity and at lower operating voltages. This study clearly demonstrates that this new design is a simple but effective method for enhancing the performance and durability of direct carbon solid oxide fuel cells.",

Heat produced from the combustion of ethanol thermally sustained the fuel cell at a temperature of 500-830 degrees C. Considerable amounts of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were also produced during the fuel-rich combustion which provided the direct fuels for the fuel cell. The location of the fuel cell with respect to the flame was found to have a significant effect on the fuel cell temperature and performance. The highest power density was achieved when the anode was exposed to the inner flame. By modifying the Ni + Sm0.2Ce0.80O1.9 (SDC) anode with a thin Ru/SDC catalytic layer, the fuel cell envisaged not only an increase of the peak power density to similar to 200 mW cm(-2) but also a significant improvement of the anodic coking resistance.

Furthermore. the cell voltage of the DNAFC decreases with all increase in current density. as observed in fuel cells such as proton exchange membrane fuel cell, solid oxide fuel cell. and several others. These results indicate that DNA film can be used as the fuel cell electrolyte under approximately 55% humidity condition. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The result showed that oxidation of carbon was minimally contributed by diffusion of oxygen anion via contact with solid anode. Whether carbon is in contact with the anode is not a major factor to cell performance. By contrast, the cell performance was determined by concentration of gaseous products from carbon in cell chamber.

Nano-porous substrate supported thin film solid oxide fuel cells were fabricated with BYZ electrolyte of various thicknesses deposited by pulsed laser deposition. Higher open circuit voltage (OCV) was achieved from the fuel cell with thicker electrolyte which can block more pinholes propagated from the porous substrate. At 450 degrees C, the OCV and maximum power density of the cell with 1.34 mu m-thick BYZ electrolyte was about 1.1 V and 21 mW/cm(2), respectively.

         "The flame fuel cell is a novel kind of fuel cell that directly combines a fuel-rich flame and solid oxide fuel cells together. Because of their simple setup, low cost, quick start-up and shut-down as well as no extra thermal management, flame fuel cells have great potential in micro-combined heat and power systems and portable applications. However, the conventional solid oxide fuel cell configurations including planar ones and tubular ones, may cause some problems when used in flame fuel cells such as thermal stress, secondary flame front, and difficulty for mass production. To solve these problems, a newly developed flat-chip solid oxide fuel cell is proposed to be used in the flame fuel cell in this study. Combining the merits of both planar and tubular solid oxide fuel cells, the flat-chip fuel cell is advantageous for its simple fabrication technology, good thermal shock resistance and feasibility to scale up. A flat-chip solid oxide fuel cell is fabricated and then integrated with a catalytically enhanced porous media combustor, demonstrating a novel flat-chip flame fuel cell system. The heating time for the flat-chip solid oxide fuel cell by the fuel-rich flame is less than 10 min from room temperature to 800 degrees C, with a temperature change rate of 5 degrees C/s in the first stage. The start-up time of the flat-chip flame fuel cell is less than 10 s. When the gas velocity is 6.0 cm/s and the equivalence ratio is 2.0, a peak power density of 179 mW/cm(2) is obtained for a single cell. Although there exists a remarkable temperature gradient, a small current degradation of 0.01 A/h is observed after a constant-voltage discharging at 0.5 V for 8 hrs. In addition, the flat-chip solid oxide fuel cell can be further scaled up in dimension, resulting in higher fuel utilization of flame fuel cell.",

         "Similar to the original direct flame fuel cell the flame-assisted fuel cell, which has a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating in combustion exhaust, can potentially simplify the fuel cell system and has applications in micro-Combined Heat and Power. Development and testing of a 9 micro-tubular flame-assisted fuel cell stack is demonstrated in this work. Two different systems are investigated having 1) fixed fuel flow rate and varying air flow rate and 2) fixed total flow rate of air and fuel for the micro-Combined Heat and Power burners. The micro-tubular flame-assisted fuel cell stack achieves a significant performance of 237 mW cm(-2) in model methane combustion exhaust at 0.5 V and 790 degrees C with a lanthanum strontium manganite based cathode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that the fuel cell ohmic losses are unaltered by variations in the exhaust species concentrations while the polarization losses increase with decreasing first-stage combustion fuel-air equivalence ratio. Variations in the combustion exhaust temperature effects both the ohmic and polarization losses. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

         "It is common knowledge that efficiency of fuel cells is highest when no electric current is produced while when the fuel cell is really working, the efficiency is reduced by dissipation. In this paper the relation between efficiency and dissipation inside the fuel cell is formulated within the framework of classical irreversible thermodynamics of mixtures. It is shown that not only dissipation influences the efficiency but that there are also some other terms which become important if there are steep temperature gradients inside the fuel cell. Indeed, we show that the new terms are negligible in polymer-electrolyte membrane fuel cells while they become important in solid oxide fuel cells. In summary, this paper presents a formulation of non-equilibrium thermodynamics of fuel cells and provides analysis of efficiency in terms of processes inside the fuel cells, revealing some new terms affecting the efficiency.

This is possible in high temperature fuel cells, such as the molten carbonate (MCFC) and the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), utilizing the heat from the electrochemical reaction for the steam reforming of methane. The heat balance is not a limiting factor. Internal reforming in a molten carbonate fuel cell involves the risk of alkali poisoning of the catalyst. The mechanism of alkali-poisoning is discussed. Laboratory tests on alkali containing catalysts are described and data from internal reforming in a MCFC-plant are presented. On basis of a simple model, an assessment is made of the required catalyst activity. Only a few percents of the original activity is needed for 95% conversion.",

In this paper, a comprehensive study is conducted to compare the thermodynamic, exergo-economic, and environmental facets of employing two types of fuel cells, embracing solid oxide fuel cell and molten carbonate fuel cell, as a driver in a trigeneration system producing cooling, heating, and power. The subsystems consist of a heating unit and a generator-absorber heat exchanger for the solid oxide fuel cell-driven system, and two heating processes for the molten carbonate fuel cell-driven system. The comparisons are made for 1 MW power generation by the fuel cells operating at ambient pressure and 0.85 for the fuel utilization factor. Simulation results show that under the baseline design conditions, the energy and exergy efficiencies of the solid oxide fuel cell-driven system are 74.1% and 37.9%, respectively, whilst these efficiencies for the molten carbonate fuel cell-driven system are 78.5% and 52.4%, correspondingly. Additionally, the comparisons reveal that the molten carbonate fuel cell-driven system outperforms the solid oxide fuel cell-driven one in terms of thermodynamic and environmental performances, but it is also more costly.",

In this composite fuel cell a Tafel nickel cermet anode is combined with a ceramic electrolyte and mixed electronic ionic conduction (MIEC) cathode. Activation polarizations are described by three models - Butler-Volmer, Tafel, and MIEC. It is verified from simulation that for hydrogen direct oxidation working reaction (WR) the MIEC-containing fuel cell functions well in the hybrid system. It has found that there is an optimal constant voltage that maximizes power for a hybrid operating at the constant voltage.

         "The purpose of this paper is to obtain relevant data on materials that are the most commonly used in fuel-cell and hydrogen technologies. The focus is on polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells, solid-oxide fuel cells, polymer-electrolyte-membrane water electrolysers and alkaline water electrolysers. An innovative, methodological approach was developed for a preliminary material assessment of the four technologies. This methodological approach leads to a more rapid identification of the most influential or critical materials that substantially increase the environmental impact of fuel-cell and hydrogen technologies. The approach also assisted in amassing the life-cycle inventories-the emphasis here is on the solid-oxide fuel-cell technology because it is still in its early development stage and thus has a deficient materials' database-that were used in a life-cycle assessment for an in-depth material-criticality analysis. All the listed materials-that either are or could potentially be used in these technologies-were analysed to give important information for the fuel-cell and hydrogen industries, the recycling industry, the hydrogen economy, as well as policymakers. The main conclusion from the life-cycle assessment is that the polymer-electrolyte-membrane water electrolysers have the highest environmental impacts; lower impacts are seen in polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells and solid-oxide fuel cells, while the lowest impacts are observed in alkaline water electrolysers. The results of the material assessment are presented together for all the considered materials, but also separately for each observed technology.",

Due to its complex structure, designing a control system is important for its smooth and efficient operation. This study is a continuation from the previous study focusing on a top-down, steady-state economic analysis for synthesizing the control structure of the solid oxide fuel cell and molten carbonate fuel cell integrated system to maximize power generation and carbon dioxide utilization. In this study, a bottom-up analysis is performed to design a control layer and validate the proposed control structure via dynamic simulation. The control configuration uses a decentralized approach with proportional integral-derivative control to maintain the fuel cell system at its optimum target. The control performance with the proposed control structure and configurations are evaluated and analyzed. Four control loops involving gas concentrations are considered, based on different time scales between the regulatory control and supervisory layers. The results of the proposed control system confirm that the integrated fuel cell system is controllable despite the deviation of the fuel cell voltages from their nominal values.",

The distribution of gas products from anode outlet was analyzed by gas chromatography and, discussed under open circuit conditions and when discharging the fuel cell. Under open circuit conditions, because there were only chemically catalytic reactions and thermal reactions in the anode chamber, the gas slate was little selective to propylene. However, the propylene selectivity was obviously enhanced when discharging the fuel cell, through activating the electro-catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. The propylene yield obtained from the electro-catalytic reaction reached 70-80%. In addition, relatively good fuel cell performances were achieved. The influences of the operating temperature and propane flow rate on the fuel cell performances were also discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

I-V measurements were performed to determine the dependence of the fuel cell performance on the Pt film thickness at different operating temperatures. The measured fuel cell performance revealed that comparable peak power densities were achieved for ALD-deposited Pt anodes with only one-fifth of the platinum loading relative to dc-sputtered Pt anodes. The Pt films fabricated by dc sputtering and ALD had different microstructure, which accounted for the difference in their performance as a fuel cell anode. In addition to the continuous electrocatalyst layer, a micropatterned Pt structure was fabricated via area-selective ALD and used as a current collector grid/patterned catalyst for the fuel cells. An improvement of the fuel cell performance by a factor of 10 was observed using the Pt current collector grid/patterned catalyst integrated onto cathodic La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta. The study suggests the potential to achieve improved performance and/or lower loadings using ALD for catalysts in fuel cells.",

         "Precise modelling of fuel cells is very important for understanding their functioning. In this work, an application of hybrid interior search algorithm (HISA) is proposed to extract the parameters of fuel cells for their electromechanical equations based on nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. Proposed hybridised algorithm has been developed using evolutionary mutation and crossover operators so as to enhance the modelling capability of interior search algorithm (ISA). To assess the modelling performance of HISA, parameter extraction of two types of fuel cell models, namely, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) have been considered. Modelling performance of HISA, assessed using mean squared error between computed and experimental data, is found to be superior to ISA and several other recently reported prominent optimisation methods. Based on the presented intensive simulation investigations, it is concluded that HISA improves the performance of the basic ISA in terms of fitter solutions, robustness, and convergence rate and therefore offers a promising optimisation technique for parameter extraction of fuel cells.",

The European industry is ramping up demonstration of fuel cell based micro-CHP units in the EU projects ene.field and PACE. Systems based on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have been demonstrated. More than 1,000 units have been tested in 10 European countries in the years 2012-2017. In the coming 5 years, additionally 2,500 units will be deployed via the EU funded program PACE. These field trials have been accompanied by analyses of end-user satisfaction, environmental impact, and costs involved. The end-users participating in the field trials had a very positive perception of the fuel cell micro-CHP technology. The environmental impact of fuel cell micro-CHP was compared to that of heat pumps and gas condensing boilers in a life cycle assessment (LCA). The micro-CHP units have a better environmental performance than these competing technologies in all the analyzed use-cases. Today, the capital costs of fuel cell based micro-CHP are significantly higher than that of traditional heating technologies. However, as serial production begins, economies of scale will cause the costs to drop substantially and the micro-CHP can become economically competitive.",

The transport of oxygen molecules from the cathode to the fuel side through the porous electrolyte can resist carbon deposition but could reduce the fuel cell performance. In this paper, a two-dimensional model for all porous solid oxide button cells is developed for the first time. After model validation with experimental data, the model is then extended for a tubular cell for parametric simulations. The effects of operating conditions and the electrolyte microstructure properties on carbon resistance and electrochemical performance of all porous solid oxide fuel cells are examined. The good carbon resistance of all porous solid oxide fuel cell is numerically demonstrated. It is found that the electrochemical performance and anode surface O/C ratio is significantly affected by anode inlet gas composition and flowrate. In addition, the anode supported all porous solid oxide fuel cell shows a great potential in terms of both power generation and coking resistance. The results of this study form a solid foundation to understand the mechanism and promising future of all porous solid oxide fuel cells.",

         "The conversion of liquid hydrocarbons to a hydrogen rich product gas is a central process step in fuel processors for auxiliary power units (APUs) for vehicles of all kinds. The selection of the reforming process depends on the fuel and the type of the fuel cell. For vehicle power trains, liquid hydrocarbons like gasoline, kerosene, and diesel are utilized and, therefore, they will also be the fuel for the respective APU systems. The fuel cells commonly envisioned for mobile APU applications are molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC), solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Since high-temperature fuel cells, e.g. MCFCs or SOFCs, can be supplied with a feed gas that contains carbon monoxide (CO) their fuel processor does not require reactors for CO reduction and removal. For PEMFCs on the other hand, CO concentrations in the feed gas must not exceed 50 ppm, better 20 ppm, which requires additional reactors downstream of the reforming reactor. This paper gives an overview of the current state of the fuel processor development for APU applications and APU system developments. Furthermore, it will present the latest developments at Fraunhofer ISE regarding fuel processors for high-temperature fuel cell APU systems on board of ships and aircrafts. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

         "Energy conversion today is subject to high thermodynamic losses. About 50% to 90% of the exergy of primary fuels is lost during conversion into power or heat. The fast increasing world energy demand makes a further increase of conversion efficiencies inevitable. The substantial thermodynamic losses (exergy losses of 20% to 30%) of thermal fuel conversion will limit future improvements of power plant efficiencies. Electrochemical conversion of fuel enables fuel conversion with minimum losses. Various fuel cell systems have been investigated at the Delft University of Technology during the past 20 years. It appeared that exergy analyses can be very helpful in understanding the extent and causes of thermodynamic losses in fuel cell systems. More than 50% of the losses in high temperature fuel cell (molten carbonate fuel cell and solid oxide fuel cell) systems can be caused by heat transfer. Therefore system optimization must focus on reducing the need for heat transfer as well as improving the conditions for the unavoidable heat transfer. Various options for reducing the need for heat transfer are discussed in this paper. High temperature fuel cells, eventually integrated into gas turbine processes, can replace the combustion process in future power plants. High temperature fuel cells will be necessary to obtain conversion efficiencies up to 80% in the case of large scale electricity production in the future. The introduction of fuel cells is considered to be a first step in the integration of electrochemical conversion in future energy conversion systems.",

For a study of the influence of the energy management concept on system performance, the fuel cell car is eventually equipped with an auxiliary energy buffering battery.

         "Direct carbon fuel cells (DCFCs) have great thermodynamic advantages over other high temperature fuel cells such as molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells. They can have 100% fuel utilization, no Nernst loss (at the anode), and the CO2 produced at the anode is not mixed with other gases and is ready for re-use or sequestration. So far, only studies have been reported on cell development. In this paper, we study the performance of a CO2-producing DCFC system model. The theoretically predicted advantages that are confirmed on a bench scale are also confirmed on a system level, except for the production of pure CO2. Net system efficiencies of around 78% were found for the developed system. An exergy analysis of the system shows where the losses in the system occur. If the cathode of the DCFC must be operated as a standard MCFC cathode, the required CO2 at the cathode is the reason why a large part of the pure CO2 from the anode is recycled and mixed with the incoming air and cannot be used directly for sequestration. Bench scale studies should be performed to test the minimum amount of CO2 needed at the cathode. This might be lower than in a standard MCFC operation due to the pure CO2 at the anode side that enhances diffusion toward the cathode. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4001015]",

The fuel cell using LiAlO2-carbonate (LiNaCO3) as electrolyte exhibits excellent performances, when we used hydrogen and air as fuel and oxidant respectively, instead of molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) environment. The maximum output power density can reach 466 mW/cm(2) at 650 degrees C and the discharging current keeps constant. The ion transport mechanics of the ceramic fuel cell were discussed.

Initially, the fuel cell stack is assumed to operate along one characteristic I-V curve, thus isolating the power management study to the system's powertrain components. Electrical converters transfer dc power from the fuel cell to usable ac power for an electric motor-driven propeller. To avoid oversizing, the fuel cell stack is designed to operate near its maximum power limit during aircraft cruising, while a battery is employed as an alternative source to provide additional power beyond the cruising kilowatt requirement (e.g., takeoff or maneuvering).",

         "Fuel cell technologies have long been recognized as one of the most promising future energy solutions. Nevertheless, major technological barriers hinder the potential realization of this clean energy source. Citation network analysis methodology is used here to identify major research trends, critical technological issues, and proposed resolutions to raise the effectiveness of investment of R&D resources in fuel cell technology development. The main path analyses identify two research streams for the Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) and Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) technologies. Analyses of cited publications show that most of the technological barriers for PEMFC have been addressed and that performance has reached an acceptable level. On the other hand, DMFC still suffers from methanol and water crossover problems. Multiple main path analysis identifies specific research groups working on technological problems in DMFC. The Direct Formic Acid Fuel Cell (DFAFC) and Direct Ethanol Fuel Cell (DEFC) have recently emerged to address the toxicity of methanol, while DMFC performance is being enhanced through research on porous carbon plates, water transportation, and methanol concentrations, and the research group at Micro DMFC is applying fuel cells in electronics devices. Despite considerable research on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), its research stream does not appear in the main paths, most likely because of a broad divergence in research subjects. Growth curve analysis forecasts that fuel cell research is in the growth stage and will enter maturity in 2018. Although emerging technologies show advantages in performance and cost, the findings presented here can raise the effectiveness of critical research project selection, thus increasing the likelihood of success.

One such technology is the fuel cell, which offers the prospect of a new, silent, modular technology with few or no problems of emissions.

         "Fuel cells are applied to power sources on unmanned aerial vehicles with long endurance to save fuel and increase endurance. A turbine-less engine integrated with solid oxide fuel cells was proposed in our previous work. With the variation of fuel cell area, the specific fuel consumption and the engine weight both sharply changes, which severely affected the endurance of aircraft equipped with the engine. Therefore, the mathematical models considering the performance and weight were built to demonstrate the effect of the fuel cell size on the performance of the engine, and the key part was validated by experimental data. The main conclusions are as follows: the coupling effect between the equivalent ratio and the fuel cell stack number is strong. The endurance increment ratio for the aircraft compared with the endurance of the aircraft with turbojet engines first increases and then decreases with increasing fuel cell stack number or the equivalence ratio. In a big operating zone, the hybrid engine has a high endurance increment ratio. The maximum value is 0.152. Meanwhile, the fuel cell stack number is 3.7, and the equivalence ratios are respectively 0.356 and 0.137 in the reformer and combustor. The rated specific fuel consumption rate are 27.9 (g/s)/kN. In addition, the maximal thrust and thrust variation range of the engine increase by about 46% and 383-403%, compared with those of the turbojet engine.",

The thermodynamic analysis is based on energy and exergy balances. A case study is reported in which the plant contains a Siemens-Westinghouse PSOFC generator and a Solar Turbines Mercury-50 gas turbine. Among the calculated quantities for a range of fuel cell current are the plant output power, first-law efficiency, and exergetic efficiency. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4003707]",
